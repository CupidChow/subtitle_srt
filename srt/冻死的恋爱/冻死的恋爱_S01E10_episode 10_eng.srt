1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,130

2
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,670

3
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:17,620
♫  Dive with you, towards the wide sea  ♫

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,090

5
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:24,090
♫  Jump in love, I fly with wings called you  ♫

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,090

♫  There is nothing to be afraid of  ♫

7
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:32,140
♫  In the world called you, it sparkles and lingers here  ♫

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,710
♫  What I found while wandering was you who 
 was always by my side  ♫

9
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,190
♫  I'm already ready for you  ♫

10
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,990

11
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:45,160

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,530

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,340
 A building collapsed due to a gas explosion at the intersection in front of the hospital.

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,660
 - What are the conditions of the patients? 
 - Most of them are unconscious,

15
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,230
 and there are already two people who've received emergency CT scans.

16
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,190
 The operating rooms are full with only one left.

17
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,440
 Which of the two should I put in that room?

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,200
 - Put in the adult male patient. 
 - Then what about that middle-school student?

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,410
 Are you going to just leave him to die?

20
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,000
 There's no hope for that adult male patient anyway.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,470
 Are you going to let a kid whose life you can save die?

22
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,310
 It's a cardiac arrest!

23
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:17,320
 You can't go like this! Not like this!

24
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,610
 Don't die, Father!

25
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,640
 Doctor, who should we put in?

26
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,920
 Put in the adult male patient.

27
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,220
 That adult male patient will die even if he goes into the operating room!

28
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,300
 I can save him!

29
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,910
 The patient's vitals are dropping.

30
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,970
 No, you can't go like this!

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,000
 Which of the two should I put in that room?

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,320
 It's a cardiac arrest!

33
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,410
 Father, you can't go like this!

34
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,880
No!

35
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,090
 Father...

36
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,500
 Don't die, Dad...

37
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,960
 Tell me what I should do, please...

38
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,610
 How do I go on living by myself, Dad...

39
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,740
 Tell me, please, Dad...

40
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,750
 Dad...

41
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,300
 Don't die, Father.

42
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,250
- Mr. Park Jae Hoon? 
 - Who are you?

43
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,910
I am Reporter Kim Jin Sang for the entertainment department of Today's News.

44
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,330
Would it be possible to interview you for a moment?

45
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,870
I'm sorry, but no.

46
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,990
Is it true that you were kicked out of the hospital due to medical malpractice?

47
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,630
 I don't think any good is going to come out of not commenting.

48
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,870
 If you're going to be like this, I will not take your position into account

49
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,960
 and write whatever I want for the article.

50
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,140
 You killed someone, right?

51
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,930
 I'm going to write the article like that, okay?

52
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,830
 Mr. Park Jae Hoon!

53
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,990

54
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,400

55
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,970
After the rehab...

56
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,610
I went to thank him in person...

57
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,920
but he had stopped working at the hospital.

58
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,730
And it was then that I learned that the doctor's father passed away while saving my life.

59
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,380
Everything the reporters are saying is lies.

60
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,770
There was no medical accident! It was all because of me...

61
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,170
It was all because he was trying to save my life

62
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,110
that the two of them ended up like that...

63
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,980
Thank you.

64
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,750
Hey, he came out.

65
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,610
Mr. Park Jae Hoon, let's have an interview for a moment.

66
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,840
Was there any other reason for why you left the hospital?

67
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,050
Let's have a brief interview.

68
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,160
Mr. Park Jae Hoon! Wait!

69
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,650
Mr. Park Jae Hoon! Come on.

70
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,700
I don't think it would have been easy for you come here.

71
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,580
I felt like I should do whatever I can to explain what really happened.

72
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,170
Jae Hoon and I have been friends for a while.

73
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:10,420
When he quit the hospital, I somewhat knew what the circumstances were,

74
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,700
but I didn't know to this extent.

75
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,290
Thank you for summoning up your courage and coming here.

76
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,570
Would it be all right... if I ask you...

77
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,640
for a difficult request?

78
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,080
You're saying we should have him on our show?

79
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,050
Yeah. He's willing to appear on our show.

80
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,120
That would be great for me.

81
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,130
But this is unusual. Stuff like this is not your style.

82
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:47,840
You know, like selling emotional and exaggerated stories...

83
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,820
Rumors are a scary thing.

84
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,390
You know that as well.

85
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:56,610
You have to stamp out even the slightest embers.

86
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,670
If you don't, they can follow you around for the rest of your life.

87
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,270
So, it's for Park Jae Hoon.

88
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,700
Okay. Let's try drawing up a plan.

89
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,660
Well...

90
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,240
- Hee Chang? 
 - Yes?

91
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,270
While we're at it, let's sue the first person who spread the rumor for defamation.

92
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,400
- Sue him? 
 - I mean...

93
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,700
we're not even the victim... Do we need to go to that extent?

94
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,850
You can sue for defamation, even if you're not the victim.

95
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:28,180
And not only that, this incident is also defamation against our show.

96
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,640
- You got that, Hee Chang? 
 - Yes.

97
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,250
I'll go to the police station tomorrow.

98
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,900
Jae Hoon.

99
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,340
Park Jae Hoon.

100
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,200
Jae Hoon, I'm going to come in.

101
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,290
I'm going to come in.

102
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,750
Chef John?

103
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,500
Can we talk for a bit?

104
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,310
About what?

105
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,200
I have a request.

106
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,150
A request?

107
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,230
Will you do it for me?

108
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,230
Well, first, let me hear what it is.

109
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,860
Let's do a collaboration on YouTube together, Chef.

110
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,040
- A collaboration? 
 - You cooked a dish for me last time.

111
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,550
How about we make a video with that kind of concept?

112
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,800
Or just a talk show concept is fine, too.

113
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,340
I have 660,000 subscribers.

114
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,940
- And you? 
 - 123,020 subscribers.

115
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,740
120,000 subscribers...

116
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,370
It's pretty obvious what you're after.

117
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,630
And it's quite unfair.

118
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,370
In return, I'll grant you a wish, Chef.

119
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,890
Whatever you want.

120
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,380
You don't even know what I might wish for.

121
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,290
- Well, it doesn't matter what it may be. 
 - Really?

122
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,120
Since you're a gentle person,

123
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,080
I'm sure you'll know to be appropriate. Right?

124
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,570
She's really toying with me.

125
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,730
Park Jae Hoon...

126
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,760
- So, you can't get in touch with him? 
 - Yeah.

127
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,840
I went to his house and he wasn't there.

128
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,530
And he hadn't come to his parent's home, either.

129
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,300
He's making matters difficult.

130
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,770
For now, there is a place where I feel he might be

131
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,290
so I'm thinking of going there later.

132
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,180
- How confident are you? 
 - About what?

133
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,780
Where Park Jae Hoon is hiding...

134
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,310
What is the probability that he would be there?

135
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,140
Well...

136
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,700
he's probably there.

137
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,680
Then let's go together with the staff.

138
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,490
You want us to all go together?

139
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,280
Yeah, why?

140
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,560
I mean, there's no guarantee he's going to be there, first of all.

141
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,630
Is this your first time producing a show?

142
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:11,280
It's either all or nothing. It's great if we can capture some good footage,

143
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,170
and if it's a dud, then too bad.

144
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,870
We can't just barge in there with a camera.

145
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,490
Only after I talk to Jae Hoon first.

146
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:23,870
Yeah, like Park Jae Hoon would openly share his story on broadcast?

147
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,770
Do you think he's capable of that?

148
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:29,500
You said you're his friend. Isn't it pretty obvious?

149
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:34,900
A non-celebrity cast member isn't capable of discerning the situation.

150
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,570
Whether it's poop or soybean paste,

151
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,210
whether they're headed toward the abyss or to their grave...

152
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:43,130
They can't tell anything apart and end up doing whatever they feel like.

153
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,560
If you want to fix the situation for him,

154
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,090
then act like a broadcaster and be thick-skinned.

155
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:50,250
Let's capture some raw footage.

156
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,850
 Dr. Park!

157
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:05,000
Hurry up and come out to eat. Come out quickly.

158
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,980
Yeah, hurry up and come out.

159
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,670
Come this way.

160
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,350
Here.

161
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,720
I made seaweed soup with flounder.

162
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,560
The broth is fantastic. Try it.

163
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,020
You don't have to worry about me like this.

164
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,390
Do you think I'll stop worrying just because you tell me not to?

165
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,610
You think I'll be like that?

166
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:30,910
Eat up.

167
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,960
Thank you for the food.

168
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,800
It's good, right?

169
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,290
Your food is the best, Ma'am.

170
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,140
It's good.

171
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,750
I really enjoyed the meal.

172
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,190
Good job.

173
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,860
You shouldn't skip meals just because you're going through a difficult time, okay?

174
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,370
Yes.

175
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,470
Hey...

176
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,020
I saw the article on you, Dr. Park.

177
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,070
Gosh, people are just so mean-spirited.

178
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:13,200
I mean, there are context and overarching circumstances,

179
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,790
excuses for why things happened the way they did and reasons why they did what they did.

180
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:23,030
But they skip all that and just badmouth you calling you names.

181
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,980
I don't believe that's right.

182
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,650
Even if I don't know what happened.

183
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,470
The context, overarching circumstances...

184
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,410
excuses and reasons...

185
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,460
I don't have anything like that.

186
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,120
Then... Dr. Park...

187
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,960
Did you actually kill someone?

188
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,010
By accident?

189
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,040
My father...

190
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,600
passed away because of me.

191
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,500
Your father?

192
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,560
He was transported to the emergency room due to an accident,

193
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,570
but I wasn't able to recognize my father.

194
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,470
There was only one space...

195
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,460
open for the operating room,

196
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:27,690
but I took a different patient,

197
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:34,160
and my father died alone in the emergency room...

198
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:40,400
as a nameless patient...

199
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,990
without anyone by his side.

200
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,380
My goodness...

201
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,900
How could something like that happen?

202
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,210
"It's not your fault."

203
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:56,290
"You made a logical judgment call as a doctor."

204
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:02,770
After my father passed away, other people said that to me,

205
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:06,080
but those reasons and those excuses...

206
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,950
I couldn't accept them.

207
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,260
How I could possibly not recognize my father?

208
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,230
I just can't bring myself to forgive myself for that.

209
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,260
I even checked his pupils.

210
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,950
And to check his mental capacity,

211
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,610
I even pinched my father's leg.

212
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,310
And the way he flinched...

213
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,520
I can still feel it...

214
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,240
Had I recognized my father then,

215
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:50,250
I don't know if I would have made the same call.

216
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,900
So I feel guilty toward everyone.

217
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:10,120

218
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,940
Ms. Han Ji Yeon. Let's go somewhere with me.

219
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,250
Where?

220
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,030
To find Park Jae Hoon.

221
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,750
Excuse me. What is this?

222
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,330
Who are you?

223
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,340
Excuse us...

224
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,690
Miss.

225
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,630
Hello.

226
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,270
What brings you here?

227
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,990
You came here to find Dr. Park?

228
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,610
Yes.

229
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,200
Jae Hoon came here, right?

230
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,750
I mean, he did come here.

231
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,060
W-What are those people doing over there?

232
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,280
What's with all those people?

233
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:52,180
Jae Hoon... Where is he right now?

234
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,770
Hey, Jae Hoon. What are you doing here alone?

235
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,670
How did you come here?

236
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,060
I came looking for you.

237
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,680
How come you never...

238
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,510
tell me anything?

239
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:58,220
You've always been by my side when I struggled.

240
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,290
Why don't you give me a chance to do the same?

241
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,970
Yeo Reum...

242
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:09,500
And regarding your dad, why didn't you tell me?

243
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,440
I thought that you were having a hard time

244
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,630
just because he passed away from an accident...

245
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:20,600
Why didn't you tell me you were going through something much more painful?

246
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:25,120
I'm fine now.

247
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,510
I'm sorry.

248
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,300
It's all my fault.

249
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,870
It's because I told you to come on the show

250
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:40,460
that the public scrutinized and tore into your wounds.

251
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,960
I'm so sorry.

252
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,460
I feel like it's all my fault.

253
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,330
Goo Yeo Reum. Don't cry.

254
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,610
You didn't do anything wrong.

255
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,730
Why is any of this your fault?

256
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,060
Don't cry.

257
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,080
Ms. Han Ji Yeon, you go first.

258
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,910
We'll grab the full shot, so go and explain the situation.

259
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,830
Let's start the shoot at the B&amp;B.

260
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:54,350
Let's zoom in when the two meet.

261
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,740
Jae Hoon.

262
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,580
Han Ji Yeon, how did you come here...

263
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,010
Are you okay?

264
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,680
I was worried after seeing the article on you.

265
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,210
I'm sorry for disappearing suddenly without a word.

266
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,760
You must've been shocked, too, Ji Yeon.

267
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,220
Rather than being in shock,

268
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,380
I was worried because it pained me to think about...

269
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,770
what you were going through.

270
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,470
You were so worried that you came to get me?

271
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:41,940
Bringing all those cameras with you? Yeah?

272
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:53,700
There is someone you must meet so we came together.

273
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,590
Someone I must meet?

274
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:23,530
Doctor...

275
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,070
I'm Myeong Hoon.

276
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,180
Doctor, I'm sorry.

277
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,980
After hearing that you quit the hospital because of me,

278
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:53,010
I was so sorry and distressed.

279
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,260
And the person who saved me was...

280
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,770
Dr. Park Tae Woo.

281
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:05,560
I found out that he was your father, Doctor.

282
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:10,710
Who am I... that just because of me,

283
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:14,510
both of your lives were ruined...

284
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:17,880
I've been so sorry and distressed, Doctor.

285
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,310

286
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,870
I made it into medical school.

287
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,000
After I received this,

288
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,340
I wanted to meet you so badly that

289
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,300
I asked around here and there

290
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,790
and ended up going to your plastic surgery clinic.

291
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:50,650
But... I felt like I was so shameless

292
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:55,080
and couldn't muster up the courage, so I just went home.

293
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,230
If you would just allow me,

294
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:05,220
I want... to become a doctor like you.

295
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:10,820
I want to be... a neurologist, Doctor.

296
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,890
You've suffered a lot.

297
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,110
You've done well.

298
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:52,020
I'm sorry, Doctor.

299
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,170
I'm sorry.

300
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,340
You managed to pull it together again.

301
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,300
I wonder how high the viewer ratings will be.

302
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,320
I'll edit... what we filmed today.

303
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,430
Okay.

304
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,940
Do you like Park Jae Hoon?

305
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,790
- What? 
 - Why are you making me repeat myself?

306
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,800
I said do you like Park Jae Hoon?

307
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,090
It's not like that.

308
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:04,060
Then, why do you look at him with such gentleness?

309
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,120
Even if I liked him,

310
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,760
there's no need for me to tell you. Right?

311
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,490
Well, I'm a bit interested in him.

312
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,080
- What? 
 - Are you a repeat symbol or an echo?

313
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,610
Why do you keep asking me back?

314
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:29,010
I'm telling you I'm getting interested in him.

315
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:33,310
That I'm starting to crave Park Jae Hoon a bit.

316
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:37,150
How do you use the term "crave" for another person?

317
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,800
Is he a late night snack? He's not ramen or fried chicken.

318
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,540
And especially at this timing!

319
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,160
My gosh...

320
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,950
If I crave him, I'll say I crave him. How else would I put it?

321
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:51,270
In any case, I'm thinking of sleeping with him.

322
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,040
Did Jae Hoon say he'll sleep with you?

323
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,350
I'll suggest to him that we do it once.

324
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,890
You know...

325
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:05,580
I've observed you for what could be considered a long time.

326
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,820
You're really something.

327
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:10,820
Typically for me,

328
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,780
I need to sleep with someone once for me to lose interest.

329
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:18,760
This feeling of getting concerned and bothered...

330
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,430
I absolutely hate this feeling.

331
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:24,750
So if I sleep with him, all of that would dissipate.

332
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,080
Kang Chae Ri. You know it, too, right? That you are a nutcase.

333
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,840
I think I'm perfectly normal.

334
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,930
At least, I am 100 percent honest about my feelings.

335
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:40,870
About what I just told you, I didn't need to tell you,

336
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:44,240
but your gaze toward him was so gentle.

337
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,360
That's why I decided to tell you.

338
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,970
Jae Hoon.

339
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,400
Yeah.

340
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,590
You were a bit taken aback by the filming today, right?

341
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,180
A little bit.

342
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,940
I wanted to discuss it with you beforehand...

343
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,500
It doesn't matter.

344
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,830
There was a controversy because of me,

345
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:17,030
and they needed a way to fix it from the point of view of the show.

346
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,110
Thanks for understanding.

347
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:22,560
I'll take my car with Han Ji Yeon.

348
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,410
Oh, okay. And I'd like it if there was no cameras in the car.

349
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,710
Yes, of course.

350
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,500
I didn't even bring them from the start.

351
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,140
I'll be on my way.

352
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,510
Yeah, go.

353
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,820
Where did Han Ji Yeon go?

354
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,200
Oh, Park Jae Hoon is here!

355
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:13,110
Where did you go?

356
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,010
We waited for you!

357
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:17,420
Did you bring back Jae Hoon, Ji Yeon?

358
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,300
Wow, great.

359
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,150
It's not a prince on a white horse. It's a princess on a white horse.

360
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:24,940
Right? She's dressed in white as well.

361
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,350
Well, in any case, I am sorry for causing you all to worry.

362
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,260
We heard from the staff that the articles were all rumors.

363
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,760
But usually, when there's smoke, there's a fire...

364
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,080
They're really just rumors, right?

365
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,380
Hey, come on!

366
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,070
Joon Ho! Shut the mouth!

367
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,670
I'm just joking.

368
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:44,280
Han Ji Yeon, you worked hard to bring back your partner.

369
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,290
You didn't let him go.

370
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,580
Welcome back to the Kingdom of Love!

371
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,100
 Welcome!

372
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,760
Welcome back.

373
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,070
- You're not happy with this, right? 
 - What?

374
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:58,340
- You're not happy with this, right? 
 - No, no, this is all good!

375
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,050
Oh. Well...

376
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:04,700
I know because I've received a lot of negative comments online,

377
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,420
but it just means you're famous now.

378
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,300
Don't get hurt or anything like that.

379
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,650
It's just your loss.

380
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,750
Wow, you're worried about me, Chef?

381
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,450
Making me feel grateful and all.

382
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,520
What do you mean, worry?

383
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,200
I'm just giving you advice

384
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,180
as a senior in the influencer world.

385
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,890
I see...

386
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:31,760
- Thank you. 
 -  You're welcome.

387
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,470
Cheers?

388
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,360
Ji Yeon.

389
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,680
I just wanted to give you this.

390
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,240
What is this?

391
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,350
It's ginger tea.

392
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:28,310
Have a warm glass and rest well.

393
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,840
Thank you. I appreciate it.

394
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,410
Goodnight.

395
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:39,190
Thank you.

396
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,100

397
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,280

398
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,070

399
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:33,650

400
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:39,290
PD Kang Chae Ri!

401
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,100
You took care of that nicely!

402
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,160
The viewer ratings are amazing, too.

403
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,630
The higher-ups are thrilled.

404
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:51,400
This is... nothing.

405
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,030
Good job.

406
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,040
Well, I admit I did well,

407
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,730
but Goo Yeo Reum worked hard as well.

408
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:00,730
How's it like working together on the same team?

409
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:02,300
You two have good chemistry, right?

410
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,840
- Chemistry? 
 - Yeah.

411
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,290
Well... No. Absolutely not.

412
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:11,840
I put you guys together so you can balance each other out like a seesaw.

413
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,090
It was all part of the big picture that I drew up.

414
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,450
- Director. 
 - Yeah?

415
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:18,730
I don't like her.

416
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,270
Come on.

417
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:24,020
You guys are colleagues from the same school and major, and entered the company at the same time.

418
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:27,520
That's a tremendous connection. Why do you hate her so much?

419
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,910
You should be good friends. Right?

420
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:36,970
It's annoying because she's just too pure and innocent.

421
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,420
So annoying.

422
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,170
So, she's annoying, huh...

423
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:44,340
 Do you still do it nowadays?

424
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,360
 I'm not able to do it much nowadays but I want to.

425
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,310
 - Do you want to try it with me? 
 - That would be great.

426
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,690
 When should we do it?

427
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:52,420
 When should we do it?

428
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,810
 How about tomorrow?

429
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:58,480
 Last time, you wore it when you came to my hospital.

430
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,260
 - Oh! 
 - The tracksuit.

431
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:04,530
 Then, you can wear the tracksuit that you wore to the blind date...

432
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,980
- Yes? 
 - Senior, eat some fried chicken.

433
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,600
- Fried chicken? 
 - Yes.

434
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,390
Wow, looks tasty.

435
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:26,150
Wow, that looks so good!

436
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:29,310
- All right! One whole chicken per person? 
 - Eat up, eat up!

437
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:31,730
All right. Let's enjoy it.

438
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,910
Director bought it for us.

439
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:37,870
But man, the viewer ratings skyrocketed, and this is it?

440
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:40,640
It's fried chicken for today, and they'll treat us to dinner soon.

441
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:44,170
And supposedly, the higher-ups are discussing something like a reward vacation somewhere.

442
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,230
Great. Wow!

443
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,620
Great!

444
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,740
Wait, wait. Senior, you should have the first drumstick.

445
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,120
- Me? 
 - Okay.

446
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,550
Well then...

447
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,890
Shall I try it?

448
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:56,570
How is it?

449
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,220
Thank you for the food!

450
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,020
Wow, this is so good!

451
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,330
- Man, this is so delicious. 
 - Hey, Sang Woo! Come here.

452
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,910
- Come here and eat! 
 - Yeah, hurry up and eat. It's so good!

453
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:12,050
Hey! I told you, don't let me see you.

454
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:14,080
I'm sorry...

455
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,500
Geez.

456
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,810
Kang Chae Ri! PD...

457
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:27,520
It's so petty to be like that over food.

458
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,040
Hey! Where are you going with the fried chicken?

459
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,630
I don't want to eat together with you,

460
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,190
so I'm going to eat in the editing room. Why?

461
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:49,340
Then why are you taking two colas?

462
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,770
I'm thirsty!

463
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:57,030
Gosh, she's so annoying.

464
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:13,430
Hey, Sang Woo. Why are you slouching over the table like that?

465
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:16,630
Because I'm afraid that I might be seen by Senior Kang Chae Ri.

466
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,420
Come out. Let's go to the editing room.

467
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,290
All right.

468
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:27,330
Here, eat it.

469
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,140
You should eat the drumstick, Senior.

470
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,790
Hurry up and eat it.

471
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:34,010
Eat this one as well, and eat the rest of these two as well.

472
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:36,210
It is my love.

473
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:38,200
Thank you.

474
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,100
- Sang Woo. 
 - Yes?

475
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:50,800
Look for the right timing, go to Kang Chae Ri and apologize to her profusely.

476
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,490
It's about time she stopped being angry.

477
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:55,690
Go to her around this timing and sincerely apologize to her

478
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:57,570
and tell her that you'll do better.

479
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:01,110
She's the type where once she lets go of her anger, she doesn't hold any grudges.

480
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,490
I'm not usually the type to be afraid or anything like that.

481
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:10,810
But being on the bad side of Senior Kang Chae Ri is really scary.

482
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:15,070
We joined the company the same year. I get scared of her at times, too.

483
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:17,240
You too, Senior?

484
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,580
There are times when she acts like a bitch,

485
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:23,820
but... there are quite a few things to learn from her

486
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,500
and she has a unique style...

487
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:30,010
so I respect her directing ability.

488
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,980
In any case, don't be so timid.

489
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,550
Look for the right timing. Okay?

490
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,940
All right.

491
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,790
- Hurry up and eat. 
 - You should eat, Senior.

492
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,800
- Is it good? 
 - Yes.

493
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,710
Should I try a bite too?

494
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,480
It's good.

495
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,620
Hey, we were so shocked while watching the show!

496
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:59,710
Why would you hold all of that pain to yourself?

497
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,620
You've gone through a lot. Are you okay?

498
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,750
I see...

499
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,680
In any case, yeah...

500
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,540
It all got resolved well in the end,

501
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,680
so come to the restaurant, so we can have some soju together.

502
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,080
Yeah. All right.

503
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,470
Okay.

504
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,560
What did Jae Hoon say?

505
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,960
Well, he says he is currently filming at the Kingdom.

506
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,340
He says he's okay.

507
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:31,630
It must have been so difficult for Jae Hoon all this time.

508
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:33,410
Right?

509
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:35,810
You know that punk is more thoughtful than you might think.

510
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:38,310
He's the type to keep everything buried inside him.

511
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:42,650
As I watch him from the sidelines, I feel bad for him at times.

512
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,440
You do that too, Honey.

513
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,440
I do what?

514
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:02,970
You always... worry about others and listen to other people's concerns,

515
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:06,150
but you don't and can't tell others about your own problems.

516
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,740
- Right? 
 - When did I do that?

517
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,820
I tell you everything, whatever it may be.

518
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:14,920
I have something to tell you.

519
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,920
What is it?

520
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,460
I...

521
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:21,630
told Yeo Reum that we're trying IVF.

522
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,260
What?

523
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:28,840
- I told you we should keep that a secret! 
 - I'm sorry.

524
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,370
Why would you tell her that?

525
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,980
She's already so tired and busy!

526
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:37,480
She's already so caught up with work.

527
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,010
The difficulties you face while you go through IVF...

528
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:43,080
I can listen to and accept everything you say to me. But...

529
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,190
if by any chance...

530
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:48,600
there's a chance that there might be something you can't tell me.

531
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,870
Something that you can only tell another woman.

532
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:54,550
Who could you talk to, if not Yeo Reum?

533
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,690
Don't you think so?

534
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:58,650
There's nothing I can't tell you.

535
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:01,510
What do you mean, there's nothing? Without my knowledge—

536
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:17,260
You cry by yourself in the bathroom all the time without me knowing.

537
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,650
How did you know?

538
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:26,230
Every time you come back from the bathroom, your eyes are red.

539
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,420
How could I not know?

540
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,310
Hye Jin...

541
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,650
It's the same for me and Yeo Reum.

542
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:39,370
To see you suffer alone and struggle...

543
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:42,270
It really hurts a lot.

544
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:46,130
Don't cry by yourself.

545
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:49,210
Don't cry by yourself, and cry when someone is next to you.

546
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,100
I beg you.

547
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:03,660
Gosh. Speak of the devil. That Goo Yeo Reum.

548
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,410
Yeah, Yeo Reum.

549
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:10,880
No, no.

550
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,470
Why?

551
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:17,180
You want to go to the sauna tonight?

552
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,280
That'd be great for me!

553
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:36,740
Feels great.

554
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:39,130
As expected, as I get older,

555
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,660
a hot sauna is the best.

556
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,960
- Right? 
 - Absolutely.

557
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:49,380
Now that we've sweated out the toxins, let's apply some collagen.

558
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,980
Okay! Sounds good!

559
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,020
Sounds good, sounds good!

560
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,520
All right.

561
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:02,820
Look over here.

562
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:06,280
Hurry up and apply it.

563
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,950
Lift it like this from the bottom up.

564
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,840
Your neck as well.

565
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,850
How is it? It's really firm, right?

566
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:23,110
Absolutely firm.

567
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,720
Firm?

568
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:29,230
Here.

569
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:31,510
Drink some persimmon vinegar, too. Hurry, hurry!

570
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,140
Let's drink.

571
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:42,550
Yeo Reum.

572
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:47,100
I heard Dae Shik told you that we're trying IVF.

573
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,980
Yeah. You were shocked. Right?

574
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,780
Why didn't you tell me?

575
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:56,910
Just because.

576
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:59,600
You're going through a lot right now, too,

577
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,820
so I didn't feel comfortable telling you things like that.

578
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:08,100
I felt really sorry and upset.

579
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,970
- What? 
 - It's just that...

580
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:15,460
you're always by my side when I'm going through hard times

581
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:19,670
and listen to me and cry with me.

582
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:22,770
But it felt like I couldn't be that kind of friend for you.

583
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:25,030
Hey, why would you be sorry?

584
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:27,670
It's just that I wasn't able to tell you.

585
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:31,620
I wanted to be a comfortable and reliable friend,

586
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:35,490
but it seemed like I always talked about my problems first.

587
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:38,420
It's not like that.

588
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:44,050
It's just that... doing IVF...

589
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:48,360
is something that is difficult to talk about, even to a close friend.

590
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:53,510
"Will I be able to get pregnant this month?"

591
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:57,170
"Will an awesome miracle like that happen to me, too?"

592
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:00,110
I keep expecting but keep getting disappointed.

593
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:04,000
Once this keeps repeating, the disappointment

594
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,310
turns into despair.

595
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:10,220
"Do I have a defect?"

596
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,900
"What did I do wrong?"

597
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:18,150
When I walk down the streets and I see people walking holding a baby's hand,

598
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:20,760
I feel like going crazy from jealousy.

599
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:24,510
I develop something like an inferiority complex

600
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:27,500
and I start hiding it.

601
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:31,920
And even to my most precious best friend...

602
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,540
I just can't start talking about it.

603
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,690
IVF is like that.

604
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:53,750
Hye Jin, if you get pregnant,

605
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:57,390
that baby will be really happy.

606
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:59,920
Because you're the mom, Hye Jin.

607
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:11,000
Don't cry.

608
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:21,550
Park Jae Hoon.

609
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,000
Are you going to your room?

610
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,570
Yes.

611
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:31,270
There's... something...

612
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,010
I want to say to you.

613
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:34,920
What is it?

614
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,060
We found the original spreader of the rumors.

615
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:47,250
The one who spread the rumors about you.

616
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:50,220
Oh, really? Who was that person?

617
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,160
When you were in the neurology department,

618
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,720
he worked in public service at the same hospital.

619
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,820
Supposedly, he did it because he was jealous.

620
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,980
He found you aggravating every time you passed by him at the hospital,

621
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:04,560
then you started showing up on TV one day, so that annoyed him.

622
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:07,350
What should we do with him?

623
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:09,620
Do you want him to be punished?

624
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:16,140
How about we just forgive him?

625
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,860
Without getting an official apology?

626
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:21,870
Not sure if that's necessary. It's okay.

627
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:23,810
Don't you want to see his face, at least?

628
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:28,010
Checking out someone's face is a basic rule for Koreans.

629
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:30,660
I'm fine. Really.

630
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:40,630
Ever since I started appearing on TV, a lot of people started liking me for no reason.

631
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:45,320
Just like I can't go around thanking each person who likes me,

632
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:51,370
how can I go around meeting each person who hates me for no reason to receive their apology?

633
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,960
I'll just forgive him.

634
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:58,620
I'll leave it to you to wrap up the rest, PD.

635
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,260
All right then.

636
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:11,660
I don't know why...

637
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:15,500
I keep craving him.

638
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,260
He's really not my style.

639
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,700
Tonight, at a haunted house,

640
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,540
we are going to have a horror experience date.

641
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:30,360
And your date partners will be chosen by picking lots.

642
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,430
A horror experience at a haunted house sounds fun.

643
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:36,710
I really don't like this.

644
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:38,960
I really hate scary things.

645
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,090
Go with me, then.

646
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:44,970
Ji Wan, do you get scared easily too?

647
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:48,810
Actually, I don't get scared easily.

648
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:50,580
Oh, really?

649
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:54,350
 Hello.

650
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:55,640
 Hello.

651
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,130
 Oh, you have to put that over here.

652
00:47:58,130 --> 00:47:59,940
 Okay.

653
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:05,680
Wow, you look really scary.

654
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,260
So, first...

655
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,280
one of you will go into the classroom.

656
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,770
And the other... give me a moment.

657
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:17,540
All right. We'll do a test once.

658
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:18,840
Oh, wait a minute.

659
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,390
Please clean up that area as well.

660
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:23,810

661
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,420

662
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:31,200
Are they close to finishing setting up the haunted house?

663
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,040
I talked with two people who are at the location,

664
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,210
and they said they're almost done.

665
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:36,640
How about the supporting cast who are playing the ghosts?

666
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,110
Two maiden ghosts, two zombies, and two female high school student ghosts.

667
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:41,420
They finished their makeup and costumes, and they're now rehearsing.

668
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,670
Okay.

669
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:45,900
Since I need to do a comprehensive edit for next week's show...

670
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:50,070
Goo Yeo Reum, go to the location and wrap everything up.

671
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:52,630
Fine.

672
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:56,440
Okay, cast members. The male members will pick from numbers one through five,

673
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:00,340
and the female members will pick from the numbers six through ten.

674
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:07,020
Okay. Start pulling on the yarn.

675
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:40,580
Ji Yeon?

676
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:42,660
Jae Hoon...

677
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,410
Oh. What's with you two!

678
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:50,670
- Are they really destined to be? 
 - I know, huh?

679
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:52,440
The rest of us are all screwed up,

680
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,370
and only the two of you are a pair again.

681
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:56,620
"Screwed up"?

682
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:01,000
So are you saying that paring up with me is "screwed up"?

683
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,350
Oh, no, no. T-That's not what I meant.

684
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:08,690
Of course, it's an honor for me to be partners with you.

685
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:11,020
Forget it.

686
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:13,340
Hoon Hui, thanks in advance.

687
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:15,290
Yes, me, too.

688
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:20,440
I get scared easily.

689
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:24,180
I apologize in advance. I'll scream a lot.

690
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:27,960
Do you know who I am?

691
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,490
Who are you?

692
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:33,920
Attention! I'm a ghost-hunting navy!

693
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:40,190
Chef, it appears that you are partners with me.

694
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:41,850
Yes, it appears that way.

695
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:43,820
Do you tend to get scared easily, Ji Wan?

696
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:48,570
Actually, I don't get scared easily.

697
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,180
That's a relief.

698
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:53,670
But then again, I'm also a manly man, so yeah.

699
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,770
- You set up the stationary cam, right? 
 - Yes.

700
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:04,420
Are the ghosts ready on stand-by?

701
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:05,760
 Yes, everyone's ready.

702
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,760
Props team?

703
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,990
 Yes, everything's fully set.

704
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:13,110
Hee Chang, did you clean up everything dangerous inside the building?

705
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:16,670
- Yes, we cleared it all out. 
 - Okay.

706
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:18,580
It seems like everything's ready.

707
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:20,300
Okay, we're going to start shooting.

708
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,800
The cast members, be on standby!

709
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,330
I'm nervous.

710
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:50,990
I'll explain our mission.

711
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:53,650

Find the shrine room inside the haunted house.

712
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:55,710
 Then find the piece of chalk hidden in the room,

713
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:58,860
 and write both of your names with it on the blackboard, and return here.

714
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:01,380
 That's tonight's mission.

715
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:04,340
Hoon Hui and Tae Mi couple, get going, please.

716
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:05,280
Let's go.

717
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,690
- Come back safely! 
 - I'm so nervous.

718
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:08,540
Yes.

719
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,230
First participant, fighting!

720
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:11,880
Fighting!

721
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:14,830
Fighting! Don't cry.

722
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:16,690
That guy...

723
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:20,560
- Do they look nervous? 
 - They look good together.

724
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,660
The mountain over there.

725
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:24,590
Stop it.

726
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:28,190
Wow...

727
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:30,350
It's okay for us to go in here, right?

728
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:32,600
We have to go inside.

729
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,500
It's so scary...

730
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:44,340
God, that scared me. Are you okay?

731
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:46,340
It's okay.

732
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:52,860
Where is it?

733
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:54,760
Oh, man, that scared me.

734
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,640
Don't scare us like that again.

735
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,330
Should we try going in here?

736
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,600
Come out! Come out!

737
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:19,570
Yeah, come at me!

738
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:21,430
Where did he go?

739
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:23,610
Are you okay?

740
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:30,230
Whoa! This way. Hurry!

741
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:32,730
Whoa! What's this?

742
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:34,900
Gosh! Goodness.

743
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,440
Oh, it's this room.

744
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:43,330
Oh, shit.

745
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:45,420
I want to see my mom.

746
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,080
What is all this...

747
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:53,330
I think it's that.

748
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:56,800
Oh, it's here.

749
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,140
Whoa! That scared me!

750
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:00,610
Oh, gosh!

751
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:03,730

752
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:09,430
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's with you two? 
 - Oh, shit!

753
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:12,210
Amazing! It's f***ing crazy in there.

754
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:13,910
F***!

755
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:16,280
What's so scary? It's all planned from the get-go.

756
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,080
It's so f***ing scary! So f***ing scary!

757
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:21,000
Gosh, I almost peed myself. F***.

758
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,680
F***.

759
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:26,370
It's okay now. It's all over now.

760
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:28,300
F***, that was scary.

761
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,770
Next, Jang Goon and Soo Mi couple, get going, please.

762
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:32,990
Oh, thank you.

763
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:35,080
- It must be really scary in there... 
 - Fighting.

764
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,370
Attorney, just leave it to me.

765
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:39,040
Let's go!

766
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:46,300
- I think it's this room. Let's enter. 
 - Okay.

767
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:47,940
Boo!

768
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:49,340
It's okay, it's okay.

769
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:50,610
Don't scare me.

770
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:53,390
All right, the prettiest girl in South Korea, Attorney Geum Soo Mi...

771
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:56,380
Hong Jang Goon will protect her!

772
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:58,360
Wait. It's somewhere in here.

773
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:02,500
- I see talismen. 
 - I think... it might be inside there.

774
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,560
I'll try opening that over there.

775
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,980
But I don't want to open it...

776
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:07,980
Gosh, but we need to find it quickly.

777
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:11,020
- Follow me well. 
 - Slowly! Slowly...

778
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,740
Okay, okay, okay.

779
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:20,380
Soo Mi! Soo Mi. Soo Mi.

780
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:22,280
Gosh. You're really hard at work. Good evening.

781
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,640
I guess it's not here.

782
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:27,500
Dun, dun, dun-dun. Clear, clear, clear. Attorney, it's clear.

783
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:30,570
- It's all right. 
 - I want to run away from here.

784
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:39,840
- Whoa, come on! Go back up! 
 - No! It's so scary! I can't go on!

785
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,380
- Wait, wait, wait! 
 - No, it's fine!

786
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,430
One, two, three.

787
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:48,020
You see, there's nothing! The chalk is here.

788
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:49,760
What is this! Get off, get off!

789
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,280
Bad hand, bad hand! Bad hand!

790
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:56,240
- Finally... 
 - We can go out.

791
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,170
Our mission is...

792
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:01,050
cleared!

793
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:03,770
 Will there be no more ghosts...

794
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:05,270
 Let's go.

795
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:07,570
Where do we need to go? Don't we need to go that way?

796
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:10,390
Why do we need to do something like this?

797
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:12,800
Gosh, I'm going to go crazy!

798
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,140
W-Where is it?

799
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:17,750
Where is it?

800
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:24,470
God, this is crazy!

801
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,700
I told you, it's f***ing scary in there.

802
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:55,200
Ji Wan, just stay behind me.

803
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,290
Because I'm not really afraid of these types of things.

804
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:01,700
It looks like something's going to pop out.

805
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,190
Have a nice day.

806
00:57:54,490 --> 00:57:56,490
Oh, what a surprise.

807
00:57:56,490 --> 00:57:58,590
Are you okay?

808
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:02,930
Are you okay?

809
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:04,540
Where did it fall?

810
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:06,460
I'll do it.

811
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:09,050
Is it here? Is it this?

812
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:15,910
Oh, my!

813
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:18,160
Whoa, why... Are you all right? My goodness.

814
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,450
John! He's so weak...

815
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:24,830
Ji Wan, I feel like I'm going to throw up.

816
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:27,370
I'm really about to throw up.

817
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:28,640
We're done, we're done.

818
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,540
- It's really hard for me right now. 
 - Okay.

819
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:33,050
We're done. Let's go.

820
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:34,410
God... I'm getting motion sickness.

821
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:36,090
You're getting motion sickness? Just hold on a bit longer.

822
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:37,480
All right. It's our final couple.

823
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,770
Ji Yeon and Jae Hoon couple, get going, please.

824
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:41,720
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

825
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:45,650
Try to get a hold of yourself.

826
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:49,100
Be careful. There are a few things to watch out for.

827
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,750
- Gosh. 
 - You look tired.

828
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:56,090
I keep yawning.

829
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:08,990
Let's go this way.

830
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,640
Oh, my!

831
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,860
Senior, it's raining.

832
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,580
What's going on? Was there rain in the forecast?

833
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:31,500
No, there wasn't...

834
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:35,790
First, cover all the cameras and equipment with a plastic tarp, and let's wrap up what we're shooting.

835
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:37,190
Oh, okay. Got it.

836
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:40,790
Okay, please cover all the equipment with a plastic tarp!

837
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:09,320
- Are you okay? 
 - N-No.

838
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:14,210
I should have had you stay at the entrance.

839
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:24,640
- Are you okay? 
 - No.

840
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,960
At this rate, I'm going to end up scared.

841
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,990
- Hold on tight. 
 - Okay.

842
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,120
Whoa, that scared me.

843
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:41,730
Gosh... Well, the blackboard is here,

844
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:44,730
so I think we should find the chalk quickly.

845
01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:49,510
Let's go.

846
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:02,470
Ji Yeon, we're done.

847
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:05,630
Let's quickly write our names and leave.

848
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:10,990

849
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,700

850
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,890
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

851
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:26,740
It's coming down a lot harder than I'd thought.

852
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:29,610
Yeah, it's raining pretty hard...

853
01:01:29,610 --> 01:01:31,370
Hee Chang, capture the lightning for an insert.

854
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:33,450
Oh, okay. Got it.

855
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,800
They're here. They're here!

856
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:40,430
Yeah! Welcome back.

857
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:43,030
Wow, it's no joke!

858
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,120
You guys weren't overreacting.

859
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,220
So refreshing!

860
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:50,180
Cut!

861
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:52,430
We're going to wrap up the shooting for today here.

862
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:54,800
Let's have all the cast members return to the Kingdom.

863
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,100
Okay.

864
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:57,410
Everyone did a great job.

865
01:01:57,410 --> 01:01:58,510
Great work, everyone!

866
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:02,390
Please put on these raincoats, and move to the bus.

867
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:05,380
Everyone, please move to the bus. Great work, everyone.

868
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:07,670
Everyone worked so hard!

869
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:12,910
- Hee Chang. 
 - Yes.

870
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:16,620
Pack all of the equipment and return to the Kingdom with the cast first.

871
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:17,610
What about you, Senior?

872
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:19,700
I'll collect the stationary cameras inside and be right behind you.

873
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:21,050
No, I'll collect them.

874
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:22,420
No, it's fine.

875
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:24,620
We need to move the large equipment first.

876
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:27,210
- Are you sure you're fine? 
 - Yeah. I'm fine.

877
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:29,070
Well, Senior, at least take a raincoat.

878
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:31,130
- It's really coming down. 
 - It's okay.

879
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:33,990
- Move quickly. Hurry, hurry, hurry! 
 - Got it.

880
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,190
Gosh, that scared me!

881
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:29,560
It's here.

882
01:03:46,310 --> 01:03:48,000
What are you doing here?

883
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,810
We're done shooting...

884
01:03:49,810 --> 01:03:53,140
What? We're done shooting?

885
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:56,610
Everyone is on the way back. Hurry up and leave.

886
01:03:56,610 --> 01:03:59,470
What the... Great work today.

887
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:01,640
Yes, great work...

888
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,490
Wow, gosh.

889
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:10,030

890
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:14,640

891
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:33,120

892
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:49,780
Goo Yeo Reum!

893
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:52,930
Jae Hoon...

894
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:54,710
Stay there.

895
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:05,000
Hey!

896
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:11,550
♫  On this long winding road  ♫

897
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:18,770
♫  There's a trace of kindness that came and went  ♫

898
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:21,410
Hey, you...

899
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:32,850
♫  And the today and tomorrow that I've been looking forward to  ♫

900
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:47,160
♫  I, who loved you with all my heart, am fading in my tears  ♫

901
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:54,690
♫  "I'm okay now"  ♫

902
01:05:54,690 --> 01:06:01,520
♫  I say that as if I'm talking to myself but keep sighing  ♫

903
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:06,900
♫  Honestly, I keep wiping away this feeling, exhausted  ♫

904
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:11,100
♫  Even if things get difficult  ♫

905
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:18,940
♫  I dream again from my love  ♫

906
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:24,950
♫  I'm smiling for some reason  ♫

907
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:33,460
♫  As I go around this warm corner  ♫

908
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:36,190
♫  Even the moments that were like promises  ♫

909
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:39,140

910
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:40,500
 Who is Park Jae Hoon?

911
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,410
 Is there something between him and PD Goo Yeo Reum?

912
01:06:42,410 --> 01:06:47,360
 Do you know that people online call you Superior Jae Hoon and Inferior Ji Yeon?

913
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:50,730
 Either you clear things up officially or not.

914
01:06:50,730 --> 01:06:52,580
 Do you have any male cast members that you like?

915
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:54,050
 You're trying to make others hate me, right?

916
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:55,680
 Isn't it better than a raffle giveaway?

917
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:58,390
 Did you guys make this trashy show?

918
01:06:58,390 --> 01:06:59,620
 Jae Hoon and Han Ji Yeon?

919
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:02,130
 It seems like they're doing really well. Right, Yeo Reum?

920
01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:03,560
 Thank you for liking me first.

921
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,970
 But from now on, I'll be the one to like you more.

922
01:07:05,970 --> 01:07:10,100
♫  I just keep enduring like this  ♫
