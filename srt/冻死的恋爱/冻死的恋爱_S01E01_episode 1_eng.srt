1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:08,980

2
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,640

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,680
♫  Dive with you, towards the wide sea  ♫

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,040

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,080
♫  Jump in love, I fly with wings called you  ♫

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,060

♫  There is nothing to be afraid of  ♫

7
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,070
♫  In the world called you, it sparkles and lingers here  ♫

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,700
♫  What I found while wandering was you who 
 was always by my side  ♫

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,360
♫  I'm already ready for you  ♫

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,130

11
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:44,780

12
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,610

13
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:03,360

14
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,170

15
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:09,050

16
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,560
Hello.

17
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,890
- Hello. 
  - Hello.

18
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,130
Hello.

19
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,520
Senior, you're here?

20
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,940
It's been a while.

21
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,640
Have you been well?

22
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,120
- What were you filming? 
 - This.

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,250
PD Goo Yeo Reum!

24
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,700
You're here?

25
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,050
Oh goodness, PD Goo, hello!

26
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,110
- Hello. 
 - Hello!

27
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,070
I really missed you!

28
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,730
 - It's been so long. 
 - I know, right?

29
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,490
 She's prettier than the brides.

30
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,900
 I really missed you.

31
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,090
Now, I'd like the final couple of "Kingdom of Love 2" to stand together.

32
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,910
We're going to proceed to film the couples.

33
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,510
 Film the couples?

34
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,960
 Oh, thank you.

35
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,390

36
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,510
Okay, the filming of couples is over.

37
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,730
We'll take a short break.

38
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,340
 Let me slide.

39
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,830

40
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:39,690

41
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,680

42
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,450
 Buy some chicken feet on your way home.

43
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,390
This girl.

44
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,890
Yeah!

45
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,960
 Order it with your finger.

46
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,910
Look at this guy.

47
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,610
Yeah, why?

48
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,640
Jae Hoon, chicken feet.

49
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,140
And a bottle of soju while you're at it.

50
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,810
With the effort it took you to call me, wouldn't it have been more efficient in many aspects to order it yourself?

51
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,210
No, no.

52
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,560
If I order it, the delivery fee won't be worth it.

53
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,330
 Just buy me some on your way back.

54
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,180
Yeo Reum wants to eat chicken feet!

55
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,070
Goo Yeo Reum, don't you feel sorry for your body?

56
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,490
Why should I feel sorry for my body?

57
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,040
 You eat chicken feet early in the evening,

58
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,630
let out bloody poop in the morning, and your visceral fat increases.

59
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,880
John Jang ignored my text.

60
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,280
John Jang?

61
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,470
Oh, the young bastard you're flirting with these days?

62
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,380
I mean, he must be too sick or too busy—

63
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,880
Ma'am, you've been rejected.

64
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,300
Buy the one with bones.

65
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,860
 And the soju with the red bottle cap.

66
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,830
Gosh, when will she grow up?

67
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,550
Now, shall we?

68
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,860

69
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,680
Hey, it's me.

70
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,070
- Wrap an order of chicken feet for me to go. 
 - To go?

71
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,110
- You should eat it here. 
 - PD Goo asked me to buy it for her.

72
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,270
Yes, flaming charisma. Fire!

73
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,160
Hey, Park Jae Hoon!

74
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,310
You were a bread shuttle for Goo Yeo Reum in high school and

75
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,070
now you're Goo Yeo Reum's chicken feet shuttle at 37 freaking years old.

76
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,370
- I'm proud of you. 
 - When was I ever her shuttle? 
  (Shuttle - errand boy)

77
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,490
You're doing it right now.

78
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,970
I'm just showing my marginalized neighbor some warmth.

79
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,460
Oh, is that right?

80
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:58,140
It's nice to see two single middle-aged people relying on each other in harmony.

81
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,260
Rely- hey, what... what...

82
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,410
What rely—

83
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,750
Goo Yeo Reum, that girl is...

84
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,370
just b-baggage. Baggage, baggage.

85
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,430
So how spicy did your baggage want her chicken feet, Shuttle?

86
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,680
Please make it so that her butthole won't be intact, Mr. Park.

87
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,650
All right, Shuttle.

88
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,900
- You need help? 
 - What help?

89
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,910
You want to be my shuttle, too?

90
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,920
Gosh, just buy me some chicken feet!

91
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,040

92
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,870
Chef John!

93
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,150
 What are you up to, PD Goo?

94
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,280
 Can we meet for a sec, right now?

95
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,530
Right now?

96
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:44,360

97
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,430
I'm going, I'm going.

98
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,470
Sorry! I can't eat any chicken feet.

99
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,670
 - John Jang just asked me to meet him.  
 - John Jang?

100
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,610
 - You said he was MIA.  
 - I don't know!

101
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,770
He suddenly said he'll be outside my house.

102
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,900
Hey, I think he's going to ask me to date him starting today.

103
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,880
 Gosh, that man has no intentions, and you're just acting a fool by yourself.

104
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,330
 If it's not to ask me out,

105
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,460
why would he ask me to meet him at this hour, huh?

106
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,690
 If he asks to borrow money, just make sure not to lend him any.

107
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,800
Should I just pounce on him first?

108
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,380
Goo Yeo Reum, you're really going to end up in jail that way.

109
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,800
He's never going to ask you out.

110
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,610
Why? Why wouldn't he? Why, why, why?

111
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,110
If he's not asking you out after three dates, it's a no deal.

112
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,230
But you've been flirting with him... for over three months?

113
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,550
- Yeah! 
  - See? It's game over.

114
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,930
I'll put my hand in the fire if he asks you out.

115
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,280
Hey, don't put your hand anywhere, and just bet money.

116
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,210
- 1,000,000 won. 
  - You'll bet 1,000,000 won?

117
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:41,490
Yeo Reum, he won't budge even if you pounce on him. I'll bet 2,000,000 won on that.

118
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,560
You... that statement just now was highly offensive.

119
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,620
I mean...

120
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,910
I didn't mean to offend, that was a honest to God fact.

121
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:54,220
So it's 1 million won if we date, and 2 million won if we sleep together, right?

122
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,670
- Yes. 
 - Go and take out some cash.

123
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:00,480
I just changed my style from effortless casual to super sexy.

124
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,920
You're dead.

125
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,670
When will she grow up?

126
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,360
Can she even pull off sexy?

127
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,790
Let's go.

128
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,390
Chef John.

129
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,840
What brings you...

130
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,950
to my house... at this late hour?

131
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,060
I have something to tell you.

132
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,630
Would you like to come inside?

133
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,820
Well, that's a bit improper.

134
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,420
Shall we go for a drive?

135
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,980
Watch your head.

136
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,340
All right.

137
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,890
It's an iced Americano, just what you like.

138
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,000
Thank you.

139
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,970
God, your perfume.

140
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,570
It smells so nice.

141
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,740
When I was in Paris,

142
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,440
I looked all over for it because I loved the scent.

143
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:54,510
 This man and I met as a program director and cast member,

144
00:09:54,510 --> 00:10:00,120
 we went on seven dates, and took it as far as a light kiss.

145
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,410
 I can't believe I dated someone I met through work...

146
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,790
 I felt overwhelmed at first,

147
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:09,680
 but the younger man's directness led me all this way.

148
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,450
 Now, it's time to clearly define our relationship.

149
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:18,030
PD Goo, everyone is like that these days.

150
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,640
They slyly end things after flirting with you for a while.

151
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,610
Gosh, but that's not my style.

152
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:29,010
I think... being straightforward is the neatest.

153
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,100
I also...

154
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,270
like being straightforward.

155
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,530
I really enjoyed our dates until now.

156
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,820
I had a good time as well.

157
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,530
I think I'm compatible with you in various aspects.

158
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:47,110
We have similar hobbies, interests,

159
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,510
and food preferences.

160
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,390
 Hey, punk!

161
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:54,340
 Similar food preferences means similar sexual preferences, punk!

162
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:59,050
But... we don't have chemistry.

163
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,700
What...

164
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,370
What don't we have?

165
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,930
Chemistry...

166
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,950
I'm not into you, so we...

167
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,990
Let's just stay in a good older sister and younger brother relationship from now on.

168
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,000
 Hello, I'm John Jang.

169
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,100
 Okay, today's star of the show is the penis fish; penis fish.

170
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,970
 Wow, just look at the size, the size!

171
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:43,870
 We're going to take the prepared penis fish and add it to the ramen.

172
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:47,550

The penis fish contains glycine and alanine

173
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:52,400
- Wow, every... single thing he does is unappealing. 
  - which makes it taste sweet.

174
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,100
Gosh.

175
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,510
Chef John.

176
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,560
You could've said that over the phone or by text,

177
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,520
but why did you go through the trouble of coming here and telling me face-to-face?

178
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,790
Manners.

179
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,380
You.

180
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,140
A face-to-face is better than "uncontact."

181
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:18,230
And moreover, Sis, you're six years older than I am,

182
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,120
so "age before beauty."  (Jang you you seo)

183
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,760
Do you want to write a will? 
  (Yoo Seo also means "will")

184
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,330
I'm sorry?

185
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:29,900
Anyway, I understand what you're trying to say.

186
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,590
A close older sister and younger brother... fine.

187
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,570
Let's do that.

188
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,750
As expected, Sis, you're really chill and charismatic!

189
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,210
Don't act awkward on the film set, just in case.

190
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,720
And let's just focus on our work from now on.

191
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,670
That sounds perfect to me.

192
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,130
If you're done, then let's go.

193
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,680
I'll take you home.

194
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,410
But... Chef John...

195
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,470
Who is it?

196
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,260
Gosh...

197
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,370
2,000,000 won.

198
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,770
You slept with him?

199
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,590
That son of a bitch...

200
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,540
Listen to me.

201
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,940
This is the last thing I said to John Jang,

202
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,080
and I want to know how this sounds to you.

203
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,560
 I mean... no matter who I'm with,

204
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,630
 my energy explodes like hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid.

205
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,810
 How would you know your chemistry with me when we haven't even done anything yet?

206
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:28,930
"How would you know your chemistry with me when we haven't even slept together yet?"

207
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,960
That's what it sounds like.

208
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,660
That's honestly not what I meant.

209
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:39,310
"How would you know when... you haven't even dated me?"

210
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,020
That's what I meant...

211
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,320
Look at you, gosh.

212
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,310
 How would you know your chemistry with me when we haven't even done anything yet?

213
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:51,390
 It would've been nice... if we did.

214
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,510
 I believe you'd be skilled.

215
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,080
But the chemistry I was talking about was our tiki-taka.

216
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,600
Tiki... taka...

217
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,820
Give and take, you know?

218
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,780
I don't think we have good communication.

219
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,450
Damn it!

220
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:08,070
That bastard and I... don't have good communication.

221
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,370
We absolutely don't!

222
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:12,710
Goo Yeo Reum, you've been humiliated.

223
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,110
How old is John Jang again?

224
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,880
31.

225
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,470
You've just been rejected by a guy six years younger than you?

226
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,860
Huh?

227
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,790
Wow, disgraceful. So disgraceful.

228
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,580
Let's stop eating and go to sleep, please!

229
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,410
Jae Hoon,

230
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,460
my wound from breaking up is so painful.

231
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,210
Hey, how is a break-up when it ended after some flirting?

232
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,500
Sometimes, failed flirting is

233
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,280
much worse than breaking up in a relationship.

234
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,980
Yeo Reum, be a bit more cool.

235
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,240
I... hate the word "cool."

236
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,810
And I abhor the word "some." 
  (Flirting, as in "something" is going on between two people)

237
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,520
Why do you hate "some"? It's so rational.

238
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,420
I want to raise an uprising

239
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,250
against the malicious social phenomenon in which

240
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:03,050
I feel similar feelings of love without any responsibility.

241
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,880
I mean, try resetting your mindset.

242
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,250
While enjoying the excitement and joy of dating,

243
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:13,900
you get to avoid commitment and the tiring cons of being in a relationship.

244
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,380
Sounds like bullshit.

245
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,640
Accept "some" as part of your daily life. Like eating and pooping.

246
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,060
Is eating and pooping light to you?

247
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,530
If we don't do those things, we're dead.

248
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:29,800
No! This is why John Jang cut it off with you. 
 - Shit...

249
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,600
- Who dates an old fogey like you these days? 
 - Who are you calling an old fogey?

250
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,390
How is treating someone's feelings seriously being an old fogey? Huh? How?

251
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,480
What kind of old fogey did this?

252
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,440

253
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,740

254
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,910
- Yeo Reum, are you okay? 
 - I'm not okay.

255
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,000
What's with this public execution?

256
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,460
He could've just sent it to our group chat, but he troubled himself with personally writing it...

257
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,700
He said in order to survive in a new media environment,

258
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,320
we will have to revamp our organization in an analog and intuitive way.

259
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,870
I wasn't expecting him to use this kind of debilitating shock therapy.

260
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:09,840
To be honest, this situation isn't entirely your fault.

261
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,780
Other channels are pitting against us with major dramas and well-known variety shows,

262
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,870
but you just joined the fight as a human shield!

263
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,200
Exactly.

264
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,220
And this poster...

265
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,480
Isn't this too cruel?

266
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,950
We're not back-in-the-days anymore.

267
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,390
What kind of...

268
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,370
I'm about to feel offended!

269
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:30,470
You're the one who offended me.

270
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,020
Whenever I check the viewer ratings of "Ramen Chef,"

271
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,830
I feel like my lifespan decreases.

272
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,140
But, Director,

273
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:44,310
I don't think... I'm entirely at fault.

274
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:47,270
Everyone uses OTT service. Who watches live broadcasts these days?

275
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,300
Look at you. You're coming at me, now?

276
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,710
Are you Generation MZ?

277
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,770
I'm "M."

278
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:57,530
- Millennial. 
 - You're such a headache.

279
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,770
All right, PD Goo from Generation M.

280
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,940
What might this be?

281
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,510
There's a program that started from 3% and increased to 20%,

282
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:09,520
but how did yours fall from 5% to 0%?

283
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,040
I'm sorry.

284
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,900
You little—

285
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,660
Gosh.

286
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,070
She's in a bad mood.

287
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,600
Be quiet.

288
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,080
PD Goo, are you okay?

289
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,690
Your expression is totally rotten.

290
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:54,100
If we can't recover our rating back to 1%,

291
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,900
I'm going to kill myself.

292
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,630
The penis fish was our hidden weapon,

293
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,100
but it just got buried.

294
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,970
Senior! I'll start by ripping down that poster in the hallway.

295
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,430
- I'll rip it down, burn it to flames, and write an apology! 
 - Sure.

296
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,830
- Sang Woo, sit down. 
 - Okay.

297
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,040
PD Goo, did you watch "Kingdom of Love" last week?

298
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,780
I couldn't because I was up several nights in the editorial room.

299
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,270
I see...

300
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,970
- They had octopus on the show! 
 - Octopus?

301
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,520
But that's our item for this week.

302
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,000
Exactly...

303
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,890
Octopus was a top search word all weekend.

304
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,810
The community has also been doing parodies of octopuses.

305
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,050
Isn't that a good thing?

306
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,380
Since it's like this anyway, let's do an octopus parody, too!

307
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,830
Stay put!

308
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:51,120
Senior, if you want to change it to Webfoot octopus or baby octopus—

309
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,140
Why would I change my item because of "Kingdom"?

310
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,980
Sorry.

311
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:03,390
PD Goo, I heard you were college alumni with Kang Chae Ri from "Kingdom of Love"?

312
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,620
Was she always a sociopath?

313
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,740
I don't know. I didn't even know she existed in college.

314
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,450
I was an insider,

315
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,040
and she was a total outsider.

316
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,450
She couldn't even dare to talk to me back then.

317
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,980
You've grown a lot, Kang Chae Ri.

318
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,300
 Unni, where did you buy your swimsuit?

319
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,220
 It's so pretty!

320
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,870
 Hey, you f***ing bitch.

321
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,170
 I heard you're talking shit about me!

322
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,740
 Did you just curse?

323
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,170
 I can't even respond to that lowly remark.

324
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,400
 Look at you acting all refined.

325
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,460
 You might have a higher education than I do,

326
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,960
 but I'm a thousand f***ing times more popular.

327
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,140
 I'm an influencer with 30,000 followers!

328
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:49,320
 Do you even know what influencer means?

329
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,150
 - God... 
 - Influencer, yeah?

330
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:56,890
 Insider in f***ing English is influencer!

331
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:00,110
 - Let go. 
 - What? What can you do?

332
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:03,900
 Hey, let go. Let go! F***!

333
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,470
Gosh...

334
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,390
We might even hit 30% if we're lucky.

335
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,370

336
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,780
Let's see.

337
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,300
 Did you like your date with her?

338
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,580
 Not really.

339
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,630
 Liar!

340
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,730
 There were hearts shooting from your eyes.

341
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,240
 I'm telling the truth!

342
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,080

I hated it.

343
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,780
 Is she pretty?

344
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,750
 You're a lot prettier.

345
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,200
 Do you want to...

346
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,080
 stay with me tonight?

347
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,040

348
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:06,930

349
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:10,160

350
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,400

351
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,160

352
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:23,760

(Food broadcast.]

353
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,440
A male and female went into a room they booked,

354
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,050
but did you... really have to insert a scene...

355
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:35,460
- of the octopus? 
 - Well...

356
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,630
is that a problem?

357
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:40,910
The KCC complained because it's too racy. 
  (Korean Communications Commission)

358
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,150
How can you laugh right now?

359
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,100
The result was good, though.

360
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,770
We hit our highest rating

361
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:50,510
and the clips continue to spread on the internet.

362
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,180
Did the cast even consent to this?

363
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,190
They don't care if footage of them booking a room goes on the air?

364
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:02,140
I obtained their consent before filming and I also communicated with them throughout the process.

365
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,880
PD Goo, we'll leave first.

366
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,990
Yeah, go ahead.

367
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,220
PD Goo,

368
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,300
I just got a call...

369
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:19,250
The ramen company said they won't renew our sponsorship contract.

370
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,780
What?

371
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,460
Hey, how much ramen do we have left?

372
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:30,050
We only have five boxes left?

373
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:37,070
Then do we have to...

374
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:40,840
buy our own ramen?

375
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,440
A ramen program...

376
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,960
that can't find a sponsor?

377
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,970
It's humiliating.

378
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,950
And the director

379
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:57,710
said he's going to cut our production fees by 20%.

380
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,350
What?

381
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,410
Yes?

382
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,880
Director Ma.

383
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,130
How could you cut down the production fees of a currently airing program?

384
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,840
I received orders from above.

385
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,800
You don't have any more ads, either.

386
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,210
Did you think they would react favorably?

387
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,370
Director Ma.

388
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,780
- Director Ma? 
 - What?

389
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,130
They say to kill the enemy with kindness.

390
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,960
Please give us another chance.

391
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,810
Please let me at least maintain the staff's pay.

392
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,780
Try exerting a hungry attitude.

393
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,340
That's also a skill of the director.

394
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,690
Let's see...

395
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,040
I heard all your ramen ads fell out.

396
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,910
Gosh, it was somewhat the golden hour.

397
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,660
It would be better to air a re-run of our show during that time.

398
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,840
Hey, Kang Chae Ri,

399
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,540
most people think that inside their heads and don't actually speak them aloud.

400
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,720
Does your brain not have a manner filter?

401
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,320
Yeah, it doesn't.

402
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,790
I'm going to kill her.

403
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,570
- Senior, did you hear the news? 
 - What news?

404
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:26,480
Chef John will be starring in the next season of "Kingdom of Love."

405
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,790
Yeah?

406
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,360
I heard from my colleague,

407
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,240
that Senior Kang Chae Ri obtained a contract from Chef John.

408
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,440
To clear out all the women around him.

409
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,280
Gosh, apparently, Chef John is quite the womanizer.

410
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,830
And during the "Kingdom" interview,

411
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:45,450
he said he has about 100 "some" partners.

412
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,310
100?

413
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,160
Is he King Uija or what? 
  (Korean folklore: a story of concubines and court ladies during the reign of Baekje’s King Uija, who jumped off the rock when Silla-Tang allied forces conquered the Baekje capital)

414
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,770
And what's even more incredible

415
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:56,070
is that Chef John agreed to expose his butt.

416
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,060
In Season 2 of "Kingdom of Love."

417
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,530
I do think it's going to be fun, right?

418
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,070
It's a work of art, even if I read it again.

419
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,520
- Yeah. 
 - Jae Hoon, let's date for just one day.

420
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,530
You've finally gone crazy, haven't you?

421
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:25,770
I came to Kanghwa Island to film and I need you to pick me up later.

422
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:29,220
Wear your best clothes and carry a bouquet of flowers, too.

423
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,490
Are you doing this because of John Jang?

424
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,270
I can't go on like this.

425
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:35,860
Oh, God. No, I don't want to. That's tiring, no.

426
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,040
- I'll buy you beef if you pick me up. 
 - I'll buy it with my own money.

427
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,060
I'll sort your trash, too. For a whole week.

428
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,540
One month of trash sorting and Korean beef rib eye?

429
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,410
Deal! You got it.

430
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,670
But you must come all dressed up, okay?

431
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:51,910
If you come looking ragged...

432
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:55,080
Down! Up.

433
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,780
I'm going to sort you out.

434
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,570
All right.

435
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,450
You said you're in Kanghwa Island?

436
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:04,410
We'll start filming now!

437
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:07,580
Here goes the slate. Three, two, one!

438
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:12,310
50,000,000 people in South Korea. 50,000,000 ramen recipes.

439
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:15,370
I look for the hidden masters in all corners of the country

440
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:17,770
Ramen Chef face-offs with ramen.

441
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:20,000
Hello, I'm John Jang.

442
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,460
Everyone, do you know what happens

443
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,880
when a three-legged octopus suffers hair loss?

444
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,670
The answer is a one-legged octopus. Why?

445
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:29,830
Because he's missing hair. 
  (Also sounds like "two legs.")

446
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,470
Now, octopuses are—

447
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:40,000
Rock, rock, rock, rock, scissors!

448
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,250
Scissors, paper!

449
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,180
Rock!

450
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,360
Why did I play rock? Why?

451
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,410
Yes!

452
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,600
- Gosh! 
 - Nice!

453
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,270
Since when was my honey so good at Muk-chi-ppa? 
  (A rock-paper-scissors game)

454
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,650
Since you were born?

455
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:54,960
Go and clean.

456
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,180
Okay, have a seat and rest.

457
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,490
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

458
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,300
He's so bad.

459
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,510
This is our break time!

460
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:14,700
I always tell you to come on time, but you always come at this time.

461
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,790
I am hungry, but I'm not here to eat.

462
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,320
- What about Dae Shik? 
- He's cleaning the sink.

463
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,580
Is he your husband or servant?

464
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,030
Of course, he's my servant.

465
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,190
God, my poor friend.

466
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,410
Jae Hoon's here!

467
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:27,530
Okay, I'll be done soon. Just rest up!

468
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:28,780
 Jae Hoon's here!

469
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,310
I miss you, too—

470
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,730
You startled me.

471
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,290
Are you even getting paid for this?

472
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:35,350
Of course, I do. Five bills every month.

473
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,580
You only get 500,000 won?

474
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,240
50,000 won. Wow!

475
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,060
Hey, Oh Hye Jin, he's not your servant. He's your slave.

476
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,510
You know,

477
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:48,970
whenever I'm sad, I clean this sink.

478
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:52,810
Moisture, moisture. Humidity, humidity!

479
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:55,050
Hey, let me use your truck today.

480
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:56,710
Why the truck, all of a sudden?

481
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:00,970
It's been long since I made Yeo Reum smile.

482
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,290
The right side.

483
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,310
What did you do to your butt?

484
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,540
Don't you dare lend the truck to this bastard.

485
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,530
Of course.

486
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:21,140
You startled me. Knock before you come in.

487
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,610
What are you going to do to Yeo Reum?

488
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,970
What would I do to Yeo Reum?

489
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:29,110
Your eyes are very wicked right now.

490
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:31,190
You... You always... stay still

491
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,130
when Goo Yeo Reum makes me do things

492
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,930
- and manipulates me. 
 - When did I ever?

493
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,740
Whose 50,000 won is that?

494
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,150
Huh? Where?

495
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,690
- Careful, careful. 
 - Why's there a 50,000 won bill?

496
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,510
Where? Where?

497
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,620
What the?

498
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,580
You gave him the keys to the truck?

499
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,240
You little!

500
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,640
Hey, Park Jae Hoon!

501
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,180
You car thief!

502
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,800
If you do this, the innards will come out, but you can just put them aside like this.

503
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,840
I'll start by making vegetable broth.

504
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,790
Cut the radish into pieces.

505
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:18,440
When you make the broth... can you show them the vegetables?

506
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,060
Just cut them up into large pieces.

507
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,190
Add the vegetables...

508
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,360

509
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,380
The master is also starting to hasten the—

510
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,730
Add it whole.

511
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,760
We'll make it a dashima broth... 
  (Kelp base broth)

512
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,160
Add the ramen... Add embellishment...

513
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,630
Then take the refreshing broth...

514
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:42,670
Okay, we'll film you tasting each other's now.

515
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:47,150
We'll have Chef John taste the master's first.

516
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:49,660
The taste of the ocean is very rich.

517
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:53,070
The noodles are so chewy. It's the best.

518
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,610
Sounds of exclamation slip out as soon as I take a bite.

519
00:30:56,610 --> 00:31:00,470
Look forward to which Master will be introduced next week.

520
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:03,120
That's it for today's Ramen Chef.

521
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,720
Cut! Good job!

522
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,380
 Good job, everyone!

523
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,820
- Good job! 
 - Good work.

524
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,930
Senior, this is going to be a hit.

525
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:14,490
You totally killed it!

526
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,520
The viewer rating is bound to go up.

527
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,880
You also said last week's penis fish would be a big hit.

528
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,450
Senior, supporting directors learn it's a virtue

529
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,300
to give unconditional support and encouragement

530
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:28,030
to the lonely journey of the main director.

531
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,660
Sure, I'm sorry.

532
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,940
I'm sorry, Sang Woo...

533
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,800
I'm sorry.

534
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:40,320
Sang Woo! Let's shoot the mud-flat scenery.

535
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,170
Okay! I'll get going.

536
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,900
Good work. Wait for me! Wait for me.

537
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,680
Sure.

538
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,890
Let's go.

539
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:14,110
My goodness, so cute.

540
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:18,450
 Older women are cost-effective.

541
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:21,490
 You don't know much yet,

542
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:25,410
 but when you're too lazy for a relationship and you just want "some,"

543
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,810
 meet an older woman.

544
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:30,360
But... why?

545
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,400
Older women aren't bothersome to men.

546
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,650
 They play well alone and are good at using money.

547
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:40,020
And once in a while, you also learn a thing or two from conversing with them.

548
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,200
 Wow, what a useful tip!

549
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:47,930
 Anyway, how far did you go with PD Goo Yeo Reum?

550
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,740
 - How far? 
 - Yes.

551
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:55,960
Well, I could've slept with her, but I didn't go that far.

552
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,890
 I... only sleep with women I'm curious about.

553
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,600
 Wow, you're really cool.

554
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:06,270
 Do some squats. You can be cool, too.

555
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,130
Senior! Senior!

556
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,580
Senior! There's big trouble!

557
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,190
Why? What is it now?

558
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,070
We lost the drone camera.

559
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,820
Hey, we rented that for 300,000 won!

560
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,360
Senior... and the memory chip we filmed today with...

561
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,540
that is inside the drone.

562
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,440
If we can't find it, we'll need to refilm everything...

563
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,960
What?

564
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,790
I'm sorry.

565
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,530
Take a good look.

566
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:48,270
Where could it be...

567
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:50,290
I'm going nuts.

568
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,680
- Hey, Sang Woo. 
 - Yes?

569
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,050
Isn't that the drone?

570
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:02,570
- Where? 
 - Over there. It is, right?

571
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:05,320
Th-That's a mud flat!

572
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,170
Whoa, Senior!

573
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,260
What do we do?

574
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,530
♫  Everybody dance on top  ♫

575
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,740
♫  Whoo, whoo, whoo  ♫

576
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:20,050
♫  Dance, whoo, whoo, whoo  ♫

577
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:21,660
PD Goo!

578
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:27,880
Whoa, be careful!

579
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,220
Senior, be careful!

580
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:41,770
♫  Twinkle, twinkle little stars are so cool  ♫

581
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:44,050
♫  Dance  ♫

582
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:29,440
 Goo Yeo Reum! Goo Yeo Reum!

583
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,790
Check the file first.

584
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,920
The file's fine.

585
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:41,220
Thank god.

586
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,030
Oh, thank god!

587
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:49,570
 Goo Yeo Reum! Goo Yeo Reum! Goo Yeo Reum!

588
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,960
Goo Yeo Reum!

589
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:00,480
Yeo Reum!

590
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,880
I brought some dog grass!

591
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,090
You're pleased to see me, huh?

592
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,130
I'm here!

593
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,600
Who is he?

594
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,620
What is he doing here?

595
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,650
That little...

596
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,510
What's with your condition?

597
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:28,140
Everyone else looks fine. Why are you the only one like this?

598
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,270
You should just go.

599
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,790
You told me to pick you up.

600
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:35,000
I came all the way here to escort you back. What's with your attitude?

601
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,250
Oh, I was in a bit of a rush.

602
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,630
I'll get going first!

603
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:45,700
- Good job! 
 - Good job.

604
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:07,070
You went through the trouble to come all the way here...

605
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,720
but did you have to humiliate me like this?

606
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,230
No, I didn't mean to...

607
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:17,170
Wait, Yeo Reum. I was wrong. I'm sorry.

608
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,750
Let's go home together.

609
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,440
Your clothes are like this, too.

610
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,140
Let go.

611
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,750
Yeo Reum!

612
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:08,490

613
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:11,690

614
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,120

615
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,130

616
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:49,870
Oh, gosh.

617
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,180
It wasn't even a big deal.

618
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,410

619
00:38:58,410 --> 00:38:59,690
Yeah.

620
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:02,820
 Brother, where are you? Mom told you to come to the center.

621
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,290
I'm busy right now. Hang up.

622
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:07,430
Wait! You know Mom's in low spirits these days, right?

623
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:10,510
Don't get on her nerves and just stop by.

624
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:12,160
 I'll be expecting you to come.

625
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,430
 You need to come, okay?

626
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:34,720
I can't decide which one will be better.

627
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,930
Mom?

628
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:42,640
- Oh, you're here? 
 -  Brother, you're here?

629
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,300
What are you two doing?

630
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,700
I'm helping her decide which picture to put on the poster.

631
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:01,020
Just choose anything. They're all the same.

632
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:04,170
You call that advice?

633
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,700
Did you just hit me out of the blue?

634
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,200
The artist poured their breath and spirit into drawing this.

635
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,830
What do you mean, "just" choose anything? Just?

636
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:15,310
You're the one "just" living however you want!

637
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:18,580
Gosh, our mother's so prickly today.

638
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,150
Well, I mean...

639
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,800
Use the one on the right for the poster.

640
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,790
Why? Why the right one?

641
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:32,850
These are a series,

642
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,700
but the one on the right keeps drawing your attention.

643
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,940
What the... You act like a fool,

644
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,630
but you're making some sense all of a sudden.

645
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:45,820
Father liked this artist's work.

646
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,200
Why is it so hard to see your face?

647
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,480
When we live under the same Seoul sky.

648
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,100
We message each other every day.

649
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,710
You haven't forgotten about your blind date at noon, right?

650
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,350
When did I agree?

651
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:13,850
I told you I'm not going on any blind dates!

652
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,430
When did you ever?

653
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,800
You said you don't stop women from leaving or coming.

654
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,130
I told you I don't do blind dates, though!

655
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:22,720
Oh, so you have preferences, too?

656
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,570
I thought you met with just about anyone.

657
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:27,430
It's good manners to refuse women who come seriously

658
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:30,540
on the premise of marriage in the first place.

659
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,390
Did you age through your ass?

660
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,960
You're almost a 40-year-old mid-elderly.

661
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,160
How long are you going to live that carefreely?

662
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,690
Did you go through something today?

663
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:40,430
And what do you mean mid-elderly?

664
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:42,810
Mom, I just turned 37 years old!

665
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:45,740
Yeah, Mom. How is Brother a mid-elderly?

666
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,310
You went too far.

667
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:49,110
Then is your brother in his youth?

668
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:53,500
Not exactly in his youth, but mid-elderly is a bit extreme.

669
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,070
Middle-aged is more like it.

670
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,480
That's more annoying.

671
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,090
She's a gentle young lady, so go and show some good manners.

672
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,470
I told you I don't like blind dates.

673
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:30,760
No way...

674
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,930
is she not home yet?

675
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:37,460
Gosh, I was just playing around.

676
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:51,270
Goo Yeo Reum, are you on your way to editing?

677
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:55,100
Hey, why didn't you pick up your phone— Hey, why are you ignoring my calls?

678
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,830
Do you know me?

679
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:01,180
A stranger keeps talking to me.

680
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,770
Hey, come on. I was just playing around.

681
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:06,600
It wasn't funny to me.

682
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,510
I mean, was it that humiliating that I wore some joggers and drove a truck?

683
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:12,870
Why are you materialistic?

684
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:19,760
Fine. I'm materialistic.

685
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,230
If a man who looked well off picked me up...

686
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:25,770
I thought I would feel less humiliated in front of John Jang, so I asked you a favor.

687
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:28,190
It wasn't even that hard, but you couldn't even do that for me?

688
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,820
That's what I don't understand.

689
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:32,900
Who the hell is John Jang that you're trying to look good in front of him?

690
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,760
It's not that I want to look good in front of him!

691
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,590
Seriously...

692
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,470
You don't even know.

693
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,280
Hey, what's wrong? Are you crying?

694
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,950
I just feel so petty.

695
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,970
I don't care if I'm not in a relationship...

696
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:59,790
My life is busy and exhausting enough without that stuff...

697
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:01,360
But...

698
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:05,750
I just feel shabby sometimes.

699
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,670
After I reached a certain age,

700
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:13,230
there was no one who liked me.

701
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:16,770
And that made me feel like I was flawed.

702
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:22,540
Why are you digging yourself into a hole?

703
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,440
When your "some" comes to an end, acting nonchalant is difficult.

704
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,090
Trying to look good for a man makes me feel cheap, too.

705
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:35,970
Working hard, trying,

706
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:38,050
and having expectations...

707
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,090
makes me feel unattractive.

708
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,900
So just do it lightly.

709
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,790
Take the easy road.

710
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:59,860
Either have light flings with men,

711
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:02,040
or just don't meet them at all if you can't.

712
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,930
If it's not a really good man, there's no need to meet anyone else.

713
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:08,340
Why do you try so hard with such ambiguous bastards?

714
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:19,000
Since no one tries hard with me.

715
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,190
At some point,

716
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,340
no one is curious about me anymore.

717
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:35,210
You wouldn't know how this feels.

718
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:51,760
God...

719
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:45,080

720
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:56,770
Excuse me!

721
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:59,160
Are you okay? Someone call 911.

722
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,600
 Yeah, that's good.

723
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,820
 Emergency? 
 - Are you okay?

724
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,740
 There was an accident, and the person is unconscious.

725
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,650
 Please hurry over to the intersection at...

726
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:09,150
 Is he hurt anywhere else?

727
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:23,080

728
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,800
Nice to meet you.

729
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:31,970
Now, I'm going to... start the filler procedure.

730
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:33,840
It's going to sting.

731
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:47,820
You're all accomplices.

732
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:50,630
Hey, Goo Yeo Reum, what's wrong with our truck?

733
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:53,130
I think it has vintage swag to it.

734
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:57,030
Honey, do you think that swag will have an effect on John Jang?

735
00:47:57,030 --> 00:48:01,320
I'm the one at fault for having the slightest expectation of

736
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,810
Park Jae Hoon's function as a man.

737
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:07,350
Jae Hoon's manly function is actually incredible.

738
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:11,000
I went to wake him up a few days ago. And inside his pants stood waiting...

739
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:15,200
Honey!

740
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:19,550
We're not talking about that function right now!

741
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,610
Yeah?

742
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:31,250
It's my fault, my fault, and my fault again.

743
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:33,580
Cheer up.

744
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:35,820
You want more black beans?

745
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:38,200
Forget it. I don't want any.

746
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,290
- Hey, Dae Shik. 
  - Hey, Jae Hoon,

747
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:55,170
we were pulverized because of you.

748
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:58,050
Yeo Reum was there? What did she say?

749
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:00,980
Geez, man. You should've gotten dressed up!

750
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,800
How desperate must Yeo Reum have been to ask you that favor?

751
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,230
I was just playing around, but she— Gosh.

752
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:07,400
Playing—

753
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,170
Hey, Park Jae Hoon!

754
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:12,090
That John Jang or ssamjang, the ridiculous bastard 
  (Fermented soybean sauce.)

755
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:14,840
said our Yeo Reum was cost-effective.

756
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,500
 He said having "some" with older women,

757
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:20,390
is extremely cost-effective because they're good at spending money and aren't bothersome!

758
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:22,960
He said that about Yeo Reum?

759
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:47,710
I heard you're very busy.

760
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:50,030
Did you set time aside to come here?

761
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:51,530
Pardon?

762
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,360
Oh, yes. Yes...

763
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:58,530
Then for lunch... The brunch menu here is nice.

764
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:01,560
You should eat something and...

765
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,490
It's okay.

766
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:09,150
If you're a cosmetic surgeon, you must have very high standards.

767
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:12,070
And you must see a lot of pretty women.

768
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:16,590
Rather than pretty women, I meet a lot of women who want to become pretty.

769
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:20,410
That's true.

770
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:38,020
I heard you even graduated first in medical school.

771
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:39,740
And your father is also a medical school professor.

772
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,640
You must take after your father's intelligence.

773
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:45,740
Father... was a professor.

774
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:48,460
He passed away.

775
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:51,330
You must not have known that.

776
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:53,750
Oh... I had no idea.

777
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:56,120
I don't specialize in cosmetic surgery, either.

778
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,240
I carry my medical license and move from place to place.

779
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:03,390
To put it simply, I'm a part-timer.

780
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,100
I don't care about those things.

781
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,540
Why not? Of course, you need to measure specs.

782
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:14,070
I think you could meet a way better man than me.

783
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:18,350
Look at the time.

784
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:20,770
I'll leave first.

785
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:22,800
It was nice to meet you.

786
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,510
Please charge this card.

787
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:37,090
I'll pay for the coffee.

788
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:41,060
No. I think you were dragged out to this meeting.

789
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:43,060
It's on me.

790
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:55,370
I'm sorry, but if you're going to embarrass someone like this,

791
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:58,370
just don't come out next time.

792
00:51:58,370 --> 00:52:01,830
When a blind date is set, I'm curious about who I'll end up meeting,

793
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:05,370
and I harbor expectations that this man might be my soulmate.

794
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:08,370
I put effort into what I'd wear for the past couple of days,

795
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:11,440
and in order to look pretty to you, who I've never even seen before,

796
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,250
I went to the shop early in the morning to do my makeup and hair.

797
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:15,830
That's how I came out to this meeting.

798
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:17,800
You think you were to my liking?

799
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:21,290
This man that's sitting in front of me in joggers,

800
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:24,310
might happen to be a good person,

801
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:29,780
and he might... be a suitable person for me,

802
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:36,590
so I did my best to keep an open mind and get to know you.

803
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,780
Excuse me, Han Ji Yeon!

804
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,570
I'm sorry. I was rude.

805
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:05,980
If I might explain, today's blind date was set by my mother one-sidedly.

806
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:08,150
I just found out last night.

807
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:09,890
Your excuse is cliche.

808
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:12,450
Yes, you might hear it as an obvious excuse,

809
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:14,720
but it's the truth.

810
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,900
You provided your valuable time,

811
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,900
so I'm sorry.

812
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:23,080
Thank you for the coffee.

813
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,960
Take care.

814
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,100
Look at this. Oh, my gosh!

815
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:40,780
This is too extreme.

816
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:42,660
Gosh.

817
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:46,350
Look at her weird expression.

818
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:47,730
What's so funny?

819
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:50,920
A celeb I like posted a funny photo.

820
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,860
A funny photo?

821
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:56,680
Her front teeth are...

822
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:04,930

823
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:16,770
PD Goo, this is today's film concept.

824
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:18,920
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

825
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,160
- Yeah. 
 - Goo Yeo Reum, where are you right now?

826
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,260
Why? I'm working.

827
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:28,670
Are you on your way to film?

828
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:31,100
What are you filming this time?

829
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:34,020
Soy sauce ramen, why?

830
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,190
Soy sauce ramen?

831
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:38,460
Where are you going to film that?

832
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:12,450
- There are quite a lot of jars. 
 - Yes.

833
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:15,990
- We're the 9th generation of a 350-year tradition. 
 - Oh, I see.

834
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:20,950
Ma'am, we're just going to get a brief sketch of you introducing your soy sauce.

835
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:24,860
We boil it every week during the winter solstice and ferment it for three months,

836
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:27,240
and we do this once a year on New Year's month.

837
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,280
We'll start filming now. Everyone, fighting!

838
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:32,340
Cue!

839
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:35,340
Today, we have a soy sauce master with us.

840
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:37,930
What ingredients have you prepared?

841
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:49,810
Maybe it's because of the quality, but it smells so nice.

842
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:51,870
The ramen is complete.

843
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:54,930
We'll get an insert of the completed dishes.

844
00:55:58,090 --> 00:55:59,630
Ramen Chef.

845
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:00,970
Cut!

846
00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:03,980
Good job!

847
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:05,300
- Thank you! 
 - Good job.

848
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,360
Anyone who's hungry should. Good job.

849
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,140
Today's film was really...

850
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:10,400
What the?

851
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,040
My necklace.

852
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,620
Huh?

853
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,300
- Where did my necklace go? 
 - Good job.

854
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,590
What's wrong?

855
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:19,440
My necklace disappeared.

856
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,820
Man, my necklace!

857
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:24,110
I'm going nuts.

858
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:25,500
What's wrong with Chef John?

859
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,770
He lost his sponsored designer necklace.

860
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:29,190
Good for him.

861
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:33,080
But he thinks he dropped it in a soy sauce pot.

862
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,010
You don't think it might cause a problem with the soy sauce, do you?

863
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:37,310
No way.

864
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:40,950
He didn't drop it in their old soy sauce jar, did he?

865
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,180
Senior, I can do it.

866
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,930
It's a seven-year-old soy sauce.

867
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:57,450
We need to find it in one try, so I'll do it.

868
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:36,970
That's my necklace! Amazing!

869
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:39,640
PD Goo,

870
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:41,970
incredible!

871
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:44,160
This is really expensive.

872
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,450
Seriously, what's wrong with him?

873
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:02,300
Sis, I really love you!

874
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:05,130
God, I love you.

875
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:13,300
Sis, if you don't have any other plans, do you want to eat dinner with me?

876
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:17,040
I didn't find it for you because I like you.

877
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,430
I found it because I didn't want to ruin their soy sauce.

878
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:21,580
Anyhow, it doesn't change the fact that I'm grateful.

879
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:24,710
I'll buy you something delicious.

880
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:29,070
Chef John,

881
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,030
I heard everything.

882
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:33,300
Heard what?

883
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,150
You should be careful when you're wearing a mic.

884
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:38,750
Any one of the staff might be able to hear you.

885
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:40,910
I don't know what you're talking about.

886
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:45,830
Meeting an older woman is cost-effective.

887
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:48,240
I heard everything.

888
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:52,490
Sis, you see what I meant is...

889
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:54,830
Men speak comfortably when they're alone.

890
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:56,130
No need to make excuses.

891
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:57,660
And don't call me Sis.

892
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,220
I'm not that chill of a person,

893
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:03,900
so let's just save face with each other. Okay?

894
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,600
Honestly, it's not like I'm wrong.

895
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,780
To put it bluntly. You also enjoyed playing around with me.

896
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:19,230
We both enjoyed our time with no strings attached.

897
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:22,540
That's called being cost-effective.

898
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,200
Dating and cost-effectiveness shouldn't be used in the same context.

899
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:43,430
Wait!  Were you actually trying to become legitimate with me?

900
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:50,050
You liked me?

901
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:17,010

902
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,980
Get out of the way. You're blocking the road.

903
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:31,140
We're in Korea, don't "hey" me.

904
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:33,240
Little Brother Joon Jeong,

905
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:36,790
- give me your phone. 
 - What?

906
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:39,440
I said, give me your phone.

907
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,710
Who the hell are you...

908
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:45,090
to ask for my phone?

909
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:46,920
You little...

910
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,670
Hand it over.

911
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:53,490
Why?

912
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:56,660
Hurry up and give it to me.

913
01:00:57,370 --> 01:00:59,540
That's what I thought.

914
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:03,530
Gosh, this isn't right.

915
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:05,070
Don't infringe on her portrait rights.

916
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:07,690
Upload your face.

917
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:09,870
And...

918
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:12,240
treat PD Goo Yeo Reum with respect.

919
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,710
If you act up one more time, I'll...

920
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,370
- Did you serve in the military? 
 - Yes.

921
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:20,950
You have the right posture.

922
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:23,010
Manly!

923
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:31,360
Hey, what's going on?

924
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:32,580
Let's just go for now.

925
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:33,860
You're hungry, right?

926
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,480
Should we eat Korean beef rib eye?

927
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:36,820
I said, what's going on?

928
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:39,850
With me? I'm your knight in shining armor!

929
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:44,430
Come here.

930
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:47,360
Is his voice always this loud?

931
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,380
It must've been tough.

932
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:52,110
Who the hell are you?

933
01:01:52,110 --> 01:01:55,810
Who are you to suddenly appear and cause a ruckus?

934
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:57,560
What relationship do you two have?

935
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,420
Are you lovers?

936
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:06,090
Me?

937
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,070
I'm just some guy who's trying his best to look good to her. Why?

938
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:17,070
I don't do things like "some.

939
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:20,170
Especially...

940
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:22,740
not with someone I'm curious about, like her.

941
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,670
Never.

942
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:31,530
♫  What can make me flutter in the wind like this  ♫

943
01:02:31,530 --> 01:02:36,550
♫  Carrying pink imaginations between the two of us  ♫

944
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:39,570
♫  I don't even blink  ♫

945
01:02:39,570 --> 01:02:43,910
♫  I can't believe this feeling  ♫

946
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:52,100
♫  You gently blow into my bleak daily life  ♫

947
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:59,090
♫  In the flow, something changed.  Oh stop it, no!  ♫

948
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:04,190
♫  The wind, called you, blew right in and shook me up again  ♫

949
01:03:04,190 --> 01:03:09,290
♫  Awakening my half-disappeared senses, 
 responding busily in anticipation of what was to come  ♫

950
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:12,550
♫  Even if you stop  ♫

951
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:15,250
♫  I will stand next to you and feel you  ♫

952
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:18,400

953
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,950
 You don't do things like "some"?

954
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:22,670
 - Especially with a woman like me? 
 - Your heart fluttered, didn't it?

955
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:24,760
 You must have almost fallen for me.

956
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:27,900
 I must always display the appearance of a ready single.

957
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:30,860
 - Okay? 
 - Goo Yeo Reum, you really like unique things.

958
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:32,170
 Yeo Reum has bad luck.

959
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:33,580
 Who was it again? In Woo.

960
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:35,590
 - Was that bastard just an ex? 
 - Yeo Reum.

961
01:03:35,590 --> 01:03:37,360
 Our Yeo Reum sincerely loved him, but—

962
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:38,700
 Let's not talk about Kim In Woo.

963
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:40,550
 Am I a handball for you to play with?

964
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:43,620
 If someone really great shows up, that's a different story.

965
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:45,550
 Just play with me until then.

966
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:49,900
♫  Say something that makes sense and wait  ♫
