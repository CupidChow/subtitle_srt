1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:08,950

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,700

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,770
♫  Dive with you, towards the wide sea  ♫

4
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,070

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:24,070
♫  Jump in love, I fly with wings called you  ♫

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,080

♫  There is nothing to be afraid of  ♫

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,010
♫  In the world called you, it sparkles and lingers here  ♫

8
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:36,720
♫  What I found while wandering was you who 
 was always by my side  ♫

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,270
♫  I'm already ready for you  ♫

10
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,050

11
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,150

12
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,920

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,740
 Jae Hoon.

14
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,890
 Park Jae Hoon!

15
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,760
 Hey, can you open the door?

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,320
 I know you're in there.

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,180
 I'm not leaving until you come out.

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,640
 Park Jae Hoon!

19
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,440
 What do you want?

20
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,010
 Let's have a little talk.

21
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,810
 Talk from there.

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,300
 How long are you going to be like this, huh?

23
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,650
 You should think about Hyeon Soo and your mother, too.

24
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,910
 Are you here to nag at me?

25
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,060
 Then just leave.

26
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,280
 Hey, wait! All right, all right.

27
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,330
 - You should move into the house above me. 
 - What?

28
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,560
 - What? 
 - It's been vacated recently, so the owner's looking for new tenants.

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,970
 It faces south, so there's plenty of sunlight.

30
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,000
 And you'll have private access to the rooftop.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,170
 It was fully renovated recently, too.

32
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,770
 Four hundred million won deposit and a monthly rent of 500,000 won.

33
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,100
 If I put in a good word, the owner might give you a discount.

34
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,000
 Why would I move in above you?

35
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,070
 I heard you quit the hospital.

36
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:50,150
 There's no need for you to live here now.

37
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,340
 Whatever. Just move to my neighborhood.

38
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,150
 Dae Shik and Hye Jin are nearby, too.

39
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,040
 Come out of that dark room now.

40
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,060
 Step on the grass, let the sun bathe your skin, and get some wind in your lungs.

41
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,080
 Try to live like a human.

42
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,500
 It's hard to find a listing this good.

43
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,120
 The owner said she'll take a 400 million deposit and rent of 300,000 won.

44
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,110
 So, grab your signature seal and get your butt over here.

45
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,940

46
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,020
 All right!

47
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:54,970
 The grass in the front yard is so green.

48
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,980
 Get a move on!

49
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,160
 - Move it! 
 - Yeo Reum chose the perfect day to move.

50
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,670
 The weather's great!

51
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,830
 It's so sunny!

52
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,280
 Jae Hoon!

53
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,450
 Park Jae Hoon!

54
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,190
 Here. It's good for constipation.

55
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,130
 Make sure to eat some.

56
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,630
 Park Jae Hoon!

57
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,040
 Jae Hoon!

58
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,680
 Come on and eat it.

59
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,000
 - Wipe it. 
 - You have it worse.

60
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,010
 Is this a house or a cave?

61
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,950
 A person should photosynthesize, you know?

62
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,920
 I whipped this up with Mom's vegetables.

63
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,590
 Here.

64
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,450
 Say, "Ah." Open.

65
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,460
 How is it? Is it good?

66
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,460

67
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:31,500

68
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,740

69
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,450
 The bride and groom look so good together.

70
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,910
 - Congratulations!  
 - Thanks.

71
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,060
Father!

72
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,240
Mother!

73
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,350
- Yeo Reum is getting married! 
 - I know!

74
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,330
See you later!

75
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,400
- Welcome. 
 - Welcome.

76
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,390
 PD Goo Yeo Reum, congratulations on your wedding!

77
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,180
- You look so pretty today. 
 - I agree. You're a goddess.

78
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,770
Have a happy life!

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,180
One more time, one more time.

80
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,000
Stop that!

81
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,290
There you go again.

82
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,740
Are we good?

83
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,910
Our high school alumni prepared this separately.

84
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,760
- Stop it. 
 - Come on, just take it!

85
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,120
Take it and use it well.

86
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,690
Thank you!

87
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,790
Oh, so pretty!

88
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,860
Looking good!

89
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,510
- Thanks, Dae Shik! 
 - Okay! See you later!

90
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,430
- See you later! 
 - So pretty!

91
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,500
- PD Goo, hello. 
 - You're here?

92
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,000
PD Goo!

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,280
PD Goo, I'll make you look like a movie star in your wedding video,

94
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,050
so just give me some good poses.

95
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,260
Senior, I asked the lighting team a favor

96
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,950
and borrowed their reflection pad.

97
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,140
It's only used for actresses.

98
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,820
I'll be holding this as you walk down the aisle, too.

99
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,440
Oh, gosh. Seriously.

100
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,980
You don't need to go this far!

101
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,150
- Pose, pose! 
 - Pose?

102
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,070
I'm not good at poses...

103
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,510
- Whoa! 
 - As expected.

104
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,640
Here come my hearts.

105
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,460
Senior, I'm going to interview the guests now.

106
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,630
- Congratulations on your wedding. 
 - Thank you!

107
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,690
- Congrats, congrats! 
 - Thank you for coming!

108
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,310
- Thank you! See you later. 
 - Okay.

109
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,620
Who are you...

110
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,520
I don't think we've met before.

111
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,970
Please give us some privacy.

112
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,650
Hello.

113
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,490
I'm Jo Ri Eun.

114
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,020
I came because I have something I must tell you.

115
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:49,010
I'm pregnant with Kim In Woo's baby.

116
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,950
What do you—

117
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:58,440
I wasn't officially dating In Woo.

118
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,940
And I'm not trying to grab him by the pant leg because of the baby.

119
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,900
I just...

120
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,430
wanted to tell you before the wedding...

121
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:12,780
that I'm going to have the baby and raise it.

122
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,840
You make the choice whether you can marry a man

123
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,350
who has a baby out-of-wedlock.

124
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,030
Explain this to me.

125
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,440
Yeo Reum...

126
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,410
you see...

127
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,990
When did you know about this?

128
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,390
A few days ago.

129
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,380
For how long were you going to keep it from me?

130
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,420
I was going to tell you,

131
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,940
but I was also very shocked and I just couldn't believe it.

132
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,320
So I didn't know how to tell you...

133
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,050
I couldn't bring myself to tell you.

134
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,750
You call that an excuse?

135
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,910
You were going to proceed with the wedding while hiding a secret as big as this? Huh?

136
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,010
She suddenly sought me out at work.

137
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,400
We weren't even in a relationship.

138
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,170
It was just one night.

139
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,320
I had never even imagined it.

140
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,710
So I didn't know what to do.

141
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,620
I... I'm sorry.

142
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,090
You think that's going to cut it?

143
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,080
I was going to tell you right after the wedding.

144
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,200
I couldn't make you fall into a mess, too.

145
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,870
- That's why I couldn't tell you. 
 - A few days ago!

146
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,960
The moment you found out. That's when you should've told me.

147
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,040
I'm sorry.

148
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,960
I can't get married.

149
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,510
I said I can't marry you.

150
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,620
Yeo Reum, please...

151
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,950
We have ten minutes left until the wedding.

152
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:52,720
You shouldn't have made me hear this ten minutes before the wedding!

153
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,040
You should've told me yourself.

154
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,770
Yeo Reum!

155
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,970
Please think objectively about this.

156
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,020
Let's talk about this after the wedding.

157
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,920
Whatever it may be, I'll do what you want me to do.

158
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,090
So let's just have the wedding for now.

159
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,460
Think about our parents.

160
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,880
And what about the guests?

161
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,170
Let's think about this calmly... after the wedding is over.

162
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,170
A wedding is...

163
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,340
about making vows in front of people.

164
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,580
That we'll trust and love each other until the end.

165
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,800
Are you someone like that to me?

166
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,120
Can I trust your vows?

167
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,810
I'm...

168
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,880
I'm so bewildered right now

169
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,550
and I think something's gone extremely wrong.

170
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:48,450
I can't lie in front of everyone just because of my parents and to save face.

171
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,710
- Park Jae Hoon? 
 - Kang Chae Ri?

172
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,940
I can't believe I bump into you even at this place.

173
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,580
How do you know Goo Yeo Reum?

174
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,400
We're friends.

175
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,730
I'm her colleague.

176
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,530
Now that I think about it, you said you're the PD of "Kingdom of Love," right?

177
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,320
PD Goo Yeo Reum is also on our team. Under me.

178
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,310
She joined Season 2 recently.

179
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,180
I didn't know that.

180
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,850
Tomorrow is the first shoot.

181
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:55,590
She's got a killer sense about settling on her wedding date.

182
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,510
- Jae Hoon! 
 - Hey.

183
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,500
Have you seen Yeo Reum?

184
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,680
I just got here. What about Yeo Reum?

185
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,320
It's time for the ceremony, but she suddenly disappeared.

186
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,970
The groom also disappeared with her!

187
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,220
I don't have a good feeling about this.

188
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:24,180
Yeo Reum!

189
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,290
Hey...

190
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,720
Why is she up there?

191
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,460
I don't know.

192
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,170
Guests,

193
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,600
I'm sorry.

194
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,760
I'm canceling today's...

195
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,900
wedding.

196
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,900
 They're canceling it?

197
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,390
 What's she talking about?

198
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,790
I'm calling off the wedding.

199
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,590
Oh, my. Oh, my! Honey...

200
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,530
What will they do?

201
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,040
 How can they do this?

202
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,610
Calling off the wedding?

203
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,820
 Why is she doing this?

204
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,460
 What's happening?

205
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,980
- Hey, hey, hey! 
 - Honey, catch her!

206
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,630
Daughter!

207
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:30,030
Wait here for a moment. I'll bring the car.

208
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,270
Where should we go?

209
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,690
You want me to take you to your house in Chuncheon?

210
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:42,760
I can't go anywhere.

211
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,810
I just want to disappear.

212
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,760
Is this what you wanted?

213
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,180
Out of all days...

214
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,590
you chose the day that should've been the happiest...

215
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,760
to go as far as to hurt the bride!

216
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,230
Did you have to do this?

217
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:32,610
You could've at least contacted me sooner.

218
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,710
I lost the timing...

219
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,860
because of my pride.

220
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,620
I'm sorry for not having contacted you...

221
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,400
sooner.

222
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,110
I wanted to take sole responsibility.

223
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,570
I didn't want to contact you, either.

224
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:53,510
I didn't want it to seem like I was holding onto a man I didn't love

225
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:56,050
because of an accidental pregnancy.

226
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,530
But...

227
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,130
when I heard about your wedding,

228
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,590
I just couldn't stay put.

229
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:09,640
I chose my baby.

230
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,020
And informing the two of you...

231
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,390
about my decision...

232
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,120
before the wedding, at least...

233
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,540
seemed like the best I could do.

234
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,890
Here.

235
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,080
Yes, Mother.

236
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,860
Yeo Reum is with me right now.

237
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,570
I'm letting you know so you won't worry.

238
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:52,020
Yes, all right.

239
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,600
Okay.

240
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,970
Dr. Park!

241
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:00,860
Did you steal the bride away from the man she was going to marry?

242
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,060
It's not like that.

243
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,710
Yeah, right. That's exactly what this looks like.

244
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,810
It would've been better if that was the case.

245
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,580
Gosh.

246
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,970
I gave her clothes she can change into.

247
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:14,060
I gave her my daughter's old clothes, but I'm not sure if they'll fit her.

248
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,660
Thank you, Boss.

249
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,110
It looked like she was walking toward the beach by herself.

250
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,520
You should go. She might jump in the water.

251
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,960
Okay.

252
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,420
I spoke with your mom.

253
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,980
I told her you're with me.

254
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:46,920
Can someone... be this humiliated...

255
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:52,370
and still go on living like nothing happened?

256
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,510
It's my life, so I'm fine, but...

257
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,860
I'm just so sorry... to my parents.

258
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,670
I need to start shooting tomorrow, but

259
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,540
how can I retreat with them for one month?

260
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,270
Forget about going to work. I just want to run away.

261
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:23,560
The company will think I'm nuts if I ask for leave, right?

262
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,930
Why would you ask for leave? Over something like this?

263
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,560
Many people get married and divorced multiple times in this day in age.

264
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,320
So what if you called off a wedding?

265
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,120
People are... not as interested in others' affairs as you think.

266
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,820
It's going to be noisy for a moment, and they'll whisper behind your back for a while.

267
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,730
But that's all.

268
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,150
You didn't do anything wrong

269
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,970
and there's no reason for you to feel humiliated, Yeo Reum.

270
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,160
I did do something wrong.

271
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,590
I was too confident that I knew him.

272
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:56,730
And I rushed my decision to get married.

273
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,910
I...

274
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,990
did everything wrong.

275
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,600
Yeo Reum, you... chose a man who treated you with sincerity.

276
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,620
Don't question the sincerity you recognized in him.

277
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:20,010
The situation just happened to turn out this way.

278
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,740
Dr. Park! Have some food!

279
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,120
Go ahead.

280
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,110
Let's go and eat.

281
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,400
Say, "Ah."

282
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,260
- I can't. 
 - Say, "Ah."

283
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,140
Eat it.

284
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,440
Don't give me more. I'm not eating.

285
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,100
I don't have an appetite.

286
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,900
- You eat it. 
 - "Ah."

287
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,920
Say, "Ah."

288
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,360
Eat.

289
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,650
Give it to me. I'll eat it.

290
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,650
Eat it.

291
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,740
There you go. Good girl!

292
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,300
You hang on by eating.

293
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,470
All right?

294
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,910
This?

295
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,230
You got to eat well.

296
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:17,350
Okay! Take care.

297
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:26,530

298
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,410

299
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,710

300
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:33,250
God, they're all so mean.

301
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,200
What's wrong, Honey? Why are you mad? What is it?

302
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,130
Our high school alumni!

303
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,730
They're having a blast talking about Yeo Reum.

304
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:43,920
They pretend to be worried, but they're enjoying her misery!

305
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,280
Humans are all like that. Don't get too worked up.

306
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,110
I couldn't stand it, so I left the group chat. Gosh!

307
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,760
What about Yeo Reum?

308
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,990
Still no call from her?

309
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,430
Yeah.

310
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:59,360
You don't have an inkling? About what happened?

311
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,100
I have no idea.

312
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:06,940
Anyhow, she's someone who makes clear judgments,

313
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,590
so there must have been a valid reason.

314
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,830
Let's wait until she contacts us.

315
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:14,970
Honey.

316
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,570
Yeah?

317
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,500
- I'm a bit regretful. 
 - Of what?

318
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,520
Listening to you is the right way to go.

319
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:26,420
Before, you suggested that we should match Yeo Reum and Jae Hoon.

320
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:31,340
- We should've. 
 - What's the point in regretting that now?

321
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,550
Would you like a cup of tea with me?

322
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,360
I have quite an unlucky fate.

323
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,310
When it was my youngest son's first birthday,

324
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,130
my husband passed away first

325
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:48,050
and I raised my two children by myself.

326
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:50,500
After I worked hard all my life

327
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,600
and married off my two children,

328
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,290
I thought I could start living my own life.

329
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:58,340
But I had a brain aneurysm.

330
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:02,010
My head felt like it was going to split open,

331
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:05,520
but I just endured it while taking pain medicine.

332
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:08,910
I ended up fainting on the street.

333
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:12,550
That's when Dr. Park saved me.

334
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,800
After I built this house, I asked him to come over.

335
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,440
I asked him to please come and visit.

336
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,160
I asked him multiple times,

337
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,930
but neurosurgeons are very busy.

338
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:28,340
Then one late night, he suddenly showed up.

339
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:32,310
He asked me if he could stay here for a while.

340
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:35,340
He wouldn't come out of his room

341
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:39,540
and only slept like a dead man for three months.

342
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,930
And today is the first time in years

343
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:45,980
he came back with you.

344
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:52,050
So, it was here.

345
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,070
When he went off the grid,

346
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,330
I was worried about where he disappeared to.

347
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:03,470
But it was here.

348
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,820
If I may ask,

349
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,840
you have someone as marvelous as him by your side.

350
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,470
You should've grabbed onto him and made him yours.

351
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:15,750
Why were you trying to marry someone else?

352
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:08,170

353
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,150
Yeo Reum.

354
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:29,320
Yeah.

355
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,250
Let's go home now.

356
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:41,180
You shouldn't stay here for too long.

357
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:51,400
I had run away... and hid for too long.

358
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:55,850
And then I forgot my way back...

359
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,520
to my old life.

360
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:04,690
But you're... different from me.

361
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:14,370
How am I... different from you?

362
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:21,490
You don't avoid a problem that's...

363
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,590
in front of your eyes.

364
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:31,180
You're someone who bravely decides everything

365
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,940
and takes responsibility until the end.

366
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,080
Let's go home.

367
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:50,680
I'll take you back to where you belong.

368
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,230
We'll leave now. Thank you for everything.

369
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,900
Come back when you have the time.

370
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,280
All right.

371
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,250
Thank you for everything.

372
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,750

373
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,600

374
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,470
 Senior, there's big trouble.

375
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,040

376
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,160
Yeah, Sang Woo.

377
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,350
What did you say?

378
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:51,040
All right, I'll be right there.

379
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,630
Yeah.

380
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,410
I need to get to work.

381
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,960
Why, what's wrong?

382
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,080
One of the cast members didn't show up.

383
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,450
The shoot starts this afternoon.

384
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:08,530
Gosh, I'm going nuts! Why is this happening, too?

385
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:24,280
Hey, Goo Yeo Reum!

386
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:29,960
Whether you call off a wedding or grill rice cakes, that's your problem.

387
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,920
The producer turns off her phone and goes off the grid on the day before the shoot?

388
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,570
Are you in your right mind? Who the hell are you?

389
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,500
I'm sorry.

390
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,260
What happened?

391
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:42,230
We got a call early this morning out of the blue.

392
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:45,230
The plastic surgeon who was supposed to appear

393
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,940
has been charged for administering propofol.

394
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,070
What?

395
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:52,340
We have less than three hours until the shoot. What should we do?

396
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,820
Didn't you properly look into the cast's background?

397
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:58,300
Did you slack off because you were busy preparing for your wedding?

398
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,790
Have you contacted the prospective candidates?

399
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:10,090
They all can't come?

400
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:12,120
There's someone who's available starting tomorrow,

401
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:16,930
but there isn't anyone... who can start today.

402
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:21,480
Find a replacement. Or I'm going to fire your entire staff.

403
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,090
Going off the grid the day before the shoot is my fault.

404
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:26,490
But why would you make my staff pay for this incident?

405
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:29,800
If you don't want your staff to take the fall, then resolve this.

406
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:35,080
I'll do whatever it takes... to find a replacement by the end of the day—

407
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,110
Who says you can find a replacement by end of the day with three hours left until the shoot?

408
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:41,890
All right. I'll resolve it before the shoot.

409
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:45,840
Bring your friend, Park Jae Hoon, instead of some random guy.

410
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,070
How do you know Jae Hoon?

411
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:53,770
A good-looking plastic surgeon who's over 180cm tall.

412
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:56,420
Without this element, the story will be messed up from day one.

413
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:01,120
If you don't want to ruin the program, grab him by the collar and drag him here.

414
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,400
How dare you come here?

415
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,780
Shit.

416
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,900
Bastard.

417
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,690
Don't you... ever show up in front of Yeo Reum again.

418
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:51,780
- Who are you... to tell me that? 
 - I'm Goo Yeo Reum's friend.

419
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,580
I'm her best friend, practically family, you son of a bitch!

420
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,820
We're not over yet.

421
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:58,870
- Where's Yeo Reum? 
 - Know when to stop!

422
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:02,100
Don't hurt Yeo Reum anymore and get lost.

423
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:06,320
I'm also... about to lose it.

424
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,730
I can't turn back time...

425
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:11,090
I can't hold onto her...

426
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:16,220
There's nothing I can do.

427
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,800
Everything's my fault,

428
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,100
but... everything I said...

429
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,100
my feelings...

430
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,270
they weren't lies.

431
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:32,800
It just pains me to think that Yeo Reum will...

432
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:37,710
think that everything was fake.

433
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,810
Take responsibility like a man.

434
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:45,330
If you dragged her into this situation,

435
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:49,700
then allow her to escape this situation as soon and as neatly as possible.

436
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,980
That's your final duty as a man.

437
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,120
Shit.

438
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,370

439
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:11,610
Senior. Here.

440
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:15,300
- What is this? 
 -  It's a list of plastic surgeons from the first round of interviews.

441
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,880
There are a total of three people.

442
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:25,310
If it just doesn't work out...

443
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,000
He's the most handsome one out of all my friends.

444
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,700
He's an acupuncture and herbal doctor.

445
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,680
We could use him as a last resort.

446
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,090
He's the most handsome one out of all your friends?

447
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:39,520
Yes.

448
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,330
You're more handsome.

449
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:45,370
You're better looking than he is.

450
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,760
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

451
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,630
Gosh, I need to reestablish my rank in the group with my friends.

452
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,200
Are you okay?

453
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,390
You must be troubled enough as it is.

454
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,700
But then this happens...

455
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:08,190
How great would it be if we could edit our lives as well?

456
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:12,590
We could neatly cut the painful and difficult parts out.

457
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:15,840
Fade out and skip over the boring parts.

458
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:20,160
But... life isn't like that.

459
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,670
We need to live everything out without cutting corners.

460
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:25,270
If we want to create an hour-long video,

461
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:28,850
we need to stick ourselves in the editing room for several nights.

462
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:32,330
Rather than cutting and pasting only the wonderful scenes,

463
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:36,210
I think it's better... to live out every second of our lives

464
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:39,040
without missing a single moment.

465
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,620
I'm going to stop by my house.

466
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,930
What about looking for a replacement?

467
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,390
I'll call you.

468
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:52,420
Tell the staff to stay on standby.

469
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,470
I'll see you later at the film location. Here.

470
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,080
I'm more handsome?

471
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,520
I don't need the receipt.

472
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,780
Thank you.

473
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:27,010
 Mom, it's me.

474
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:30,700
My daughter... did you eat?

475
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,490
Yeah, I ate. What about you?

476
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:35,810
 Mom and Dad ate, too.

477
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:39,000
With kimchi and rice in water.

478
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,360
Yeo Reum...

479
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:46,120
I'm sorry.

480
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:51,560
 For rushing... you to get married. I'm sorry.

481
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:55,670
My kind daughter...

482
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,550
I feel like you...

483
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:02,110
 rushed your decision to get married because of Dad...

484
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:04,250
so I'm miserable.

485
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:09,820
 Mom and Dad haven't done a single helpful thing for you.

486
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,460
We were just a burden to you.

487
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:16,320
 It breaks my heart.

488
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:35,860
 Mom, I'm really sad, too...

489
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:39,970
but I... don't regret calling off the wedding.

490
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:42,830
 It hurts now,

491
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:46,860
but I can become happy again at any given time.

492
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:50,600
So don't worry, okay?

493
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,700
 Mom and Dad are not my burden.

494
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:59,460
You're the ones who enabled me to believe my life will definitely be happy.

495
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:03,400
 The ones who raised me that way.

496
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,110
So don't ever say something like that again. Okay?

497
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,590
What's wrong with your face?

498
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,440
Kim In Woo was in front of the house.

499
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,680
I told him to get lost.

500
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,770
Did you want to meet him?

501
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,560
I need to see him at least once.

502
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,660
But today's not that day.

503
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,480
What about work? Did you resolve it?

504
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,680
- Jae Hoon... 
 - Yeah?

505
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,240
Come with me to someplace.

506
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,740
Sure.

507
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:42,730
- You don't know where. Why are you agreeing? 
 - Where is it?

508
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:44,730
To the film site of "Kingdom of Love."

509
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:46,370
You want me to drive you there?

510
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:48,540
I want you to appear in it.

511
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,050
Why would you ask me that?

512
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,050
I need you.

513
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:06,000
The main producer is Kang Chae Ri, and I have no authority.

514
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,510
Your reputation might plummet.

515
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:12,450
I'm in no situation to protect you, but...

516
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:18,350
I absolutely don't have the strength to last any longer.

517
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,400
So I need you.

518
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,150
Very much so.

519
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:28,550
I'll do it.

520
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:32,930
You're going... to star in it?

521
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:35,570
Yeah. I will.

522
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,870
Why are you agreeing so easily?

523
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:43,330
It's fine.

524
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:45,240
Let's go together.

525
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:54,090
You can move the planter here.

526
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:56,880
And the light... hold on. Next to the statue.

527
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,090
And the bench... yes.

528
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,810
All right, we're going to prepare for filming!

529
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:05,520
- Camera directors, please set up the cameras. 
 - Okay.

530
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,780
Oh, yes.

531
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,520
The cast's lodging have been arranged, right?

532
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,930
 Yes, they've been arranged.

533
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:25,190
Okay.

534
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:27,040
- Hello. 
  - Hello.

535
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,020
 Senior, hello.

536
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,220
Park Jae Hoon agreed?

537
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,610
Don't threaten me with my staff ever again.

538
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:49,980
If it happens again,

539
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,400
I'm going to submit a formal complaint to the company.

540
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,880
Sure.

541
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,610

542
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:16,740
Hello!

543
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,680
Hello.

544
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:24,650
We're going to start filming! Please start recording.

545
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:26,010
All right, I'm going to hit the slate.

546
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:28,140
Three, two, one!

547
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,900
The first cast member, John Jang will arrive in three minutes. Everyone, please standby.

548
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,450
Can we just throw PD Goo Yeo Reum in there like this?

549
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:45,030
Why not?

550
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:48,440
Well... she called off the wedding yesterday.

551
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,300
So what?

552
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,380
Just keep the young writers' mouths shut.

553
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,710
So she doesn't feel unnecessarily awkward.

554
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:58,960
- You're subtly looking out for her. 
 - As if I am.

555
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,260
I just want to make her work.

556
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,550
 We'll re-record his entrance.

557
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:41,910
Oh, all right.

558
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:44,960
We're going to re-record your entrance.

559
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,100
Should I redo that?

560
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,100
Let's just proceed.

561
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,960
Well... you can just go.

562
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:10,300
Capture the suitcase.

563
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,840
 Send in Jang Tae Mi, next.

564
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,360
- Hello. 
  - Yes, hello.

565
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,260
Nice to meet you. I'm John Jang.

566
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:29,190
Huh? Aren't you a really famous chef?

567
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:31,640
Yeah, that's me.

568
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,840
- Please take a seat. 
 - Okay.

569
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:39,780
Zoom in on her expression.

570
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,100
Hello.

571
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:15,460
What the? Why is she showing up like that?

572
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:17,630
Why? It's cute.

573
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:19,980
- You think that's cute? 
 - Yeah.

574
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,080
She's totally my type.

575
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:26,670
That's why she's never been in a relationship.

576
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:35,560
- Hello. 
 - Yes, hello.

577
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,160
Nice to meet you. I'm Park Ji Wan.

578
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,880
Oh, Ji Wan. It's very nice to meet you!

579
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,390
I'll help you out!

580
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:46,000
- Come this way. This way. 
 - Such manners!

581
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,580
Get a close up of the cast's expressions.

582
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:51,000
You can have a seat here.

583
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,840
Okay, thank you.

584
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,860
Thank you.

585
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:00,930
Welcome.

586
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,050
Judging by her looks,

587
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:09,180
it will be a relief if she doesn't run away.

588
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:16,170
Five minutes until the final male cast member, Park Jae Hoon, arrives.

589
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:40,140
 Get a front view of Park Jae Hoon with back light.

590
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:05,650
Hello.

591
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:19,910
It's nice to meet you.

592
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:22,060
I'm John Jang.

593
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:24,570
I think we've met before.

594
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:28,310
Well, as for me...

595
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:31,080
I've seen you a lot on TV.

596
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,890
I'm Park Jae Hoon.

597
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:36,030
- Hello. 
 - Welcome.

598
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:38,300
You look better in person.

599
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:41,650
The final female cast member is entering.

600
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:47,630
You're tall, too.

601
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:08,460
What the? What's up with her?

602
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:09,580
Do they know each other?

603
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:11,780
There are fireworks going off.

604
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:21,090
Hello, I'm Han Ji Yeon.

605
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:23,020
- Hello, Ji Yeon. 
 - Nice to meet you.

606
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,430
- Nice to meet you! 
 - Hello.

607
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:26,250
Nice to meet you.

608
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,980
I think everyone's here now.

609
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,430
Please take good care of me for one month.

610
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:46,100
Please take care of me, too.

611
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:47,920
Please take good care of me!

612
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,700
Let's go.

613
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:53,460
Cut!

614
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:59,000
Each of you can go into your rooms to unpack your belongings

615
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,660
- and about 30 minutes? 
 - Yes.

616
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:03,080
We'll start filming again in 30 minutes.

617
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,540
- VJs, please continue to follow the cast members. 
 - All right.

618
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:09,300
- You can rest. 
 - Okay!

619
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,800
- Okay! 
 - Shall we?

620
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:19,830
I didn't think we'd meet again like this.

621
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:21,620
Me, neither.

622
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,170
- What brings you here? 
 - Well...

623
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:26,550
it's a long story.

624
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:30,290
But due to personal circumstances, I ended up joining.

625
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,820
Let's talk separately later.

626
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:38,240
Sure.

627
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,000
Yes.

628
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:07,260
There's one woman!

629
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,890
One man will love one woman.

630
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:50,800
They're filming everything.

631
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,820
Where am I supposed to get changed?

632
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:57,790
Over there... is a blind spot.

633
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:01,380
Here and over, there is a blind spot from the cameras,

634
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,180
so you can get changed over there.

635
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,240
And come here.

636
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:10,760
When you have the mic on, everything you say will be recorded by the previewers.

637
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,860
So keep that in mind.

638
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,790
They're listening to everything I say?

639
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:17,710
Yeah, they can hear everything as long as your mic is on.

640
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:20,620
We're going to choose first impressions now.

641
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:22,310
You need to choose a dress from the showroom

642
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:24,870
and send it to a female cast member you're interested in.

643
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:28,280
The women will send the men suits.

644
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:31,870
- Wear it to the pool party at night. 
 - Okay.

645
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:35,480
The staff will give a black plastic bag to those who weren't chosen.

646
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,570
And it will contain underwear.

647
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:41,220
If you want to join the party, you can go wearing underwear.

648
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:45,570
I thought... this was "Kingdom of Love,"

649
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:47,430
not "Kingdom of Perverts."

650
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:49,310
I'm sorry.

651
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:52,330
For dragging you into this game.

652
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:54,010
So what should I do?

653
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:57,100
If I can't get a single vote, should I still go wearing underwear?

654
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,170
What do you want to do?

655
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:01,510
I'll do whatever you want.

656
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:07,770
As a program producer, I want you to go,

657
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:10,150
but not as your friend.

658
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:14,100
It sounds like you want me to go...

659
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,950
It's not like...

660
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:21,850
Let's see Park Jae Hoon's skills for once.

661
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:24,360
And see how many votes you get.

662
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:35,780
You call them friends?

663
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,840
It's going to be...

664
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,550
more entertaining than I thought.

665
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:54,440
If they finished choosing the clothes, let them choose first impressions.

666
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:00,420
- Hee Chang! 
 - Yes.

667
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:04,360
- Put the staff on standby. 
 - Okay, all right.

668
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,390
We'll begin choosing first impressions!

669
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:08,920
Everyone, please standby!

670
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:14,800
 Go to the showroom this instant

671
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:18,160
 and choose clothes you'd like to send to a member of your liking.

672
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,510
 There will be a pool side party tonight.

673
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:27,350
♫  I want to love once again  ♫

674
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:28,370
♫  I keep wanting you  ♫

675
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:32,850
♫  I want love  ♫

676
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:35,160
♫  You look at a face before dating  ♫

677
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,430
♫  You look at the physique before dating  ♫

678
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:39,730
♫  You look at the family background before dating  ♫

679
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:42,030
♫  I write down this and that  ♫

680
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:44,210
♫  What's there to life?  ♫

681
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:46,520
♫  It's up to the person  ♫

682
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,770
♫  Only if this heart beats  ♫

683
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:51,250
♫  Okay, okay, okay, no matter what, okay  ♫

684
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:53,360
♫  One, two, three, go!  ♫

685
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:57,780
♫  I want to love once again  ♫

686
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:02,340
♫  I want to meet someone  ♫

687
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:06,810
♫  I want to love once again  ♫

688
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:11,380
♫  I want to love  ♫

689
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:15,030
♫  I want to love once again  ♫

690
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,400
Park Ji Wan received one? How unexpected.

691
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,670
I didn't think Kim Joon Ho would be the one to give it to her.

692
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:24,880
Well, there are men who have fetishes for abundant women.

693
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,450
- It's a preference. 
 - Hey.

694
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,220
Let's filter what we're saying.

695
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:33,280
I feel like my ear will rot listening to you at times.

696
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,640
I'm sorry if I made your ear rot.

697
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:41,300
The way you're talking back is more like you now.

698
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,910
What?

699
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:44,560
Work, let's work.

700
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,240
Work.

701
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,970
All right, the cast members can come out now!

702
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:39,210
All right, the female cast members can come out now!

703
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:54,510
All right, now, the cast members who weren't chosen can come out!

704
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:38,160
 - Oh my god! 
 - What should we do?

705
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:30,970

706
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:52,400
♫  What can make me flutter in the wind like this  ♫

707
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:57,410
♫  Carrying pink imaginations between the two of us  ♫

708
00:59:57,410 --> 01:00:00,410
♫  I don't even blink  ♫

709
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:04,780
♫  I can't believe this feeling  ♫

710
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:12,910
♫  You gently blow into my bleak daily life  ♫

711
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:17,520
♫  In the flow, something changed.  Oh stop it, no!  ♫

712
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,530

713
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:23,420
 How do you know Han Ji Yeon?

714
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:24,600
 No plans to pursue her?

715
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:27,090
 Are you asking as a friend or the program producer?

716
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:31,230
 Don't make things complicated. You can use me. Choose me.

717
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:33,450
 - Someone came looking for you. 
 - Who?

718
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:35,580
 The man who almost married you...

719
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:36,420
 Take a look at this.

720
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:39,190
 There's nothing good from rumors like this circulating among the cast.

721
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:41,390
 I'm telling you to behave properly.

722
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:43,750
 Yeo Reum, the reason I came here is because of you.

723
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:45,060
 I'm a bit confused right now.

724
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:47,970
 Don't be confused. Just tell me what you want.

725
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:50,070
♫  Wrapping around your body  ♫

726
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:51,700
♫  Even with your subtle breath, I feel dizzy  ♫
