1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:08,980

2
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,640

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,700
♫  Dive with you, towards the wide sea  ♫

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,050

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,180
♫  Jump in love, I fly with wings called you  ♫

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,140

♫  There is nothing to be afraid of  ♫

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,020
♫  In the world called you, it sparkles and lingers here  ♫

8
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:36,700
♫  What I found while wandering was you who 
 was always by my side  ♫

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,290
♫  I'm already ready for you  ♫

10
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,030

11
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:44,840

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,170
I have a favor to ask you.

13
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,070
What is it?

14
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,830
- Let me borrow your lips. 
 - What?

15
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,720
If Han Ji Yeon comes in,

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,840
just... set the mood and...

17
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,550
give her a kiss.

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,610
I need to prevent a major accident.

19
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,270
I'm sincerely asking you.

20
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,100
You call this a favor?

21
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,310
We're not in our twenties.

22
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,830
We're grown adults,

23
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,900
so a simple kiss is okay. Right?

24
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,100
In a world where one-night stands are a piece of cake.

25
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,970
It doesn't matter to you if I kiss another woman?

26
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,420
Jae Hoon, you see...

27
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,540
- I'm in a real stitch— 
 - Goo Yeo Reum.

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,870
Let me ask you again.

29
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,210
You really don't care if I kiss another woman?

30
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,840
A simple kiss is fine?

31
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,770
In a world where one-night stands are a piece of cake?

32
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,850
- Jae Hoon... 
 - If it's that easy...

33
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,410
why don't you try it with me?

34
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,370
 - Here we are. 
 - Yes.

35
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,220
 Thanks for tonight. Go home safely.

36
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,020
 I had fun tonight, Oppa.

37
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,710
 Me, too.

38
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,710
 They say the first kiss for mankind

39
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,470
 took place between God and a human.

40
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,250
 God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life

41
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,620
 and the man became a living being.

42
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,850
 If this Hebrew creation story is true,

43
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:19,480
 it seems life flowed into our soul through a kiss.

44
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,980
 So, how is it that

45
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,750
 we've come to give away

46
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,670
 each other's soul to just anyone?

47
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,850
 I think this at times.

48
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,220
 I think this at times.

49
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,340
 At some point, kissing became an easy thing to do.

50
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:45,080
 At some point, kissing became something I took for granted.

51
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,920
 The moment where the other person's mood,

52
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,930
 the restlessness, and their breathing

53
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,250
 are directly delivered to you.

54
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,840
 The moment when your souls should be shaken upside down.

55
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,840
 Why is it that there isn't much inspiration from time to time?

56
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,310
 They say kissing is...

57
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:12,550
 a behavior where you perceive the other person's DNA instinctively.

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,600
 If that's the case,

59
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,800
 if the kiss is so-so,

60
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,230
 is it a DNA problem?

61
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:28,480
 Perhaps the kiss that used to be so sweet and radiant...

62
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,990
 became something you score,

63
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,930
 evaluate, judge,

64
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,450
 and at times...

65
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,230
 it became a romance that's run its course...

66
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,700
 As a part of the steps toward sleeping together,

67
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,590
 you can barely even remember

68
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,540
 where you kissed and whom...

69
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,390
 and with what kind of heart and mind.

70
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,800
 A romance that is commonplace.

71
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,690
 At some point, kissing became something I took for granted.

72
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,940
 At some point, kissing became an easy thing to do.

73
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,990
 But I'm not taking this moment for granted.

74
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,260
 This moment is not an easy one.

75
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,680
 Goo Yeo Reum cannot be taken for granted.

76
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,800
 The feeling where my heart and brain are both being rattled.

77
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,860
 Of all people...

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,220
 because of Park Jae Hoon...

79
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,310
Yeo Reum.

80
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,440
Goo Yeo Reum!

81
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,670

82
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,380
Goo Yeo Reum!

83
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,960
Jae Hoon, later.

84
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,310
Let's talk later.

85
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:12,220

86
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,370
Gosh! I'm crazy!

87
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,840
I must be crazy.

88
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,450
Sir, I'll go to the office.

89
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,110
Okay.

90
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,170
It's a nice picture.

91
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,160
- Yes. 
 - But where is the sound?

92
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,890
Oh, well, as for that...

93
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,340
How could you make a mistake like this?

94
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,880
Did you build your years of experience through your ass?

95
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,600
Well, you know... I think they turned the sound off on purpose.

96
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,400
So I only got the visuals.

97
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,510
I'm sorry.

98
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,730
So, these two turned off the sound on purpose?

99
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,620
I can't believe these guys are making me laugh.

100
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,990
On top of that, she disappeared all of a sudden.

101
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,500
- Disappeared? 
 - Yes!

102
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,300
She literally just vanished.

103
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,360
She won't pick up her phone, either.

104
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,430
All right. I got it for now.

105
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,570
Go and get some rest.

106
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,260
Go to the editing room in the morning and start working on the rough cut.

107
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,370
Yes, I got it.

108
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,370
Hi, Senior.

109
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,970
Why the long face?

110
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,020
Sang Woo.

111
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,900
I think this...

112
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,730
whenever I cause some trouble.

113
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,520
What are those thoughts?

114
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,710
In the end, everything will get resolved and will be taken care of.

115
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,970
Take responsibility for whatever is necessary and get embarrassed if I deserved to be.

116
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,320
That's all it takes.

117
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,430
Is something the matter?

118
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,290
Well...

119
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,170
- A little earlier— 
 - Senior.

120
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,610
May I go first?

121
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,190
What?

122
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,120
No, don't.

123
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:21,040
I caused huge trouble, too.

124
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,910
I think it'd be better if I expose it first.

125
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,830
What is it?

126
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,910
Park Ji Wan's...

127
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,710
recording of her sexual molestation...

128
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,890
I deleted it.

129
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,900
The entire part in the original recording.

130
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,030
What?

131
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,640
 In middle school...

132
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,100
 whenever it was a holiday,

133
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,600
 my older cousin would...

134
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,500
 touch my body.

135
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:01,920

136
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,170
Why did you do it?

137
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,740
You!

138
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,530
How could you do that without even discussing it with me?

139
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,910
Because you'd become an accomplice if I had told you.

140
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,260
And since I recorded it, it's on my shoulders.

141
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,630
How could that be your responsibility?

142
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:20,410
You have no reason to take responsibility, and there is no need.

143
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,990
It's my first VCR.

144
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,480
Park Ji Wan had asked me about it.

145
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,760
She said to make sure it doesn't get aired.

146
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,790
But still...

147
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,920
This original recording is

148
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,750
a property of the company the minute we press "record."

149
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,750
You got yourself in huge trouble.

150
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:43,750
I know. My apologies.

151
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,350
Then... you go ahead, Senior.

152
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,830
How can I help you?

153
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,840
Because you pulled such a huge stunt,

154
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,680
what I did doesn't even compare.

155
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,710
I'm sorry...

156
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,410
Sang Woo, don't tell Kang Chae Ri about deleting a portion of the recording.

157
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,610
I'll tell her. Got that?

158
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,560
Okay. I understand.

159
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,770

160
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,310

161
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,640

162
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,570

163
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,000
Hey, Hee Chang, are you in your room?

164
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,730
I see.

165
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,990
How are Park Jae Hoon and Han Ji Yeon?

166
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,860
Not yet for both of them?

167
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,160
I see...

168
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,340
All right. Okay.

169
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,800
Ji Yeon.

170
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,330
I heard you had left the film location earlier.

171
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,050
What are you doing and not going in?

172
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,870
I was waiting for you, PD.

173
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:06,430
Can you talk to me for a second?

174
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:21,640
This time, I'll ask you a rude question.

175
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,160
What could it be...

176
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,260
Do you have...

177
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,200
feelings for Jae Hoon?

178
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,620
Ji Yeon...

179
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,410
I saw earlier... the two of you.

180
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,700
Honestly, I got hurt.

181
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,660
Seeing the man I have a crush on

182
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,550
kissing another woman...

183
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,830
I was tormented.

184
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,370
Ji Yeon...

185
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:08,690
- What happened earlier— 
 - But it will air as if I kissed him.

186
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:12,460
Did you think I would be okay that?

187
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,660
Because I like Jae Hoon so much,

188
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,750
since I say okay to everything,

189
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,840
you had no care for how I might feel?

190
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,760
That's not what it was.

191
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,150
I sincerely apologize if you're upset about it.

192
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,600
But there is misunderstanding.

193
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,810
What misunderstanding?

194
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,800
Well...

195
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,510
I wanted to drop out of the Kingdom

196
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,930
so I'm here to pack my things.

197
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:49,190
- Drop out? 
 - But all of a sudden,

198
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:52,550
I started feeling it was unfair.

199
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,670
Jae Hoon's feelings are

200
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,720
so far from me.

201
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,790
But for you, PD... it's so easy.

202
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,630
If you also like Jae Hoon,

203
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,740
I'd like to drop out.

204
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,050
But if that's not the case, I don't want to step back.

205
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,780
Jae Hoon and I are...

206
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,630
friends.

207
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,340
Then draw a clear line from him.

208
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,350
Don't shake him up for no reason.

209
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,310
For me,

210
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:35,290
it's not easy to gain his heart.

211
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,360
I will.

212
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,050
And what we recorded today won't be aired.

213
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:49,710
I wasn't going to go that far.

214
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:53,850
As long as you draw a clear line, it doesn't matter to me.

215
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,420
- What do you mean— 
 - I don't care if it's just work.

216
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,090
I don't care if you air it.

217
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:06,340
Jae Hoon's heart is what's important to me.

218
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,900
Jae Hoon.

219
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,600
How come you two are together...?

220
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,620
I explained the situation from earlier at the set

221
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,400
and asked her if it was okay to air it as though it was her.

222
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,780
What?

223
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,710
As long as you're okay with it.

224
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:36,050
I want to air it as though it was a kiss between you and Ji Yeon.

225
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,050
Goo Yeo Reum.

226
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,880
Must you take it that far?

227
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,220
Our faces didn't show anyway.

228
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,390
As long as both of you are okay with it,

229
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,580
I'd like to do that.

230
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,240
You two can discuss it and let me know what you decide.

231
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,980
Then...

232
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,350
I'll get going first.

233
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,600
Ji Yeon, I'm so sorry. I don't know where to begin to explain.

234
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,130
I saw you earlier.

235
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,930
The two of you kissing.

236
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,450
Tell her you don't want them to air it, Ji Yeon.

237
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,970
You can refuse.

238
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:54,670
Do I seem like someone who can't even refuse something like that?

239
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,850
No, that's not it.

240
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,610
I'm really sorry about what happened earlier.

241
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:04,760
I was on a date with you, Ji Yeon.

242
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,890
I'm so sorry.

243
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,310
People's eyes don't lie.

244
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,570
You can't hide what your glances say.

245
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,010
Especially when you're looking at someone.

246
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:29,540
You can't hide the eyes of love

247
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,260
and you can't imitate them.

248
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,410
Because of your glances, my heart...

249
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,370
is breaking.

250
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:45,420
Ji Yeon...

251
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:51,340
Glances are like a spotlight.

252
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,970
A spotlight that is lit up on only one person.

253
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:03,250
A shining spotlight that does not move toward me, not even by a little bit.

254
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,010
- I was going to drop out of the Kingdom. 
 - Drop out?

255
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:11,200
I don't want to burden you anymore

256
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,500
and I don't like being in this pathetic one-sided love.

257
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,940
But...

258
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,230
I can't control my heart.

259
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,570
I can't just give up on you like this.

260
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:32,540
To the extent that I don't care if I get hurt even more...

261
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,700
I like you...

262
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,080
Jae Hoon.

263
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,250
So I would like to say that it's okay one more time.

264
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:52,380
I'll say "it's okay" this time once again.

265
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,800
I just don't know what I should say to you, Ji Yeon.

266
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,400
You don't have to give me an answer.

267
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,530
Until the end of the program,

268
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,600
it means I have a chance.

269
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,560
Did you sleep well?

270
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,330
Aren't you going to work today, everyone?

271
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,900
- I'll go after breakfast. 
 - A little later.

272
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,190
I saw you on TV, Tae Mi.

273
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,100
- You looked so pretty! 
 - Really?

274
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,310
Thank you!

275
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:39,190
- I'm so jealous. 
 - Really?

276
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,390
I got a text.

277
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,280
- Not me. 
 - It looks like only women got it.

278
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,770
"Ladies, write down your ideal date

279
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:53,610
on the card that's on the table and put it in the mailbox."

280
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,580
Table where?

281
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,450
When did they set that up?

282
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,590
We got a text, too.

283
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:07,690
"The first episode of the Season 2 of Kingdom of Love will air today.

284
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,840
The viewers will vote for the most compatible couple

285
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,680
right up until the episode ends.

286
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:18,800
The best couple bought to you by the viewers will get to go on a date."

287
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,490
Whoa! This sounds so interesting.

288
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,300
There wasn't anything like this in Season 1. Right?

289
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,510
No, there wasn't.

290
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,390
I had no idea there would be voting.

291
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,310
I'm nervous for some reason.

292
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,510
A date?

293
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,360
A date?

294
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,590
- A date. 
 - He thinks he could get it.

295
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:47,740
 Jae Hoon, see me for a second.

296
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,650
I'm here.

297
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,370
Sit down.

298
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,900
You know, you're always so good to me.

299
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,540
Yeah.

300
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,630
It's so fun to hang out with you.

301
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:55,900
So there were days when I was confused as well.

302
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,410
"Do I like him?"

303
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,670
But...

304
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,960
it became clear to me yesterday.

305
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,850
That we're friends.

306
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,800
- It became clear to you? 
 - Yeah.

307
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,940
That we're friends?

308
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,540
Yeah.

309
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,780
Look me in the eyes and tell me.

310
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,660
But for me, it has to be you.

311
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,130
That became more clear to me.

312
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:38,610
Yeo Reum, are you sure...

313
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,410
I'm not the one for you?

314
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:45,350
Yeah. You're not.

315
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:53,150
Let's just say nothing happened last night.

316
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:56,430
When we look back later, this will be our embarrassing moment.

317
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,730
It will be hilarious.

318
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:02,660
Hye Jin and Dae Shik will tease us for the rest of our lives.

319
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,010
Hey, Yeo Reum...

320
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,700
If you're saying this because of the program,

321
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,470
I'll wait until this is over.

322
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,340
I'll do my best in the Kingdom.

323
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,880
That's not it.

324
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,020
I'm just saying you're not the one for me.

325
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,550
What?

326
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,340
I didn't feel anything last night when we kissed.

327
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,730
Isn't that game over?

328
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,970
You mean, I'm mistaken all by myself?

329
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,460
I can't help it even if things become awkward with you.

330
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,930
No is a no.

331
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,130
All right. I'll do as you say.

332
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,700
I'll stop right here.

333
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,560
- Thank you. 
 - Give us a moment.

334
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,280
- Sure. 
 - Thank you.

335
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:22,050
 Out of the men in here who made an impression on you?

336
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,400
Honey, watch TV.

337
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:28,310
Wow, is that Jae Hoon?

338
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,640
He is great.

339
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,210
What's he doing over there?

340
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:34,160
Our Park Jae Hoon is looking good on the screen.

341
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,260
- He looks much better than in real life, huh? 
 - Yeah.

342
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,270

343
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,640
What's with that girl?

344
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,410
Look, look at that! Can't believe they're doing that on TV!

345
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,280
 Vote for the couple of your choice.

346
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,270
 Extremely reality dating show, Kingdom of Love, Season 2.

347
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:54,360
 We will begin a new method for viewer participation.

348
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,380
 You can give a dating opportunity for the couple of your choice.

349
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:02,650
 Will the two people you vote for fall in love?

350
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,180
 Ten beautiful women and handsome men are

351
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:07,900
 waiting for the Cupid's arrows you'll shoot for them.

352
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,820
 Please vote for a couple of your choice immediately.

353
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,380

354
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,040

355
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,160

356
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,430
 - Pretty good. 
 - You're pretty strong, Jae Hoon.

357
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,510

358
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:25,450

359
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,730

360
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:31,610

361
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:34,500

362
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,230

363
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:41,870

364
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:45,360

365
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,620

366
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,050

367
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:52,390

368
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:56,390
 I'd like to ask Han Ji Yeon on a date.

369
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,460

370
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,360

371
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:06,580
It's fun. Turned out nice.

372
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:09,320
Good work! Good job.

373
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,570
Good job.

374
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,600
So, how is the viewers' voting going?

375
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,940
Are there lots of votes?

376
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,710
They're going crazy.

377
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,270
Oh, really?

378
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:23,620
As of now, Jang Tae Mi and John Jang are garnering votes since they're recognizable.

379
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:27,770
But after the first episode, there will be some changes.

380
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,980
Park Jae Hoon and Han Ji Yeon's love line is very entertaining.

381
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,610
We'll go with those two in the earlier episodes.

382
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:35,160
As each episode unfolds, we'll select a variety of love lines.

383
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,370
Okay, great!

384
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:39,190
Okay! Good job!

385
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:43,220
Kang Chae Ri.

386
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,180
Let's talk for a moment.

387
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,980
- What is it? 
 - Not here.

388
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,650
Follow me.

389
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:52,960
He deleted the recording?

390
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,460
Is he crazy or not?

391
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,500
I definitely taught him a lesson.

392
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,690
- Let's just let this one slide. 
 - Who says?

393
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,550
Is he a serpent or something? Slide through what?

394
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:05,100
We can't air that anyway.

395
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,690
The cast members said no.

396
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:13,150
I said we'll air that part!

397
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:17,090
I will not let this one slide.

398
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:20,270
I'll request a formal disciplinary action.

399
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,570
Hey! Kang Chae Ri!

400
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,410
Just let him off this once.

401
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:32,160
Telling me to let him off easy when he deleted the recording

402
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,090
is much more shocking to me.

403
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:36,220
Is this some school broadcasting club?

404
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:40,030
If disciplinary action is necessary, I'll be disciplined.

405
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,790
- Did you tell him to? 
 - Yeah...

406
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,590
I told him to do it.

407
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,020
No matter how much you lack the feel for a show, you're not that bad.

408
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,410
Don't try to cover up for him.

409
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,780
I have one more thing to tell you.

410
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,800
What now?

411
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,680
You know the kiss scene between Park Jae Hoon and Han Ji Yeon? That was me.

412
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,840
I know.

413
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,500
You know?

414
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,670
How did you find out?

415
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:08,210
Because I have eyes.

416
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,720
I could tell right away it was you.

417
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,710
Gosh, you're up to all kinds of things now...

418
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,070
Well, to explain what happened...

419
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,460
No need to explain.

420
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,140
- I can use it, right? 
 - Yeah.

421
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,380
The two people agreed.

422
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,320
Way to go.

423
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,560
Senior.

424
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,730
Hey, Kim Sang Woo!

425
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,230
You sure showed it to me.

426
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:38,820
Your gut. How gutsy you are.

427
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,400
I'm sorry.

428
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,460
But I couldn't help it.

429
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,460
What you asshole?

430
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,880
Look at this guy. Hey! Who says you could mess with the recording?

431
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,130
Who says?

432
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:51,350
Have you lost your mind?

433
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,260
Have you lost it? Come, get over here!

434
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,940
- You rat! Get over here! 
 - Hey!

435
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,020
You! I didn't like you from the get-go.

436
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,760
- You! You! 
 - Get out!

437
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,620
You, you!

438
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,960
Where do you think you're going?

439
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,540
Ji Wan.

440
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,450
Ji Wan.

441
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,450
What are you doing out here?

442
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:19,800
I was just spacing out.

443
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,450
Well...

444
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:27,490
You know what you said yesterday during our date?

445
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:31,510
Thank you so much for telling me something like that.

446
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:35,590
It couldn't have been easy since the camera was rolling.

447
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:40,810
I just couldn't help it. It just came out.

448
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:43,470
I think you're so brave.

449
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:46,070
You were really, really amazing.

450
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,800
I wanted to tell you that.

451
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:54,170
But that's not going to air on the show.

452
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:57,260
- Oh, why? 
 - I asked.

453
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,240
Since I just blurted it out,

454
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,200
I asked them to be sure to edit it out.

455
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,200
I see...

456
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,570
So, you did that.

457
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,880
Well...

458
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,100
But if it airs, I'm sure it will be a hot topic.

459
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,830
Do you think the production crew would edit that out?

460
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:18,400
It can never air.

461
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,640
The broadcasting company would want to air it, though.

462
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,430
They can't. Never.

463
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,980
Ji Wan,

464
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,370
if...

465
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:30,710
Really, if it doesn't get edited out,

466
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:33,150
don't you worry too much.

467
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:35,790
I'm here for you.

468
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,960
Why did you do it?

469
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,620
- I'm sorry. 
 - I'll consider the circumstances, but...

470
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,630
your method was wrong.

471
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,290
How you went about it was wrong.

472
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,920
You could've resolved it in a different way.

473
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,690
Why did you delete that?

474
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,610
I'm sorry.

475
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,130
Director, it's my fault.

476
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:08,480
Why are you stepping forward?

477
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,830
I strongly pushed him by saying we couldn't air that part.

478
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,860
I might as well have ordered him to do it.

479
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,960
It was my fault.

480
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,810
Director?

481
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:21,180
I won't let this slide.

482
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,760
Please discipline him properly.

483
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:39,310
Kang Chae Ri, let's let this one slide.

484
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,370
- Director! 
 - I heard you threw things at him, too.

485
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,570
That's assault.

486
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:47,680
Then discipline me for that separately.

487
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,200
Then it becomes an outrageous cheesy melodrama.

488
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,680
Right?

489
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,620
Let's not open this up for discussion and resolve it internally.

490
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,700
Within your team.

491
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:05,470
Kim Sang Woo, don't let me see you on the film location going forward.

492
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:08,200
I can't let you produce outdoor scenes. Editing goes without saying.

493
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,650
Backup, settle payments, move things, miscellaneous tasks. That's all.

494
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:14,170
Hey, send him to another team if you can't stand to see him.

495
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:17,120
- For whose benefit? 
 - It was my fault...

496
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,960
so I'll receive whatever the punishment.

497
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:23,070
I'm sorry.

498
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,600
That's all then, right?

499
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,350
Then, we'll wrap this up like this.

500
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:03,010
Why do you discriminate?

501
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,010
What? What do you mean?

502
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,950
Why do you cover up for Goo Yeo Reum?

503
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:09,420
- Why? 
 - When did I?

504
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:12,780
Besides, you're not the type to dwell on other people's affection for others.

505
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,360
I may not dwell on it!

506
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,820
But it still offends me.

507
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,020
I said I'm offended.

508
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,380
Kim Sang Woo,

509
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,340
are you okay?

510
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:53,790
Yes. I'm okay.

511
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:56,300
Let's stay on the down low for a while.

512
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,480
Try to avoid Kang Chae Ri for now. Okay?

513
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,320
Yes, I got it.

514
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,400
Sang Woo.

515
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,990
- Don't do that going forward. 
 - Yes.

516
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:10,750
I'm not saying this as your senior at work, but

517
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:14,270
I'm telling you as someone who cherishes you.

518
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:16,930
Was I that unreliable?

519
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:18,910
It's not that...

520
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,160
I thought that for me to take care of it

521
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,500
would be the cleanest and the most precise way to get rid of it.

522
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:29,190
You were very brave, but you still can't do that.

523
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:33,390
Even if we were to delete the recording, I should've done it.

524
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:38,530
I have a bigger responsibility than you and more authority, too.

525
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:45,250
I'm saying don't be too brave when you don't have enough power.

526
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,720
- Senior... 
 - We could just fight head-on,

527
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,700
throw a fit...

528
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,240
Do stuff like that first.

529
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:56,100
As for taking responsibility, do that later.

530
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,350
Do you understand?

531
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,750
Yes.

532
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,020
Nice, nice!

533
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,970
Behind you.

534
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,860
Soo Mi.

535
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,400
Do you want to ride the floater?

536
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,330
Sounds good.

537
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,370
Tae Mi, do you want to ride one, too?

538
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,510
I'll let you ride one.

539
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:56,130
No. I don't like to go in the water.

540
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:01,510
But instead, take some pictures for me.

541
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,330
Gosh, I'm practically a photographer. This is crazy.

542
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:06,650
I'm a great photographer.

543
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,870
Really?

544
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,330
Give it to me.

545
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:13,000
- Then, okay. From over there. 
 - Okay.

546
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,300
Your proportion is so...

547
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,820
How do I look?

548
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,880
Good, good.

549
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,100
Good, good, good!

550
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,070
Why are you so nice to me?

551
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,410
Because I'm interested in you.

552
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:51,420
What got you interested in me?

553
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,090
- I fell for you after seeing you do the chicken fight. 
 - What?

554
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:58,390
I usually like women who are aggressive like a fighting chicken.

555
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,570
Come on...

556
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,970
What the heck does that mean?

557
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:04,220
It doesn't sound like a good thing.

558
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,970
A glamoritor-like woman.

559
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,190
Isn't that cool?

560
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,870
Glamoritor?

561
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,350
What's that?

562
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,950
Don't you know glamoritor?

563
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:15,930
You know, a long time ago in Greece,

564
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:19,750
inside a round stadium, they used to fight with swords.

565
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:22,060
Kind of like pro wrestlers of our time.

566
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:26,740
By chance do you mean gladiators?

567
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,860
In the Roman Empire?

568
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,470
Rome is Greece.

569
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,840
Greek and Roman myths.

570
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,570
They're the same country.

571
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,430
I see...

572
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,240
You don't even know that?

573
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,040
Shall we go?

574
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,410
Wow, looking good! That pose!

575
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,100
Turn just a little bit. Just a little bit...

576
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,550
Okay! Great!

577
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,900
Where are the others?

578
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,420
Isn't So Yeon coming out?

579
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,280
I asked her to come out with us earlier, but

580
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,760
I think she wanted to stay inside.

581
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,380
Really?

582
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:42,310
- Make my legs look long. 
 - They're long already.

583
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,880
Wow! Your proportions are awesome.

584
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,520
Wow... wait...

585
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,160
Slightly.

586
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,910
Good!

587
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,160
Good, good! Good! Wow!

588
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,180
Tae Mi, turn slightly.

589
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,540
Wow, it's a work of art.

590
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,760
Wow! Okay. Slightly. Slightly to the left.

591
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,920
I think you grew tall in that short time. What a work of art.

592
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,750
Send me one later, okay?

593
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:03,970
Does it look okay?

594
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,280
Okay...

595
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,930
Here, here.

596
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:10,800
- Isn't it nice? 
 - My face looks like it's in the shade.

597
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,900
Could you take it once more?

598
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,350
I'll take it from this angle.

599
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,270
Great! Wow! Nice!

600
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,800
I'm practically a national athlete.

601
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,520
This is totally...

602
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,970
So...

603
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:24,580
It doesn't seem level.

604
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,250
Be sure to line up horizontally. Like this.

605
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,850
Just this much.

606
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:29,300
Good, good. Keep going.

607
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,490
Horizontal. It's leveled.

608
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:32,990
My legs look too short.

609
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:36,040
Wow, nice! We'll move over here...

610
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,080
- Geez! 
 - No, no.

611
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,830
Again, again.

612
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,760
Whoa, so pretty.

613
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,800
This photo is amazing. It came out so good!

614
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,350
I totally love it.

615
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:55,220
I know. Since the model is so beautiful.

616
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:58,970
Please take pictures over on this side.

617
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:00,500
Again?

618
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,860
Tae Min, let's sit down and grab a drink...

619
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,330
No. I'll go change into another swimsuit.

620
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,300
Excuse me?

621
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,150
I thought animal prints might be too much.

622
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,830
So I hesitated bringing it here, but I bought it just in case.

623
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:13,670
I think I could wear it.

624
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:15,470
I'll be right back.

625
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,590
All right.

626
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:19,980
I'll take all the pictures for you when you get back.

627
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,920
Hey, little brother Jang!

628
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,420
Yes?

629
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,860
While waiting, put some tanning oil on my back for me.

630
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,080
I don't do stuff like that for men.

631
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,490
If you put it on for me, I'll give you a tip.

632
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,430
You crazy? What tip—

633
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,740
Why would you give me a tip?

634
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:00,280
Not that kind of tip.

635
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,160
A tip on how you can get together with Jang Tae Mi.

636
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,920
It'd better be helpful.

637
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,660
Listen up.

638
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,720
Women who look like a goddess like her

639
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,480
All they hear are, "You're so pretty, I like you, Date me."

640
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,600
- So? 
 - You can't be taking pictures for her.

641
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,410
- Only the low-class kiss asses do that. 
 - What?

642
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:29,210
Fucking high-class dudes like you shouldn't do that.

643
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,460
If you want things to work out,

644
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,270
keep a distance from her.

645
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:34,840
Push and pull.

646
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,060
That's totally my specialty.

647
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,710
Then why are you doing that? W-Why are you so submissive?

648
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,350
Geez, when was I so submissive?

649
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,360
I wasn't like that.

650
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,920
- You weren't? 
 - No!

651
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,100
Okay.

652
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,710
Then I'll be watching you from now on.

653
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:59,080
But...

654
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,040
who are you interested in, Hyungnim?

655
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,810
Well, I'm just watching them for now.

656
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:08,630
I tend to be the cautious type.

657
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:11,730
I think you're just unpopular.

658
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:18,390
Wait and see. They'll all fall for me.

659
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,020
This guy is very good putting on oils.

660
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,210
- Is it okay? 
 - You're pretty much an expert.

661
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:29,350
To the right. Can you do a thorough job under my arm?

662
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:31,590
- Under your armpit? 
 - Yeah, get in there.

663
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:33,610
- I need to get tan. 
 - You have hair!

664
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:34,660
Geez!

665
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,360
Don't you have hair? Don't you?

666
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,030
I don't. I shaved it all off.

667
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:39,810
It's true.

668
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:57,320
Where are you, PD Kang?

669
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,610
In the editing room.

670
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:00,580
 What are you doing over there?

671
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:02,100
I have something to fix in Episode 1.

672
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,560
What? I thought it was all done.

673
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,270
Until it's transmitted on the air, it's not done.

674
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,600
I'm busy. Talk to you later.

675
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,060
Park Jae Hoon! What brings you here at this hour?

676
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:31,260
I wanted to eat.

677
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,300
Sure! Have a seat. Sit over here.

678
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,200
Honey!

679
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,000
Jae Hoon is here!

680
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,140
Hey! You came.

681
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:43,230
It's spinach.

682
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,550
Why are you guys staring at me like that?

683
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:05,870
- Something's up, huh? 
 - No.

684
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:09,670
I can feel it. I can tell something is up.

685
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:13,640
This is how you look when Goo Yeo Reum is giving you grief.

686
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:17,990
Yeo Reum rejected me.

687
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:20,060
He said he got rejected a few days ago.

688
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:23,610
Not that one. I got rejected again this morning.

689
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:25,160
What the heck are you talking about?

690
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,490
She's not even interested in me.

691
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:29,280
I guess I just kicked some air.

692
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,560
You idiot. You shouldn't have come on too strong.

693
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,970
You should approach here very slowly.

694
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:38,420
She's not in the mindset to pursue a relationship.

695
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:40,600
Park Jae Hoon always goes straight ahead.

696
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,850
You don't ever back up.

697
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:43,520
I'll back up.

698
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,590
Yeo Reum says I'm not it.

699
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:47,900
No. Never.

700
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,030
So I'll forget about it.

701
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:52,280
Well...

702
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,170
I'm not sure if I could forget about it even if I tried.

703
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,020
Forget it.

704
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,020
She says she doesn't like him!

705
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:06,610
- Honey! 
 - You may be on Yeo Reum's side, but as for me,

706
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:08,620
I'm on Jae Hoon's side.

707
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:11,830
Don't look at a woman who rejects you.

708
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:14,490
Why bother? It's her loss.

709
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:17,130
Who does she think she is to reject our Jae Hoon?

710
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:19,750
Geez, I'm so pissed.

711
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:23,290
Hey, does Yeo Reum have eyes hanging on her belly button?

712
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:26,530
Drink some ice water and come to your senses.

713
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:37,760
Jang Tae Mi likes car camping dates.

714
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,410
Park Ji Wan likes to dress in matching outfits and go to Bukcheon.

715
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:42,820
Han Ji Yeon likes to jog along the Han River and grab a beer after.

716
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:45,420
Ahn So Yeon likes to eat grilled clams by the ocean.

717
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:50,640
Geum Soo Mi likes to have a wine and course dinner at a restaurant with nice atmosphere.

718
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,060
They all sound good.

719
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:55,160
I think they'll all look good, too.

720
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,380
How is the viewer voting going?

721
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:58,880
John Jang and Jang Tae Mi,

722
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,400
Park Jae Hoon and Han Ji Yeon,

723
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,630
Kim Joon Ho and Park Ji Wan.

724
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:03,280
They're the top three.

725
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,180
Those three couples were in the trailer, too.

726
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:09,370
Okay. Things are going according to our plan.

727
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,990
But how come PD Kang isn't here yet?

728
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:14,020
She says she's editing.

729
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,310
- Editing? 
 - Yeah.

730
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:17,080
She said she has something to add to Episode 1.

731
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,920
The closing part was all done.

732
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,950
- Add what? 
 - Not sure.

733
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:24,980
I wouldn't know that.

734
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:31,540

735
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,310
Hello.

736
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:40,890
For our show,

737
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:43,000
please use this.

738
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:50,240
What do you think we'll get?

739
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,870
Okay, here are more beers.

740
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:57,170
Everybody, attention, please.

741
00:47:57,170 --> 00:48:00,970
Everyone, I'll turn the channel.

742
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:03,300

743
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,720
Gosh, I'm so looking forward to it.

744
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,820
Feels good.

745
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:17,000
Gosh, why am I so nervous?

746
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:23,670
 I like the strongest predator.

747
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:26,340
All right, let's go for the amazing viewer ratings!

748
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:28,780
- Let's go! Let's go! 
 - Let's go.

749
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,340
I'm so nervous that I can't watch it.

750
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,340
Why be nervous?

751
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:34,070
It's okay.

752
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:38,970
Whoa!  We all look so cool.

753
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,760
 Everyone looks like celebrities.

754
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,830
 I'm the one who creates my destiny.

755
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:47,660
You look so pretty!

756
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:49,900
You came out so pretty, too, Ji Wan.

757
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,460
I look so fat.

758
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,560
Not at all.

759
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,260

760
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:58,420
What? What, what, what?

761
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:00,820
What? So what?

762
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,810
- Because you look sexy. 
 - It's my underwear.

763
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:05,530
Gosh, seriously.

764
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:08,910

765
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:10,710
At this rate, the server will go down!

766
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:12,110
How is the community reaction?

767
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:14,090
I think it's going to be a huge jackpot this time.

768
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:15,840
The comments are coming up nonstop.

769
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:19,430
They're going crazy on the SNS, too. It's huge.

770
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:21,540

771
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:24,320
Han Ji Yeon and Park Jae Hoon took over.

772
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,350
They're in first place for viewers' voting.

773
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:27,750
Really?

774
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:30,220
Whoa, of course.

775
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:35,120
Wow, the reactions are explosive as soon as she fell into the pool.

776
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:39,120

777
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,910
Wait a minute. Shouldn't there be introductions after the pool scene?

778
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:42,950
Why is that on?

779
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:45,970
Senior Kang Chae Ri must've added that part.

780
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:48,420
We're airing that part already?

781
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:54,560
Gosh, capable people don't need stuff like this.

782
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,450
 To be a good man,

783
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:59,290
 - I should wait.  
 - You came out so beautiful.

784
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:01,390
That woman, Han Ji Yeon.

785
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:04,010
Doesn't she look like she really likes Jae Hoon?

786
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:06,320
It looks like it.

787
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,700
Her eyes look genuine.

788
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,820
I'll give her one vote.

789
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:13,850
- Are you going to vote? 
 - Of course. It's for everyone

790
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:17,290
I'll watch it a little more.

791
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,030

792
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,400
Kissing in Episode 1 already?

793
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,260
Why is it moving so fast?

794
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:31,950
PD Chae Ri is totally determined, it seems.

795
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,680

796
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,160

797
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,640

798
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,980
What's that?

799
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:46,460
Hee Chang, did you film that?

800
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,420
N-No...

801
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:52,540
- That's our van black box footage. 
 - What?

802
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:55,440
- What? 
 - Senior Kang Chae Ri asked for it, so I got it for her.

803
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,430
 I was going to drop out of the Kingdom.

804
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:01,490
 I don't want to burden you anymore

805
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,740
 and I don't like being in this pathetic one-sided love.

806
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,510

But...

807
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,450
 I can't control my heart.

808
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:18,850
 I can't just give up on you like this.

809
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:24,500
 To the extent that I don't care if I get hurt even more, I like you...

810
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:28,610
 Jae Hoon.

811
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:30,180

812
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:37,970
Park Jae Hoon and Han Ji Yeon are overwhelmingly on top.

813
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:41,320
All the SNS sites, women and men community sites are going crazy, too.

814
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,150
Asking who Park Jae Hoon kissed.

815
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:44,310
Who's that?

816
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:45,610
I don't really know, either.

817
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:47,410
PD Yeo Reum, do you know?

818
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:51,540
What the heck? When did you guys strategize like that without me?

819
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,750
I'll be right back.

820
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,920
You didn't kiss Han Ji Yeon?

821
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:02,930
Then, who was it?

822
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,910
It's getting more interesting.

823
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:19,100
Ji Yeon.

824
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,150
Ji Yeon!

825
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,110
What in the world is going on?

826
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:29,220
It's not Ji Yeon?

827
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:33,300
It means someone who kissed Jae Hoon in secret is here.

828
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,740
Is this the Mafia game or something?

829
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:37,870
It's fun.

830
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:40,390
It's fun. Isn't it?

831
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:47,100
Ji Yeon! Ji Yeon!

832
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:51,070
Are you okay?

833
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,250
- Did you know about this? 
 - No.

834
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:56,100
I had no idea our conversation in the garden was recorded.

835
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:59,370
You and PD Goo Yeo Reum didn't plot this?

836
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:01,720
I feel so stupid.

837
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,240
I proved myself an idiot in front of the whole nation.

838
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,830
- Ji Yeon... 
 - PD Goo...

839
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:09,130
She's really amazing.

840
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:12,370
She'll do anything for viewer ratings.

841
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:15,110
How could she film that in secret?

842
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:18,410
So scary. Really.

843
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,170
You saw the show, right?

844
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:35,690
What do you think?

845
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:37,010
The show's going to go big, right?

846
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:38,720
Kang Chae Ri.

847
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:40,850
- What the hell did you do? 
 - What did I do?

848
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:42,900
How can you tie in the kiss scene like that?

849
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,860
That's my talent.

850
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:49,410
Thanks to you, it's become a lot more interesting. I'm so grateful.

851
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:54,110
After doing that, how are you going to clean up the aftermath?

852
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:56,020
I'll take care of that.

853
00:53:56,020 --> 00:54:00,980
This is... how you create a show.

854
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:03,120
Watch and learn.

855
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:30,080
 This... looks like Goo Yeo Reum, no matter how I look at it.

856
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:32,180
 Jae Hoon.

857
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:35,360
 How come you two are together...

858
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:38,940
 I explained the situation from earlier at the set and asked her

859
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:42,760
 if it was okay to air it as though it was her.

860
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:50,400
 Until the end of the program, it means I have a chance.

861
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:04,730
Hi.

862
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:06,730
Hi.

863
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:08,810

864
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,500

865
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:26,460
Congrats, PD Kang.

866
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:28,530
The first episode hit it big.

867
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:30,760
Congrats, Writer Jang.

868
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,010
So, who kissed Park Jae Hoon?

869
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:34,870
You're not going to tell me, either?

870
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:37,980
I said it's top secret.

871
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:41,610
In any case, have you seen this?

872
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:44,790
- What? 
 - People are hashtagging on SNS,

873
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:47,440
"Park Jae Hoon and Han Ji Yeon should date."

874
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,000
Look.

875
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,910
Isn't it great?

876
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:55,940
How interesting.

877
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:02,060
It's so crazy.

878
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:04,100
Look at this. People are...

879
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:06,250
I'm looking.

880
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:11,220
So are two of them pretty much the main star this season?

881
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:13,760
It's not over until it's over.

882
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,610
Isn't that right?

883
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:29,350

884
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:43,380
It's Park Jae Hoon!

885
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:46,180
Isn't that him?

886
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:48,350
Oh, my gosh!

887
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:50,050
Park Jae Hoon!

888
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:53,200
He's out! So cute!

889
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:57,060
Excuse me.

890
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:59,330
It's you, right? Kingdom of Love.

891
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:00,350
Yes.

892
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:02,610
 Incredible! Oh, my gosh!

893
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:06,230
You know... could you please date Han Ji Yeon?

894
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:08,680
We're genuinely cheering you on.

895
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,930
You two are totally awesome together!

896
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:12,640
Really! Fighting! Fighting!

897
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,250
We'll watch it when it broadcasts.

898
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:16,750
He's so cute!

899
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:19,470
He's so handsome!

900
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:34,270

901
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:42,540

902
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:12,480

903
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,700

904
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:25,490

905
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:29,780

906
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:31,330
I'll start the treatment.

907
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:33,640
It might sting a little bit.

908
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:34,980
Let me know if it stings.

909
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:37,420

910
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,010

I'll begin at your left cheek.

911
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:42,610

912
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:43,690

913
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:46,360
- Does it sting? 
 - It's okay.

914
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:55,760
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

915
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,060
I'll do it stronger.

916
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:09,990

917
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:21,890
♫  From your glances that call out to me  ♫

918
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:29,680
♫  Sometimes you're so difficult for me  ♫

919
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,820
♫  At times like that, be by my side  ♫

920
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:35,960
♫  Hold my hand and whisper to me  ♫

921
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:42,270
♫  Let's go fly away  ♫

922
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:45,710

923
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:47,960
 He got kicked out of the hospital because of a medical accident.

924
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:48,980
 This post is just a rumor.

925
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:50,130
 Did a person die or not?

926
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:51,420
 I had a bad feeling about him.

927
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:53,770
 He might be annoying, but I don't think so.

928
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:55,620
 I believe you, Jae Hoon.

929
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:59,010
 You quitting the hospital over what happened, there's a strange rumor online...

930
00:59:59,010 --> 01:00:00,710
 You want to use that for your show, too?

931
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:01,850
 Don't mess with that incident.

932
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:03,330
 You think I'd use that incident?

933
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:06,490
 - Sharing your story was— 
 - You're the one in control anyway.

934
01:00:06,490 --> 01:00:08,500
 I'm a cast member and you're the producer.

935
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:13,370
 I used to like you, and... you were not interested in me.
