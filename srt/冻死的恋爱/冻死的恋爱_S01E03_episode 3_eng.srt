1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:07,990

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,670

3
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:17,750
♫  Dive with you, towards the wide sea  ♫

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,100

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:24,040
♫  Jump in love, I fly with wings called you  ♫

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,090

♫  There is nothing to be afraid of  ♫

7
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:32,130
♫  In the world called you, it sparkles and lingers here  ♫

8
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,660
♫  What I found while wandering was you who 
 was always by my side  ♫

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,070
♫  I'm already ready for you  ♫

10
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,030

11
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:44,890

12
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,600
 I'm leaving.

13
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,350
 Yeah. Sure, go.

14
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,940
You're crazy.

15
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,360
Why would you close your eyes?

16
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,010
 Until the East Sea and Baekdusan are dry and worn away.

17
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,740
 Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name.

18
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,980
 I'm leaving.

19
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,520
 Yeah. Sure, go.

20
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,990
God, you're crazy. Goo Yeo Reum?

21
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,470
Let's be holy, Jae Hoon.

22
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,180
Let's please be holy.

23
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,880
Must you play it out until the end to know?

24
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,840
Let's be holy.

25
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,420

26
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:21,930

(T/N: "But" sounds like friends in Korean)

27
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,440
Hey, on your way to work?

28
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,640
Yeah.

29
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,590
- You, too? 
 - Yeah.

30
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,280
I came out a bit early today.

31
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,640
The bus is here.

32
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,330
- I'm going first! 
 - All right.

33
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,170
Hey, Kang Chae Ri!

34
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,870
Eat this, you piece of trash!

35
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,400
It's a stink bomb made of fish sauce!

36
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,560
Senior!

37
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,820
You fucking bitch!

38
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,640
Come here!

39
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,040
Let go. I said, let go!

40
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,700
Hey, let go!

41
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,980
Sang Woo...

42
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:09,300
Starting today, may I call you Umbrella Man?

43
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,040
I was leaving home this morning

44
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,960
and my mom said it'll rain and told me to take an umbrella.

45
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,540
This is why you need to listen to your mom.

46
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,090
I'm going to sue her.

47
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,230
- I'm the one who's going to sue you! 
 - Hey!

48
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,400
Come here!

49
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,320

50
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:58,770
You want me to work with Kang Chae Ri on season 2 of "Kingdom of Love"?

51
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,390
Why? Is there a problem?

52
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,550
I really don't want to.

53
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,070
I absolutely can't do "Kingdom of Love."

54
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,970
Never.

55
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,390
Yes?

56
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,770
Yes, please have a seat here.

57
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,140
I came to get a diagnosis.

58
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,280
I think my nose is broken.

59
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,010
And I think I'm going to get poop poisoning.

60
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,750
That can be considered a work injury, too. Right?

61
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,540
I really don't think this is right.

62
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,050
I really can't!

63
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,710
I know I screwed up with "Ramen Chef," but

64
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,170
how can you stick me in my colleague's program as a gofer?

65
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,610
Who said you're a gofer?

66
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,030
I just want you and Chae Ri to join forces and do well.

67
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,410
Please...

68
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:50,870
Please just send me somewhere else.

69
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,970
If you just get through this show,

70
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,210
I'll fully support you next time in whatever you want to do.

71
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,780
Director...

72
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,740
God, I was called in by the boss

73
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,740
because of the poop terror incident and apologized for an hour.

74
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,220
I called every entertainment reporter

75
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,560
and begged and pleaded to prevent any articles from being published.

76
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,780
Chae Ri needs to know when to stop.

77
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,070
You know she's got a bizarre streak.

78
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,960
Use this chance to learn a few things from her

79
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,580
and you should balance her out if Kang Chae Ri seems to go overboard.

80
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:26,540
Is there no way to avoid this?

81
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,110
You can't avoid it, so why don't you enjoy it?

82
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,490
Then I have a condition, too.

83
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,990
What is it?

84
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,910
Our team...

85
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,370
The Ramen Team.

86
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,570
Let us all go together.

87
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:52,900
Writers and staff, if I can take everyone, I'll do it.

88
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,930
Your condition, was to worry about other people's payrolls?

89
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,080
Fine.

90
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,130
We're making the program even bigger.

91
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,960
So you can take whomever you want to.

92
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,770
Your nose is fractured.

93
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,220
We can only wait for it to mend naturally.

94
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,160
There's no need for surgery. I'll keep it in place with a bandage.

95
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,410
Slight pain.

96
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,280
Does it hurt that much?

97
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,460
We usually don't even prescribe pain meds for this.

98
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,000
I don't need pain meds.

99
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,210
My noradrenaline is skyrocketing in anger.

100
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,510
I see.

101
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,750
How many weeks does this usually take to heal?

102
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,210
I'll write up three weeks.

103
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,240
Don't blow your nose for one month or rub it excessively.

104
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,220
Okay.

105
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,420
Take care.

106
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,240
Excuse me.

107
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,430
- Doctor... Park Jae Hoon? 
 - Yes?

108
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,170
- How old are you? 
 - I'm 37 years old.

109
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,350
And are you married?

110
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,400
I don't think I need to answer your background check questions.

111
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,090
Oh, yes.

112
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:04,060
Please excuse my—

113
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,310
Please excuse my rudeness.

114
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:09,640
I'm PD Kang Chae Ri, currently producing the program "Kingdom of Love."

115
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,470
You're good-looking...

116
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:14,540
and you have a great resume.

117
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,460
We're preparing for Season 2 this time.

118
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,940
If you're single, would you like to come for an audition?

119
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,780
I don't want to show my face on TV.

120
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,400
You don't want to become famous?

121
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,740
It'll be good for advertising your clinic.

122
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,900
I respectfully and courteously decline.

123
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,840
Okay.

124
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,460
I'm an avid fan of "Animal Kingdom."

125
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,370
Did you get a nose job?

126
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,140
You heard from Director, right?

127
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,150
I look forward to working with you.

128
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,180
Why does it have to be you?

129
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,740
I'm not joining you because I want to, either.

130
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,920
I guess... anyone higher than you is overwhelming,

131
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,640
and anyone lower is a bit ambiguous.

132
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:23,270
Let's... avoid unprofessional and rude language, okay?

133
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:27,110
I needed someone to stay on location 24 hours a day.

134
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,780
I'll sign you up for that.

135
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,860
Hey, you want me to waste my time on location?

136
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,400
What do you mean waste your time?

137
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,090
Let's not use unprofessional language.

138
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,300
There's a general meeting tomorrow afternoon,

139
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,100
so familiarize yourself with the notice before you come in.

140
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,200
- "Ramen Chef"! 
   - We love you!

141
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,330
- Good job. 
 - Good job!

142
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,380
You did great.

143
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,230
PD Yeo Reum.

144
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:03,530
I heard that you accepted "Kingdom of Love" on the condition

145
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,940
that the whole "Ramen Chef" team joins you.

146
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,400
It's fine.

147
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,800
I was at a loss when the program terminated us all of a sudden.

148
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,450
PD Goo, thank you.

149
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,180
Gosh.

150
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,900
Let's all do our best, yeah?

151
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,200
Senior! Please have this.

152
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,230
It's a perfectly grilled piece of pork belly.

153
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,970
But will you be okay?

154
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,420
There was a lot of talk about you going in under Kang Chae Ri.

155
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,460
What can I do?

156
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:33,030
The path of the cross. The path I must take.

157
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,200
Gosh, what can you do? Huh?

158
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,060
You'll have to take all her crap.

159
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,390
We're going there to be sacrifices.

160
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,620
I'll fight crap with shit.

161
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:47,990
I'll take this chance to activate all the crazy bitch cells in my body.

162
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,910
Senior, please have this.

163
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,000
It's a perfectly grilled garlic.

164
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:01,260
Why are you doing this? I'm fine, so you eat.

165
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,680
Watching you throw yourself into "Kingdom of Love,"

166
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,780
respect for you boils from the bottom of my heart.

167
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:11,470
Please continue to eat. I'll... continue to grill.

168
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,400
Sang Woo... did Kang Chae Ri call you?

169
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,390
I did receive a call from Senior Kang Chae Ri recently.

170
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,890
What did you decide to do?

171
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:24,330
I declined when I got the call,

172
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,270
but since you're joining "Kingdom of Love,"

173
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,890
I'm going to follow you, too.

174
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,700
Don't follow me.

175
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,240
You shouldn't join this kind of game.

176
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:39,320
It will be hell that remains in the history of variety shows for a long time.

177
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,180
I'm aware. I'll survive on my own.

178
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:50,390
What's that? Do you like me?

179
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,320
- As a woman? 
 - Yeah.

180
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,600
You're not exactly my type.

181
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,390
But why do you keep following me around?

182
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,260
You can think of me as a chick.

183
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,590
A chick follows the first person it sees after hatching from an egg.

184
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,950
You can write my name down on the history of hell as well.

185
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,140
- Eat up. 
 - You, too.

186
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,130
How nice.

187
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,610

188
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,640
Mom...

189
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,450
Yeo Reum!

190
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,980
Your father suddenly couldn't breathe,

191
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,640
so I called the ambulance.

192
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,000
Mom... I'll be right there!

193
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,280
Hold on. Hold on just a minute!

194
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,330

195
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,400

196
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,370
It's going to sting.

197
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,160
Yeo Reum, what's wrong? Did something happen?

198
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,540
Why are you here?

199
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,780
- I need to go right now. 
 - Where are you going?

200
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,160
Chuncheon...

201
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,870
- Dad's on the ambulance to the hospital. 
 - I-I'll give you a ride.

202
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,920
It's all right. I'll take care of it.

203
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,880
Get on.

204
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,990
Yeah, Mom.

205
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,800
I'm on my way right now.

206
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,700
Dad's in the operating room?

207
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:59,420
Mom, hang in there. I'll be there soon, okay?

208
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,680
Don't cry. It's going to be fine.

209
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,310
Yeah. Okay.

210
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,400

211
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,940
- Mom! 
 - Yeo Reum!

212
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,310
What about Dad?

213
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:45,830
It's... about time for him to come out.

214
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,320
As long as the procedure goes well,

215
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,480
they said he'll recover in no time.

216
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,830
Oh, Mom. You must've been so shocked.

217
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,370
I was.

218
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,880
But thank goodness.

219
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,990
I was going to go to the bathhouse, but I had a weird feeling, so I just stayed home.

220
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,620
What would've happened if your dad was home alone?

221
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,830
It could've been terrible. Oh, my gosh.

222
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,320
It's okay, Mom. It's okay.

223
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,420
Honey!

224
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,260
- Honey! 
 - Dad!

225
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:26,050
Honey... Yeo Reum...

226
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:29,720
The results of the angiography

227
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,780
found a highly stenotic area, so I inserted a stent.

228
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,580
And the procedure went well.

229
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,250
We'll keep an eye on him in the recovery room,

230
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,380
and then send him to the in-patient room.

231
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,810
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.

232
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:45,710
Thank you. Thank you.

233
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,040
I'm fine now.

234
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,890
Don't worry too much.

235
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,610
I'll see you in the room.

236
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,650
Okay, Honey.

237
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,660
Dad, are you feeling better?

238
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,860
Gosh, why did you scare her over nothing serious?

239
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,720
What do you mean, Dad?

240
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,720
How is this not serious?

241
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,300
You suddenly couldn't breathe.

242
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,080
How could I not contact her?

243
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,020
Why did you make her come all the way here when she has work tomorrow?

244
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:38,360
But it's nice to see my daughter's face.

245
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:46,400
Dad, I'm sorry.

246
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,730
I don't even live that far, but I don't visit because I'm busy.

247
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:54,240
I was... going to make the squash pancakes you like.

248
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,190
Dad! Are squash pancakes important right now?

249
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,690
Take care of yourself.

250
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:02,880
You don't even take the vitamins I sent you because you're too lazy, right?

251
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,610
He doesn't even think about it unless I get him water and put them in his hands.

252
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:09,600
How great would it be if he could just remember to take them himself?

253
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,560
You think it's just the vitamins?

254
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,490
Cheonggukjang herbal medicine and everything else. 
  (T/N: Fermented bean paste)

255
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:16,570
Even if we buy him all the healthiest stuff, he won't eat them.

256
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,190
All right.

257
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,930
I'll remember to take them now.

258
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,300
Oh, and daughter!

259
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,210
Who's the young man waiting outside?

260
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,040
It's her ex-boyfriend from long ago!

261
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,930
Kim In Woo.

262
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,690
Mom... How did you know, Mom?

263
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,640
You showed me his photo a long time ago.

264
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,670
You remember that?

265
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:47,080
You think I would forget the man my daughter showed me?

266
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,170
After wasting your youthful days,

267
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:55,070
why are you meeting the guy who ran off at the cusp of your marriageable age again?

268
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,350
It wasn't like that.

269
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,130
He came all the way here with you when you're not even dating?

270
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:02,950
It's not what you're thinking.

271
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,870
Anyway, I'm thankful for him.

272
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:10,000
He accompanied you all the way here because you were in shock.

273
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,690
How's your father?

274
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,510
They'll keep an eye on him until the day after tomorrow

275
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:37,110
and if he's all right, he'll be discharged.

276
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:42,000
Thanks for today.

277
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,440
You should go home first.

278
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,880
What about you?

279
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,560
I'm going to stay a bit longer

280
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,850
and take the first bus back.

281
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,390
I'll wait for you. Let's go together.

282
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,490
If you're uncomfortable with me being here, I'll wait in the car.

283
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,460
Yeo Reum.

284
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,940
Dad wants you to go home.

285
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,350
Go home and come back on your day off. You have work tomorrow.

286
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,580
I can stay a bit longer.

287
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,290
Dad needs to sleep.

288
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,060
What more can you do than just sit there?

289
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:17,730
I'm tired, too, so I'm going to sleep next to Dad.

290
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,160
You're my daughter's ex-boyfriend, right?

291
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,470
Hello, Mother.

292
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,600
It's nice to meet you. I'm Kim In Woo.

293
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,280
Thank you for today.

294
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,240
I leave my daughter in your care until she returns to Seoul.

295
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,860
That day... I went back to you.

296
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:26,630
I got off the closest exit and returned to the rest area,

297
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,780
but I couldn't find you no matter how hard I looked for you.

298
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:39,120
 If you're not going to stay in Korea, then just go back alone.

299
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:54,350

300
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,230

301
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,470
 Yeo Reum!

302
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:35,200
 Goo Yeo Reum! Goo Yeo Reum!

303
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,230
 Yeo Reum!

304
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,500
I'm sorry.

305
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,010
For just leaving... that day like that.

306
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:01,560
Both of us... were being emotional.

307
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:06,100
It's not anyone's fault.

308
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:10,690
Things just... happened that way.

309
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:14,890
I was so resentful of the highway.

310
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:17,010
I couldn't make a u-turn.

311
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:20,130
And it took too long to return.

312
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,460
From then on,

313
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,000
I kept regretting.

314
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:35,480
I'm sorry it took... so long to...

315
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,400
return to you.

316
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,980
She's not picking up her phone.

317
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,690
Is something going on?

318
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,490
Thanks for today.

319
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,780
Be careful going home.

320
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,570
Yeo Reum,

321
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:49,960
I'm hungry because I skipped dinner.

322
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,780
Can... I eat something before I leave?

323
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,920
The plant grew a lot.

324
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:35,340
I don't get to water it often, but it grows well on its own.

325
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:40,040
Everything around you is like that.

326
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,910
They become full of life and special.

327
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,150
I watched all of the programs you created.

328
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,560
I watched all of "Ramen Chef"

329
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,880
and enjoyed the pilot program you debuted with as well.

330
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,320
What did you watch it for?

331
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,460
I broke up with you because of that.

332
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:12,170
I like the programs you make because they're heartwarming.

333
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,220
Yeo Reum.

334
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:33,740
Yeah.

335
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:39,670
I... haven't yet.

336
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,210
I haven't gotten over you yet.

337
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,020
She brings home a guy at one in the morning?

338
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,570
Goo Yeo Reum is so liberal.

339
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:16,080
I think I have indigestion. What will make it go away?

340
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,300
What do I do?

341
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,650
Gosh, I have indigestion at this time. What can I do?

342
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:29,000
That's right. At this time...

343
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,640
exercise is the way. Arm exercises.

344
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,740
Here we go.

345
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,120
Should I work out my biceps? Or my shoulders? The triceps?

346
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,690
All right.

347
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,630
I don't have strength in my arm!

348
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,950
What was that sound?

349
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:02,260
Jae Hoon lives upstairs.

350
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,250
Pa-Park Jae Hoon?

351
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,210
He lives upstairs?

352
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,870
Yeah.

353
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:16,530
Cleaning is best when done at dawn.

354
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:21,350
All right, I think I'm almost done,

355
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,950
so should I do the rest tomorrow?

356
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:28,330
Metal pots are best when dented.

357
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,650
Right?

358
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,340
At dawn... we listen to hip-hop.

359
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,530
All right. Music, start.

360
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:04,360
- The ramen will get soggy. Hurry and eat. 
 - Okay.

361
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,210
Is it usually this loud?

362
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:18,910
No. He's usually not like this, but...

363
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:23,200
maybe he's blasting the music, thinking that I'm not home?

364
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,720
At least you won't be bored since your schoolmate lives upstairs.

365
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,820
It does feel safer than being alone.

366
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:54,690
Next time, let's eat out at a nice place.

367
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,950
Thanks for today.

368
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,760
Get home safely.

369
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,800
 Jae Hoon!

370
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,120
 Park Jae Hoon!

371
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,490
What the hell are you doing in the middle of the night?

372
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:51,210
- You're doing this on purpose, right? 
 - Me?

373
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,590
Doing what?

374
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:55,230
You're doing this on purpose because you knew that I was with Kim In Woo!

375
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,510
Kim In Woo was here? I didn't know at all.

376
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,870
He was here, huh?

377
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:05,000
Why didn't you answer your phone, though?

378
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,520
I went to my parents' home.

379
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,330
Chuncheon?

380
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:12,460
My dad...

381
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:16,800
got an emergency stent treatment because he was diagnosed with angina.

382
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,220
How is he doing now?

383
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:26,820
The procedure was done well, so we just need to keep a watch for a few days.

384
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,170
When you called me earlier...

385
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:31,650
I was working. Sorry.

386
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,920
I'm going.

387
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,450
Okay.

388
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,520
Quiet down, please.

389
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,770
Ms. Ji Yeon!

390
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,220
What do you think about the art display path?

391
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,410
It's nice.

392
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:11,040
My dad would also be satisfied, I think.

393
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,660
This exhibition is getting a lot of attention from everyone in the art field and

394
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:18,490
also from ordinary people, so it's quite a bit of pressure.

395
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:21,310
Please take good care and thank you.

396
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:24,110
I need to let the young people do it on their own,

397
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,950
but I can't help getting curious.

398
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:29,500
What do you think about my son?

399
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:34,020
We're getting close slowly.

400
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,460
I'd really love for you and my son to end up together.

401
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,310
I really like you, Ms. Ji Yeon.

402
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:44,690
Center Director...

403
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:49,200
I didn't know that your husband passed away.

404
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,520
I see... You didn't know...

405
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,320
It's been three years.

406
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,660
I told my dad, and he was also quite surprised.

407
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,700
Back then, I was too shocked and

408
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,510
couldn't accept my husband's death,

409
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:05,060
so I didn't make it known to anyone.

410
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:10,200
Even Jae Hoon, who's been living like a textbook example,

411
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,850
changed a lot after his dad passed away.

412
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:30,510

413
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,730
 What are you doing?

414
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,570

415
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:07,780
 I'm hanging out at home on my day off.

416
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,020
 Please have a good day.

417
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,180
What's this?

418
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,080
Is he saying that he's free today or

419
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,860
is he telling me to get lost because he doesn't want to text?

420
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,180

421
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,330
- Mr. Kim Joon Ho? 
 - Yes.

422
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:28,060
Please come in.

423
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,660
Hello.

424
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,940
- Hello. 
  - Hello.

425
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:38,830
We'll start the interview in... three, two, one!

426
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,880
Hello, my name is Kim Joon Ho.

427
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,890
Nice to meet you.

428
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:46,340
You're a CEO of a startup?

429
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,210
- A dating app? 
 - Yes, I am.

430
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:50,770
Are you trying to advertise your company in our program?

431
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:51,750
Can I not do that?

432
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:54,660
Look for a lover and advertise my company...

433
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,880
it's a good opportunity, right?

434
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,830
It's good that you're honest.

435
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:03,960
Could you tell us what you think makes you attractive?

436
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,160
First of all, I'm pretty big.

437
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,080
Quite big, in fact.

438
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:12,160
Your height is average...

439
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,700
and you don't seem to be bulked up.

440
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,970
What are you saying is big?

441
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:19,920
Well, my ambition is big and my vision for the future is also big...

442
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,660
as well as my confidence.

443
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,680
You do know that our program is a spicy one, right?

444
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,130
Of course. I know well.

445
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:28,170
I get that your ambition and...

446
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:30,790
vision for the future is big.

447
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,110
Is it big?

448
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:41,370
Could you show us?

449
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,630
Do I really need to show?

450
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,280
Yes.

451
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,630
You're an ice hockey player?

452
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,560
Yes, I've been playing since elementary school.

453
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,880
Have you dated a lot of people?

454
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,980
About three times.

455
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,850
You have less experience than I thought...

456
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:06,130
although you look like you'd be popular.

457
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:09,480
I like to date one person for a long time.

458
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:13,550
How long was your longest relationship?

459
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,630
I dated my first crush for ten years.

460
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,170
 - Whoa...  
 - Ten years?

461
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,320
He doesn't really look like that type.

462
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,510
Your name is... Hwang Jang Goon? 
  (T/N: Jang Goon means a military general in Korean)

463
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,450
Gingko bed? 
  (T/N: A Korean drama, the main character's name is General Hwang)

464
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:26,440
Well, it was embarrassing when I was young,

465
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,800
but since everyone memorizes my name quickly because it's unique.

466
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,740
So, yeah. I like it now.

467
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:36,100
Can you do General Hwang impressions and such?

468
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:39,830
I did prepare one.

469
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:51,910
There's a man...

470
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,930
who loved only one woman

471
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:56,880
with a thousand years like a day stubbornly.

472
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,000
What is that?

473
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,530
I'll clean up everything.

474
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:05,910
- I'll clean it up. 
 - It's okay.

475
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,460
Hey.

476
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,020
My name is Gabee, hello.

477
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:12,270
I do go on blind dates and... I like a man who is a...

478
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:13,310
friendly person.

479
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,280
So you care about looks, right?

480
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,160
I care a lot.

481
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:24,020
I also wonder if I'm too calculative.

482
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,000
I think people who run shops make similar income.

483
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,880
The beautiful Announcer Park Su Yeon is...

484
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,910
Eating late at night and tteokbokki...

485
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:30,710
That's a no can do.

486
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:33,450
A man who can rely on me...

487
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:37,090
I came because my director said that I'm handsome.

488
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,570
I like someone who leads.

489
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,310
Like Prince Charming...

490
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,430
Namaste. 
  (T/N: A Hindu greeting)

491
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:44,520
Raise your body slowly like this and...

492
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,190
Hello.

493
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:49,430
My name is Park Ji Wan.

494
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,120
You're a famous webtoon artist?

495
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:57,450
Do you have a special reason for applying to our program?

496
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:01,150
Well... to be honest...

497
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,390
I've never dated anyone.

498
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:05,160
You know the kind of person...

499
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,180
who lacks presence and is never noticeable...

500
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,730
wherever she goes.

501
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:12,770
That's me.

502
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:14,770
I applied because

503
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:18,680
I wanted to be the main character at least once in my life.

504
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,490
You seem to have a shy personality,

505
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:24,890
but would you be able to enthusiastically show off your charms on air?

506
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:27,940
That's why I prepared a talent.

507
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,380
Could I show you?

508
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,210
Please show us.

♫  Four weeks in the summer, I should know better than to  ♫

514
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:56,000
♫  Let things grow bigger than it gets  ♫

515
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,180

516
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,440

517
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,070
The fat girl will never do.

518
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,270
I like her, though.

519
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:07,690
Do you want to ruin our program?

520
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:12,780
Can't stand the sight of a full girl like her coming out and liking someone.

521
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,100
Not somebody who wants to be a celeb.

522
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,300
Somebody who really wants to find love should come out.

523
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:21,610
Our job is to show the viewers what they want to see, plainly.

524
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:24,940
Isn't the plain reality what the viewers want to see?

525
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:29,220
Viewers nowadays... have a need for love stories that sound like theirs and their friends'.

526
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,900
"Kingdom of Love" is popular because

527
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:35,560
it shows the emotions in a relationship plainly in its entirety.

528
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:40,480
Don't cast just the ones that look like Barbie dolls.

529
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,540
Let's make it balanced. Evenly.

530
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,660
She'll only get hurt if she comes out.

531
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,750
That's up to how we do it.

532
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:49,430
It's my program. It's the program that I planned.

533
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:53,740
Because you're the planner, I respect your opinion.

534
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:58,320
But let's make at least one of the love lines genuine.

535
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,540
Okay.

536
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,050
Let's put her in.

537
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:09,440
Instead, I'll check the ratings every time that fat girl comes on screen.

538
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,690
You take responsibility if the ratings by minute fall.

539
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:14,770
Fine. I'll take responsibility.

540
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:22,810
Hey, pick out a man for her since

541
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:25,160
we have to make each pair compatible.

542
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,530
Do we have anyone?

543
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:28,580
Kang Chae Ri...

544
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,200
PD.

545
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,880
Let's call her Ms. Park Ji Wan with manners.

546
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:40,240
Sorry.

547
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,430
Let's pick out a male candidate for our plus-sized Ms. Park Ji Wan

548
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:47,180
who would go well with her.

549
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,540
Is there a guy who looks like an anchovy anywhere?

550
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,840
Someone who's like an anchovy.

551
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,820
You know what I mean, right?

552
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,270

553
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,350
- Honey, make sure to chew. 
 - Okay.

554
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:39,560
It's so delicious.

555
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,730
Hello?

556
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:49,780
Mom, how's Dad doing?

557
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,430
He's recovering well.

558
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:55,030
He even walked around the block once today in front of the hospital.

559
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:57,190
 Your dad is in such a great condition,

560
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:59,460
so don't worry.

561
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:02,970
I'm really glad.

562
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:06,190
Sweetie! The lunch box is so delicious!

563
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:07,420
 Thank you!

564
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,850
Lunch box? What lunch box?

565
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:12,050
Didn't you have the lunch box delivered?

566
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:15,100
 There's bulgogi, abalone, and salad.

567
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:18,070
We're enjoying it so much

568
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:22,390
with other patients, the doctor, and the nurses.

569
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:25,280
My gosh. That wasn't me, though.

570
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,070
Then who ordered them?

571
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:29,710
Did In Woo send them?

572
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:34,230
 Sweetie! All the side dishes are my style!

573
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:36,960
They're so delicious!

574
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,190
Your dad is overreacting saying, "This taste

575
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:44,190
is out of this world!"

576
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:49,490
Anyhow, please tell him that we enjoyed it.

577
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:51,430
Okay.

578
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:53,320
Yes.

579
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:18,340
Now that I think about it, I don't even know his number.

580
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:31,820

581
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:34,450
 When are you coming home?

582
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:39,550

583
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,080
 I'm on my way home now.

584
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:46,450
 Hey, do you have potatoes at home?

585
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:48,160
 No, but why?

586
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,480
 Buy me two potatoes on the way home.

587
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,710
Why potatoes out of nowhere?

588
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,980
Gosh, seriously.

589
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,300
What are you doing, being naked?

590
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,310
It hurts too much...

591
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:09,320
I was tanning on the rooftop and...

592
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:13,150
What a smart thing to do.

593
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:14,720
Where are you going?

594
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,480
Why did you become so cold?

595
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,120
You need to help me put potatoes on my back.

596
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,110
No. I'm absolutely not doing it.

597
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:23,050
You can't say that. Can you leave me even upon seeing my back?

598
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:24,130
Can you?

599
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:26,100
Come in.

600
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:30,490
- Come in! 
 - Gosh, seriously.

601
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:38,290
Stop making weird groaning sounds.

602
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:41,100
- When did I? 
 - Right now!

603
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,770
- That thing. 
 - It's because it hurts.

604
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:46,340
Whoa, there...

605
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,260
It feels a lot better... with the potatoes...

606
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:51,950
Here.

607
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:57,140
I'm done with all of them, so don't move and stay put.

608
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,840
Okay.

609
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,760
Goo Yeo Reum, your dad's being discharged tomorrow. Right?

610
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,580
- How did you know that? 
 - I talked with your mom this morning.

611
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:14,250
I talked to his doctor because your mom gave the phone to him.

612
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:17,160
- What did he say? 
 - Don't worry too much.

613
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,690
His prognosis seemed to be good.

614
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:22,940
Also... give that envelope on the dining table to your mom.

615
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,130
What's this for?

616
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:32,630
To help cover the hospital fees.

617
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,640
What's this, Park Jae Hoon? It's a bit touching.

618
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,510
The potatoes on Oppa's back fell off.

619
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:40,990
Okay, Oppa!

620
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:42,380
- Here, here. 
 - Where?

621
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:44,150
Put it on properly.

622
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:46,520
- Is it cooling? 
 - It's cooling.

623
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,280
I feel like I can live.

624
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,740
Thank you for saving my life.

625
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:55,310
Kim In Woo hugged you while eating ramen?

626
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:58,220
Whoa, great.

627
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:00,790
Describe more in detail.

628
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:02,780
Was it a sneaky hug or...

629
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:05,850
did he go at you passionately as if to eat you up?

630
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:09,380
Technically... it was quite...

631
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:12,280
on the passionate side.

632
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,540
So?

633
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:16,260
He hugged you and then?

634
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,400
For now...

635
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,080
that's all we did.

636
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:24,140
Seriously...

637
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:25,970
So what are you going to do?

638
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:28,500
I don't know.

639
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,500
It's just quite sudden...

640
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:35,240
I'm just glad to see him after a long time...

641
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,080
and the familiar feeling is nice...

642
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,750
My heart does tremble a little because it's been forever since someone

643
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:43,950
looked at me with those eyes.

644
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:45,290
Those eyes?

645
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:47,200
What eyes?

646
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:51,390
The melodramatic eyes. Melodramatic eyes!

647
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:54,010
- Come here! 
 - Don't do it!

648
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:56,350
Gosh, really!

649
00:48:56,990 --> 00:48:58,490
Wait a minute.

650
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:00,330
You said a long time ago that

651
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:03,440
you can't date anyone else because

652
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,750
you gave all of your love to Kim In Woo and

653
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:08,700
received all the love in your life from him.

654
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,880
I... did say that.

655
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,070
That Kim In Woo came back.

656
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,400
It feels so good to sweat it out for once.

657
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,080
I know. Going to work?

658
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,160
No, it's my day off.

659
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,790
- I'm going. 
 - Okay, take care.

660
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,860
Yes, Honey. It's me.

661
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,070
Damn.

662
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:55,460
Hey, bring rice from the rice cooker.

663
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:08,940
What's this?

664
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:11,330
You said you made something delicious. Where is the delicious stuff?

665
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:12,520
It's here. The spinach.

666
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,680
You've finally gone mad.

667
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,500
Is spinach something delicious?

668
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,850
Just have a bite.

669
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,160
I'm being fooled again.

670
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:29,380
It tastes good, right? This is Hye Jin's cooking.

671
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,150
Spinach just tastes like spinach.

672
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:34,140
The smell of spring is dancing in your mouth.

673
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:39,490
It's going to get soggy. Hurry up and eat.

674
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:49,530
Kim In Woo and Goo Yeo Reum are seeing again, I heard?

675
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,760
They're seeing again?

676
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:56,680
- Is that what Hye Jin said? 
 - No.

677
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:57,920
I don't know. What?

678
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,630
What's that? They're seeing again?

679
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:02,460
What are you saying? Are they dating again or not?

680
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,130
Well... thinking about it,

681
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:07,280
it's not that they're dating again but just seeing each other.

682
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,080
You know, "Long time no see."

683
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:14,180
Hey, that bastard suddenly showed up

684
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,610
in front of Yeo Reum's house looking all cool.

685
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,570
You almost had me.

686
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,430
It's good for her.

687
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:22,800
Right, it's good for her.

688
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,000
Yeo Reum did like that guy a lot, right?

689
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,550
- I'm going. 
 - Okay.

690
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,720
Take care.

691
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,870
- You came? 
 - Yes, I'm leaving.

692
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:50,150
Okay, take care.

693
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,810
Honey, as you told me to,

694
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:01,970
I lured him with the spinach and interrogated him.

695
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:03,240
Yes, and...?

696
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,360
You were completely...

697
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:07,510
off the radar.

698
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:08,750
What did I tell you?

699
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,270
Why? What did he say?

700
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:11,840
He doesn't care at all.

701
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,010
He didn't care even though you talked about Kim In Woo?

702
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:17,190
Then what? Did you think he'd flip the table or somethinhg?

703
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:20,450
No, even if it's not that much of a reaction...

704
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:24,980
maybe he flinched or he looked like he was uncomfortable?

705
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,700
Completely no interest.

706
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,770
I catch on to people so fast.

707
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:31,620
Gosh, that can't be, though.

708
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:35,110
Honey, you seem to be greatly mistaken, but

709
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:37,000
Jae Hoon and Yeo Reum are not in a man and a woman relationship.

710
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,100
That makes me want to puke. They're more like...

711
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,640
a human and another human.

712
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,300
No, not at all.

713
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:45,830
I gave this some thought.

714
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:48,990
We need to help them, so they end up together.

715
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:50,450
Their genre is bromance.

716
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:53,640
Why do you keep making it a melodramatic romance?

717
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,230
Gosh, never mind! You never get what I'm saying.

718
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:58,570
I have a great instinct.

719
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:01,750
Goo Yeo Reum and Park Jae Hoon...

720
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:03,280
Gosh, it's giving me goosebumps.

721
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,140
- That can't be, seriously! 
 - No, it's not!

722
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:09,470
Even Park Jae Hoon and I have more possibilities.

723
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:12,760
You're just pretty but don't have a good sense.

724
00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:15,700
Be quiet!

725
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:18,150
Goo Yeo Reum and Park Jae Hoon?

726
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:39,590
Go this way and...

727
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,390
pick it up...

728
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:46,510
What are you doing?

729
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:48,410
I'm trying to adopt a pet bear

730
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:51,770
because my life is so lonely.

731
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:55,110
It worked, it worked!

732
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:01,540
You give it a try. I'll pay. Hurry.

733
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:03,000
I don't want to.

734
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,860
Please get it for me.

735
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:07,780
How dare you act like you're cute?

736
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,610
Hey, Goo Yeo Reum, you're almost 40 now.

737
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:11,870
Stop liking teddy bears and stuff.

738
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:13,210
It's gross.

739
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:14,840
Gross—

740
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,700
Hey, where are you going?

741
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,570
Internet cafe.

742
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,230
How petty.

743
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:24,040
Forget you.

744
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,740
I can just get it myself.

745
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:30,390
It's going to work for real.

746
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:32,130
It worked.

747
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,530

748
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,700
Hello?

749
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,090
 Yeo Reum, it's me.

750
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:49,900
 Do you want to have...

751
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,850
 dinner with me today?

752
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,980
It doesn't feel real to be eating with you like this.

753
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,810
I was alone in New York a week ago.

754
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:18,470
I'll pay for dinner today.

755
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:20,660
You did me a favor last time and

756
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:23,490
I'm also thankful for the lunch box.

757
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:25,170
Lunch box?

758
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:26,950
The lunch box.

759
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,760
It wasn't you, Oppa?

760
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,330
No.

761
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:34,700
I don't think it was me.

762
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,060
How was it in New York?

763
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:46,620
Well... I was doing well.

764
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:49,670
I worked and traveled a bit.

765
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:56,020
Were you okay after dumping me?

766
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:01,490
It was hard for a while...

767
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:03,740
and I became okay.

768
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,290
I got it this time.

769
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:16,460
Gosh, seriously.

770
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:23,450
 Are you coming to my dad's personal exhibition pre-open party?

771
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,690
 I should. See you then.

772
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,990
He cuts it off once again.

773
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:40,380
Does he find texting to be bothersome?

774
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:44,660
Shit...

775
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,670
Why didn't it get pressed?

776
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:03,520
Oppa.

777
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,880
Yes?

778
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:09,050
Why did you come back?

779
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:14,060
You should've just lived well somewhere.

780
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:16,530
Why did you come to me?

781
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:19,400
What are you trying to do now at this point?

782
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,980
Yeo Reum.

783
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:36,700
Yes.

784
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:55,580
Let's get married.

785
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:03,110
I came to...

786
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:05,860
ask you to marry me again.

787
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:32,220
Coming home now?

788
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:33,760
Yes.

789
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:35,860
Did you go somewhere?

790
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:39,090
Yeah. I had dinner with Kim In Woo.

791
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:40,770
I see.

792
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,090
Yeo Reum.

793
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:45,990
Yes?

794
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:48,860
Are you two seeing each other again?

795
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:57,930
- Jae Hoon. 
 - Yes.

796
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:03,400
Should I...

797
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:10,040
marry Kim In Woo?

798
00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:22,010

799
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:30,230
♫  What can make me flutter in the wind like this  ♫

800
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:35,220
♫  Carrying pink imaginations between the two of us  ♫

801
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:38,210
♫  I don't even blink  ♫

802
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:42,600
♫  I can't believe this feeling  ♫

803
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:50,800
♫  You gently blow into my bleak daily life  ♫

804
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:57,740
♫  In the flow, something changed.  Oh stop it, no!  ♫

805
00:59:57,740 --> 00:59:59,960
♫  The wind, called you   ♫

806
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:03,010

807
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:05,760
 Apparently, Kim In Woo asked Yeo Reum to marry him.

808
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,140
 - What are you going to do? 
 - Do I need to do something?

809
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:08,750
 You like Yeo Reum.

810
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:11,490
 Hey, something would've happened with Goo Yeo Reum and me if we were meant to be.

811
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:14,920
 Why do you always answer my text with short replies?

812
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,730
 Are you still not interested in me after seeing me a few times?

813
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:18,170
 You're very aggressive in pursuing me.

814
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:20,230
 Delivered to Senior Yeo Reum.

815
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:23,470
 Wouldn't it be more problematic if I asked you to date me after all this time?

816
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:25,720
 I don't believe in friendship between a man and a woman.

817
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:27,090
 You make yourself clear, too.

818
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:28,460
 Don't marry Kim In Woo.

819
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:30,340
 I want to try dating you.

820
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:33,440
♫  I get dizzy  ♫

821
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:34,750
♫  You  ♫
