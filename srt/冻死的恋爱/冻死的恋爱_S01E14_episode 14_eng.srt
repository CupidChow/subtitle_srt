1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:08,070

2
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,670

3
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:17,730
♫  Dive with you, towards the wide sea  ♫

4
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,040

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,090
♫  Jump in love, I fly with wings called you  ♫

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,100

♫  There is nothing to be afraid of  ♫

7
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,100
♫  In the world called you, it sparkles and lingers here  ♫

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,720
♫  What I found while wandering was you who 
 was always by my side  ♫

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,230
♫  I'm already ready for you  ♫

10
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,170

11
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,800

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,440
Thank you for signing up to be a part of the cast of "Kingdom of Love, Season 2."

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,630
Finally, we'll ask you the same question we asked everyone else.

14
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:59,820
What do you think love is?

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,970
L-Love?

16
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,910
- Well... 
 - Love is...

17
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,620
Love?

18
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,700
Love is...

19
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,170
Carbohydrates!

20
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,520
Supposedly, beautiful and abundant things

21
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,800
like love, mercy, and consideration for others

22
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,620
all come from carbohydrates.

23
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,940
When I was younger, I thought love was when you get butterflies and your heart beats faster,

24
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,670
but now I think of love as

25
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,010
something that makes me feel at peace and stable.

26
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,190
Oh, can I be honest?

27
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,210
I think of love as a partnership in gratifying one's desires

28
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,760
where you gain some amount of satisfaction from.

29
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,580
That's what I think love is.

30
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,530
In technical terms, it's called libido.

31
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,090
Love is like a mirage.

32
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,720
You can't tell if it's really there or not, but you want it.

33
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,480
You desperately want it.

34
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,310
It's close to a state of mania.

35
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,730
I tend to be on the more rational side.

36
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,110
But when I really like someone, I go crazy.

37
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,790
That's why I try my best not to like anyone.

38
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,040
But...

39
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,310
sometimes, I want to have something burning in me, go crazy,

40
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,200
and meet someone that I would go nuts for.

41
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,370
I think of love as looking together in the same direction.

42
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,210
Instead of looking at each other but looking in the same direction together.

43
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,050
Love is when you are affectionate toward another person.

44
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,060
I think love is when you're more focused on that person's well-being,

45
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,490
and you want that person to be happy whenever and wherever they are.

46
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,030
In love, there is eros,

47
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,120
and also plastic love as well. Right?

48
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,340
For me, rather than plastic love,

49
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,430
I think my understanding of love is closer to eros love.

50
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,600
Plastic?

51
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,570
- Platonic! 
 - Platonic.

52
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,590
It's not plastic?

53
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,430
Then what's plastic? A love that never biodegrades!

54
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,120
It's pretty much platonic love.

55
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,660
Love is a luxury.

56
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,020
For me, it was a luxury.

57
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,640
But now that I'm fairly well off now, I want to try it.

58
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,870
Love, dating, stuff like that...

59
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,960
But it's a bit hard.

60
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,420
Well, I don't really know how to do it.

61
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,080
Would I be able to do it in the "Kingdom of Love"?

62
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,390
 Shall we try it once?

63
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,870
 Oh, that would be great. PD!

64
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,480
 If you would only pick me...

65
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,390

66
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,710

67
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,590
Get in.

68
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:11,990
Aren't you breaking the rules by coming to my workplace?

69
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,090
What do you want?

70
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,230
Your sister broke off the engagement.

71
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,340
It's all your fault.

72
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,780
Why... is that my fault?

73
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,920
I shouldn't have allowed someone so dirty as you into my family.

74
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:35,510
I knew something like this would happen one day because of you.

75
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,580
I'm to blame for my mistake.

76
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,840
If your mom was going to die, she should have taken her child with her.

77
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,570
Why did she leave you behind when she died?

78
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,670
You're at it again.

79
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:52,330
The same repertoire for the past 30 years.

80
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:57,050
I wish you would just disappear from this world.

81
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,360
Life... is a bit more persevering than you think.

82
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,670
How could you be so shameless like that?

83
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,470
I'll be going if you're done taking out your anger out on me.

84
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,270
You don't look good.

85
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,770
I suppose...

86
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:00,600
you're always in a bad mood, Kang Chae Ri.

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,490
You always seem to be interested in other people's business.

88
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,290
I'm really not that type.

89
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:17,450
You've got a lot on your mind because of the show ending early. Right?

90
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,870
Well, it's certainly not a good feeling.

91
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,200
It's not your fault, PD.

92
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,160
Things don't always go the way you want.

93
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,030
Can I ask you something?

94
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,800
Ask away.

95
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:39,090
What do you think love is, Park Jae Hoon?

96
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,840
That question was so out of the blue.

97
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,010
We asked the cast members the same question during the pre-show interview.

98
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,960
I just rewatched it while preparing for the last episode.

99
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,980
I'm curious about your answer as well, Park Jae Hoon.

100
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,940
Wouldn't it be a combination of hormones such as oxytocin, serotonin, and dopamine,

101
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,090
for the evolutionary purpose of reproduction?

102
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,620
What do you think? Is this answer

103
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,980
one you'd approve of, Kang Chae Ri?

104
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,870
Do you seriously believe that?

105
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,840
Come on. Obviously, I'm joking.

106
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:14,330
Well, if I were to answer sincerely,

107
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:19,440
I think of love as being by someone's side to the very end.

108
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,880
I think that's what love is.

109
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:36,530
Kang Chae Ri... what do you think love is?

110
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,520
You were the one who planned this great show called "Kingdom of Love."

111
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,730
What did you think love was that you made such a show?

112
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,530
Being abandoned.

113
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,990
You become last even though you were first.

114
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,840
And then,

115
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,550
dying.

116
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,290
And the life of the one resulting from such great love...

117
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,650
becomes forever miserable.

118
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,290
That's... the love that I know.

119
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,970

120
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,930

121
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,400

122
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,420
Yeo Reum.

123
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,300
Jae Hoon.

124
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,820
What are you doing here?

125
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,220
Were you waiting for me?

126
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,860
Well, yeah... I was waiting a bit because I missed you.

127
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,200
Look at this.

128
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,730
It's a heart!

129
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,240
It's cute, right?

130
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,150
Wow.

131
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,780
While I was waiting for you,

132
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,550
it fell to the ground, but it caught my eye.

133
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,470
So I picked it up.

134
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,460
Wow, this is so cool.

135
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,610
- It's cute, right? 
 - Yeah.

136
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,210
- Right? 
 - Yeah.

137
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,800
Park Jae Hoon?

138
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,730
Park Jae Hoonnam.  
  (T/N: Handsome guy)

139
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:34,840
No, I should be Park Jae Hoonjae. 
  (T/N: Smoked food)

140
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,950
Like Park Jae Hoonjae-ori? 
  (T/N: Smoked duck)

141
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,160
Yeah, Park Jae Hoonjae-ori.

142
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,380
Who is it?

143
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,720
Oh, PD. What brings you here at this hour?

144
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,560
Do you want to...

145
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,210
sleep with me once?

146
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,820
Excuse me?

147
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,650
You don't want to?

148
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,150
W-W-What is this...

149
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,410
Is this like a hidden camera...

150
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,420
Is it something like that?

151
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,970
Well, I mean...

152
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,290
Come inside for now.

153
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,220
So...

154
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:33,710
Why do you... want to sleep with me?

155
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,920
If you don't want to, I'll be on my way.

156
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,370
Yeah, Jae Hoon.

157
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,840
Right now?

158
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,740
- Jae Hoon. 
 - Sorry for calling you out when you're busy.

159
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,360
No, it's fine.

160
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,500
What is it you want to tell me?

161
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,790
- Today is... the final decision day. 
 - Yeah,

162
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,950
I am... going to choose Han Ji Yeon.

163
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,450
I wanted to tell you first.

164
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,110
You're the reason I came to the "Kingdom of Love."

165
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,710
My feelings are for you, too. But...

166
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,050
I can't just leave Han Ji Yeon by herself in front of the cameras

167
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,510
and turn my back on her.

168
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:54,960
Since I made the decision to appear in "Kingdom of Love"

169
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,130
and I believe that I need to take responsibility

170
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:01,180
for whatever consequences result from it.

171
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,710
That is so like Park Jae Hoon.

172
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:12,180
All right. I think what you're saying is right, too.

173
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,920

174
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,570
 We're going to start shooting.

175
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,830
 Before you make your final decision,

176
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:12,110
 please take a moment to remember what you felt and experienced in this place.

177
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,200
 You can present a sweet cake to the one you would like to be with

178
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,860
 when you go back to your everyday life.

179
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,970
PD Goo, what do we do?

180
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,390
I can't find So Yeon anywhere.

181
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,490
- What do you mean? 
 - She's not in her room.

182
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:31,760
I looked everywhere she might be, but she was not there.

183
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,000
Gosh, we have to start shooting now, though.

184
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,360
When did you last see her?

185
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,580
Well... this morning.

186
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,050
She was definitely here until the morning.

187
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,630
Ahn So Yeon disappeared?

188
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,300
Yeah.

189
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,070
I had the entire staff look for her for 30 minutes,

190
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,190
but she's nowhere to be seen.

191
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,730
Talk about pulling all the stops...

192
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,820
She ran away out of embarrassment.

193
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,840
What shall we do?

194
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,530
Postpone the shooting until we find her?

195
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,360
Let's just go with it.

196
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,040
She's a side character, anyway.

197
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,530
Even so, it doesn't...

198
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,400
look so great since it's the last episode.

199
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,730
We can't postpone the shoot just because of her.

200
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,970
We have more to lose than to gain.

201
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,890
Okay then.

202
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:49,520
- Are we ready? 
 - Yes, we are.

203
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,810
We're now going to go into final selections.

204
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,850
Please get ready.

205
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,730
Everyone, please make your final selections in order.

206
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,040
Kim Joon Ho, please start moving.

207
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,520
Would you like to leave the "Kingdom of Love" with me

208
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,170
and try having sweet love together in real life?

209
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,940
Please get a tight shot of Ji Wan's face.

210
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:19,650
Yes... I'll try it.

211
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:33,580
Next, Lee Hoon Hui, please get going.

212
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:42,470
Would you like to share sweet love with me?

213
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,300
Main camera,

214
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,900
get a shot of Lee Hoon Hui and Geum Soo Mi.

215
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,650
If there's someone who wants to give Geum Soo Mi a cake,

216
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,160
 please make your move now.

217
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,970
Would you like to leave this place together

218
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,710
and try sharing sweet love together?

219
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,530
I'm sorry.

220
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:39,480
I cannot share sweet love with you.

221
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,680
Goodbye.

222
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:07,460
I'll accept... this cake.

223
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:11,000
Let's meet outside as well.

224
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,310
 PD.

225
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,290
 What...

226
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,820
 were we?

227
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,620
 What would we be?

228
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,550
 It doesn't mean anything.

229
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,830
 Why me, of all people?

230
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,800
 Why me?

231
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:57,200
 Because when you were asked what love was,

232
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:03,320
 you said... it was a luxury.

233
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,270
 I felt like you understood your place well.

234
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,930
 In any case, thanks to you,

235
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,090
 I felt warmth momentarily.

236
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,160
 Thank you.

237
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:23,490
 I usually... have a lot of body heat.

238
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:40,400
 I hope that for you,

239
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,740
 love will not be a luxury

240
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,010
 but a reality, Hwang Jang Goon.

241
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:07,220
Would you like to leave "Kingdom of Love" with me...

242
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,110
and have sweet love together?

243
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,730
I accept.

244
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,110
Finally, Park Jae Hoon,

245
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,370
please make your final selection.

246
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,220
Would you like to

247
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:54,620
wrap up your time in "Kingdom of Love"

248
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:58,110
and try sharing sweet love with me?

249
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,410
From the moment I first met you, Jae Hoon,

250
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,370
to every moment in the "Kingdom of Love"...

251
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,870
even though it hurt,

252
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,390
I was happy.

253
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,370
It seems that our relationship...

254
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,380
is only to this point.

255
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,910
What is this?

256
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,440
Why is Han Ji Yeon acting like that?

257
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,300
PD Kang, what is this right now?

258
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,700
What could it be?

259
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,180
It's the "Kingdom of Love."

260
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,360
Oh, my goodness.

261
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,860
Cut.

262
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,750
Lastly, we're going to get a drone cut.

263
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:09,300
Our staff, please take the equipment and get out of the shot.

264
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:13,330
Cast members, please stay in your positions for a moment.

265
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,570
- Hee Chang. 
 - Yes?

266
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,030
Please get Lee Hoon Hui and Park Jae Hoon something to wipe their faces with.

267
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,030
Oh, okay.

268
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:42,910
I'll... also make the final selection!

269
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,540
Sunbaenim...

270
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,270
Ahn So Yeon?

271
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,150
- What's she doing? 
 - So Yeon?

272
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:02,350
Hee Chang... call 911 first, just in case.

273
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,200
Yes, I got it.

274
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,900
What? What's wrong with her?

275
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,990
Ahn So Yeon!

276
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,150
PD Goo.

277
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:31,160
So Yeon, what are you doing over there?

278
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,520
- What are you doing? 
 - So Yeon, wait.

279
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,390
What is that...

280
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:50,100
Did you call the police and the ambulance?

281
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,480
Yes, I called them.

282
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:57,830
So, she ends up causing trouble in the end.

283
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:01,390
I told you she's risky because of her bipolar disorder.

284
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,530
What do we do?

285
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,850
I feel like she might fall like that...

286
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,350
Man, this is such a mess.

287
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,990
This is unprecedented in so many ways, don't you think?

288
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:13,330
Aren't you even worried, Joon Ho?

289
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:16,600
When a person is up there in a dangerous spot?

290
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,560
I-I am worried. I am worried.

291
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,760
We don't even know when the ambulance might get here.

292
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,370
Shouldn't we at least put a mattress and some blankets on the ground?

293
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,270
I think we should.

294
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:30,190
The men here, let's go and carry some over here. Okay, got it.

295
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:33,470
The male members of the cast, let's go.

296
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,950
What is this...

297
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:38,430
It looks so dangerous.

298
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,360
So Yeon...

299
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,370
I know...

300
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:49,410
you had a hard time at the Kingdom all this time.

301
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,120
Even so...

302
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,460
doing this here is too dangerous.

303
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,320
I'll hold you, So Yeon. Okay?

304
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:06,820
PD Goo, people said I look cheap...

305
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:11,070
and that I have a strange look in my eyes.

306
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:15,030
People who don't even know me well...

307
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,390
Why are they talking shit about me?

308
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:20,560
Why are they running their mouths as they please?

309
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,000
Who are they to do that?

310
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,310
Who do they think they are...

311
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,500
So Yeon, that's all...

312
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,350
my fault entirely.

313
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:37,600
You're a really good person, So Yeon.

314
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,180
I should've caught the good sides you have on camera...

315
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:45,440
and showed them to people...

316
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,030
but I failed to do that.

317
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,730
I'm really sorry.

318
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,240
It's all the staff's fault.

319
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,220
It's all my fault completely.

320
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:57,650
So, So Yeon, hold my hand...

321
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,770
and come over here. Okay?

322
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,200
Gosh...

323
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:20,200
So Yeon... One second.

324
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,840
Try holding my arm.

325
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,700
I feel so dizzy.

326
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,390
So Yeon, give me the bottle.

327
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:33,030
Try to pull yourself together a bit.

328
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:40,070
- Hee Chang. 
 - Yes.

329
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,270
You try going up there.

330
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,160
Okay, got it.

331
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,130
What do we do?

332
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:54,830
- Hold my hand and... 
 - O-Okay.

333
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,250
pull your legs up.

334
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,700
Come down here now.

335
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,240
Carefully...

336
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,710
Yeo Reum...

337
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,370
Goo Yeo Reum!

338
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,550
Yeo Reum, wake up.

339
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:17,640
Goo Yeo Reum! Can you hear me?

340
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,390
Yeo Reum.

341
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,870
Yeo Reum, get up.

342
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:24,650
No... Come on, Yeo Reum...

343
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,720
I am a doctor. I'll go with you.

344
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,030
Please go to Hankuk University Hospital.

345
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:15,410
It's So Yeon.

346
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:14,230
Cast and staff...

347
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:17,490
"Kingdom of Love, Season 2" filming ends here.

348
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,280
Everyone...

349
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,290
may go back home now.

350
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,900
- What is this? 
 - Isn't this so irresponsible?

351
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,340
It's going to end like this?

352
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,480
I can't believe this.

353
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,500
What in the world...

354
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,390
- Is it okay for us to end like this? 
 - Great work, everyone.

355
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:35,240
You've all worked hard. Hee Chang, I leave you in charge.

356
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:38,780
Great work, everyone.

357
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,940
So, we just leave?

358
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,050

359
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,400

360
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,550

361
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,260
- You've done great. 
 - Great work.

362
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,080
Give it to me. I'll take it.

363
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,470
Great work, everyone.

364
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:07,450
- So do we go? 
 - Let's go.

365
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,230
Watch your head.

366
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,050
I'll close the door.

367
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,160
Are you driving me all the way to my house?

368
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,100
Yes, of course.

369
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:46,240
In front of my house, there's a restaurant that makes really good pork backbone stew.

370
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,470
Do you want to have dinner together?

371
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,940
It'd be nice if we could have some soju, too.

372
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:53,510
Yes.

373
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,830
Soo Mi.

374
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,060
Yes.

375
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,550
I...

376
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:19,010
have something to tell you.

377
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:20,680
What is it?

378
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,460
Well...

379
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,440
I...

380
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:31,820
slept with someone else at the Kingdom.

381
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,550
W-What?

382
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,330
Yeo Reum.

383
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,850
We're in the hospital.

384
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,660
Jae Hoon.

385
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:39,200
I'm not dreaming right now, right?

386
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,820
No, you're not.

387
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:47,880
Oh, be careful.

388
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:54,820
What happened to So Yeon?

389
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,200
Is she okay?

390
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:00,100
Yeah. The writers took her home

391
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,910
and called her family members.

392
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,290
What a relief.

393
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:10,720
Are you seriously worried about someone else first in a situation like this?

394
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,620
You told me it's not a dream.

395
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,100
Then that means I'm fine.

396
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,740
And you're by my side.

397
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:27,790
Your vitals are okay and your CT scans came out fine, too.

398
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,360
Since you regained consciousness,

399
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,970
you can leave the hospital after getting some rest.

400
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,500
Thanks.

401
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,080
Oh, right. What happened with the situation on set?

402
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,860
Did everything get wrapped up okay?

403
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:42,270
I came to the hospital with you right away,

404
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:44,530
but PD Hee Chang gave me a call a moment ago.

405
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:46,840
He said they wrapped up shooting Kingdom well,

406
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,300
and asked me to call him when you woke up.

407
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,130
They must be worrying about me.

408
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:53,420
Give them a call for me.

409
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,390
Goo Yeo Reum, what's so important about the show...

410
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:06,680
that you worry about the cast and the shooting more than yourself?

411
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,040
Why is that?

412
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:12,860
I don't know.

413
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:17,960
Just... I end up doing that without thinking about it.

414
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:31,120
Jae Hoon, I'm really fine.

415
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,440
I'm really fine.

416
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:41,460
Okay?

417
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,950
Yeo Reum! Daughter!

418
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:52,470
Mom. Dad...

419
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,600
Do you know how scared I was?

420
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,270
Why would you go up there like that?

421
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:01,370
Why would you go up there?

422
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:04,400
My daughter... Daughter... Goodness...

423
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,290
Mom and Dad, sorry for making you worry.

424
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:08,770
I'm really sorry.

425
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:11,740
Quit your job immediately.

426
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,190
I just can't understand it.

427
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:16,940
Why do you have to do jobs that are so dangerous?

428
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,480
Why must you?

429
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:23,490
- Goodness... Daughter. 
 - Mom...

430
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:25,940
You always have to be careful.

431
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,980
You got that?

432
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,590
Let me see, let me see. Goodness...

433
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,530
I'm really okay, Mom.

434
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:34,140
Let me see. I'm fine.

435
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:37,310
Are you really not hurt anywhere?

436
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,970
Goodness...

437
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:53,810
PD, it's Park Jae Hoon.

438
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:56,000
PD Goo Yeo Reum woke up.

439
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,420
Yes, after she's had some time to rest and stabilize, I'll tell her to give you a call.

440
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:03,360
Yes, I understand.

441
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:14,470
All right. Thank you.

442
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:16,770
 Thank you.

443
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,830
Hey, Honey.

444
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:23,150
Shouldn't we go to Yeo Reum's hospital?

445
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:27,480
I'll watch the restaurant by myself, so go and visit her first if you're really worried.

446
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,490
I got a call from Jae Hoon already. She'll leave the hospital soon.

447
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:31,710
Oh, really?

448
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,110
Yeah.

449
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:36,860
Yeo Reum's parents came up here, so she's going to go to Chuncheon first,

450
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:40,060
and rest there for a couple of days before coming back up.

451
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:43,060
How scared Yeo Reum's parents must've been...

452
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,420
What's all this, really...

453
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,350
I know, right?

454
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:49,770
I never thought I'd see something like this in my day.

455
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:52,100
- Right? 
 - Yeah.

456
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,740
It's all right. I'll do it.

457
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:55,920
No, it's okay.

458
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,340
Get some rest.

459
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:08,940
I really... don't know what to say.

460
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,930
I'm sorry.

461
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:15,740
How were you managing the cast members?

462
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,790
What would you have done if it resulted in a really bad accident?

463
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:22,980
I'm sorry.

464
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,310
Thankfully, PD Goo wasn't hurt too badly.

465
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:33,950
But still. A knifing incident and a falling accident on set...

466
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:35,510
Submit a letter of apology.

467
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:39,330
Disciplinary actions will be made after assessing the situation later,

468
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,030
so just stand by.

469
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:44,100
I understand.

470
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:53,710
Hello, PD Kang Chae Ri.

471
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:56,590

It's Park Jae Hoon from "Kingdom of Love."

00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:46,750
♫  A hot summer and you smiling in it  ♫

497
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:52,570
♫  And I was there next to you  ♫

498
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:59,540
♫  When I open my eyes again  ♫

499
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:06,690
♫  I feel like I'm so far away  ♫

500
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:14,690
♫  I watch helplessly like this  ♫

501
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:20,380
♫  We are left behind like this wonderful scene  ♫

502
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:21,700
Jae Hoon?

503
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:28,920
♫  The reason why it hurts so badly like this  ♫

504
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:35,690
♫  The reason why I keep having expectations, thinking perhaps  ♫

505
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:37,190
You're already here?

506
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:40,660
♫  We're so beautiful, no need to envy anyone  ♫

507
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:43,800
Jae Hoon, what's all this?

508
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,490
Well, I just bought what you would need right away.

509
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:49,170
Based roughly on your style.

510
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:52,420
When did you buy all of this?

511
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,950
Welcome back.

512
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:15,250
- Are you feeling okay? 
 - Yeah.

513
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:17,810
By any chance,

514
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:21,530
if you keep feeling scared or are reminded of it,

515
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:25,280
you can go get trauma therapy.

516
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,500
I'm really fine.

517
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:37,660
After spending the past few days resting up and eating my mom's cooking,

518
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:41,590
I feel like my condition is even better than before.

519
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,650
Jae Hoon.

520
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:49,070
Yeah?

521
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:53,360
That day, the day of the accident...

522
00:49:53,970 --> 00:50:00,140
you know how people say that when you're about to die or go through a major crisis,

523
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,960
your life flashes before your eyes like a panorama

524
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,740
in that short amount of time.

525
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,570
Yeah, people say that.

526
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:11,390
But...

527
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:16,570
for me, only one thought came to mind.

528
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:18,660
What thought?

529
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:25,550
The thought that I didn't get to answer you.

530
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:30,270
You told me that you loved me,

531
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:34,040
but I wasn't able to answer you right away that day.

532
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,770
I...

533
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:38,940
regretted that so much.

534
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:54,560
I love you.

535
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,380
I'm sorry I couldn't answer you right away that day.

536
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:04,120
I've been wanting to tell you that.

537
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,040
Yeo Reum.

538
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,220
I love you more.

539
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,950
 Jae Hoon, your big brother is here.

540
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:42,540
 Yeo Reum, we're here.

541
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:45,510
 Unni, Oppa, I'm here, too.

542
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:49,110
They're coming.

543
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:50,170
Surprise!

544
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:53,220
Yeo Reum!

545
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:57,750
What's happening...

546
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:00,360
- You made chicken porridge instead of what? 
 - Come on, no.

547
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,860
All right, hold off on catching up for now.

548
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:05,740
Since we sat down, let's eat before it gets cold.

549
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,590
What is all this?

550
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:11,670
Very warm... chicken porridge!

551
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:15,270
What's with the chicken porridge?

552
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:17,510
I told you I'm perfectly fine.

553
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,390
You should've fried some chicken feet.

554
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:21,660
I didn't make him do it.

555
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:26,850
He just kept insisting that he would make chicken porridge for you.

556
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:29,200
Dae Shik is sensitive in a subtle way.

557
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,070
I'm not subtle.

558
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:32,780
I'm blatantly sensitive.

559
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:34,350
Dae Shik. Thank you!

560
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:35,880
That's right!

561
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,550
Hey. Have you guys ever had chicken porridge with alcohol?

562
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:40,310
The pairing is perfect.

563
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:42,490
More than anything, it soothes your stomach.

564
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:43,930
Your stomach feels so much better.

565
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:47,660
You can keep drinking while protecting your liver.

566
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:50,110
It's the perfect food.

567
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,630
All right. Goo Yeo Reum, Park Jae Hoon.

568
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:56,430
Congratulations on coming back to the neighborhood!

569
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:59,400
Cheers! We missed you.

570
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,300
- What about me? 
 - Not so much for you, Oppa.

571
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,280
I'm not interested in you.

572
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:08,720
But I do wonder if this is something that's really worth celebrating.

573
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,370
Just enjoy it and drink.

574
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:12,090
It's an excuse for drinking.

575
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:14,650
- Okay. Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

576
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:23,030
But... is "Kingdom of Love" really going to end early?

577
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:26,460
Yeah. Once this episode airs, it'll be all over.

578
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:28,610
Whoa. That's really amazing.

579
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:30,520
Yeo Reum, what about you? Are you all right?

580
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,990
You're not going to be blamed for anything, right?

581
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:35,450
No, it doesn't matter.

582
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:38,920
I'll just go to work tomorrow and see how everything is going.

583
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:43,190
Then, does that mean you've made your final selection, too, Jae Heon?

584
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:49,700
I did.

585
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:51,100
What happened?

586
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:52,410
Tell us quickly!

587
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:55,250
- Did you become a couple with Han Ji Yeon? 
 - Did you?

588
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:58,160
Are you really dating her?

589
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:01,310
So what happened was...

590
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:03,120
Oh, gosh...

591
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:09,440
- Watch the show and find out. 
 - Oh, come on!

592
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,290
I'm so curious! Why aren't you telling us?

593
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:12,950
Come on, tell us.

594
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:14,780
The PD is right next to me. How could I spoil the show?

595
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:16,140
If spoilers get out, then I'll get in trouble.

596
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,250
These guys are driving me nuts.

597
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:20,440
I'm the PD.

598
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:25,190
Hello.

599
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:27,080
- Hey, Yeo Reum. 
 - Senior.

600
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,770
I heard about what happened. Are you okay?

601
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:32,400
Yes, well. I'm okay.

602
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,570
It's an event that will be remembered in the history records of variety shows.

603
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:38,190
Cheer up.

604
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:39,950
See you later.

605
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:51,290
PD Goo.

606
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:52,880
Oh, Writer.

607
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,580
What in the world is going on?

608
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:58,450
I nearly fainted when I heard the news. I was seriously in shock.

609
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:02,230
Still, it's a relief that it didn't result in anything worse.

610
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:03,520
What do you mean, it was a relief?

611
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,330
Something terrible could've happened to you.

612
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:09,840
Anyway, when things get less busy, let's grab something to eat together.

613
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,410
Sounds good.

614
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,330
Thank you.

615
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,440
- Senior! 
 - PD Goo.

616
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,010
- Senior! 
 - PD...

617
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:25,360
How are you guys doing?

618
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,170
Senior, are you okay?

619
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:28,810
Sang Woo, I should be asking you if you're okay.

620
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:30,540
How's the wound?

621
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:33,380
I'm really fine. I'm almost fully healed up.

622
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:36,290
That's good to hear.

623
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:39,160
Senior, I'm sorry.

624
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:43,260
I should have assisted you by your side... I'm sorry I wasn't there.

625
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:46,760
Hey. Why are you always so sorry?

626
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,410
Don't be like that, okay?

627
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:52,170
I want to talk to Goo Yeo Reum quietly alone.

628
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:54,990
Could everyone give us some space?

629
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,180
Goo Yeo Reum.

630
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,770
PD.

631
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:21,800
I sincerely regret that there was an unfortunate event that took place on set.

632
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:26,530
Because you went up there and bought us some time, we were able to prevent a major accident,

633
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:29,140
and in the chaos, the fact that you fell—

634
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:46,820
I regret that you were in such an accident.

635
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:50,610
Kang Chae Ri, are you doing some kind of diplomatic negotiation?

636
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:53,560
- Why are you beating around the bush like that? 
 - What did I do?

637
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:56,110
In situations like this, most people

638
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:58,550
just say things straightforwardly like

639
00:56:58,550 --> 00:57:01,660
"Thank you" and "I'm sorry."

640
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:10,490
Thank you and...

641
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,850
sorry.

642
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:20,800
You are quite consistent.

643
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:28,350
But how did you manage to keep the cast's mouths shut?

644
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:31,700
I thought there'd be a major commotion by now, but why is it so quiet?

645
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:35,960
I didn't really do anything special, but they're quiet by themselves.

646
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,480
I have a bad feeling about this...

647
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,840
- What bad feeling? 
 - It's just too quiet.

648
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:44,740
So it's giving me a bad feeling.

649
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:51,360
Senior! We're in big trouble.

650
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,260
What is it? Why?

651
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:54,770
Take a look at this.

652
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:56,470
What is it?

653
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:03,880

654
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:07,420

655
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:16,850

656
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:25,150
Hey, what's this?

657
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:29,360

658
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,590
Supposedly, the one who reported this was a cast member.

659
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:33,910
Does anyone come to mind?

660
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:37,810
I haven't been able to properly assess the situation yet...

661
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,420
I'm sorry.

662
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:46,170
You really don't know who it could have been?

663
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:49,220
I don't know.

664
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:55,130
How could we have such crazy rumors like this attached to the show? Huh?

665
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:10,410
- I'm sorry. 
 - About what?

666
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:12,910
I feel like it's my fault.

667
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:16,650
A cast member and a staff member...

668
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:19,530
I'd be the only potential source of such a story.

669
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:23,670
Including the kiss scene that was aired before.

670
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,880
First, I'll try to find out who reported it,

671
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:31,700
and try to assess the situation before the last episode airs.

672
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,260
Okay.

673
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,490
Yeo Reum!

674
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:03,290
Aren't you cold?

675
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,030
Let's go inside.

676
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:22,950

677
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:28,690
♫  What can make me flutter in the wind like this  ♫

678
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:33,740
♫  Carrying pink imaginations between the two of us  ♫

679
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:36,710
♫  I don't even blink,

680
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:41,050
♫  I can't believe this feeling  ♫

681
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:49,150
♫  You gently blow into my bleak daily life  ♫

682
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:56,210
♫  In the flow, something changed. Oh stop it, no!  ♫

683
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:59,580

684
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:01,340
 What is this? Isn't this you, PD Goo?

685
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:02,870
 How am I supposed to interpret this?

686
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:04,720
 You're telling me nothing's going on between you two, right?

687
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:07,640
 I think it's better to tackle this head-on than clumsily avoid it.

688
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:10,160
 Then you and Park Jae Hoon will take all the blame.

689
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,810
 You stay out of it rather than clumsily trying to be righteous.

690
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:14,920
 Have you seen the article? Park Jae Hoon.

691
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,420
 There are rumors about how he's living together with the PD in charge.

692
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:18,800
 You haven't received any calls yet?

693
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,460
 I guess everyone's pretending not to know anything.

694
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:22,950
 I have a bad vibe about this.

695
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:26,290
 Jae Hoon, I need to discuss something with you.

696
01:01:26,290 --> 01:01:30,690
♫  Even with your subtle breath, I feel dizzy  ♫
