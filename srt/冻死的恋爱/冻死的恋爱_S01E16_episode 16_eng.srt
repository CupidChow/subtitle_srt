1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:08,790

2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,610

3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:17,660
♫  Dive with you, towards the wide sea  ♫

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,060

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:24,080
♫  Jump in love, I fly with wings called you  ♫

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,120

♫  There is nothing to be afraid of  ♫

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,070
♫  In the world called you, it sparkles and lingers here  ♫

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,720
♫  What I found while wandering was you who 
 was always by my side  ♫

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,230
♫  I'm already ready for you  ♫

10
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,110

11
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,780

12
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:14,600
 Yeo Reum! Wake up and eat.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,120
 Daughter, wake up and eat.

14
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,440
Mom made some tasty bean paste stew.

15
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,880
Hurry up.

16
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,930
Okay, Dad.

17
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,460
Thank you for the meal.

18
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,920
Try the bean paste stew.

19
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,740
I don't know if I seasoned it well.

20
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,060
I feel like it's a bit salty.

21
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,970
It's so good, Mom!

22
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,550
- Eat up. 
 - Really?

23
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,950
Try the soy sauce quail eggs.

24
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,220
Honey, why don't you also bring out the pickled garlic that our Yeo Reum likes?

25
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,690
Oh, my goodness, I'm so forgetful!

26
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,250
No, no, Mom. It's fine.

27
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,460
This is already a lot of food. I'll just eat what's out here.

28
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,440
I just have to take it out from the refrigerator.

29
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,790
No, no. This is enough.

30
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,260
I'll eat it later in the evening.

31
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,690
But are you really okay physically?

32
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,550
I told you I'm fine.

33
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,540
The hospital said I can be discharged because there were no issues.

34
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,000
You fell from such a height!

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,040
How could you be perfectly fine?

36
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,960
Even if you seem visibly fine, your body must have experienced quite a shock.

37
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,230
Honey, why don't we let her eat first?

38
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,010
I'm okay.

39
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,680
Gosh...

40
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,490
This is nice.

41
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,290
Mom.

42
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,940
- Mom. 
 - Yeah?

43
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,850
Coming back to your hometown with Dad and living here... do you like it?

44
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,720
Yeah, I like it.

45
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,060
What do you like about it?

46
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,270
It's comfortable.

47
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,150
I spent my school years here.

48
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,680
I have a lot of my long-time friends here,

49
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,060
and it's near Grandmother and Grandfather's graves.

50
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,300
I made a promise to your father

51
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,400
that once you graduate from college and get a job,

52
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,990
we would retire and go back to our hometown and live there.

53
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,440
We are happy.

54
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,450
We're living well.

55
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,250
Don't worry about us.

56
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,860
I'm sorry, Mom.

57
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,980
About what?

58
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,670
You got really scared because of what happened to me, huh?

59
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,440
I'm 37 years old,

60
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,620
and yet, I feel like I'm just causing you two worries.

61
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,650
Your friends... are enjoying their ordinary lives

62
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,090
marrying off their sons and daughters

63
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:34,240
and bragging about their grandchildren.

64
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,770
But for me... I feel like I'm a daughter

65
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,360
who only causes you and Dad pain,

66
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,700
so I'm so sorry.

67
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,710
- Yeo Reum. 
 - Yeah?

68
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,940
Can't you take a break from work for a while?

69
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,590
Because I'm so proud of you...

70
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,660
Because my daughter is so special...

71
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:04,180
For me, you are so amazing, I don't care about what others say.

72
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,380
Your marriage ending up like that...

73
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,940
Your dad and I are fine with that.

74
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,300
But seeing you get in an accident on the set,

75
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,480
makes me get so anxious and it's difficult for me.

76
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,370
I would like for you to talk with your workplace

77
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:23,480
and take a break from work for the time being.

78
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,430
Okay, I'll think about it, Mom.

79
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,360
Don't cry.

80
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,980
Please?

81
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,130
Honey! Yeo Reum!

82
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,770
It's coffee time.

83
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,700
- Okay? 
 - Okay.

84
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,600
I'm a wonderful barista.

85
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,520
Mr. Goo!

86
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,480
- Dad, you made us some coffee? 
 - Yeah.

87
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,830
All right. Cheers.

88
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,220
How is it? It's good, right?

89
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,310
- Yeah. 
 - Thank you.

90
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,440

91
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:07,590

92
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,560

93
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,220
 Yes.

94
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,770
Oh, Dr. Park.

95
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,330
What brings you here without even calling?

96
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,840
- Professor. 
 - Yeah?

97
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,090
I'll return to the Neurosurgery Department.

98
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,040
Good job.

99
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,880
You made the right decision.

100
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,930
Jae Hoon, thanks for... pulling yourself together.

101
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,980
Professor... thank you for continuously

102
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,520
holding onto me so many times.

103
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,450
 Come in.

104
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,400
Yes, PD Goo.

105
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,910
What brings you here?

106
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,420

107
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,880
Director,

108
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:57,690
I'm going to resign.

109
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,250

110
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,210
Take it back.

111
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:10,200
- Director— 
 - I'm sure you thought hard about it. And you're having a tough time.

112
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,880
But give it more thought.

113
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,760
I...

114
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,620
can't do it.

115
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:26,820
I can no longer pretend to be okay.

116
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:33,720

117
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:40,970
Yeo Reum, you can leave this field permanently anytime.

118
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,780
I'll give you some time,

119
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,910
so mull over it a bit more. Okay?

120
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,250
 Hold my hand and...  pull your legs up.

121
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,360
 Come down here now. Carefully...

122
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,570

123
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,440

124
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,990

125
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,750

126
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,950

127
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,160
Please center it in the middle.

128
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,160
The cast members who are ready, please come in.

129
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,530
- Hello. 
 - Hello, it's been a while.

130
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,410
Good to see you.

131
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,480
Where's my seat? It's here.

132
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,560
Oh, it's here.

133
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,530
- Have you been well? 
 - Yes.

134
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,310
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

135
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,260
 - You look so pretty.  
 - No way.

136
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,660
Everything here... is so pretty today.

137
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,580
 You look so pretty today.

138
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,770
Hello! Hello.

139
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,350
Hello.

140
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,240
Bro Jang.

141
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,580
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

142
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,860
How have you been?

143
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:46,580
Please put the chairs neatly in the meeting room, okay?

144
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,750
Please place the flowers nicely.

145
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,450
Everything's checked and accounted for, right?

146
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,780
Please decorate the room nicely.

147
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,640
PD Goo.

148
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,730
So Yeon, you came.

149
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,350
I didn't think I'd be invited.

150
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,760
As long as you're okay with it, you should be with us.

151
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,940
Thank you.

152
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,720
For the day of the final selections,

153
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,950
we put captions saying you couldn't make it due to personal reasons.

154
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,460
Okay.

155
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,230
Please go inside. Everyone is waiting.

156
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,230
PD Goo Yeo Reum!

157
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,920
Yes?

158
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,040
I'm sorry about that day.

159
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,560
Because of me...

160
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,440
I wanted to... apologize to you, PD.

161
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,720
The reason I came here despite the embarrassment...

162
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,040
was to apologize to you, PD.

163
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,850
So Yeon,

164
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,840
I'm sorry as well.

165
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,500
As a member of the production staff, I sincerely apologize.

166
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:17,970
I should have been more attentive to you on the set.

167
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,040
I'm really sorry.

168
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,470
You should go in first.

169
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:36,010
Okay then, we'll be downstairs getting ready to shoot.

170
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,550
Did all the cast members gather?

171
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,410
Not yet.

172
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,160
We gave them a time to meet. What do you mean, not yet?

173
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,780
Park Jae Hoon and Han Ji Yeon are on their way up here,

174
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,730
and Kim Joon Ho says he's running a bit late due to traffic.

175
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,960
And Ahn So Yeon is here as well.

176
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,110
At least, we've got the whole mix of people

177
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,760
even though we don't know what accidents might come to pass.

178
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,610
Are you okay?

179
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,330
- About what? 
 - Kim Joon Ho.

180
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:14,000
Is it okay for you to see him face-to-face?

181
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,400
Why wouldn't I be?

182
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,500
You're really...

183
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,200
mentally strong. I admit that.

184
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,300
If that bastard tries anything funny, I'll kill him.

185
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:37,400
You should also stop pretending to be nice and change your mindset.

186
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,180
Like "If you screw up, I'll kill you."

187
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:45,520
You really have my respect.

188
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:50,710
It's people like you who should be PDs, right?

189
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:55,200
This field is too tough to endure in your right state of mind.

190
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,410
It's a good thing you realize it now, at least.

191
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,760
 Now, let me hear your answer.

192
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,980
 Why are you being such a bitch to me?

193
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,100
 You're...

194
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,610
 so annoying because you have everything.

195
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,120
 What?

196
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,560
 You're so annoying because you have everything!

197
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,230
 So I hope every program you make hits rock bottom in the viewer ratings!

198
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,400
 That would only be fair.

199
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,150
 Ma'am... Soju, please.

200
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,960
Jae Hoon.

201
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,790
You're here, Ji Yeon.

202
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,390
Let's go inside.

203
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,810
Okay.

204
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:35,090

205
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,940
Honey, the final episode is starting! Hurry, hurry!

206
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,690
Really? Geez, I was heating up the oil.

207
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:36,830
We worried a lot about Jae Hoon when the show was starting out,

208
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,040
but everything seems to have turned out for the better. Right?

209
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,550
Yeah.

210
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,300
 - Tell us honestly. 
 - What?

211
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:48,100
 You had an unusual vibe with Yeo Reum last time.

212
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,610
 Our Hye Jin has great intuition.

213
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,050
 The sixth sense... I guess women just have that.

214
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,200
 You two have something going on, right?

215
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,270
 Yes.

216
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,300
 I think Yeo Reum and I...

217
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,870
 will have to separate.

218
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,390
 What?

219
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,300
 What...

220
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,680
 Separate?

221
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,880
 What's this? Did you guys ever go out?

222
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,660
 I'm going to... return to the university hospital.

223
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,770
 To the Neurosurgery Department.

224
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,570
 Really?

225
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,770
 Are you serious?

226
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,620
 Wow, that's such good news!

227
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,260
 Good job. Really!

228
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,910
 You made the right decision!

229
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,990
 Punk, when did you decide to do the right thing?

230
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:46,270
 When I go back, I'll probably have to pretty much live in the hospital.

231
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,970
 Yeah, you probably will.

232
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,430
 Wait a second.

233
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,870
 Then, did you just trick us?

234
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,320
 Wait. Is that what you meant when you said you'll separate?

235
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,630
 That you'll temporarily be apart while you're living in the hospital?

236
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:00,870
 - Yeah. 
 - Gosh, you scared me!

237
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,740
 I was tricked. I was tricked for a moment there.

238
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,440
 Gosh, this hurts my pride.

239
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,360
 I haven't performed surgeries for a long time and since I've pretty much lost my touch,

240
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:13,280
 I'll be working with the residents for now until I regain my touch.

241
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,410
 You made the right decision.

242
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,370

243
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:21,840
I'm so curious about the results of the final selections.

244
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,380
This punk and Yeo Reum, too...

245
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,880
Why won't they tell us? Why?

246
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,230
They'll show the results soon.

247
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,290
Let's wait and see.

248
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:36,090

249
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,740
 Sure.

250
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:48,830

Yes. I'll try it.

251
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,370
Don't we look really good here?

252
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,780
 I'll accept this cake.

253
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:16,470
 It seems that our relationship is only to this point.

254
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,070

255
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:37,200
 - Congratulations! 
 - Thank you!

256
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,510
 You guys look great together.

257
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,130
 Great work, everyone.

258
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,420
 Great work.

259
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,440
Great work.

260
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,280
Great job.

261
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,080
Great job!

262
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,060
Great job.

263
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:55,670
We'll take a five-minute break and then shoot the behind-the-scenes talk.

264
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:59,330
Please pass the question sheets to the cast members.

265
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,720
Yes, I got it.

266
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,770
We will give you the common questions to each member in order, and you guys can talk about it freely

267
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,430
and comfortably as you can.

268
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:10,750
And also, please throw out questions that are written here.

269
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,250
We can talk amongst ourselves, right?

270
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,940
Yes, comfortably.

271
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,340
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

272
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,370
Here you go.

273
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,820
Yeo Reum.

274
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,280
Yeah.

275
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,760
Are you okay? You look tired.

276
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:29,100
I guess I'm a bit nervous because we're going to air this live.

277
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,360
You saw the question sheet. Right?

278
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,650
Yeah.

279
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,430
I thought it would be better

280
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:43,250
for you to explain the rumors about living together on the show rather than through an article.

281
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:47,480
Just relax and say that we're friends living upstairs and downstairs of the same house.

282
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,000
Okay.

283
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,630
I'm sorry...

284
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:57,440
that I'm asking you to do all kinds of things.

285
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,290
It's okay.

286
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,710
I wanted to do it like this, too.

287
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,570
Ji Yeon.

288
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,830
Aren't you offended?

289
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,180
About what?

290
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,600
Even the article about them living together came out.

291
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,030
Isn't this like adding insult to injury?

292
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,370
Those two were friends from the beginning.

293
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:35,560
Come on, how can a man and a woman be friends?

294
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,810
On the live show today,

295
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:43,710
make it really obvious that you're offended.

296
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,290
If you play your cards right,

297
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:49,830
you can really bring down Park Jae Hoon for good.

298
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,380
He's facing rumors of living together

299
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,450
and you didn't select him, either, Ji Yeon.

300
00:21:55,450 --> 00:22:00,550
If you want, you can send him to Andromeda.

301
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:09,350

302
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,410
Chef John.

303
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,360
Ji Wan, have you been well?

304
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,490
Yes.

305
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:26,200
For me, after spending all day and night with everyone,

306
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,670
it was really strange to go back

307
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,200
when I returned to my everyday life.

308
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,290
I was a bit sad, and I...

309
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,300
missed everyone.

310
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,060
It was like that for me, too.

311
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:49,180
Are things going well with Kim Joon Ho?

312
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,530
What's it like to date him out in the real world?

313
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:52,730
Do you guys get along well together?

314
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,990
What about you, Chef?

315
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:58,820
Are things going well with Tae Mi?

316
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:03,480
The two of you are such a good-looking couple.

317
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,890
You two have a similar vibe

318
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,870
and you look good together.

319
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,360
Oppa!

320
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,580
Hey. They said they're starting the shoot.

321
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,120
Let's go inside.

322
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,860
Oh, okay.

323
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,530
We're going to start shooting.

324
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:52,410
First, I'll ask a common question to the final couples

325
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:54,730
of "Kingdom of Love, Season 2."

326
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:59,840
Are things going well even after the show?

327
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:08,580
Things are going well between us.

328
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,530
Yes, we're doing great.

329
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,760
 - Soo Mi. 
 - Yes?

330
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,350
 I...

331
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,300
 have something to tell you.

332
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,740
 What is it?

333
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,450
 I...

334
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:34,180
 slept with someone else at the Kingdom.

335
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,920
 W-What?

336
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,840
 G-Gosh...

337
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,670
 S-So... w-with who?

338
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:46,380
 Who did you sleep with?

339
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:51,580
 Well, I don't think I can tell you who it was...

340
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,910
 But I really am not a player or anything like that.

341
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,950
 If things work out with you, Soo Mi,

342
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,300
 I will be responsible and be a man,

343
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,100
 and be faithful.

344
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:07,430
 But... as for what happened this time...

345
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,250
 Well, things just turned out that way somehow...

346
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:21,210
 I just couldn't lie to you, feeling like I was deceiving you...

347
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,980
 and going to eat pork backbone stew in front of your house.

348
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,640
 So I'm telling you the truth.

349
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,230
 I guess I like your honesty.

350
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,600
 What?

351
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,200
 I mean, it was before we became a couple

352
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,040
 and I guess I'm not the only one who found you attractive.

353
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:54,040
 Are you really the type to be faithful?

354
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,400
 Of course.

355
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,440
 I mean it. Of course, I will!

356
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,230
 Then, let's go for now.

357
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:05,460
 Let's have a deep conversation as we eat pork backbone stew.

358
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:08,040
 Whoa...

359
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:13,380
We're a long-distance couple, so we don't get to go on many dates.

360
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,660
Yes, because we're a long-distance couple...

361
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,940
I'm in Cheonan and Soo Mi is in Seoul.

362
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,860
Regardless, things are going well for us.

363
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,370
But one thing's for sure.

364
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:25,740
I've really fallen for her.

365
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,420
Gosh.

366
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,310
Oh, really?

367
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:33,150
So cool.

368
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:36,170
We're also doing well.

369
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:39,400
Did the two of you decide to date for real?

370
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,060
We're not officially dating yet...

371
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:48,280
Weren't we... dating?

372
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:53,730
We are getting to know each other with an open mind.

373
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:57,500
I thought we were dating, though.

374
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:02,070
What's with you? We're getting to know each other.

375
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:07,080
Well, I guess neither of us made it official.

376
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,020
I see...

377
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,250
- Yes. 
 - I see...

378
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,650
You got something in your hair.

379
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,860
How about you two?

380
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:24,000
Oh, well, for us...

381
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,730
We decided to date for just one month.

382
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:30,760
One month? If you're dating, you're dating.

383
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,700
What does it mean to date for just one month?

384
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,020

385
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,820
 Give me the copies as well.

386
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,890
 Hurry up.

387
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,970
 Before I turn them all over to you,

388
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:05,440
 I have a condition for you as well.

389
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,550
 What is it?

390
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,720
 Date me for just one month.

391
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,910
 What?

392
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:13,400
 Since things turned out like this, I'll be honest with you.

393
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:18,230
 I really need the dating app that I just launched to succeed.

394
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:21,160
 I would like for you to help me.

395
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,470
 Who are you trying to con this time?

396
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:26,590
 I'm doing this, so I don't have to con people.

397
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:29,180
 I'm not doing this just for my sake.

398
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:32,020
 I'm trying to help the people who invested in me

399
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,190
 make a profit.

400
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:41,240
Because I've never dated in my life,

401
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:46,650
I got scared to be in a dating relationship all of a sudden.

402
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:51,540
So, Joon Ho was considerate of me.

403
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:54,950
So we decided to meet for just one month for now.

404
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:58,910
- I see. 
 - I-I-I guess he's got some manners.

405
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,980
It's nothing.

406
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,900
I'll ask the next question.

407
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,610
It's the couple who became the hottest topic

408
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:13,440
at "Kingdom of Love, Season 2."

409
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,860
Park Jae Hoon and Han Ji Yeon.

410
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:20,180
Because you didn't choose Jae Hoon during the final selection, Ji Yeon,

411
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,740
a lot of people were shocked.

412
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,730
A lot of people are commenting online as we speak.

413
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:29,240
Let's hear your stories as well.

414
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,610
An article about you living together with someone came out a few days ago, Jae Hoon.

415
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,680
I feel like you should

416
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,210
talk about that first.

417
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:46,990
- Well, about that— 
 - Jae Hoon and the PD were friends

418
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:50,350
who lived upstairs and downstairs in the same house.

419
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,080
Oh, really?

420
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:57,460
On the first day of shooting,

421
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:00,070
the person who was supposed to be on the show suddenly couldn't make it,

422
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:04,740
so Jae Hoon joined the show in a rush, recommended by the production staff.

423
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,700
So that's what happened. I didn't know all that.

424
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,580
So, Jae Hoon,

425
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:13,320
you were friends with the PD, living upstairs and downstairs of the house

426
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,790
and you ended up appearing on Kingdom as a replacement?

427
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:18,120
Yes, it turned out that way.

428
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:22,170
You must've been baffled to read the article, then.

429
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:28,110
But it's good that you're able to clear the misunderstandings like this.

430
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,810
Yes, I suppose so.

431
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,210
But I have a question.

432
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:41,060
In the first episode, who's the person you kissed, Jae Hoon?

433
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,000
That cliffhanger hasn't been resolved yet.

434
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,780
I've been curious all this time, and my mom kept asking me about it, too.

435
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,310
- Even your mother? 
 - Yeah.

436
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:50,800
Who did you kiss out of the people here?

437
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,020
That was me.

438
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,130
It was you, Ji Yeon?

439
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,660
Yes. You guys were all fooled by the evil editing.

440
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:17,230
The person who kissed Jae Hoon that day was me.

441
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,990
After we kissed that day,

442
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:24,110
we had a situation with a misunderstanding so I came out first.

443
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:27,440
But the production staff just edited it that way.

444
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,500
You all know already

445
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,320
the spiciness of "Kingdom of Love," the evil editing.

446
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,640
Then, I want to ask another question.

447
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,650
Why didn't you choose him for the final selection?

448
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:47,340
Because I felt like I liked him a lot more than he did.

449
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,010
I showed my interest in him, leaving behind no regrets

450
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:52,520
and although he did open up to me,

451
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:56,930
I don't think his feelings for me were to my satisfaction.

452
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,300
Because it was too hard for me to like him more and get ahead of myself,

453
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,240
I didn't choose him in the final selection.

454
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:22,150
Ji Yeon!

455
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,790
Han Ji Yeon.

456
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:27,510
Thank you.

457
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:31,860
You were able to get past the difficult questions, thanks to me. Right?

458
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,320
Yes.

459
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,400
I'm good as long as you know.

460
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,610
Can I ask you why you answered for me like that?

461
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,070
Because I liked you.

462
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:51,100
Because I sincerely liked you,

463
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:55,210
so I didn't want to make things difficult for you...

464
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:58,890
in front of other people and the cameras.

465
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,840
Thank you.

466
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:10,000
And I'm sorry.

467
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,330
I'm fine with you thanking me,

468
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,530
but you don't need to be sorry.

469
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,970
Because it was a good memory for me as well.

470
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:22,630
Because I don't want others to talk badly about it.

471
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,280
I'm also...

472
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,450
thankful to you, Jae Hoon.

473
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:30,920
It was a crush that I don't regret.

474
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,820
- Are you waiting for a bus? 
 - Yes.

475
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,920
I'll give you a ride home. Get in.

476
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,870
- It's okay. 
 - Hurry up and get in.

477
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,990
Okay.

478
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,890
- What's Kim Joon Ho doing... 
 - What?

479
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:48,150
I mean, you said you guys decided to date for a month.

480
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:51,050
But why isn't he taking you home?

481
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,010
Well...

482
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:33,180
I'll be going inside, then.

483
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:36,810
Thank you for giving me a ride home.

484
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,810
Ji Wan!

485
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,560
Yes?

486
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,410
After dating Kim Joon Ho for a month,

487
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:52,990
do you want to try dating me?

488
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,500
Excuse me?

489
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,050
I like you.

490
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:00,240
- You like me? 
 - Yes.

491
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,350
Why do you like me...

492
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:06,480
I'm sorry... for not telling you sooner.

493
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,000
I like you.

494
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:13,960
I like you a lot, Park Ji Wan.

495
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,280
Thank you.

496
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,850
- Jae Hoon. 
 - Yeah?

497
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,370
You've gone through a lot.

498
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:09,450
It's not like I did anything special.

499
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:13,170
I was so grateful to Han Ji Yeon today.

500
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:15,960
Ji Yeon turned out to be such a cool person.

501
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,610
Yeah, she's cool... and amazing.

502
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,850
Seeing her today

503
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:25,160
made me feel really small for some reason.

504
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:29,240
Such a cool person like her liked you.

505
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:33,390
So you get what an amazing competitor you defeated, Goo Yeo Reum?

506
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:36,290
- Right? 
 - Yeah.

507
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:38,530
I so get it.

508
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,740
- Jae Hoon. 
 - Yeah?

509
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:54,850
I turned in my resignation letter at work today.

510
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,440
What?

511
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,940
The director... told me to mull over it more,

512
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:04,000
and to talk about it again.

513
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,580
But I just...

514
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,500
I don't know what to do.

515
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:14,040
Is it because of the accident on set?

516
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,110
Just...

517
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,810
That's certainly something,

518
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:21,980
but I lost the confidence to make shows anymore.

519
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,200
I don't think I can do it anymore.

520
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,630
- Senior? 
 - Yeah?

521
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,200
What are you doing here?

522
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,920
I'm just here.

523
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,050
Everything's over, so why are you here?

524
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,880
It's not over yet.

525
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,090
It's not over until the viewer ratings come out tomorrow morning.

526
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,400
You can go home.

527
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,110
I'm telling you you can go home and rest now, Senior.

528
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,900
I thought that...

529
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,980
I could make people happy.

530
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,390
I thought I could succeed in

531
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:50,790
making shows that were heartwarming and comfortable.

532
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:53,530
But now...

533
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:59,810
I feel that... I lack the sense for it.

534
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:03,160
After calling off the wedding

535
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,340
and while directing the Kingdom of Love,

536
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,650
I've been constantly anxious

537
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:13,230
and distressed from feeling like I was selling out and manipulating people's emotions.

538
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,400
Now that it's all over,

539
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,140
I lost any confidence to make any more shows.

540
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,380
Yeo Reum.

541
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,360
I'm not saying this as a friend.

542
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:32,200
But as a cast member of "Kingdom of Love," there were times I was disappointed by you,

543
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:37,520
but looking at the various results after it all ended,

544
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,480
I realized that I'm grateful to you for many things.

545
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:46,470
I was able to understand why you did what you did as a director.

546
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:52,110
And I was able to understand how hard you tried for the cast.

547
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:58,540
I liked that you were the producer in charge of me.

548
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:01,280
And I was grateful.

549
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:08,350
But what's the point?

550
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:11,760
I'm not favored by the viewers.

551
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:17,970
The reason why the "Kingdom of Love" did well was because Kang Chae Ri created it.

552
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:22,520
I just can't keep up with her.

553
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,500
My gosh.

554
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:35,880
Goo Yeo Reum, when you're experiencing burnout,

555
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,750
you can take a break before moving forward again.

556
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:44,350
But don't completely block off all paths to return.

557
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:48,420
I'm telling you this as someone who had wandered before.

558
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:55,030
Let's take a break. And hold off on your conclusion just yet.

559
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:57,620
Take some time for yourself, Yeo Reum.

560
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,740
Okay.

561
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:33,770

562
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,990
A 54-year-old male patient. It's been three days since his falx meningioma surgery.

563
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:56,680
His vitals are stable and his motor sensory is intact.

564
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,690
His proprioception deficit has improved compared to before the surgery.

565
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:01,410
What about his post-op CTs and MRIs?

566
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:04,100
The tumor has undergone complete resection, and there are no hematomas.

567
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:08,000
We're planning on starting him on gate rehabilitation today.

568
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:11,670
A 47-year-old female patient.

569
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:14,310
She's had a right frontotemporal parietal traumatic subdural hematoma,

570
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:17,180
and it's been five days since her operation for craniectomy hematoma removal.

571
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:20,190
Her vitals are stable, her self-breathing is intact after extubation,

572
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:23,610
and her sluggish right pupil is now prompt.

573
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,030

574
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:48,510
Hey, Yeo Reum.

575
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:52,270
Yeah, I just finished my afternoon rounds.

576
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:53,510
You woke up?

577
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:55,930
What time is it over there now?

578
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:58,590
You woke up pretty early. What about breakfast?

579
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:03,160
You're having coffee and a croissant at a cafe with a terrace?

580
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,490
I don't think that's something you should be telling me right now, Honey.

581
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,430
I'm just kidding. Enjoy your food.

582
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:12,860
I miss you a lot.

583
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,490
Yeah.

584
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,040
Are you hungry?

585
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,860
Yes, I'm a bit hungry.

586
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,930
Let's go.

587
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:27,480

588
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,370
- Hello. 
  - Hello.

589
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:31,180

590
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:35,610
Whoa, amazing.

591
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:38,730
A robot fries the chicken here.

592
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:41,280
It's something we should learn.

593
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,260
Like a robot, we need to continuously be accurate

594
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:46,330
and be unceasing in our editing.

595
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:48,900
Let's eat quickly and go back inside. Yes.

596
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,240
- Your chicken is here. 
 - Wow...

597
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:57,090
Enjoy your food.

598
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,700
- Have a drumstick. 
 - Oh, no, no. It's okay, Senior.

599
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,620
- Senior, you should— 
 - I'm okay.

600
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:05,670
In our variety show department, there's a tradition.

601
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:10,210
We give the most beloved junior two drumsticks.

602
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:14,240
Well, then, I'll eat this with much gratitude.

603
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,670
It's hard, right?

604
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:25,640
You thought you started a glamorous job as a broadcasting company PD,

605
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,860
but all you do is manual labor and the seniors keep getting on your case.

606
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,810
You feel like dying, huh?

607
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:32,430
Yes.

608
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:35,150
It is difficult, I guess.

609
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:36,300
Endure it.

610
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,230
As you endure, you'll get this feeling one day.

611
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:40,540
What kind of feeling?

612
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:43,850
Well, "I can't do anything else but this line of work."

613
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:47,230
"I'll be making shows no matter what."

614
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:48,580
That kind of feeling.

615
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:52,020
Senior, when did you get that feeling?

616
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,930
One day.

617
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:03,660
Order more if you need anything else.

618
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,040
Oh, no, I'm okay.

619
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:13,750
- Hello, Senior. 
 - Hey, yeah.

620
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:16,550
Hey, Kim Sang Woo.

621
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:18,070
Yes?

622
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:25,370
Do you want to join me on a new show I'm planning?

623
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:27,300
Well, about that...

624
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:31,040
- Why? You don't want to? 
 - No, it's not that I don't want to. Well...

625
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,600
Well...

626
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,920
Are you waiting for Goo Yeo Reum?

627
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:40,450
It's about time she returned...

628
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:42,910
- Hey, you... 
 - Yes?

629
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:44,500
Think carefully about this.

630
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,140
Just because Goo Yeo Reum took a break for six months,

631
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,200
do you think she radically came to her senses?

632
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,630
It's pretty obvious. Everything she plans is destined for failure.

633
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:56,670
And I'll... produce another hit.

634
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:02,550
For now, I'll try to wait for her.

635
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,790
You're on the path to destruction.

636
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:07,010
At this rate, if you keep going like this,

637
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:11,130
doomed, doomed, doomed. You'll be doomed!

638
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:13,060
You scared me.

639
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:15,400
Same old rice with the same old veggies. 
  (T/N: "Birds of a feather flock together")

640
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:18,890
What am I? A bibimbap?

641
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:24,410

642
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,470
Yeah.

643
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,710
Did you have fun with your friends?

644
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,930
I miss you, too.

645
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:38,680
Where should we meet later? I'm fine with wherever.

646
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:39,990

647
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:44,820
Hey, you... You're going to do this?

648
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,510
Yes.

649
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:49,660
The title is "Problem Family"?

650
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,230
Yes.

651
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:59,020

A variety show that carefully observes different dysfunctional families

652
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:03,170
and that explicitly reveal

653
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:05,480
the inner wounds and the process of healing

654
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:09,590
in order to demonstrate the meaning of family in this day and age—

655
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:15,090
Are you trying to expand your provocative craziness into the sphere of families?

656
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:17,410
I want to try it. A family reality show.

657
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:19,750
Why does it have to involve families?

658
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:22,030
Maybe as I work on it,

659
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:26,040
I might be able to find the answer

660
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,250
to what family is,

661
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:32,410
and how you can resolve the wounds you got from one.

662
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:55,450

663
00:48:57,890 --> 00:48:59,650

664
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:43,010
I guess you like this piece.

665
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:48,390
My eyes are drawn to it repeatedly.

666
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:56,330
An oil painting uses oil, which has physical properties that really reveal itself.

667
00:49:56,330 --> 00:50:00,320
It boldly shows off its color and texture on the canvas.

668
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:06,130
But Oriental paintings use physical properties of absorption on the materials.

669
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:09,720
I majored in Western art, but

670
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:14,770
I wonder if Oriental art, which gets absorbed into and smudges onto the paper

671
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:19,220
and shows off its own color by leaving its mark...

672
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,700
might have been a better fit for me sometimes.

673
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,990
Your interpretation is fantastic.

674
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,560
I talked too much when we'd just met.

675
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,790
Please enjoy your time looking around.

676
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:46,460
Han Ji Yeon.

677
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,260
Well...

678
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:55,640
You are Han Ji Yeon, who appeared in "Kingdom of Love," right?

679
00:50:57,310 --> 00:51:01,020
I really enjoyed watching you on the show.

680
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:03,100
Yes...

681
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:06,950
But as I was watching the show,

682
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:10,040
I found that man, Park Jae Hoon,

683
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,580
to be so pathetic. Excuse me?

684
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:16,370
He wasn't able to recognize what a catch you were

685
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:18,790
and kept making you cry.

686
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:22,280
If it were me, I would've never done that.

687
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:29,430
If it's all right with you,

688
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:32,810
I want to treat you to a delicious meal.

689
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:36,350

690
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:52,050

(Pork Feet)

691
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,360
- Thank you for the food. 
 - Thank you for the food.

692
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,620
It's good.

693
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,830
Wow, the jokbal is chewy and tasty!

694
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:12,150
Ji Wan, your mother's a fantastic cook!

695
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:13,890
Yes! It's delicious.

696
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:16,300
I had no idea you were the daughter of a pork feet restaurant owner.

697
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,930
Had we known, we would've hung out here much sooner.

698
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:20,480
- Right? 
 - That's right.

699
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,050
Please come often.

700
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:24,460
I'll give you lots of free sides.

701
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,960
Well... I have something to tell you all.

702
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,200
What is it? You seem pretty serious.

703
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,030
I know, right?

704
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:42,800
Ji Wan and I decided to get married.

705
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:45,770
- Amazing! 
 - Really?

706
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:47,940
Whoa! Oh, my gosh!

707
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:49,460
Wow, what is this!

708
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,730
- Whoa! 
 - A ring!

709
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:55,980
Wow, amazing!

710
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:58,410
- Amazing. 
 - What is this!

711
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:00,850
We just reserved the wedding hall for next year.

712
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:02,080
My goodness, I'm so happy for you.

713
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:05,310
Congratulations! I'm so happy for you.

714
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:06,650
You guys look good together.

715
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:08,600
Congratulations.

716
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:11,360
I'm so jealous.

717
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,560
When are we getting married?

718
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,040
We should get married.

719
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,790
I'll prepare right away. I'll hurry up and get on it.

720
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:18,760
Okay, then!

721
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,340
To congratulate my beloved brother John Jang

722
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:23,800
and Ji Wan on their engagement, cheers!

723
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,270
Cheers!

724
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:29,020
I want to say a toast.

725
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:33,450
I'm going to say something to Ji Wan today.

726
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:38,270
- Ji Wan. 
 - What?

727
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:42,430
You make me go crazy for you.

728
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,610
Too much!

729
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:48,210
John! Gosh...

730
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:49,470
Just wrap it up with a love shot.

731
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:52,070
Finish it up! Love shot.

732
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:54,520
 Love shot!

733
00:53:56,350 --> 00:53:58,850
Congratulations.

734
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:02,300
- Congratulations. 
 - Still the same.

735
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,430
Is PD Goo Yeo Reum doing well?

736
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:06,850
Yeo Reum is in Paris right now.

737
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:08,110
Paris?

738
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:09,570
Yes, it's already been six months.

739
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:11,330
Her workplace sent her to learn the language.

740
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:14,090
Oh, I see.

741
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:16,810
You must miss her a lot.

742
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,260
Yeo Reum...

743
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:57,570
Jae Hoon! I'm back.

744
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:59,610
How did you...

745
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:01,590
You didn't even call.

746
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:04,160
I wanted to surprise you.

747
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:14,000
Have you been well?

748
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:23,190
I missed you.

749
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:24,740
Me, too.

750
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:26,460
I missed you so much.

751
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:29,510
I missed you even more.

752
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:59,040
It's nice to take care of my skin.

 What's a happy ending?

764
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,200
 Amidst a difficult life where unforeseen misfortunes

765
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:04,520
 pop up on the long journey of life,

766
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:08,690
 I wonder what it means to have a happy ending.

767
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:15,700
 Perhaps life is a countless repetition of endings.

768
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:22,600
 Not a single ending you face when you die.

769
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:25,690
Honey, what's wrong?

770
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:30,100
 The endpoint of daily life you encounter every day.

771
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:39,500
I think we're having a baby...

772
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:46,100
 An overwhelmingly joyful moment you can never forget in your life.

773
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:51,000
 An unexpected happy ending.

774
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:58,810
 Just another day.

775
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:05,800
 A boring ending that repeats every day in your hectic daily life.

776
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:16,160
Honey, eat some more.

777
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:19,630
Honey, you should do it like this.

778
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:25,100
 Predictable and ordinary, yet a precious ending.

779
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:41,220

780
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:43,480
 A sad ending

781
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:48,430
 that comes out of nowhere to tear your life down.

782
00:58:57,590 --> 00:59:00,140

783
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:05,200
 And also, a happy ending that appears out of the blue

784
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:10,000
 one day and gives you the courage to go on again.

785
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:18,090
 If life is a countless repetition of unforeseen endings,

786
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:22,360
 then, I look forward to

787
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:26,560
 many happy endings occurring often in my life.

788
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:31,900
 Even if that doesn't happen and a sad ending

789
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:36,090
 comes upon us unexpectedly, it'll be all right.

790
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:41,200
 I tell myself to push through and live my life.

791
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:47,530
 Even if there is an ending to our love,

792
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:52,470
 I say our story will never end,

793
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:57,670
 that it doesn't matter if our daily life is repetitive and tedious,

794
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:02,260
 that you are never-ending for me,

795
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,400
 that it doesn't matter if it gets boring,

796
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,400
 and that you are my endpoint.

797
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,600
 I make this promise holding your hand.

798
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:25,720

799
01:00:26,770 --> 01:00:32,220
♫  Slow down the pace, you might slip  ♫

800
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:38,560
♫  Look around, you might be surprised to bump into something  ♫

801
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:43,680
♫  It's still not good timing  ♫

♫  We can stand together, a bit closer  ♫

804

805
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:04,860
♫  It's awkward, but carefully and slowly  ♫

806
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:09,370
♫  Let us kiss just like this  ♫

807
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:12,450

808

♫  Don't rush  ♫

810

01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:52,730
♫  The eyes that found me, the bright...  ♫
