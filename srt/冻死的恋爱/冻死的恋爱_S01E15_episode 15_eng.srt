00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:08,750

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,640

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,890
♫  Dive with you, towards the wide sea  ♫

4
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,040

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,950
♫  Jump in love, I fly with wings called you  ♫

6
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:28,140

♫  There is nothing to be afraid of  ♫

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,190
♫  In the world called you, it sparkles and lingers here  ♫

8
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:36,640
♫  What I found while wandering was you who 
 was always by my side  ♫

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,210
♫  I'm already ready for you  ♫

10
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,120

11
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,810

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,970

13
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,470
 Dad, I'm late. I'm off!

14
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,590
 Okay.

15
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,910
 Hey, Daughter!

16
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:07,030
 Gosh! Don't run, you're going to trip!

17
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,480
 Have fun in class.

18
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,050
 - Thanks, Dad! Bye! 
 - Okay!

19
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,010
 Is she in grade school?

20
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,570
 To come to school with her dad?

21
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,310
 I like tteokbokki! I like tteokbokki!

22
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,770
 You know eggs are a must, right?

23
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,300
 Of course.

24
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,190
 - Hard-boiled. Team hard-boiled! 
 - Team hard-boiled!

25
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,040
 - No, what are you saying? 
 - Soft-boiled eggs.

26
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,140
 - No way! 
 - Pass, pass!

27
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,270
 Yeo Reum! Hey, have one more before you go!

28
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,850
 - It's okay, I can't eat anymore. 
 - Hey, hey, hey.

29
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,760
 - Just one. Come on. 
 - I'm full.

30
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,090
 - Just one. Say, "Ah." 
 - I'm full, Dad.

31
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,620
 All right. Study hard!

32
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,930
 - Bye, Dad. 
 - Okay.

33
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,450

34
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,010
 Yeah, Mom.

35
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,610
 I'm briefly taking a break from studying.

36
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,590
 For dinner?

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,090
 I don't have an appetite.

38
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,040
 Oh, Mom. Bulgogi.

39
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,410
 I want to eat bulgogi. 
 (T/N: Marinated grilled beef)

40
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,740
 All right.

41
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,960
 Okay.

42
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,280
 I'll call you when I head home.

43
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,160
 Okay.

44
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,230
 Bulgogi!

45
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,840
 Kang Chae Ri?

46
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,000
 You're Kang Chae Ri, right?

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,190
 We're in the same major.

48
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,780
 I heard you're also preparing for the Media Examination.

49
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,610
 If it's all right with you, do you want to join our study group?

50
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,070
 I'm good.

51
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:02,600
 Hello?

52
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,780
 Examinee Kang Chae Ri, this is the personnel team from DNA.

53
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,210
 You've been accepted as a producer of the Variety Show Department.

54
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,220
 Congratulations.

55
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,690
 I got accepted.

56
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,060
 Kang Chae Ri!

57
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,400
 Hey, congrats!

58
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,360
 I heard you got accepted, too!

59
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,160
 Hey, you know Jang Min Gyo, right?

60
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,650
 The one in DNA Variety Department. He's our senior from the entering class of 2002.

61
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,270
 He just called me, and told me we were the first ones where classmates

62
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,470
 from the same college and same major have been accepted at the same time.

63
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,270
 Let's be good friends.

64
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,840
 Yeah?

65
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,270

66
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:13,980

67
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,290

68
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,500
 A totally crazy program. The producers are crazy, too.

69
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,550
 If a cast and producer made physical contact on site, could they have possibly...

70
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,860
 I heard it was a female producer and a male cast.

71
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,280
 Who's the brave male cast member?

72
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,000
 There was also a knife incident on site.

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,190
 - They're hopeless. 
 - They scammed the viewers. Make a national apology.

74
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,331
 This program is rigged. Let's sue the producer. Go to prison.

75
00:05:38,331 --> 00:05:40,900
 Looks like the producer picked men to suit her taste and played around with them.

76
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,850
 Guys, this is serious.

77
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,050
 They made such a sleazy program and profited from advertisements.

78
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,880
 And she dates as she pleases. Is she in her right mind?

79
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,070
 The PD who made this is actually a psychopath.

80
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,910
 Did you just realize that "Kingdom of Love" PD is a psychopath? I'm not even surprised.

81
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:55,130
 Shouldn't they first check the PD's character?

82
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,380

83
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,550

84
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,930

85
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,080
Yeo Reum.

86
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,850
You're getting off now?

87
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,340
Yeah.

88
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,670
- Yeo Reum. 
 - Yeah.

89
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,080
Do you want to go on a date next weekend?

90
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,660
Is there a movie you want to watch or...

91
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,150
should we eat something delicious?

92
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,590
Jae Hoon.

93
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,050
Yeah.

94
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,860
I have to show you something...

95
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,430
What is it?

96
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,080

97
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,150
Apparently, one of the cast members gave an anonymous interview.

98
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,740
That "Kingdom of Love" isn't a reality show,

99
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,980
and that it's all an orchestrated play.

100
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,140
That it's all rigged...

101
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:21,500
and that there was inappropriate physical contact between producer and cast on site.

102
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,760
Yeo Reum.

103
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,260
That time we kissed...

104
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,280
No matter how I think about it,

105
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,200
I think that's become a problem.

106
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,060
I shouldn't have allowed that to broadcast.

107
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:45,520
You're... in a difficult situation, right?

108
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,640
I have my own problems,

109
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,600
but what about you?

110
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,900
It's okay for me,

111
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,700
but since your face is widely recognized now,

112
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,890
you'll be the scapegoat in this situation.

113
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:03,180
You'll get extreme hate comments, too.

114
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,840
Jae Hoon, I'm sorry.

115
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,670
I'll do whatever it takes to claim responsibility and fix this.

116
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,010
Why would you claim responsibility?

117
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,590
And why would you fix this?

118
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,800
- I'll do it. 
 - Jae Hoon.

119
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,040
I mean... if there's a truth that needs to be revealed, I'll reveal it.

120
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,010
And if I need to apologize, I'll apologize.

121
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,660
If I need to be criticized, I'll be criticized.

122
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,380
I'll do it.

123
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:38,090
I'm the one who asked you to star in the "Kingdom of Love."

124
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:42,000
The staff has a duty to protect the cast,

125
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,490
and I have a duty to protect you.

126
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,910
I'm the one who made the decision.

127
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,820
You don't need to protect me.

128
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:01,040
Your life has... become wretched because of me.

129
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,410
I don't know why I'm always like this.

130
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:10,770
Everything... is just...

131
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,860
This is just all my fault.

132
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,100
Goo Yeo Reum...

133
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:24,610
I'm the one who joined "Kingdom of Love" because of my feelings for you.

134
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:27,340
Fully knowing I would have to date on camera,

135
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,080
I thought too lightly of it.

136
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,710
Full of thoughts for you,

137
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,450
I'm the one who went after you.

138
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,980
I don't care about hate comments.

139
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,220
I can take them as they come.

140
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,860
I'm fine.

141
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,350
Okay?

142
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,710
Come here.

143
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,180
It's all right.

144
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm really sorry, Jae Hoon. I'm really sorry.

145
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,160
What are you sorry for?

146
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,000
It's all right.

147
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,410
- I'm here. 
 - Yeo Reum!

148
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,250
- Goo Yeo Reum, you're here? 
 - Yeah.

149
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,060
Did you have breakfast? You want something to eat?

150
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,270
No, it's okay.

151
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,000
I just stopped by to give you this on my way to work.

152
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,280
What is this?

153
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,470
It's an air purifier we received from our sponsor for the program.

154
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:01,830
The staff each took one home, and I thought it would be a good idea to keep one here.

155
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,040
This was really nice on the set.

156
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,050
- Isn't it expensive? 
 - No.

157
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,820
What are you doing, Dae Shik?

158
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,430
Open.

159
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,880
Here.

160
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,160
Do I put it like this?

161
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,300
Okay, okay, okay.

162
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,590
Is it this one?

163
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,800
Whoa, it has a presence.

164
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,520
There's a lot of smoke when you cook. Leave it here and use it.

165
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,430
For Hye Jin and Dae Shik's respiratory health!

166
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,730
Thank you, we'll use it well.

167
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,290
Thank you. We'll really use it well.

168
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,590
- I'm leaving. 
 - You're going to work?

169
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,990
Yeo Reum, are you okay?

170
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,910
I think you're returning to work too soon.

171
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,720
It's okay, I'm fine.

172
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,450
Fine, my foot.

173
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,340
Hey, even in a car accident,

174
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:56,070
you might be fine on the outside, but your neck and shoulders are sore

175
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:58,290
and you suffer from the aftermath.

176
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,700
Don't overdo it.

177
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,380
She's right. Take it easy.

178
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,770
Why is your life so hardcore?

179
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,820
It's fine. I'm not overdoing it.

180
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,790
And filming is all over now, too.

181
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,890
The other PDs will do the remaining work.

182
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,530
I'm fine. I'm fine!

183
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,330
- I'm leaving. 
  - Okay.

184
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,900
Bye!

185
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,910
Take care!

186
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,320
How worrisome.

187
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,770
Seems like Yeo Reum is having a totally rough time and pushing herself too hard. Right?

188
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:34,340
Yeah. Totally.

189
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,680
No contact from them yet?

190
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,220
The writers left to meet the cast members.

191
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,200
No news from them?

192
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,170
I guess they're all denying it for now.

193
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,060
Saying it wasn't them.

194
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,300
We need to know who did the interview,

195
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,820
so we can settle things or whatnot.

196
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:19,490
Anyhow, reporters have been continuing to call us since yesterday.

197
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,900
What should we do?

198
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,570
Don't pick up for now.

199
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,930
We can't continue to push things off forever.

200
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:35,440
If we keep stalling, I feel like we're going to get backlash.

201
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,440
It's not like they showed their face proudly for the interview.

202
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,990
They went under our noses like a coward.

203
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,290
Why should we respond to each call?

204
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,230
Stall a bit more.

205
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,960
As soon as the final episode finishes tomorrow,

206
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,870
what should we do about the special broadcast we planned to do via YouTube?

207
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,650
Do you think it'll be possible?

208
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,160
Even if it's not an official broadcast,

209
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,500
gathering the cast members in this atmosphere

210
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,840
and talking about behind-the-scenes...

211
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,240
I'm getting a bad vibe.

212
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,220
Canceling can be done at any moment,

213
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,900
so let's just observe the mood for the day.

214
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,280
What the?

215
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,670
What? What? What is it now?

216
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,380
PD Goo, isn't this you?

217
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,910
Look.

218
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,000
Wait...

219
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,260

220
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,430

221
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,020
Goo Yeo Reum.

222
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,700
What is this?

223
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,380
Living together?

224
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,220
How should... I comprehend this?

225
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,620
He's a friend who lives in the house above me.

226
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,900
Friend?

227
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,510
On the first day of Park Jae Hoon's shoot,

228
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:26,000
you know how we urgently brought him in as a replacement?

229
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,750
He's my high school friend

230
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:32,530
and he originally lived in the house above me.

231
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,130
Yeah?

232
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:37,920
But this is how the article was published?

233
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,160
Yes.

234
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,690
Then you two have nothing going on. Right?

235
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,200
Right?

236
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,450
- Director? 
 - Yeah, PD Kang.

237
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,870
You probably already heard,

238
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,670
but Park Jae Hoon and Goo Yeo Reum are friends

239
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:07,090
and I'm the one who told her to bring him.

240
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,560
You're the one who told her to bring him?

241
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,920
Yes. I've bumped into him a couple of times myself,

242
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,750
so I picked him as a replacement.

243
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:22,850
And... I think it's semi-stalking to secretly take pictures

244
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,850
and publish articles on a non-celebrity.

245
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:27,990
The staff will take strong action.

246
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,550
Fine.

247
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,190
You two talk it out nicely.

248
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:47,200
Don't leave any loose ends for them to cause any trouble. Okay?

249
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,760
Okay.

250
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,820
Okay.

251
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,710
Kang Chae Ri,

252
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,340
what's with you?

253
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,800
What?

254
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,560
- You know the gist of it. 
 - Of what?

255
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,220
Jae Hoon and me.

256
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,460
I've thought about it and instead of clumsily avoiding it,

257
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,990
I think facing it head-on is a better idea.

258
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,220
Apologize for what needs to be apologized for,

259
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,460
and be criticized for what we should be criticized.

260
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,650
I think that'd be neat and clean.

261
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,720
Goo Yeo Reum.

262
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,250
Yeah.

263
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,100
Stop flapping your wings and stay put.

264
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,330
I'm going to fix things.

265
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:47,080
How will you fix things?

266
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:53,990
The one who gave an interview saying it's a rigged program and a rehearsed play is Kim Joon Ho.

267
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:56,910
Kim Joon Ho? And the female producer and male cast,

268
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,330
who shared inappropriate physical contact was Hwang Jang Goon and me.

269
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:00,910
What?

270
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,110
It was you?

271
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,700
You did?

272
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,860
Yeah, Hwang Jang Goon and I slept together.

273
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,320
Wait... Why?

274
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,830
No... How did this happen?

275
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,380
Just...

276
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,460
It just happened.

277
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,980
I got a call from Kim Joon Ho yesterday.

278
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,020

279
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,140
 - Hello? 
 - PD Kang Chae Ri,

280
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,460
 it's me, Kim Joon Ho.

281
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:52,910
 He said he had a photo of me going into Hwang Jang Goon's bedroom.

282
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:57,750
 He suggested we make a deal before he shares it with reporters.

283
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,140
Hey, you...

284
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,380
Why are you telling me this now?

285
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,590
I was busy thinking about how to resolve this.

286
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,890
What did Kim Joon Ho say to you?

287
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,530
No, what was he requesting of you?

288
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:17,330
First, he didn't want to make it public knowledge

289
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,170
that he's the reason behind the knife incident.

290
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:24,450
Second, he wants to be paid eight times more than the other members.

291
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:28,620
And? What did you say?

292
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,500
I told him... to go ahead and share the photos with the reporters.

293
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,480
The threat wasn't that convincing.

294
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,070
Hey...

295
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,480
Hwang Jang Goon is like a weed, so he'll be fine with this much.

296
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,760
So you stay out of this.

297
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,370
I'll take care of the photo that surfaced today.

298
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,580
No.

299
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,490
What?

300
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:57,670
The photo that Kim Joon Ho says he has... we can't let it spread.

301
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:00,670
Let's just fulfill his request.

302
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,570
This is fatal for you, too.

303
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:06,960
And also considering Hwang Jang Goon... we can't let this happen.

304
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:13,580
Where did the person who just said she'll face things head-on go?

305
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:17,860
Well, that was... regarding the situation that has already unfolded.

306
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,700
We need to prevent what we can.

307
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,710
I'll meet Kim Joon Ho.

308
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:28,340
Then you and Park Jae Hoon will be blamed for everything.

309
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,210
"We were originally friends."

310
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,880
"He's my high school friend, but I brought him as a replacement."

311
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,710
Even if you officially explain, people will keep inquiring about the relationship between you two.

312
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:44,230
If a photo of Hwang Jang Goon and me is exposed, then you'll become safe.

313
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,670
Don't you want to use me as a shield?

314
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:50,840
Are you... that altruistic of a person?

315
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,970
Don't be a clumsy hypocrite.

316
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:05,660
Just enjoy the show and eat some popcorn.

317
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,620

318
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,250

319
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,830

320
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,000

321
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,250
Hey, Dae Shik.

322
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,420
Hey, Park Jae Hoon, are you okay?

323
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,970
Yeah, I'm okay.

324
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:51,150
Hey, you must've really become famous.

325
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,470
 You're involved in scandals that are only for superstars.

326
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:56,130
What on earth is going on? You must really be making it big!

327
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,660
Honey, are you spitting words out of your butt?

328
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:02,730
Hey, did you call to check in on me or to tease me?

329
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,730
 Of course, I'm teasing you, you punk. You kidding me?

330
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,530
Honey, just stay put.

331
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:12,570
- Jae Hoon, this is Hye Jin. 
  - Hey, Hye Jin.

332
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:15,730
Come over to our store later for dinner.

333
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,500
 I want to talk to you face-to-face.

334
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,580
Sure, let's do that. I got it.

335
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,440
- Honey. 
 - Yeah.

336
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,820
Aren't you worried about Yeo Reum and Jae Hoon?

337
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,140
What's there to worry about? It's a good thing it happened.

338
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,170
What do you mean it's a good thing?

339
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:38,190
Gosh, I think it's a big deal.

340
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,460
Think about it carefully.

341
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,840
If you think about it, you and I getting married was a similar situation to this.

342
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,710
What?

343
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:49,700
We were kissing in front of your house and got caught red-handed by your father and dragged into the house.

344
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,940
Right? And we drank a ton.

345
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,960
Oh, come on! Why are you bringing up that embarrassing story right now?

346
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,160
I got totally wasted and passed out.

347
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:02,220
After I ate the pollack soup your mom made the next morning, I barely got released.

348
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,930
That's right.

349
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:08,660
Gosh, it was like that back then.

350
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:14,790
What I'm saying is once their relationship is revealed to everyone, there's no going back from there.

351
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:18,540
Jae Hoon and Yeo Reum have entered the road of no return.

352
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,300
Is that so?

353
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,730
Fine, let's think positively.

354
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:28,460
- Yeah? 
 - Yeah.

355
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,230
We're here.

356
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,340
- Oh, Honey. 
 - Huh?

357
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,370
Sit still. I'll open the door for you.

358
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:50,110
Please come out.

359
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:00,120
Gosh.

360
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:04,000
Hye Jin,

361
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,160
thank you.

362
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,200
For what?

363
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,170
IVF must be really difficult,

364
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:15,000
but for not giving up and continuing on.

365
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,480
I really respect you.

366
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,500
I can do this only because you take good care of me by my side.

367
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,050
I'm the one thankful.

368
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,430
- Let's go in. 
 - Okay.

369
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,190

370
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,400

371
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,580

372
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:10,430

373
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,320
Man, whatever.

374
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,510

375
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,740
Yes, Professor. Hello, this is Jae Hoon.

376
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:43,090
Oh, yes, all right.

377
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:46,360
Then I'll visit you right away.

378
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,760
Yes.

379
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,530
Doctor Park, you've become a total celebrity.

380
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,800
I couldn't watch the show since I've been busy,

381
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:10,530
but the residents and the nurses wouldn't give it a rest, saying you're cool.

382
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,710
Are you debuting in the entertainment industry now?

383
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,420
Oh, no, I'm not.

384
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:18,960
I just happened to star, coincidentally.

385
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,970
Doctor Park,

386
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:26,470
I'll be of retirement age in a few years,

387
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,530
and I need to start preparing for retirement.

388
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:32,590
Wait, you're... already...

389
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,830
You still have many years ahead.

390
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,960
Successors and whatnot sound too grand.

391
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,520
But our Neurosurgery Department does need young blood.

392
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,010
That's why I called you here.

393
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:57,370
Jae Hoon, after you left the medical field, I was really miserable.

394
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:01,490
A student I treasured was struggling with his sadness.

395
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:06,500
But as a mentor and as an adult, I was miserable because I couldn't hold you up.

396
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,600
It's all my fault.

397
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,050
You've done more than enough for me.

398
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:21,350
In life, unbearably tough times... can fall hard on anyone.

399
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:27,120
Overcoming those times is what life is about, and that becomes your destiny.

400
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,330
It's not too late.

401
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,950
Return to your original position.

402
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:39,640
That... middle school student you saved,

403
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,870
I heard he got accepted to our medical school.

404
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:45,910
Yes.

405
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:51,840
That person you saved is dreaming about saving other people.

406
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:55,900
Think about the place you need to return to...

407
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,890
and what you need to do from now on.

408
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:05,930
I'm telling you to decide again on the type of life you'll be living from here on.

409
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,390
Over here.

410
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,560
Hello, I'm Park Hyeon Seo.

411
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,360
Yes, hello. I'm Kim Sang Woo.

412
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:12,070
Oh, I ordered an iced Americano beforehand.

413
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,940
Oh, so sensible.

414
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,740
Thank you.

415
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,920
We only got to text so far, and we finally meet in person.

416
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,670
That's true. I apologize. I kept postponing the date, right?

417
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,100
Not at all.

418
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:35,120
Is the injury you got at the set getting better?

419
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,090
I heard you were stabbed, so I was so shocked.

420
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:41,760
Yes, it's almost healed completely. So I'm okay.

421
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,790
You must've been scared to death.

422
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,590
At least I was stabbed in the arm.

423
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:49,300
If it was anywhere else, things could've been worse.

424
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:55,880
I think you're really brave. Even after experiencing that, you're so calm.

425
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,230
I usually don't get shocked or... get furious that seriously.

426
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,660
I think it's just my personality.

427
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:07,300
You're more manly than I thought, too.

428
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,410
In fact, in contrast to my looks,

429
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,920
I'm the macho man style.

430
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:19,110
I also have abs.

431
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:23,140
Abs? Really?

432
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,070
Yes, I like to exercise.

433
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,170
What exercise?

434
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:29,760
I go to the gym and also like to bowl.

435
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,240
Bowling? I'm also good at bowling.

436
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,000
- Really? 
 - Yes.

437
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,470
I was in the bowling club in high school.

438
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,990
Then, do you want to go bowling while we're on the topic?

439
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,290
Sounds great!

440
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,110
Great.

441
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,150
I even went to a hair salon to meet you.

442
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,230
You went to a salon?

443
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,710
It's Inferior Han Ji Yeon.

444
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,190
- Professor! 
 - Oh, hello.

445
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,770
Have you seen the article by any chance?

446
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:02,050
What article are you talking about?

447
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:05,990
In Kingdom of Love, Superior Jae Hoon, who flirted with you—

448
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,720
I mean, Park Jae Hoon.

449
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,610
He's apparently living together with the PD in charge.

450
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:12,460
Did you make your final selection, Professor?

451
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,940
You couldn't have been betrayed, right?

452
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,220
I'm so curious about the final results.

453
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:20,690
Then, what happened to you two?

454
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,880
Isn't it the Inferior Ji Yeon from the Kingdom of Love?

455
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,230
Whoa, it is her!

456
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,140
- It's her, right? 
 - Yes.

457
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,200
Inferior Ji Yeon and Superior Jae Hoon.

458
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,370
- She's really pretty. 
 - Seriously.

459
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:52,480

460
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,760
Welcome!

461
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,370
I'd like to get two portions of eel and a bottle of soju, please.

462
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,870
Okay.

463
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:34,570

464
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:42,450
 I'll try it.

465
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:31,060

466
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,140
Yes, Yeo Reum.

467
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,760
Jae Hoon... where are you right now?

468
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,100
I'm home.

469
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,010
I went out shortly, but now I'm home.

470
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:53,160
- You saw the article, right? 
 - I did.

471
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,960
 Are you okay?

472
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,900
Of course, I'm okay. What about you?

473
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,580
Me, too.

474
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,460
I'm okay.

475
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,600
Jae Hoon...

476
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,670
 I have something to discuss with you.

477
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,280
What is it?

478
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,680
I'll go home right now.

479
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:20,110
I have something to decide after talking to you.

480
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:22,340
Okay, come home.

481
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,990
- I'll wait. 
 -  Okay.

482
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,650

483
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:55,740
Hello, Ji Wan.

484
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,670
Hello.

485
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:01,960
Sorry?

486
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,730
Right now?

487
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:08,150
- Ji Wan! 
 - PD Goo!

488
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:13,150
What did you need to give me so urgently?

489
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,500
It's this.

490
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,710
What's this?

491
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:23,498
- The picture Joon Ho held on to. 
 - What?

492
00:36:23,498 --> 00:36:27,480
It's the picture of PD Kang going into Hwang Jang Goon's room.

493
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,980
There's also a video.

494
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,890
How did you get this?

495
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:48,330
 You came, Ji Wan.

496
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,640
 Yes.

497
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,640
 What did you need to tell me?

498
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,130
 You did it, Joon Ho, didn't you?

499
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:00,800
 The interview that claims the Kingdom of Love is a rigged program.

500
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:07,790
 It's you who exposed the female PD and a male cast is

501
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,040
 engaged in that kind of relationship.

502
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:15,850
 I'm not... the one who did that.

503
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:16,930
 It is you.

504
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:18,630
 It really wasn't me.

505
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:21,230
 What's the picture evidence you talked about?

506
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,860
 Do you really have such a thing?

507
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:35,850
 Well... what if...

508
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:40,100
 I am the one who they interviewed...

509
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:43,420
 and the picture evidence is real?

510
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,630
 Erase the original file right now and

511
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:49,110
 give me the copy.

512
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:51,480
 Why would I do that?

513
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,210
 I also... will do an interview.

514
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,360
 I won't do it anonymously like you-know-who.

515
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,120
 Instead, I'll show my name and my face clearly.

516
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,310
 What interview will you be doing?

517
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:12,220
 I'll say you intentionally talked about how I was sexually harassed in front of the camera.

518
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:17,450
 To attract people's attention, I'll say that you used me.

519
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:19,270
 What are you saying right now?

520
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:23,370
 Try being honest at least once.

521
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:27,430
 I was the easiest target... and that's why you used me.

522
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,020
 Thinking if you get involved with a never-dated single like me,

523
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,920
 you'd be aired as an entertaining character.

524
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:37,660
 Ji Wan... you have a huge misunderstanding here.

525
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,670
 It wasn't like that.

526
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:46,610
 I liked you, Ji Wan... with all my heart.

527
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:49,460
 I still like you even now, too.

528
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:57,060
 People around me... told me to try doing a live-stream channel.

529
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,170
 I think it'd be fun.

530
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:03,020
 It'd be fun to talk about the knife incident

531
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:06,300
 that happened on the set one day.

532
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,850
 What do you think?

533
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:14,100
 Would you be okay... even if I expose all these stories?

534
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:19,080
 Or... should I make a webtoon about us?

535
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,660
 With the main character's name...

536
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:25,220
 as Kim Joon Ho?

537
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:38,150

538
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,360
 Give me the copy as well.

539
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,530
 Hurry up.

540
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:48,600
It seemed like you were in a tough spot.

541
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:53,970
So... I blackmailed Joon Ho.

542
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:03,400
Why did you go to this extent, Ji Wan?

543
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,610
I thought Joon Ho had

544
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:10,820
some weird pictures of you

545
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:14,660
and Park Jae Hoon together.

546
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,390
But when I saw them,

547
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:20,080
they were PD Kang Chae Ri and Hwang Jang Goon.

548
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,200
Ji Wan...

549
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,600
Please use this file however you'd like.

550
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:30,810
It's better for you to have the sword handle in your hand.

551
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:33,270
So I brought it here.

552
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,900
Thank you so much.

553
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,140
But why...

554
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,850
why are you helping me this much?

555
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:54,310
Because I'm grateful.

556
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:57,910
I heard from PD Kim Sang Woo.

557
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:00,250
I heard that you...

558
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:06,800
put in a lot of effort to prevent the sexual harassment story from being aired.

559
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,780
Did Sang Woo say something like that?

560
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:15,260
Also, you were also the one who allowed me

561
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,570
to appear in the Kingdom of Love.

562
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,260
Thank you.

563
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:25,950
Thanks to you, I made a lot of good memories.

564
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,030
Additionally, thanks to you,

565
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:37,410
I came to like someone with all my heart...

566
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:45,600
and was able to experience heartbreak as well.

567
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,560
Thank you.

568
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,070
I'm even more thankful.

569
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:58,800
I'll... really think deeply about this

570
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,200
and use it in the best way possible.

571
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,690
My job is done here, so I'll go now.

572
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:10,510
I'll see you tomorrow at the filming for the special.

573
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,120
Okay.

574
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:17,860
- Ji Wan... 
 - Yes?

575
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,530
Can I ask you just one thing?

576
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,340
Sure.

577
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:25,420
You said your heart broke because you came

578
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,060
to like someone with all your heart.

579
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:30,340
Was it, by any chance...

580
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:33,470
Joon Ho?

581
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:26,580
I'm here.

582
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,280
Welcome.

583
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,730
Park Ji Wan is amazing.

584
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:39,500
I'm seeing her in a new light.

585
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,820
Right.

586
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:44,480
I was also really surprised.

587
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:49,160
I'm more grateful that she went to that extent out of gratitude for you.

588
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:51,600
Yes.

589
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:56,800
What do you want to do...

590
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,650
about this?

591
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:05,850
What do you want to do?

592
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,440
I can protect you with this.

593
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,440
If this picture gets released, then we can...

594
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,670
live quietly until people don't

595
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:26,160
pay attention to us anymore.

596
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,820
Wouldn't that be the best result...

597
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,150
for you and me both?

598
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:37,570
Do you really want to do that?

599
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:49,930
I don't know.

600
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:57,410
If it's okay with you...

601
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,550
let's get rid of that file.

602
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,260
Or... give it to PD Kang Chae Ri.

603
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:08,900
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

604
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:13,610
Well, it's true I liked you throughout the shoot.

605
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:16,390
I don't want to hide behind someone else.

606
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:28,120
Why are you okay with everything?

607
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:30,400
You're okay with bad comments...

608
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,830
and okay with how people see you...

609
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:35,380
and even okay with being a scapegoat.

610
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:40,460
Why are you okay with everything?

611
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:44,390
♫  Happiness slowly wells up within me  ♫

612
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:50,910
♫  A hot summer and you smiling in it  ♫

613
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:53,200
- Yeo Reum... 
 - Yes.

614
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:58,070
I'm going to return to the hospital.

615
00:45:58,070 --> 00:45:59,190
What?

616
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:02,420
I plan to return to the Neurosurgery Department.

617
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,250
Jae Hoon!

618
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:08,940
I appeared in the Kingdom of Love because of you.

619
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:14,560
Due to that, the story of my father's passing was told to everyone.

620
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,780
I also got to meet Myeong Hoon again.

621
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,500
I thought I'd never recover from it,

622
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,030
but after my wound was exposed to the world,

623
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:29,800
it actually... became okay.

624
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,180
Jae Hoon... you really made the right decision.

625
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,620
You did really well. Really.

626
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:39,800
That's why... I don't want to hide this, either.

627
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,600
Well... we don't need to state in front of people,

628
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,510
but...

629
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,850
let's not hide it, either.

630
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:52,340
Just the way things are...

631
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:55,500
Just the way our feelings have flowed...

632
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,450
Let's just let it be.

633
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:04,350
Okay.

634
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:49,470
Sir, please give me the check.

635
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,450
You're going to Yeonhui-dong, right?

636
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:23,190
Yes.

637
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,730
Miss, why are you crying?

638
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:13,050
Did something upset you today?

639
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:22,140
Because a person's feelings...

640
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:25,080
are just too unfair.

641
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:30,570
For someone,

642
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:33,040
his feelings are taken for granted.

643
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,650
She can have his heart so easily.

644
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:43,900
Yet, no matter how much I try,

645
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:46,480
it's impossible for me to possess.

646
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,700
That makes me so sad.

647
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:54,250
You must've been so hurt.

648
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:59,320
Tears keep coming down.

649
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:07,960
But...

650
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,850
even if I can't like him...

651
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:16,800
it's still okay to cry because of that person. Right?

652
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,750
You're drinking soju with no side dishes?

653
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,580
I have one side dish.

654
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:11,810
Ma'am, please give us two glasses here.

655
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:14,680
Also, one order of chicken feet, please.

656
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,690
A little bit of the fishcake soup, please.

657
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:18,320
Okay.

658
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,940
Why are you asking for two glasses?

659
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:23,600
Thank you.

660
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:48,450
Park Ji Wan came to see me earlier today.

661
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:49,770
Why?

662
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:51,880
She brought a USB...

663
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:56,660
that has the pictures of you and Hwang Jang Goon.

664
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:00,580
What?

665
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:03,760
That's why...

666
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:12,250
I'm going to get rid of it.

667
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:27,240
Have you eaten yet?

668
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:28,410
Not yet.

669
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:31,350
It's so late. Why haven't you eaten yet?

670
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:33,900
Sit down. I'll give you food.

671
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,220
Honey, Jae Hoon is here!

672
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:38,070
He says he didn't eat yet!

673
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:39,700
He still hasn't eaten?

674
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,750
Wait just a moment!

675
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:43,550
Okay.

676
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:46,080
I'll sit over here. Gosh...

677
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:54,170
What are you doing right now?

678
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:59,390
I'll explain that Jae Hoon and I originally lived in one house on different floors.

679
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:01,610
And erase these pictures.

680
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:03,280
Then during tomorrow's special,

681
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,490
let's have all the cast say whatever they want to say.

682
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,100
Where do you get this confidence from?

683
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:14,360
It's confidence in a person's heart.

684
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:21,380
How come everything is all flowery and nice for you?

685
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:24,150
Why is the world so beautiful for you?

686
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:27,200
It's not that the world is beautiful.

687
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,250
I just...

688
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:31,640
I just have trust.

689
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:36,450
Park Ji Wan, who came to me with this, and

690
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:38,620
Hwang Jang Goon, who spent a night with you

691
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:42,100
although I don't know his story...

692
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:46,400
and all of our cast members.

693
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:51,240
I'm saying it's okay to let everyone's hearts flow as they please.

694
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,890
I just believe that.

695
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:57,330
Kingdom of Love is a reality program.

696
00:53:57,330 --> 00:54:01,610
Let's just let things flow naturally as they would.

697
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:06,910
Also, let's do what we need to do.

698
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,580
Okay?

699
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:15,180
Sure.

700
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,510
Let's do that.

701
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:21,530
Reality is a filthy thing, anyway.

702
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:38,380
Why do you find the world so filthy?

703
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:42,130
Let me just ask you this while we're on this.

704
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:45,290
Ever since we got into the company and until now,

705
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:48,010
why are you so disagreeable with me?

706
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,360
Did I wrong you in any way?

707
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,890
 Hey, no hagfish today.

708
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:03,820
 I'm going to order it anyway.

709
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:06,550
 It's so delicious. We have to.

710
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,720
Gosh, Kang Chae Ri is over there.

711
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:14,220
Geez, I'm losing my appetite. Let's go elsewhere.

712
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:15,670
That crazy bitch.

713
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:17,080
I don't feel like drinking.

714
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:20,200
- Let's go. 
 - So annoying.

715
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:24,070
What are you saying in front of a person's face right now?

716
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:25,570
What did we do?

717
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:29,550
You just said she's making you lose your appetite while looking at her.

718
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:31,260
We just said it to ourselves.

719
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:33,250
Mind your own business.

720
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:35,330
- Apologize to her. 
 - What the heck.

721
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:37,150
I said to apologize!

722
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:40,100
Hey, hey! Goo Yeo Reum!

723
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:41,900
Just let them be.

724
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,220
Hey, aren't you offended?

725
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:45,640
I'm not.

726
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,510
She says she's fine.

727
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,530
Even a crazy bitch like her has a friend.

728
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:51,420
They're probably both crazy.

729
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:54,890
What? Crazy bitch?

730
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:56,630
Are you done running your mouth? Huh?

731
00:55:56,630 --> 00:56:00,390
If you're her friend, you'd know better than anyone, wouldn't you?

732
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:03,480
That Kang Chae Ri is a total crazy bitch. Isn't that right?

733
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:06,000
Also, you call a crazy bitch, a crazy bitch. What else?

734
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,260
- A crazy bastard? 
 - Is she?

735
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:09,440
- Seriously. 
 - Let's go.

736
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,060
Wait a minute!

737
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:12,900
What the heck?

738
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:17,830
- She's also a nutcase. 
 - What a nut.

739
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,210
What's that?

740
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,370
- What are you doing? 
 - What? What?

741
00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:29,070
W-Why? What?

742
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:32,530
- Have some. 
 - No, I'm...

743
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:36,570
I don't like it.

744
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,810
She's my crazy bitch.

745
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:11,230
My fucking bitch. Okay?

746
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,530
Will you apologize or not?

747
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:17,320
PD Kang Chae Ri!

748
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:20,900
Sorry, we made a slip of the tongue. Sorry.

749
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,830
Please have a good time.

750
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:24,540
She's too tough...

751
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:39,170
You'll get a hole in your stomach like that.

752
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:41,200
It's okay.

753
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:44,780
I enjoy eating spicy food.

754
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:48,840
Now, let me hear your answer.

755
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:52,780
Why are you being such a bitch to me?

756
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,600
Here.

757
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:03,800
Wait, why are there so many side dishes today?

758
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:07,290
Eat plenty.

759
00:58:07,290 --> 00:58:09,550
Thank you for the meal.

760
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,110
It's delicious.

761
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:26,080
Hey, I'll get indigestion.

762
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:29,780
Why are you staring so intensely at me?

763
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,010
Tell us honestly.

764
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:33,770
What?

765
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:39,380
You had an unusual vibe with Yeo Reum last time.

766
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,910
Our Hye Jin has great intuition.

767
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:45,530
The sixth sense, I guess women just have that.

768
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:50,090
You two have something going on, right?

769
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:56,740
Yes.

770
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:10,830
I think Yeo Reum and I will have to separate.

771
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:12,370
What?

772
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,140
- What... 
 - What

773
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:16,440
Separate?

774
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:20,110
What's this? Did you guys ever go out?

775
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:06,230

776
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:11,340
 Yes.

777
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:17,250
Dr. Park!

778
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:19,760
What brings you here without even calling?

779
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,680
Professor...

780
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,870
I'll return to the Neurosurgery Department.

781
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:43,520
 Come in.

782
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:50,570
Yes, PD Goo. What brings you here?

783
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,490

784
01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:00,030
Director...

785
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:03,920
I'm going to resign.

786
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:14,980

787
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:24,350
♫  What can make me flutter in the wind like this  ♫

788
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:29,300
♫  Carrying pink imaginations between the two of us  ♫

789
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:32,310
♫  I don't even blink  ♫

790
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:36,790
♫  I can't believe this feeling  ♫

791
01:01:36,790 --> 01:01:44,810
♫  You gently blow into my bleak daily life  ♫

792
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:48,040
♫  In the flow, something changed  ♫

793
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:51,050

794
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:53,680
 I can no longer pretend to be okay.

795
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,822
 You can leave this field permanently anytime. Give it more thought.

796
01:01:56,822 --> 01:01:57,980
 Are all the cast members here?

797
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:00,500
 Are you okay with seeing Kim Joon Ho face-to-face?

798
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,800
 Why wouldn't I be okay?

799
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,390
 I want to see it to the end, although I don't know what might happen.

800
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:07,020
 - Ji Yeon, aren't you offended? 
 - About what?

801
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:09,200
 Even the article about them living together came out.

802
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,870
 I think we can bring them down completely if you want, Ji Yeon.

803
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:14,952
 The living together controversy came out a few days ago.

804
01:02:14,952 --> 01:02:17,867
 I think we need to talk about that first.

805
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:21,767
♫  With the scent, embracing my entire body  ♫
