1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:08,970

2
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,720

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,740
♫  Dive with you, towards the wide sea  ♫

4
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,060

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:24,160
♫  Jump in love, I fly with wings called you  ♫

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,060

♫  There is nothing to be afraid of  ♫

7
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,120
♫  In the world called you, it sparkles and lingers here  ♫

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:36,750
♫  What I found while wandering was you who 
 was always by my side  ♫

9
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,220
♫  I'm already ready for you  ♫

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,100

11
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,570

12
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,620

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,850
 I'll give you a progress report on the surgery patients from last week.

14
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,260
 Patient Kim Tae Shik started tracheostomy training and patient Yoon Jong Pil is able to sit up.

15
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,680

So he began the active PT.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,460
 And for patient Im Seon Ha, a cranioplasty will be scheduled.

17
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,890
 Since her guardian will come in tomorrow,

18
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,810
 we scheduled her surgery as the second one due to permission issues.

19
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,370
 - Jong Chan! 
 - Yes?

20
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,070
 - Did you hear the rumor? 
 - What about...

21
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:11,290
 My colleague Um Joo An, the cardiothoracic surgery fellow, just got his day off.

22
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,140
 Oh, I heard he hasn't left the hospital building for a very long time.

23
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,740
 Hey, I haven't felt the outside air for 116 days, either.

24
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,860
 It doesn't make sense that our department is busier than the

25
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,600
 cardiothoracic department with only two doctors!

26
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,780
 So I was thinking...

27
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,970
 I'm going to enjoy my day off today.

28
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,550
 What should your attitude be on a day like today?

29
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,130
 There shouldn't be any emergency surgeries today.

30
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,140
 Even if there is, there shouldn't be.

31
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,050
 Right on. That's it right there.

32
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,820
 So, I'm going on my way today.

33
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,990
 Don't stop me.

34
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,240
 For the patient starting the tracheostomy training, start with a 10-minute duration.

35
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,660
 For the one doing the active PT, note after he's able to stand up.

36
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,220
 And when the surgery schedule for tomorrow is confirmed, text me.

37
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,550
 - Okay. 
 - Right away.

38
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,170
 Don't text me if you miss me.

39
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,620
 Okay.

40
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,060
 Hey, Yeo Reum.

41
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,810
 Jae Hoon, are you busy?

42
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,400
 Are you in surgery all day again?

43
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,740
 No, I'm off today. What's wrong with your voice?

44
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,850
 Yeo Reum, are you crying?

45
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,410
 I broke up with Kim In Woo...

46
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:30,340
 That jerk left me in the Eungok rest area.

47
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,910
 Wait a minute...

48
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,500
 So Kim In Woo left you behind in a highway rest area?

49
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,540
 I did tell him to leave, but...

50
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,460
 he actually did leave me behind.

51
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,260
 Gosh, talk about pulling all the stops...

52
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,250
 All right. I'll be there. Wait for me.

53
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,450
 Is it going North or South?

54
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,910
 It's an emergency! Hurry! Hurry!

55
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,720
 Go! Go!

56
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,070

57
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,120
 Hey, Jong Chan.

58
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,630
 Please prepare and wait over there.

59
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,180
 This bed, too. Same thing.

60
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,630
 A building near the intersection in front of the hospital caved in from a gas explosion.

61
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,110
 And the patients' condition? Two people are unconscious, so we took an emergency CT.

62
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,530
 One male is unidentifiable due to the burn from the explosion.

63
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,590
 He seems to be middle aged.

64
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,100
 He's in a semi-coma and his pupils are at 3 mm and 5 mm. They're sluggish.

65
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,300
 The left SDH thickness from the CT is 20 mm.

66
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,830
 The mid-line shifting is at 15 mm.

67
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,550
 The other patient is a male middle schooler.

68
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,440
 We're locating his guardian and his mental state is at stupor, and his pupils are prompt.

69
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,670
 His right SDH thickness is 30 mm.

70
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,000
 But...

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,660
 But it's not thin enough so he'll likely get worse.

72
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,420
 The surgery rooms are full, and we have only one OR open. What should we do?

73
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,520
 Which one should I put in the OR?

74
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,480
 I'll start the surgery.

75
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,110
 Scalpel.

76
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,690

77
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:29,650

78
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,660

79
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,080
Coming home now?

80
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,670
Yes.

81
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,780
Did you go somewhere?

82
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,040
Yeah. I had dinner with Kim In Woo.

83
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,470
I see.

84
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,850
Yeo Reum.

85
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,960
Yeah?

86
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,770
Are you two seeing each other again?

87
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,020
- Jae Hoon. 
 - Yes?

88
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,370
Should...

89
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,090
I marry Kim In Woo?

90
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,310
I mean, you should stop jumping the gun.

91
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:32,220
Just because a man stopped by a few times,

92
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,440
you're already booking the wedding hall and going on your honeymoon by yourself.

93
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,420
Where are you going this time?

94
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,190
- What's that? 
 - It's a ring.

95
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,670
Did that punk ask you to marry him? Showing up out of nowhere after three years?

96
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,830
Why are you so annoyed?

97
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,150
I mean, it's not just dating. Isn't getting married so random?

98
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:53,140
I mean, I'm 37 years old and In Woo is 40.

99
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,990
If we're to see each other again, of course, we should consider marriage.

100
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,960
I really don't get it, Yeo Reum.

101
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,060
You don't think stuff like this is important, right?

102
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,370
You think dating and marriage are a nuisance.

103
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:10,240
Without any surprises, ordinarily,

104
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,370
did you ever come across moments you wanted to live dating,

105
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:19,790
getting married, and having a child according to the book...

106
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,520
through different phases of life?

107
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,670
It used to fit perfectly before.

108
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,730
 Let's get married.

109
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:17,510
 I can't accept this.

110
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,940
 I'm stunned that you showed up after all this time. And get married?

111
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,710
 If I asked you to date me after all this time,

112
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:28,240
 wouldn't that be even more problematic?

113
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,530
 Our dating relationship ended three years ago.

114
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,300
 But...

115
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,190
 my heart...

116
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,060
 wouldn't end it.

117
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,960
 Let's get married, Yeo Reum.

118
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,330
 I have...

119
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,860
 always been in love with you.

120
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,190

121
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,420

122
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,850
The overall picture isn't too different from Season 1.

123
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,750
The storytelling will be more vicious this time.

124
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,350
Who are you pushing as the star of the show among the male participants?

125
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,480
Here.

126
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,120
He's a plastic surgeon.

127
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,420
Isn't this too predictable?

128
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,010
A male doctor is like kimchi in a Korean home-cooked-style restaurant.

129
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,240
It's disappointing without one.

130
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,630
PD Goo, what do you think? Are you happy with the participants?

131
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,910
The characters are crucial for a reality show.

132
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,340
The characters are everything.

133
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,090
Having fun and being sincere.

134
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:01,380
We chose participants who could display both qualities.

135
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,220
Okay!

136
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,540
Let's set this up, then.

137
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,810
Be sure to do a thorough background check on the participants.

138
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,930
It's a huge headache if any issues arise with everyday people participants.

139
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,030
PD Goo Yeo Reum said she'd be responsible for that.

140
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,790
Okay! Good luck!

141
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,120

At the Art Center at 7:00 p.m. tomorrow night.

142
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,830
- Senior! 
  - What?

143
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:42,050
I was calling Senior Yeo Reum.

144
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,970
From now on, be sure to attach our name to "senior."

145
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,310
What's this?

146
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,730

(T/N: Yeo Reum means summer in Korean)

147
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,660
What's this...

148
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,550
It was delivered to you, Senior Yeo Reum.

149
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,010
Delivered?

150
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,810
- It's mine? 
 - Yes.

151
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,190
It's from Mr. Kim In Woo.

152
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,650
I asked the delivery man to leave it here.

153
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,280
What's this? So childish...

154
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,410
That little...

155
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,890
Wow! "Summer, marry me"?

156
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,370
PD Goo, were you proposed to?

157
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,530
Gosh, no...

158
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,250
PD Goo, hurry up and open it.

159
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,540
This is the new line. It's super expensive.

160
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,800
Wow, your boyfriend knows what's up.

161
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,220
The balloons alone won't be any fun.

162
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,480
Senior, I think your boyfriend is very romantic.

163
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:55,270
I don't really like being in the middle of an event at the workplace.

164
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,410
Gosh, what are you saying?

165
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,580
PD Goo, your love life cells should stay alive and well

166
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,810
so our program succeeds, too. Isn't that right?

167
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,290
Congrats in advance, PD Goo.

168
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,040
- Gosh, stop it! 
 - Congratulations.

169
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,390
Anything for you, PD Kang?

170
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,560

171
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,510
Did you receive the gift I sent you? Do you like it?

172
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,600
Yeah. I got it.

173
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,550
But why throw an event all of a sudden?

174
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,690
I'm asking you to wear those pretty shoes and come to me.

175
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,930
 I'll continue to do stuff like this for you.

176
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,780
Although you may feel cringy,

177
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,750
I'll make up for everything I've missed doing all this time.

178
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,420
So, get ready.

179
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,920
Yes.

180
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,550
Dr. Jae Hoon, are you busy?

181
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,340
What's up? You didn't even call.

182
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,150
I was in the area to take care of some business.

183
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,580
Do you want to grab lunch together?

184
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,850
Sure.

185
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,840
Yum! It looks good.

186
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,770
Gosh, I said I wanted to treat you to something good.

187
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,720
Since I run a restaurant, I crave stuff like this when I'm eating out.

188
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,600
Yeo Reum likes this place, too.

189
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,500
Because their portions are generous.

190
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:13,250
I heard Kim In Woo asked Yeo Reum to get married.

191
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,340
- I heard. 
 - So, what will you do?

192
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:20,790
- What will I do about what? 
 - You like Yeo Reum.

193
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,900
Stop moping around, and just tell her how you feel.

194
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,960
First of all, judging from the appearance of things and for our image, Jeju Island is the prettiest.

195
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,090
It looks pretty on screen, too,

196
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,630
and it's good image-wise.

197
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,880
But I think it's going to be a little difficult to coordinate.

198
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,950
I'm saying I'll help you.

199
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,220
Because you two frustrate me so much.

200
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,240
Yeo Reum and I aren't like that.

201
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,360
At such a crucial juncture, will you pretend with me, too?

202
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,790
Hey, something would've happened with Goo Yeo Reum and me if we were meant to be.

203
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:53,210
The timing for you two was totally off.

204
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:56,010
When Yeo Reum was dating, you were alone.

205
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,380
When you were dating, Yeo Reum was alone.

206
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,800
And then, you were completely swamped as a resident.

207
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,080
Yeo Reum joined the broadcasting company and was swamped working as an assistant producer.

208
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,070
And then for you,

209
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,600
after that incident happened, you quit the hospital.

210
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:19,640
You didn't have a chance to face each other seriously.

211
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,950
In my opinion, I think now is the time for you two.

212
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,910
Hye Jin.

213
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,370
Yeah?

214
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:36,960
Yeo Reum... appeals to me as a woman at times.

215
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,850
- And? 
 - But as you know,

216
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:44,140
my life at the moment is way too off track.

217
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,110
With this amount of feelings for her,

218
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:54,320
approaching her just because she seems like a woman to me sometimes is wrong.

219
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,390
I don't want to be like that with Yeo Reum.

220
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:03,980
Then, will you be okay even if Yeo Reum marries someone else?

221
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,140
 Without any surprises, ordinarily,

222
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,600
 did you ever come across moments you wanted to live dating,

223
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,890
 getting married, and having a child according to the book

224
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,610
 through different phases of life?

225
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,580
 I...

226
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,600
 I...

227
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,500
 like right now.

228
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,510
 How about you?

229
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,880
 Just... live with one person for the rest of my life,

230
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,300
 promise to love each other,

231
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,930
 live together, fuss around, and argue...

232
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,390
 That's a really tough thing to do.

233
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,140
 I...

234
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,380
 want to try it.

235
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,130
 I don't want to give up.

236
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,660
 - What the heck? 
 - It's packed.

237
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,210
 She should take another one.

238
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,500
Miss, come in through the back door.

239
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,250
Thank you!

240
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:28,850
Whoa, balloons!

241
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,910
- Wow, balloons. 
 - Yes!

242
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,230
- How pretty. 
 - Yes!

243
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,910
Geez...

244
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,210
Are you in an amusement park? What's with the balloons?

245
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,210
- Is it a hot-air balloon? 
 - Don't tease me.

246
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,480
I had it rough trying to carry these home.

247
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,060
So, why are you carrying these by yourself?

248
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,230
- Where is Kim In Woo? 
 - It's not heavy, though.

249
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,180
Not the weight. The volume.

250
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,620
Yeo Reum, when you carry stuff like this,

251
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,020
you should snatch a guy by your side.

252
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,660
That way, you won't be embarrassed.

253
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,510
That Kim In Woo has no common sense. Geez, it's hot.

254
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,270
Be careful, careful!

255
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,380
- Careful. 
 - These are...

256
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,720
I didn't like these balloons from the get-go.

257
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,950
- "Summer, marry me"? 
 - I think they're pretty.

258
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,340
Next time, ask Kim In Woo to carry them himself.

259
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,320
- Why are you so pissy? 
 - I just don't like him.

260
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,270
That asshole has no sensibilities.

261
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,820
I'm off.

262
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,030
Hey!

263
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,210
The person who sent lunch boxes to my mom and dad... Was it you?

264
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,330
Yeah.

265
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,720
Why did you send them over without even telling me?

266
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,740
I was confused there for a while as to who sent them.

267
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,400
Are you disappointed that it wasn't Kim In Woo?

268
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,590
What?

269
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,800
Gosh, forget it.

270
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,300
Geez.

271
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,390
 Thanks for the lunch boxes.

272
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,530
 Mom and Dad said they really enjoyed them.

273
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,460

274
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,800

275
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,710
 Women's sensual figures.

276
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:55,750
There's an artist who captivated us with a brilliant golden hue.

277
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,960
It's Gustav Klimt.

278
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,400
A genius who spent his entire life among women.

279
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,720
Klimt is notorious for having been involved with numerous women.

280
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:09,240
So, when we discuss his life and his works of art, there's someone we cannot leave out.

281
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,550
It's his lifetime lover, Emilie Flöge.

282
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:16,840
Klimt had painted numerous nudes of female figures, but

283
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,270
they say he could not paint a nude of Emilie Flöge.

284
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:26,290
Klimt became so naive in front of Emily that he couldn't even kiss her.

285
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:29,220
It's difficult to understand, however,

286
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,030
even though Klimt loved Emily,

287
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:34,120
he did not stop having secret love affairs with other women.

288
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,870
When Emily was deeply hurt by Klimt's womanizing ways and scandals and left him,

289
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:44,620
Klimt poured his heart and soul into this one painting for the next two years.

290
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,900
The original title is "Lover."

291
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,800
It's known to us as "The Kiss."

292
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,790
It's known to be a loving and enchanting painting.

293
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,580
The man symbolizes Klimt himself

294
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,560
and the woman symbolizes Emily.

295
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,710
The painting portrays his anxiety and the precarious

296
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:04,200
state of his mind if Emily were to leave him.

297
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,110
Why did Klimt...

298
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,870
love Emily yet...

299
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,840
hurt her?

300
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,500
All the while, loving her enough to...

301
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,070
paint a fantastic painting like this.

302
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,710

303
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,400
Hi, Ji Yeon.

304
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,720
You're coming to the Art Center tonight, right?

305
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,780
Right!

306
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,090
Today's the opening, isn't it? I totally forgot.

307
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,210
Oh, you forgot about it?

308
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,810
Center Director worked hard for today's event.

309
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,790
Oh, yes. Thanks for giving me a call, Ji Yeon.

310
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,930
I'll see you later.

311
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,440
Looking forward to seeing you all dressed up.

312
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,080
All right. Thanks, Ji Yeon.

313
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,630
Okay.

314
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,250
What do you want from me?

315
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,020
I'll get to the point.

316
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,580
What are you doing hanging around Yeo Reum?

317
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,590
What did I do exactly?

318
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,210
Even if you're just friends,

319
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,710
on the second floor of a house where a woman lives alone,

320
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:48,590
a man... you know, how it is?

321
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,620
People usually don't do this without an ulterior motive.

322
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,810
There's no ulterior motive to speak of.

323
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,350
The rent in this house is very low.

324
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,350
Are you saying you have no other feelings for Yeo Reum?

325
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,900
Whether I have feelings for Goo Yeo Reum or not, I don't think it's any of your business.

326
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,040
Of course, I'd be curious. I proposed to her.

327
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,130
Aren't you still waiting for her answer?

328
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,150
It's not like you're dating her just yet.

329
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:09,650
You're not in a place to ask me about my feelings for her.

330
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,740
Yeo Reum will come to me.

331
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:18,320
We have our own history that you cannot butt in.

332
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,450
Right.

333
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:21,480
There's also your history that shouldn't be repeated.

334
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,010
You're extremely confident.

335
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:25,900
Don't be sarcastic.

336
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,880
Let's be fair and square.

337
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,240
That's why I came to see you.

338
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,000
Don't confuse Yeo Reum by hanging around her as a friend.

339
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,880
Either come at me or get lost.

340
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,600
Make yourself clear like a man.

341
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,870
 Thank you.

342
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,840
Lots of people came.

343
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,990
We promoted the exhibit a lot.

344
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,210
Lots of people are here.

345
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,460
I'm here.

346
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,850
I'm thinking of purchasing this artwork under your name.

347
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:20,910
What do you think?

348
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:24,620
You don't need to walk on eggshells around Dad at this rate.

349
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,250
Why do you keep calling me out?

350
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,260
"I met Chae Ri. I bought her a painting."

351
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,580
Is it still important to you that we pretend to be a mother and a daughter?

352
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,040
Your sister is having a family introduction dinner for her wedding next month.

353
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,570
I'll give you a call, so make time.

354
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,680
I'll be filming a show.

355
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,290
I can't go, so come up with an excuse.

356
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,650
I watched the program you worked on.

357
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:49,370
Even though that's what pop culture is,

358
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:51,650
it was pretty vulgar.

359
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,660
I'm ashamed to face the in-laws.

360
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,420
Why don't you tone it down a bit?

361
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:02,950
When I was 20, you said this to me.

362
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,280
That I couldn't go to medical school or law school.

363
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:10,160
That I couldn't have a career in the field where Dad would have high hopes for me.

364
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,160
That's what you said.

365
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,400
That's the only thing I wanted from you.

366
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,520
So why are you doing this to me again?

367
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,860
I'm making a vulgar TV show and living as you had hoped.

368
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,920
In this world,

369
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,710
there's no such thing as toning down vulgarity.

370
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,820
 And I think I'm going to get poop poisoning.

371
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,650
 How many weeks does this usually take to heal?

372
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,640
Are you okay?

373
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,120
Why are you standing here when I'm puking?

374
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,780
Well, I wasn't covering you up to get a thank you from you.

375
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,080
But I didn't think I would get yelled at.

376
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,280
Mr. Park Jae... Hoon.

377
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,580
Well, we meet again.

378
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:39,340
You got a nose fracture and you puke in the streets.

379
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,350
You live quite a dynamic life.

380
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,940
Are you usually so interested in other people's business?

381
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,610
No. Not at all.

382
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:46,280
I won't in the future, either.

383
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,710
It's because you stood out so much.

384
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,120
Oppa!

385
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,620
Jae Hoon, come here!

386
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,020
- You came. 
 - Hi.

387
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,400
Goodness, Mom. Good work. Congratulations.

388
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,020
Take a look around the exhibit first.

389
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,830
Ji Yeon, would you guide him through?

390
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:17,370
Should I?

391
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:27,300
That painting is the scene from the ball in the novel.

392
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:32,100
They prepared it well. Of course.

393
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,190
It's my favorite piece.

394
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,680
It looks simple and ordinary.

395
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,880
In order to complete this piece,

396
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,800
Dad poured several years into it.

397
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,720
He painted over the paint whenever the seasons changed.

398
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,010
It's just a white base color.

399
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:55,310
Don't you think that makes it more meaningful?

400
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,910
It looks like there's nothing there, but

401
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:01,920
the layer of time is piled onto the surface.

402
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,140
Do you want to have a glass of champaign with me?

403
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,800
Sounds good.

404
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:36,550
Why do you always answer my text with short replies?

405
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:40,300
Are you still not interested in me after seeing me a few times?

406
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,170
I didn't think you were like this when I first met you, but

407
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:46,700
you're very aggressive in pursuing me.

408
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:50,140
That's a polite way of saying that I'm coming onto you, right?

409
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,360
Just now, too.

410
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,240
Women usually aren't so direct with their words like you.

411
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,480
I don't... come onto just anyone.

412
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,120
I get very nervous when I throw myself at someone with thick skin.

413
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:13,670
Ji Yeon, my late father

414
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:17,190
loved your father's artwork.

415
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,080
He said he was peaceful while looking at his artwork.

416
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,480
I don't want to be rude to you, Ji Yeon.

417
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,830
The more I meet you, more I find you very charming

418
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:29,650
and I think you're a fantastic person.

419
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,900
But I don't think I can.

420
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:38,550
Let's put an end to the ambiguous relationship today.

421
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,230
Why?

422
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,140
We can't even have "some"?

423
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,830
I started wanting to check out something.

424
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,240
I'm sorry.

425
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,710
Yeo Reum, where are you?

426
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,740
I'm at work.

427
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,880
Give me a call when you get off work.

428
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,740
I have something to say to you.

429
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,660
All right.

430
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,060
- Hi, Oppa. 
 - Yeo Reum, you're still at work, right?

431
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,260
Yeah.

432
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,030
It's raining outside. Do you have an umbrella?

433
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,970
It's raining outside?

434
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,170
Oh, it sure is raining.

435
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:02,410
Should I come and get you?

436
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:05,920
Let's have dinner together at my place tonight.

437
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,740
Have dinner at your place together?

438
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,460
PD Goo, aren't you going home?

439
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:37,100
Sang Woo, don't you think Kang Chae Ri is a real pervert?

440
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,210
Seems like she runs experiments with all the participants.

441
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:43,260
Her list of participants is pretty straightforward.

442
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,610

Their looks and resume qualifications.

443
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:47,430
Golden spoon, dirty spoon...

444
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:52,110

With all the conditions listed, they're all mixed in together like a buffet.

445
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:55,030
I think she indeed is a pervert.

446
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:58,060
Gosh, while staring at it like this,

447
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:03,290
it makes me wonder where I'd fit in among these people.

448
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,160
I was thinking the same thing.

449
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,370
I intuitively started ranking them based on society norms.

450
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:11,520
Season 2 is going to be a hit. Don't you think?

451
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,630
Yes. I think it's going to be crazy.

452
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:18,440
Gosh. How come I can't be a pervert like Kang Chae Ri?

453
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,300
In my opinion, letting go of one's dignity and refinement

454
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,600
seems to be the virtue of a variety show PD.

455
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,900
Did you... decide to line up with Chae Ri?

456
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,120
I'm still thinking.

457
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,870
For you to get high viewer ratings,

458
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:36,600
you're way too sophisticated.

459
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,400
Traitor.

460
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:44,760
Calculating, figuring out, and testing them out.

461
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,400
Not stuff like that.

462
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,760
I want to fall madly in love.

463
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,950
Fall madly in love?

464
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,130
Yeah.

465
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,940
It's not impossible.

466
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:58,180
Just love that's possible when you're young.

467
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,600
Not like Kingdom of Love.

468
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,150
Something like the Kingdom of Innocence?

469
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:06,190
Senior, I think that'd be no fun at all.

470
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:09,620
That's why I'm not making it in this field. Right?

471
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,770
Yes.

472
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,420
You...

473
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:48,480
I told you to call me.

474
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,350
Did you... wait for me?

475
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,950
Yeah!

476
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,710
Yeo Reum.

477
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:07,190
Yeo Reum, have dinner with me tonight.

478
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,980
Please step aside tonight.

479
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,260
I even brought you a teddy bear.

480
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,490
Jae Hoon, I'll call you when I get home.

481
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,780
Okay.

482
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,630
Oppa.

483
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,520
I'm sorry, but

484
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,530
can we eat out tonight? Not at your place?

485
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,020
Why?

486
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,000
Do you feel pressured?

487
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,690
If I go over to your place tonight,

488
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:51,230
I feel like that's going to be my answer.

489
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:53,710
I haven't...

490
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:57,100
settled things in my heart yet.

491
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,900
Okay. I'm sorry.

492
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,480
I guess I didn't pace myself.

493
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,880
Bye. I'll call you.

494
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,960
Yeo Reum,

495
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,340
I actually... met Park Jae Hoon separately.

496
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,890
- What? 
 - It bothered me so much that

497
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:16,680
a man lives on the second floor of the house you live alone.

498
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:21,200
But still, why would you meet Jae Hoon separately?

499
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,810
I know it was a loser move.

500
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:26,170
But I won't apologize.

501
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:31,240
Even if I thought it over, I'm sure I would've told him to get away from you.

502
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,050
I hope you make yourself clear as well.

503
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:42,690
I don't believe in friends between a man and a woman.

504
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:53,980
What did you want to say to me?

505
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,240
It's nothing.

506
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,810
It's okay. Just go, Yeo Reum.

507
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:01,540
Did you want to talk about Min Woo?

508
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,980
That he came to you and said something weird?

509
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:06,650
He told me that. He said it bothered him a lot.

510
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:09,400
Are you siding with that jerk in front of me?

511
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,130
No, it's not like that...

512
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,030
But how about you? Why would you come over to my workplace over stuff like that?

513
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,790
Don't you even have any self-respect?

514
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:24,200
- What? 
 - Are you happy that Kim In Woo asked you to marry him?

515
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,230
Then... do you think I wouldn't feel anything?

516
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,270
Of course, I'd be torn.

517
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,670
Why are you picking a fight?

518
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:33,690
It annoys me to watch you like this.

519
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:36,080
Because you're being too easy.

520
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:38,180
I'm...

521
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,850
- too easy? 
 - Where was that place?

522
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,790
Eungok rest area?

523
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,640
Don't you remember he left you there?

524
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,620
What's so amazing about a guy who left his woman in the middle of the road?

525
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,000
What's so loving about him that you're seeing him again?

526
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,550
Why? Can't I think him amazing and be loving?

527
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:00,910
That was the happiest time of my life.

528
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,630
Besides...

529
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,640
Why can't I have it easy?

530
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,610
I want to love someone with ease.

531
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,180
It's too tough and complex to make a living.

532
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:14,210
But as for love... I want it to be easy.

533
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:50,160
Daughter, your mom and dad are here.

534
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,670
Are you sleeping in because it's the weekend?

535
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:54,580
Do you know what time it is?

536
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,870
Mom!

537
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,200
Wait...

538
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,980
What brings you here without calling in advance?

539
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:02,770
We have a wedding to attend this afternoon.

540
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:04,940
Look at this mess in the house...

541
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,680
Honey, open the window. Let's ventilate and vacuum.

542
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,180
- Okay. 
 - Dad, Dad, Dad!

543
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,780
Leave it alone. I'll do it.

544
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:13,830
We should come up every once in a while and check up on you.

545
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:16,090
Gosh, seriously.

546
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:18,330
What's this?

547
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,210
What's this?

548
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:29,640
Who did you get it from?

549
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,180
My daughter, did you get a proposal?

550
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,630
It's that guy from last time, huh?

551
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,570
Kim In Woo.

552
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:38,070
Did he ask you to marry him?

553
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:40,130
- Yeah. 
 - So what will you do?

554
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,520
Should I...

555
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:48,210
- marry him? 
 - Of course, you should!

556
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:51,510
Oh, my goodness, Honey!

557
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,000
Good thinking, my daughter!

558
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,390
Why are you so happy?

559
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:56,820
I haven't made up my mind yet.

560
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,060
- Ouch! 
 - Stop spewing nonsense. Just get married.

561
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:03,100
Gosh, you have no idea what kind of guy he is. Why do you want to marry off your daughter?

562
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:07,830
I saw him last time, and he looked perfectly fine. That's it, then.

563
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:11,410
Daughter, it's because your mom was traumatized over what I went through.

564
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:15,280
Even after I got home from the hospital, your mom was so upset.

565
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,900
Once your mom and I are gone, you'll be alone in this world.

566
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,000
After getting sick this time,

567
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,710
the first thing that scared me was the fact that you and your mom will be left alone.

568
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:32,790
When a child meets a good spouse and forms a familiy,

569
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:34,690
the parents can finally rest assured.

570
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:36,570
We couldn't say anything because we were cautious around you.

571
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:39,290
Do you know how frustrated and in anguish your dad and I were?

572
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:42,510
Think of your age.

573
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:46,910
But how come the diamond is so big?

574
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:48,470
Put it on! I want to see it on you.

575
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:50,500
Gosh, it's okay.

576
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,260
Oh, my goodness...

577
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:56,760
It's so beautiful!

578
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,360
Isn't it a little too loose?

579
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,730
You can adjust the size.

580
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:04,820
Mom...

581
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,960
Mom, are you crying?

582
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,810
I mean...

583
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:12,630
Why are you crying?

584
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:15,870
It's because I'm so happy!

585
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:17,110
My gosh...

586
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:19,670
- Are you that happy? 
 - Of course!

587
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:22,250
- Why are you crying? 
 - Seriously...

588
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,270
Honey...

589
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:27,630
Don't cry, Mom.

590
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:51,850
 The days without any butterflies in my stomach.

591
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:57,480
 My daily life where my work became creating dreams.

592
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,300
 My age 37 where even dating and work

593
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:11,410
 have grown sick and tired, the marriage

594
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:15,170
 meant that my life can still change

595
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:18,620
 and I still have the right to decide.

596
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:22,400
 It got my heart to flutter.

597
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:52,510
Let's get married.

598
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:09,140
Let's have a toast.

599
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:11,340
Nice to meet you.

600
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:22,170
 The feeling that enveloped me throughout the wedding preparation.

601
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:26,320
 I finally felt like I became an adult.

602
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:30,330
 That feeling wasn't so bad.

603
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:31,810
What do you think?

604
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:33,620
It's so pretty.

605
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,830
We're thinking of wintertime for our wedding.

606
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:41,110
I'm sorry, but we're all booked for the end of the year.

607
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:45,290
By chance, if you can do it in a month, we have a cancellation.

608
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:47,470
In a month?

609
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:51,670
That's too soon, though.

610
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:53,000
If you take that day,

611
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,900
we can give you a huge discount for meals and flowers.

612
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,080
Maybe we shouldn't be vague and postpone.

613
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,210
Do you want to get married in a month?

614
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:07,110
I start filming my program then, though.

615
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:10,440
We can have the wedding ceremony first and we can take a long honeymoon.

616
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,410
You can have a long vacation after your program is over.

617
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:15,950
I'll ask for my entire vacation time off, too.

618
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:20,570
How much of a discount can you give us?

619
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:23,410
 Everything was decided in a flash.

620
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:25,520
 Whenever we needed to think things over,

621
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:31,040
 my age 37 came up just like a pop-up ad window.

622
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:35,430
 My age where I'm allowed to decide things quickly.

623
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:38,090
 My age, which is old enough.

624
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:41,570
 Now is time for me to decide.

625
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:43,240
You do it, Oppa.

626
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,480
Yeah, Oppa.

627
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,430
Yeah. Oh, this, please.

628
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:51,380
Yeah. I don't have much stuff.

629
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,010
Yeah.

630
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:54,160
I see.

631
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,650
Please be careful with the glass.

632
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:57,770
Yeah.

633
00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:00,900
I sold a few pieces of furniture and threw away a few.

634
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,870
It must've been tough for you to do alone.

635
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:04,920
Geez, I said we should do it together on the weekend.

636
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,430
 It's okay. I'm almost done.

637
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:10,250
I'll call you later.

638
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:14,270
In Woo, someone's waiting for you in the lobby.

639
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:15,560
Who?

640
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:18,670
Someone you knew from New York?

641
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,870
Okay.

642
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:05,880
Oh, no...

643
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,300
No...

644
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,750
Leaving now?

645
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:15,680
Yeah.

646
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:20,110
I'll go now.

647
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:24,320
All right. Bye now.

648
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:31,060
Jae Hoon!

649
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:38,180
Thanks for everything.

650
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:42,950
Me, too.

651
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:44,870
Thanks for everything.

652
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:10,640

653
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,450
Ta-da!

654
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:15,130
You're going!

655
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:18,330
Finally going!

656
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:21,640
You're finally going!

657
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:29,830
I think it's suspicious.

658
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:32,520
You're rushing into this way too fast.

659
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,130
Yeo Reum, be honest.

660
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:35,280
You have your dowry in your tummy, huh?

661
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,400
It's not like that. Geez...

662
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,170
If you truly are not with a baby,

663
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:43,400
if so...

664
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:49,270
- Gosh. 
 - Okay.

665
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:50,790
Bottoms up!

666
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:53,130
Gosh, seriously.

667
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:01,380
- Happy now? 
 - I guess she's not.

668
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:04,100
You are doing this pretty fast, I must say.

669
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:07,610
Are you sure you're okay rushing in like this?

670
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:09,870
I feel like crying all of a sudden.

671
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:13,680
I'm not ready to let you go.

672
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,140
I didn't intend to get married so quickly, either.

673
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:20,100
Things just fell into place so fast.

674
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,890
Both of our parents want us to rush as well.

675
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:24,060
That's right.

676
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,740
Getting married is like that.

677
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:28,000
Once you decide to go through with it, the rest of the prep happens quickly.

678
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,690
Honey, Hyeon So, Honey, Hyeon So, hey!

679
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:31,950
What, what, what?

680
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:35,380
I heard Kim In Woo say you should just move in since he's got everything prepared.

681
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:38,190
To prevent from things falling apart,

682
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:40,680
shouldn't they sign the marriage license first?

683
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,330
Yeo Reum isn't lacking anything.

684
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:47,240
Sis, don't put yourself down.

685
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:50,880
Don't even sign the marriage license until you get pregnant.

686
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,770
Who should I listen to?

687
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:56,630
But where is Jae Hoon? How come he's nowhere to be seen?

688
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:58,860
Don't know. I couldn't reach him on the phone at all lately.

689
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:01,370
- I can't reach my brother, either. 
 - Me, neither.

690
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:04,830
I've been too busy with the wedding prep, so I couldn't see him.

691
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:28,400
- Are you here alone? 
 - Yes.

692
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,290
Will you buy me a drink?

693
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:36,750
I don't really want to buy you a drink.

694
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:38,640
What the...?

695
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,670
How annoying.

696
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,930
I am annoying.

697
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:00,040
How do you feel?

698
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,590
You're about to become a married woman soon.

699
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,880
It doesn't seem real yet.

700
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,680
You'd gone through all this ten years ago when you were much younger.

701
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,320
I have... so much respect for you.

702
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:19,630
Wedding preparation is just the beginning.

703
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:24,350
Going forward, you'll have many more chances...

704
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:27,680
many more chances for you to respect me.

705
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,260
What in the world?

706
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:36,780
I want to ask you something.

707
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:40,720
Did anything happen with Jae Hoon?

708
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,490
Happen?

709
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:47,650
I guess I overreacted all by myself.

710
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:50,530
I just wanted you and Jae Hoon

711
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:53,900
to get together.

712
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,280
So I gave Jae Hoon some ideas.

713
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,380
Telling him to confess his feelings for you.

714
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,430
And? What did he say?

715
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04,950
Who cares about his reaction?

716
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:08,160
In the end, nothing happened

717
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,820
and you're marrying Kim In Woo this weekend.

718
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,920
What in the world?

719
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,220
What's with your facial expression?

720
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:22,120
Were you interested in Park Jae Hoon?

721
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,110
Well, not exactly interested...

722
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:26,630
For a moment there...

723
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:28,670
I was a little bit confused.

724
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:30,510
Oh, my gosh!

725
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:35,280
You're not going to regret this, are you?

726
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:38,910
You're happy about marrying Kim In Woo, right?

727
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:42,580
Hye Jin, this thing called happiness...

728
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:45,610
isn't somewhere special.

729
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:49,480
When I used to date without considering marriage,

730
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:54,550
there was a certain tension or anxiety.

731
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:57,220
Wanting to look good to the other person

732
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:59,850
and wanting to be a pretty good catch.

733
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:02,590
Wanting to be loved and wanting to give love.

734
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:05,040
That tension is the beauty of a dating relationship.

735
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,860
But... right now...

736
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:10,770
my heart is at absolute peace.

737
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:13,260
I don't have to try harder

738
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:16,000
and I don't have to be nervous.

739
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,700
I just...

740
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:21,840
have the love that is mine, no matter what.

741
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:27,450
That feeling of security is the beauty of marriage.

742
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:31,210
I'm really going to live happily ever after.

743
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:35,840
I'm getting married!

744
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:39,010
Goo Yeo Reum!

745
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:42,560
- I'm getting married! 
 - You have to be happy!

746
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:45,130
I'll be happier than anyone in the world.

747
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:48,030
Of course.

748
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,910
 What are you doing here?

749
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:54,700
 I came because I missed you.

750
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,530
 What did you want to say to me?

751
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,850
 Don't marry Kim In Woo.

752
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:04,920
 Date me.

753
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:10,570
 I can't promise you the next step, but

754
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:14,020
 I want to try dating you.

755
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,520
Gosh, congratulations! Really!

756
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:53,200
 Congratulations!

757
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,830
I'm old. I'm too old.

758
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:58,770
Gosh, we're all getting old...

759
00:56:58,770 --> 00:57:00,510
We're all what?

760
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:03,570
Why are you so nervous?

761
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:07,080
- You can't speak in front of her? 
 - Be quiet.

762
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,930
Is that why you can't speak in front of me?

763
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,640
- Hey. 
  - Where are you?

764
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,750
I'm home.

765
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:08,460
 Aren't you going to Yeo Reum's wedding?

766
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:10,380
I should go.

767
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:54,440
Dear guests,

768
00:58:55,350 --> 00:58:57,410
I apologize.

769
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:05,130
The wedding ceremony today will be canceled.

770
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:10,970
I'm calling off the wedding.

771
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:14,070
C-Calling off... Calling off the wedding?

772
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:57,020

773
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:30,460

774
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,280
 Yeo Reum, we have our wedding in ten minutes.

775
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:35,110
 You shouldn't have let me hear this ten minutes before our wedding!

776
01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:38,060
 Forget going to work. I just want to run away.

777
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:39,750
 Even after embarrassing myself like this,

778
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:42,760
 would I be able to go on as if nothing ever happened?

779
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:45,530
 You didn't do anything wrong, so you don't need to be embarrassed.

780
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:46,790
 Hey, Goo Yeo Reum!

781
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:49,080
 Didn't you do a proper background check of all the participants?

782
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:52,790
 Find a substitute. Don't bring in just some loser. Bring your friend Park Jae Hoon.

783
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:54,190
 Come with me somewhere.

784
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:55,690
 Why are you asking me to do that?

785
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:57,750
 I need you.
