1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:08,940

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,690

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,710
♫  Dive with you, towards the wide sea  ♫

4
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,010

5
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:24,140
♫  Jump in love, I fly with wings called you  ♫

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,120

♫  There is nothing to be afraid of  ♫

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,150
♫  In the world called you, it sparkles and lingers here  ♫

8
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:36,750
♫  What I found while wandering was you who 
 was always by my side  ♫

9
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,250
♫  I'm already ready for you  ♫

10
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,050

11
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,760

12
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,960

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,510

14
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:56,950
 I like top predators.

15
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,450
 Out of all the men here, aren't you the top predator?

16
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,120

17
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,900
 I like pretty women.

18
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,480
 I look at a woman's affluence rather than her looks.

19
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,830
 Everyone's an adult. Isn't mature content of this extent okay?

20
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,260

21
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,680
 What's wrong with being fat?

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,640
 It's an honor for me.

23
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,000

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,770
 To be honest, I've never been in a relationship before.

25
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,430
 I don't believe in destiny.

26
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,650
 I'm the one who creates my destiny.

27
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,030

28
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:38,050
 I haven't thought about making a commitment for a very long time.

29
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,770

30
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,300
 Why are you being nice to me?

31
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,020

32
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,750
 Chemistry. Chemistry is what's important.

33
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,920
 A woman I can tiki-taka well with.

34
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,480

35
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,630

36
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,130

37
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,910

38
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,320
 This is getting fun.

39
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,710

40
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,680
Let's finish editing here.

41
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,400
Okay.

42
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,330
She's crazy scary.

43
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,570
I'll just... send this...

44
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,520
All done.

45
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,120
 Senior, this is the first teaser.

46
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,320

47
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,380

48
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,540
 Good job.

49
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,570
 You did well.

50
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,780
Shall we start?

51
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,010
We'll start filming now!

52
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,150
The ladies can sit in the chairs.

53
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,860
As for the men, please wait next to the arena.

54
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,940
The last man standing is the ultimate winner.

55
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,140
We'll start the game for the date ticket.

56
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,810

57
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,530

I'll announce the results of the first impressions selection.

58
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,460

Park Jae Hoon, John Jang, Lee Hoon Hee, Hwang Jang Goon.

59
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,430
These four people chose Jang Tae Mi.

60
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,010
Kim Joon Ho chose Park Ji Wan.

61
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:01,390
Jang Tae Mi and Park Ji Wan chose John Jang.

62
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,880
Han Ji Yeon and Ahn So Yeon chose Park Jae Hoon.

63
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,370
And Geum Soo Mi chose Lee Hoon Hee.

64
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,430
Jang Tae Mi and John Jang matched.

65
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,090
Are we going to ship those two as this season's main couple?

66
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,190
That combination isn't really fun.

67
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,540
It's too obvious.

68
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,770
- What do you think? 
 - They'll look good.

69
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,440
I think they'll continue to gather attention.

70
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,250
That's obvious.

71
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,690
It's too predictable.

72
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,780
How about Kim Joon Ho and Park Ji Wan?

73
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,550
I think they'll stir some talk.

74
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,120
Let's wait and see for now.

75
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,110
Okay.

76
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,500
It's the real start from here on out, so let's do a good job.

77
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,050
There are writers for each cast member,

78
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,400
so the production team needs to pay special attention.

79
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,470
PD Goo Yeo Reum will be assigned Park Jae Hoon, John Jang, and Park Ji Wan.

80
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,960
I'll take Jang Tae Mi, Han Ji Yeon, and Kim Joon Ho.

81
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,420
Sang Woo is assigned Jang Goon and Geum Soo Mi.

82
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,690
Hee Chang, you'll follow Lee Hoon Hee and Ahn So Yeon.

83
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,420
Okay.

84
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,000
The people who weren't chosen,

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Kim Joon Ho, Jang Goon, Han Ji Yeon, Ahn So Yeon, and Geum Soo Mi's

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,790
writers, do your best to convince them to come out to the pool party in their underwear.

87
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,710
 Yes, all right.

88
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,260
You know how important it is to build rapport with them, right?

89
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,390
Make them reveal their personal stories.

90
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,710
And when they want to cry, make them bawl.

91
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,570
When they're mad, make them furious.

92
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:22,090
Let's help so they can really get into the program.

93
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,870
Oh, and please tell the VJs who mark the cast one-on-one.

94
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:31,660
The person who captures the most entertaining footage will be given a bonus.

95
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,890
Well, then dismissed!

96
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,400
 Eat with me some time.

97
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,800

98
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,780
Whoa, Park Jae Hoon!

99
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,970
There were two women who were blinded by you.

100
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,410
I thought you wouldn't get any votes.

101
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:09,460
Man, I was worried I'd get all the votes.

102
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,930
How do you know Han Ji Yeon?

103
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,510
Was it obvious that we knew each other?

104
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,570
You can't hide anything from the camera.

105
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,720
I went on a blind date with her because of my mom.

106
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,270
You don't plan to hit it off with her?

107
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:25,540
Are you asking as a friend, or as the program director?

108
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,490
Well... both?

109
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,530
Well...

110
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,570
If I planned to hit it off with her, we'd already be dating.

111
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,320
What time will today's shoot end?

112
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,780
It's the first day, so around 10:00 p.m. or 11:00 p.m.

113
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,340
Then, meet me after.

114
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,690
I have something to tell you.

115
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,480
Sure.

116
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,540
Yes?

117
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,050
Can I come in for a moment?

118
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,460
We met during the preliminary interview.

119
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,430
I'm PD Kang Chae Ri, in charge of the entire production team.

120
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,080
Yes, I'm aware.

121
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,960
Hold on.

122
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,520
There we go.

123
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,770
You weren't chosen for first impression selection.

124
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,680
What do you plan to do?

125
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,140
Are you going to stay in the room or will you come out wearing that?

126
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,010
Well...

127
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,640
Standing in front of the camera just in my underwear...

128
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,490
I don't think I can do it.

129
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,450
I can stay in my room, right?

130
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,560
Of course.

131
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,480
Since the decision is up to you.

132
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:02,090
However, not being chosen by anyone...

133
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,860
and staying cooped up in your room...

134
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,930
Are you okay with that being broadcast?

135
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,100
Isn't that more petty and lame?

136
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,080
You speak quite viciously.

137
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,490
I like you, Han Ji Yeon.

138
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,770
I want to make you this season's main character.

139
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,460
The show has already begun.

140
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,580
And whether you like it or not, you'll be humiliated.

141
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:39,190
Whether you want to be Cinderella or an unloved carcass...

142
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,060
the decision is yours.

143
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:49,640
What must I do to become Cinderella?

144
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,920
You know the fairy tale.

145
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:57,740
Take off the dress and you need to trip.

146
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,640
The next member will come out.

147
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,050
 - Oh, no! 
 - Oh, my...

148
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,160
Lighting Team, go near the pool and shed light on Han Ji Yeon.

149
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,660
Other cameras except for the main one should take shots of Han Ji Yeon from various angles.

150
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,750
Senior...

151
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,560
Just a moment.

152
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,300
Wait.

153
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,770
She catches on quickly.

154
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,660
Me?

155
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,110
Yeah.

156
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,950
I do catch on quickly.

157
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,310
Camera, don't get too close.

158
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,180
Please give some room for the two to move about.

159
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,180
Sang Woo, get them some towels.

160
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,590
Okay.

161
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,850
Thank you.

162
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,830
Who the hell is that asshole?

163
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:47,040
I'm totally confused as to who he really is.

164
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,460
- Aren't you cold? 
 - I'm cold.

165
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,620
You should've looked down.

166
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,960
He was so cool!

167
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,330
Those two people. Aren't they just awesome?

168
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,660
I sent him his outfit.

169
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,830
He put it on another woman. How annoying.

170
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,460
That was a pretty strong comment.

171
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,040
With so many cameras here, too.

172
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,490
There's no need to act coy.

173
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,030
Looks like those two will definitely be a couple.

174
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,840
You never know. He could just be minding his manners.

175
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,000
When Han Ji Yeon fell into the water, she kept staring at Park Jae Hoon.

176
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,970
They totally made eye contact.

177
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,580
If it were me, I would've jumped in to help as well.

178
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,900
You seem displeased.

179
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,570
- Nothing like that going on here. 
 - Gosh!

180
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,380
The star of the night with all the votes got her camera taken away by someone else.

181
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,920
I'd be really upset if I were you.

182
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,540
Should we try to get some attention?

183
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,350
How?

184
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,210
Let's give a toast.

185
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,550
What did I just witness?

186
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,720
You two are truly awesome.

187
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,410
I thought I was watching the movie "Titanic."

188
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:13,650
I'm so looking forward to the time I'll be spending with you all.

189
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:16,140
It's my great honor to meet all of you.

190
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:21,000
Especially Ms. Jang Tae Mi,

191
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,840
who is as pretty as a princess.

192
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,660
That dress you're wearing, I was the one that sent it to you.

193
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,600
I just want you to know.

194
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,670
You totally get what I like.

195
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,750
Cheers.

196
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,760
 Cheers!

197
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:47,730
Is Han Ji Yeon the star of the show and is Geum Soo Mi set on being the wall flower?

198
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,210
It's up to the individual.

199
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,400
It's only the first day.

200
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,630
It's only the first day.

201
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,010
It's nice here.

202
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,830
Isn't it?

203
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,300
Were you okay today?

204
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,900
Wasn't it tough on you?

205
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,410
That's what I want to say to you.

206
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,990
How was it today?

207
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:35,340
Well? It was fun.

208
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,220
Thanks. And I'm sorry, too.

209
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,580
It kept bothering me that I dragged you into this.

210
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,450
You have to take your top off, too.

211
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,560
Do some push-ups.

212
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,440
- Yeo Reum. 
 - Yeah?

213
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,850
The reason I came here is because of you.

214
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,630
I know.

215
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,030
That's why I'm grateful to you.

216
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,490
But... I was thinking...

217
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:15,120
Since you're on the hottest dating program on TV in Korea,

218
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,120
I hope you get something out of it.

219
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,930
It's been a while since you were in a relationship.

220
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,200
Ever since that incident and after you quit the hospital,

221
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,110
you haven't been able to settle your heart and kept wandering.

222
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,270
You're aware that our program is on global OTT, right?

223
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:39,370
In this day and age, being famous isn't such a bad thing.

224
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,980
Try reorganizing your life.

225
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,840
Use this opportunity to your advantage.

226
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,430
I said I came here because of you.

227
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,880
So I can keep an eye on you.

228
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,830
Why are you treating me like a little child near the water?

229
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:58,300
Why? What? Do you think I might have some terrible thoughts?

230
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:04,030
Since I'm so crazy busy with work, I can't think about anything else.

231
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,410
It actually turned out to be a good thing.

232
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,260
People do talk behind my back, but

233
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,420
I'm okay with that...

234
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,660
Don't worry.

235
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,740
I'm regretting it.

236
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:29,500
The fact that I didn't hold you back when you said you were marrying Kim In Woo.

237
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,570
Well...

238
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:40,380
it's not like I have to become a couple on a dating program like this, right?

239
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,030
So I'll just go with the flow.

240
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,880
I'm a bit confused right now.

241
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,250
Makes me want to misunderstand what you said.

242
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,440
It's not a misunderstanding.

243
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,350
Don't be confused.

244
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:09,140
For the time being, I don't intend to approach you.

245
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,360
You'll need some time, too.

246
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,760
But I just wanted you to know.

247
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,330
What's gotten into you?

248
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,870
It feels like my head is going to explode as is.

249
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:24,130
Whatever you want, I'll do everything you need me to do.

250
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,890
I'm telling you to use me.

251
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:30,490
Hey! How can I use you when you say stuff like that?

252
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,250
Even if I wanted to, I wouldn't be able to.

253
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,710
I'll be your friend if you need a friend.

254
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,370
I'll be a man to you if you need a man.

255
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,540
You just say so.

256
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:58,400
I'm extremely curious as to who you really are.

257
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,560
Didn't you say you were pursuing PD Goo Yeo Reum?

258
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,610
But PD Goo almost got married yesterday.

259
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:10,300
Then, were you just barking up the wrong tree?

260
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,680
So, how did you end up here, then?

261
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,300
Hey, John. What's your Korean name?

262
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,010
It's John Jang.

263
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,690
I know your last name is Jang.

264
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,000
What's your Korean name?

265
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,010
Korean name.

266
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:28,070
No comment.

267
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,490
Fine.

268
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,790
I'll just call you John.

269
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,110
- Ow, ow! 
 - Hey, John.

270
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,810
Why do you keep talking down to me?

271
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:40,530
It's because I'm an old geezer down to my bones. Try to be understanding.

272
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,420
You've heard of this before, right?

273
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,420
"Keep your friends close and your enemies closer."

274
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,600
Yes, yes, yes. I've heard of it.

275
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,450
Then, what should I do with you? Think about it.

276
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,470
- Thinking! 
 - Speaking English, huh?

277
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,150
Since we're enemies, probably closer?

278
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,950
That's right! That's right.

279
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,220
- Yes. 
 - Ah, yes. Closer.

280
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,300
- Closer. 
 - Closer...

281
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,210
- Closer. 
 - Closer. Closer...

282
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,970
You can do it...

283
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,400
- Oh, really? 
  - Hello.

284
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,680
Is it ready?

285
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:55,130
I made enough. Enjoy.

286
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,390
 Thank you!

287
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,290
It's so good!

288
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,220
We must've been so hungry...

289
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,860
See you in the evening. Drive safely.

290
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,870
- Thank you for breakfast. 
 - Don't mention it.

291
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,010
- Can I sit over here? 
 - Sure.

292
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,080
- Have some. 
 - Goodness.

293
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,320
Ji Wan, does the food taste okay? Is it okay?

294
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,720
It's so nice to have such a nice breakfast, thanks to you.

295
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,080
Gosh, thank you.

296
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,570
Hello?

297
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,390
Yeah.

298
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:59,190
I'm doing fine.

299
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,650
Yeah.

300
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,100
A woman I like?

301
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,670
Gosh, hey.

302
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,300
Did I come here to find a relationship?

303
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,040
I came here for my business.

304
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,740
As for the first impression...

305
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:13,470
I chose the easiest woman who might be the least popular here.

306
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,550
Yeah.

307
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:18,440
I made a love-line connection and I feel like we might gain some attention.

308
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,430
It's not bad.

309
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,280
Hey.

310
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,100
I can meet a pretty girl once I get out of here.

311
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,410
That's right.

312
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,460
Park Ji Wan! Park Ji Wan!

313
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,530
- Aren't you going to work? 
 - Yes.

314
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:45,160
Oh, you must work from home.

315
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,960
Yes.

316
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,320
You're a Yes-Yes Fairy.

317
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,090
What?

318
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,700
Aren't your answers too cut and dry?

319
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,110
Oh, that's because... I'm still a little unfamiliar with everything...

320
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:01,450
I'm fine when I'm with everyone else.

321
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:05,580
But now that only two of us are talking... I feel nervous.

322
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,590
- I'm sorry. 
 - Gosh, no worries.

323
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,540
Don't be sorry.

324
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,020
- So, Park Ji Wan. 
 - Yes?

325
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,410
During last night's first impression selection,

326
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:18,040
the one who chose you...

327
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,720
It's me.

328
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,220
- What? 
 - I just wanted you to know.

329
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,290
It's me. Me.

330
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,130
I'll get going, then.

331
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,900
- Hee Chang! 
 - Yes?

332
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,000
Did you check the total number of sponsored products?

333
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,540
Yes, I made sure we had enough for everyone.

334
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:43,080
So that different products could be shown naturally,

335
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,430
let's spread them throughout the participants' rooms,

336
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,220
dining room, and makeup rooms.

337
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,800
- Okay. 
 - And put an air purifier in the monitoring room.

338
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,080
- I heard it works really well. 
 - Got it.

339
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,310
Good day.

340
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:57,920
- Where should I put these? 
 - To the right side over there.

341
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,570
These, too. Please put them over there.

342
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,420
Mom.

343
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,000
You're here?

344
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,440
Okay, I'll be right down.

345
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,560
Mom! Dad!

346
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,580
Yeo Reum!

347
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,540
Mom!

348
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,750
My daughter, did you have breakfast?

349
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,970
Yes, I did.

350
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,550
We have food trucks, so I eat three meals a day.

351
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,690
So, don't worry, Dad.

352
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,890
Can't you even use some vacation time?

353
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:05,380
What kind of company uses and abuses a person like this?

354
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,340
Gosh, it's better that I work.

355
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,810
I'd just be tormented if I had to stay home.

356
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,630
I brought everything that came in for you.

357
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:21,560
I'm sorry. For making you bring me stuff like this.

358
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,020
Your dad's heart was trembling because of this.

359
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,530
He had to pee, but we couldn't even stop over at a rest stop.

360
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,260
Dad, do you want to use the bathroom?

361
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,820
- Do you want to go up with me? 
 - Oh, no. I felt like my bladder was going to explode.

362
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,700
So, I took care of business at a gas station nearby.

363
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,560
While your dad went to the restroom, I sat in the car alone with all the doors locked

364
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,370
and sat there hugging this bag.

365
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:49,470
My goodness... How come you're both so funny?

366
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,390
Are you...

367
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:56,270
going to go around returning these to everyone?

368
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,620
Do you want me to do it for you?

369
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,700
You don't even know who's who, Mom. You can't do it for me.

370
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,890
My daughter...

371
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:07,090
would be too embarrassed...

372
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,890
I'm okay. I'm not embarrassed at all.

373
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,930
That Kim In Woo...

374
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,250
If I ever meet him, I'll crush him to smithereens.

375
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,840
I'll really, really teach him a lesson.

376
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:25,270
I want to just pull my eyes out and sew my lips...

377
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:29,960
when I think about nagging you about getting married...

378
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,710
Gosh, come on. There you go again.

379
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:36,800
I told you it's not your fault, Mom. Why do you keep saying that?

380
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,350
If anything bad happens to my daughter, it's all my fault.

381
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:43,340
Don't say stuff like that. Please?

382
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:53,960
Mom, eat something good on your way home.

383
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,060
I want to go with you, but I can't leave the location for too long.

384
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,550
- Here- 
 - Forget it! We don't need it!

385
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,900
You're busy. Hurry up and get back!

386
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,490
No, no, take it.

387
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:06,950
Hurry. That'd make me feel better.

388
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:09,690
- Okay? 
 - My daughter...

389
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,680
Come over here...

390
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,390
It's okay, Mom.

391
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:20,300
Gosh...

392
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,360
Yes?

393
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:33,320
I came here hoping we could talk without the cameras.

394
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,080
Sure. Let's go out.

395
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,160
May I ask you how you've come to appear on the show?

396
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:49,140
You said you wanted to confirm your feelings.

397
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,790
Did you finish confirming them?

398
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:57,140
I'll be honest with you, Ji Yeon.

399
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:00,800
PD Goo Yeo Reum on location...

400
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,470
I want to know how I feel about her.

401
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,920
I heard that she called off her wedding at the ceremony...

402
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:13,470
I heard the staff talking.

403
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:17,040
I'd rather not get into her situation here.

404
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,860
In any case, I got to be on the show because of Yeo Reum.

405
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,830
One of the participants couldn't make it on the show all of a sudden

406
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,270
and she needed someone with my qualifications.

407
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,530
Kind of like Daddy Long Legs... Something like that?

408
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:31,080
Best friends. Like buddies?

409
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,990
Well, for now.

410
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:40,220
Ji Yeon, if it's okay with you,

411
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,660
how about we become friends?

412
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,600
Are you drawing the line?

413
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,360
When I have to pick someone in the Kingdom of Love, I'll go with the flow.

414
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,980
Go for someone most people choose.

415
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:58,850
And then what if Jang Tae Mi says she likes you?

416
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,690
I don't think she will, though. I think she'd...

417
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:06,720
like a man who'd try harder, don't you think?

418
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,850
Don't make things complicated for no reason.

419
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:16,240
You can just use me... comfortably.

420
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,350
I understand your dilemma

421
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:23,010
and I won't have any expectations.

422
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:28,080
You'll have to continue to select someone for a month.

423
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:33,050
And that person can't be the one standing behind the camera.

424
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,270
Just pick me.

425
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:43,720
I can't do that to you, Ji Yeon.

426
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,160
I don't think that's right.

427
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,480
Why not?

428
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,120
I don't want to cause you heartache.

429
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:57,090
But it's okay to make me walk out in my slip, huh?

430
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,160
I really don't want to be embarrassed

431
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:03,140
in front of the whole nation as a woman no one wants.

432
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,260
If your choice is meaningless in the end,

433
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,310
just choose me.

434
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:17,510
Here. I thought I should return it.

435
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,790
Senior, I'm okay, though...

436
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:22,410
Take it. Hurry.

437
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:29,780
Taking care of the aftermath is so...

438
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,760
messy.

439
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,600
But still, I can't look the other way.

440
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,730
It's my life after all.

441
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,790
Total respect to you.

442
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,430
Your mentality rocks.

443
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:45,970
Thanks for your encouragement.

444
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:48,260
Give that to me. I'll return the rest of them.

445
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,750
Why would you return these?

446
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:52,240
Half of the staff members didn't make it to the wedding.

447
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,460
I collected all the cash gifts and put them together.

448
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,370
Why would you return them in person?

449
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:59,090
Just give it to me.

450
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,060
I don't want to use you for a personal matter.

451
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,600
Hurry up and give it to me.

452
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,490
At times, I think it's okay to

453
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:13,150
use someone else unfairly to keep your dignity intact.

454
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,700
Seriously, you're so...

455
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,430
Senior, are you crying?

456
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,540
Why do you say stuff like that?

457
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,590
I'm already feeling fragile as is.

458
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:29,370
That's why you should save your energy.

459
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,850
I'll return these.

460
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,940
Senior! Fighting!

461
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,770
Let's go!

462
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,250
How about a date in a desert?

463
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,340
A desert?

464
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:52,320
Senior, excuse me for a moment.

465
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,870
Excuse me.

466
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,700
What is it?

467
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,700
Oh, I see. Why are you bringing it to me?

468
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,120
Did Goo Yeo Reum make you do it?

469
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,570
I volunteered to help her.

470
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:10,290
Are you... Goo Yeo Reum's minion?

471
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:12,540
Well, something like that.

472
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:17,170
Since Senior Goo Yeo Reum is the producer and I'm an assistant producer.

473
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:20,220
Then, will you... do something like this if I asked you to?

474
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:23,470
Can I use you to do my personal things here and there?

475
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,390
I don't think you and I are...

476
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:29,240
that close just yet, Senior.

477
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,740
What?

478
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,700
Are you discriminating?

479
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,510
I'll get going.

480
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:37,240
I'll be busy having to return all of these.

481
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,350
Gosh, kids these days...

482
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,880
Did you already set the channel on this?

483
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,010
Yes, everything's set.

484
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,340
Hee Chang, is everything ready?

485
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,140
Yes, almost. We're almost there.

486
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,400
- Let's send out the text. 
 - Okay.

487
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,230
I got a text.

488
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,710
We're doing self introductions later.

489
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,100
"We'll have time to introduce ourselves tonight.

490
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:33,200
 Please dress up in your best outfit and meet us in the garden."

491
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:40,520
We'll have the men come out in order and introduce themselves.

492
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,300
 So handsome!

493
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:49,510
Hello. I'm John Jang.

494
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,570
As you all know, I'm a chef.

495
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:56,590
I run two fine-dining restaurants, one in Cheongdam and one in Hannam.

496
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,270
Two locations.

497
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,550
I'm 31 years old.

498
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:03,040
What's your ideal type of woman?

499
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,920
The chemistry.

500
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,310
 Chemistry...

501
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,830
The chemistry is important.

502
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:13,170
A woman I can tiki-taka well with.

503
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,770
Hello. I'm Kim Joon Ho.

504
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,500
 Nice to meet you.

505
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,880
I'm a CEO of a startup company. I'm developing a dating app.

506
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,260
I was born in 1987. I'm 36 years old.

507
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,050
- He looks young. 
 - So, why did you come out to this show?

508
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:36,400
You should find a woman through your own dating app.

509
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,290
Oh, I thought I might get that question.

510
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,280
As for me, through this program,

511
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,690
I wanted to find out objectively what type

512
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:46,960
of relationship I'll pursue.

513
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,190
Thank you in advance.

514
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,350
He said he prepared something earlier, right?

515
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,620
Let's see.

516
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:05,400
Foolishly! 
  (T/N: Doing a scene from a Korean movie with a character name Hwang Jang Goon, which means General Hwang)

517
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:11,360
As a man who loved a woman for a thousand years as though it was only a day,

518
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:13,750
over there...

519
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,760
Can't you hear it over there?

520
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,550
The solemn chorus of the heavens that is blessing our love?

521
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:26,680
Come here. Hold my hand!

522
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,250
Hold my hand!

523
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:31,720
Why are you hesitating?

524
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,560
Hello.

525
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,960
I'm a man who wants to love a woman for a thousand years as if it's only a day.

526
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,070
I'm Hwang Jang Goon. Nice to meet you!

527
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:48,640
I run a gym that's 300 pyung in Cheonan.

528
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,440
I also work as a trainer.

529
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,510
And I'm 37 years old.

530
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:55,830
What do you value the most in a woman?

531
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:59,890
Rather than a woman's appearance, I look at her ability.

532
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:03,630
- Ability. 
 - The resume tells you how that person has lived her life.

533
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:07,540
So, I look at what her accomplishments are.

534
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:10,150
Hello. I'm Lee Hoon Hee.

535
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,490
I'm 30 years old, and I'm an ice hockey player.

536
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:15,880
I was a national athlete for a short time.

537
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,570
Did you ever win a medal?

538
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:21,680
I won a silver medal in an Asian Winter Games.

539
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,030
How cool!

540
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,910
Hello, I'm Park Jae Hoon. I'm 37 years old.

541
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:34,230
I work as a doctor in a plastic surgery office.

542
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:37,430
Please tell us your ideal type.

543
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,840
A woman who loves chicken feet.

544
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,490
That's weird.

545
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:48,080
He keeps looking at Goo Yeo Reum.

546
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,510
Oh, my! I totally love chicken feet!

547
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,390
I enjoy eating chicken feet, too.

548
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,860
Me, too! Me, too! I love chicken feet.

549
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:01,810
Are you sure you really love it? Come on now.

550
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,050
There was a spring breeze, and it was a warm weekend day.

551
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:11,400
The weather at Kingdom of Love will continue to be clear tomorrow

552
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,220
and the temperature will rise slowly and will be very hot.

553
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,190
Hello, I'm Jang Tae Mi.

554
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:19,760
I'm a newscaster who gives you weather reports.

555
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,280
And I'm 30 years old.

556
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,620
What's your ideal type?

557
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:28,500
I like tall... and handsome men.

558
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,830
Come on, let's go!

559
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:33,200
Don't get nervous!

560
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:41,950
I'm... 36 years old, Park Ji Wan.

561
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,090
I work as a webtoon artist.

562
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:47,970
By chance, did you work on anything we might recognize?

563
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,610
Up until recently,

564
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:53,600
I worked on "I Loved That Jerk."

565
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,560
- Is that a popular one? 
 - Awesome!

566
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,040
I'm a huge fan of that story.

567
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,910
Isn't it coming out as a drama?

568
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:02,180
Yes. They bought the copyright...

569
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,230
You're so cool! So successful!

570
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,460
Tell them to capture Ji Wan and Joon Ho's close-ups.

571
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,910
- Got it. 
 - Keep at it.

572
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:17,040
Hello, everyone! It's nice to meet all of you.

573
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,900
I'm Ahn So Yeon.

574
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,440
I'm 32 years old

575
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,310
and I teach English at an academy.

576
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:27,490
My special talent is dance.

577
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:39,080
Thank you!

578
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,560
So sexy!

579
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,180
You're so cool!

580
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:52,210
Hello. I'm Geum Soo Mi.

581
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:54,270
I'm 31 years old.

582
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:57,780
- And I work as a lawyer. 
  - Awesome.

583
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:01,150
I work at a small law firm in Seocho.

584
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:04,370
Please come to Suite 406 if you ever need any legal advice.

585
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:07,600
Hello. I'm Han Ji Yeon.

586
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,170
I'm 33 years old.

587
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:14,150
I teach Western Art in a college.

588
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,430
May I ask you how you've come to appear on the show?

589
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:23,400
I had a little flirtation going on with a man

590
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,730
and he turned me down saying he didn't want to pursue it further.

591
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:31,040
I happened to see an ad for participants for the show on my way home that day.

592
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,080
And I went to the interview and ended up coming here.

593
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:39,010
And then I met the man who turned me down

594
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:41,960
here once again.

595
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:48,600
W-Who?

596
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,520
Mr. Park Jae Hoon.

597
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,960
Wow...

598
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:10,970
Then... will you continue to pursue him?

599
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:15,620
Even though he turned you down once already?

600
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:28,760
That's what I plan to do.

601
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,920
So cool!

602
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:42,700
♫  Fry the chicken  ♫

603
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,970
- Honey! 
 - Yeah?

604
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:47,110
- Did you talk to Jae Hoon? 
 - No, I haven't.

605
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:49,500
Yeo Reum just called me.

606
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,110
I see. What did she say? How is she?

607
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:53,060
She's on film location right now.

608
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,030
She asked us to send a food truck tomorrow night.

609
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:57,440
- A food truck? For how many people? 
 - 100.

610
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,890
One hundred?

611
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:03,290
Gosh. Why did she tell us just now?

612
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:04,780
There's so much to prepare for the ingredients.

613
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,700
But we should still do it! She's our friend!

614
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,240
Gosh, so much charisma.

615
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,610
Totally crazy! Seriously!

616
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:13,720
That's not important right now.

617
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,020
Jae Hoon is going to be on Kingdom of Love.

618
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,210
Kingdom of Love?

619
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,250
That's where men and women come out in swim suits like this,

620
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,350
while pairing up saying "I like you, you like me."

621
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,370
Then suddenly they go,

622
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:27,040
"I had no idea I'd be in this place and it'd turn out like this...

623
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,570
This is so great." Isn't this how it goes there?

624
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:32,190
Yeah! Yeo Reum is on that team!

625
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,680
Why would Jae Hoon go on a show like that?

626
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,080
- He hates doing stuff like that. 
 - I know!

627
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,400
What the heck are these guys up to?

628
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,220
They left the wedding hall and went off the grid together.

629
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,000
First, let's go grocery shopping.

630
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,270
And we'll take the food truck there tomorrow night and do a proper interrogation.

631
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,670
Okay! Got it!

632
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,650
- Are you confident? 
 - I'm confident!

633
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,500
I'm confident!

634
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,470
- Let's hurry up and go. 
 - Okay!

635
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:53,980
It was so fun today.

636
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:56,400
Right? I mean, this is...

637
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,750
- I'm so surprised with this one. 
 - Really.

638
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,310
- I was so shocked. 
 - Right?

639
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:01,920
- Senior. 
 - Yeah?

640
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,820
Someone is here for you outside.

641
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,800
- Who? 
 - Well...

642
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,040
The man you almost married...

643
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:36,440
I'm sorry to come barging at your workplace.

644
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,470
I couldn't reach you, so...

645
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:42,070
I'm glad you came. We should meet.

646
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:44,450
We have some things to wrap up.

647
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:49,150
The refunds and the penalties we have to pay...

648
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:51,060
Please take care of them, Oppa.

649
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:54,420
As you can see, all that's too much for me to handle.

650
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,180
Yeo Reum,

651
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:59,440
what should I do to make things better?

652
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,570
What can you do?

653
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:04,890
Is it a definite no?

654
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:10,710
You can't... give me another chance?

655
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,030
How can you even say that?

656
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,640
I'll pretend to be crazy and ask of you.

657
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,910
Please give me a chance.

658
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,520
I can't end it like this.

659
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:24,240
I'll... I'll repay you for the rest of my life, Yeo Reum.

660
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,250
Please go easy on me.

661
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,770
Do you know... what really makes me mad?

662
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:37,150
Because it's you.

663
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:40,510
I wanted to get married because it was you.

664
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:43,260
Because I loved you so much...

665
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,300
Because it was the happiest time of my life...

666
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,590
I missed that time so much.

667
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:54,920
When you came back,

668
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:59,530
although our memories were gone, I wanted to turn things back.

669
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:01,320
For me,

670
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:05,080
I loved the fact that

671
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:09,860
I had such a heartrending yet sparkling memory.

672
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,590
Now... even all of that has been ruined.

673
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:16,370
I'm sorry, Yeo Reum.

674
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:19,670
If... you had told me in advance,

675
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,750
I would've thought about it.

676
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:25,760
Since both of us are older now, I would've thought about it.

677
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:30,990
But, Oppa, you weren't honest with me.

678
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:34,610
Will you be okay to end it like this?

679
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,770
I can't even breathe right now.

680
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:41,610
You know it, too, Oppa. Everything will be okay in the end.

681
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,760
The heartbreaking first love becomes a memory

682
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,560
and all kinds of crappy things you experience in life become part of the past.

683
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,640
You and I both...

684
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:55,910
will settle and become "that person" during the tough times...

685
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:58,060
of our lives in the end.

686
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:00,230
- Yeo Reum... 
 - We...

687
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,550
end here.

688
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:17,000
Yes?

689
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,020
Tae Mi, would you like to talk for a moment?

690
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,720
 Will that be okay?

691
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,940
Yes. Let me change, and I'll be right out.

692
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,630
Okay, take your time.

693
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:28,460
 Okay.

694
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:35,800
I asked you out because I don't think we ever got a chance to talk in private.

695
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,790
I wanted to talk to you, too.

696
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:41,660
Can I ask you how many people you're interested in?

697
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:44,470
To be honest... two people.

698
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:46,130
I see.

699
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:49,530
Are you disappointed that it's not one person?

700
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:51,340
Am I one of them?

701
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,040
Not sure.

702
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,510
I'm only interested in one person, though.

703
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:58,560
I'll go all in with that person.

704
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,530
Is that... me?

705
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:03,180
Not sure.

706
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:23,690
The other person must be Park Jae Hoon, then?

707
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:25,710
I'm a little curious about him.

708
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:27,970
But I think it'd be better for you if you don't get mixed up with him.

709
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:30,300
He's too tangled with too many women.

710
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,730
What do you mean by that?

711
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:39,170
I'll tell you only the facts that I know of.

712
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:44,340
When I... worked on the program called "Ramen Chef,"

713
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:47,170
I had a thing going on with PD Goo Yeo Reum.

714
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:48,830
With PD Goo Yeo Reum?

715
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:51,260
Before she called off her wedding?

716
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:54,120
Whoa, incredible!

717
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,680
Park Jae Hoon came to the film location one time.

718
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:01,300
He said he liked PD Goo and was violent with me.

719
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,590
 I'm speechless just thinking about what happened back then.

720
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:05,290

721
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:09,140
But hearing from him earlier, it seems like he's got something going on with Han Ji Yeon, too.

722
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:12,490
I was so surprised by that introduction.

723
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,970
I don't know what it is, but he's fishy.

724
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:19,070
Like the bad boy stench.

725
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:24,770
Anyway, I just told you what I know.

726
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:29,160
So, were you serious with PD Goo?

727
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,180
There's no way.

728
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,440
She came onto me first, so I hung out with her very briefly.

729
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,300
Then she suddenly said she was getting married. I was so shocked!

730
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,180

731
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:51,400
Hey, Goo Yeo Reum.

732
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,750
When you were working on "Ramen Chef," did you have a thing with John Jang?

733
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:12,340
Tell me what happened.

734
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,390
I don't know why I should explain myself to you.

735
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:19,300
John Jang is running his mouth right now.

736
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,430
And you're mixed up in his story as a production crew.

737
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:24,440
Of course, I should know what happened before and after.

738
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,650
Did things end badly after your fling with John Jang?

739
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,100
What's "some"? 
  (T/N: Flirting, fling, short for "something going on")

740
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,870
There was no need to end anything whether it was good or bad.

741
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:35,140
We went on a few dates.

742
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:36,250
How about Park Jae Hoon?

743
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,440
Look at John Jang's character.

744
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,900
He was being annoying, so I asked Jae Hoon for a favor.

745
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:43,270
To teach him a lesson.

746
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:46,470
Okay. I got it.

747
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:55,480
Tell John Jang to stop running his mouth.

748
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:58,020
Let's manage our show participants.

749
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:11,270
I should've checked the script first.

750
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:13,300
But Senior Kang Chae Ri saw it first.

751
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,610
I'm sorry.

752
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:17,230
How embarrassing.

753
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:19,980
Senior, did you really have something going on with Chef Jang during "Ramen Chef"...

754
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:22,690
Yeah. I played a bit.

755
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:28,990
Senior! I had no idea you were a femme fatale with men always around you.

756
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:31,080
So, you want me to make you fall for me, too?

757
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,920
No, no! I'm all right.

758
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:48,520
Ji Yeon.

759
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,560
What are you doing?

760
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,150
I couldn't sleep.

761
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:55,130
So I was getting some air.

762
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:56,390
Me, too.

763
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:58,730
I can't sleep.

764
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:08,010
Ji Yeon, during the introduction earlier,

765
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:09,520
you were so cool.

766
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,850
I was regretting it.

767
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:13,300
I feel like I came on too strong.

768
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,350
You were honest and looked so proud.

769
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:20,530
I want to have a personality like you, Ji Yeon.

770
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:24,260
You know the type of person...

771
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:28,470
who causes you to behave unlike yourself.

772
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:31,780
You keep overreacting because you want to look good to him.

773
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:36,130
You want to win his heart, so you start being flirtatious.

774
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:41,160
I think Park Jae Hoon is that kind of a person to me.

775
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,740
I think you two... are going to work out.

776
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:46,800
Do you think so?

777
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,300
Ji Yeon, you seem like the pretty main character type.

778
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:54,440
Main characters always gain their love.

779
00:50:55,390 --> 00:51:00,960
I can feel that you're such a good person from each and every word you say, Ji Wan.

780
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,900
You must have lots of people around you.

781
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:09,030
Not really.

782
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:13,720
Actually, I don't have any friends,

783
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,570
and I haven't really worked properly in the real world.

784
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:21,430
So I hear a lot... that I'm dense.

785
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:24,720
I'm self conscious about my laughter, too.

786
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,400
People say...

787
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:31,960
that whenever I laugh, I look like a fool.

788
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:36,750
I want to laugh without holding back like you, Ji Wan.

789
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:39,330
- Really? 
 - Yes.

790
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:43,640
Then... it looks like we're each other's "wannabes"

791
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,050
Looks like it.

792
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:53,570
Let's get along.

793
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,020

794
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:12,340
Hey, Jae Hoon.

795
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,820
Hey, you came.

796
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:37,910
Did your work wrap up okay?

797
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:39,460
Yeah.

798
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:44,070
Watching everything on the sidelines, it's no joke filming a TV show.

799
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:48,800
With so many staff members... and so much to prepare...

800
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,800
And there's a battle going on behind the cameras.

801
00:52:57,530 --> 00:52:59,500
I heard Kim In Woo came by earlier.

802
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,110
Are you my stalker?

803
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:03,750
How did you know about that?

804
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,640
I don't think there are any secrets here.

805
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:09,630
I think everyone even counts rice grains stuck on their spoons.

806
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:14,710
It's because everyone is so interested in other people's businesses.

807
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:17,670
That's how we're able to make a living doing this.

808
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,800
Did the meeting go over well?

809
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:29,640
We... it ended well.

810
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:35,530
I just... was worried if you were okay.

811
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:46,370
Jae Hoon.

812
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:48,160
Yeah?

813
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,060
I...

814
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:53,740
thought about what you said.

815
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,440
Yeah.

816
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,730
I need a friend right now.

817
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,540
Not a man.

818
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,430
A friend.

819
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,830
Just continue to be my friend.

820
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:17,840
I don't want to misunderstand or be confused anymore.

821
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,290
My life is so complex that

822
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:23,030
I'm so sick and tired of getting into relationships.

823
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:32,040
I'm sorry.

824
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:40,700
All right.

825
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:43,810
I got it.

826
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:45,670
I'll do that.

827
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:13,240
I was on my way to your room.

828
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,160
Why did you want to see me?

829
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,690
Please take a look.

830
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:26,340
What's this?

831
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:30,370

832
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,470
Why are you showing me this?

833
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:44,460
Please behave yourself.

834
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:47,910
Nothing good will come out of stuff like this going around about the participants.

835
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:50,910
For you as well as PD Goo Yeo Reum.

836
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:52,750
This is... a threat, right?

837
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:54,880
A piece of advice.

838
00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:02,100
I'll take care of myself.

839
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,720
There are rules in a game.

840
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,600
No matter how good of a player you are, if you don't keep the rules,

841
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,540
you're dead.

842
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:12,940
Once you've set foot inside the Kingdome of Love,

843
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:17,670
you should abide by the rules here and behave accordingly.

844
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:21,660
I think it's fair for a producer to make demands such as this.

845
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:27,320
I'll be watching you.

846
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:51,040
Let me test it out.

847
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,680
♫  I want to love once again  ♫

848
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,620
Okay, we'll get right into the shoot when we arrive.

849
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:58,310
We'll shoot scenes of you getting off the bus first.

850
00:56:58,310 --> 00:57:01,810
Men, please take off your shirts if you could.

851
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:05,340
If you're uncomfortable about that, you can still wear a T-shirt.

852
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:07,920
But still, it'd be great if you could take off your shirts.

853
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,540
That's all.

854
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:12,040
We're here.

855
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,030
Please put the water in it.

856
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:17,540
Okay, you can get off the bus.

857
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:20,320
♫  What's there to live?  ♫

858
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,630
♫  It's up to the person  ♫

859
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:24,820
♫  Only if this heart beats  ♫

860

♫  Okay, okay, okay, no matter what, okay  ♫

♫  One, two, three, go!  ♫

862
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,390
What's wrong...

863
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:36,510
♫  I want to meet someone  ♫

864
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:38,660
I think I know...

865
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:41,010
Ladies, please sit down in the chairs.

866
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:43,550
Men, please stand by the match circle.

867
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:47,520
♫  I want to love  ♫

868
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:51,220
♫  I want to love once again  ♫

869
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:55,410
What's this?

870
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:58,730
You can avoid getting water dumped on you, if you get someone to ask you out on a date.

871
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:03,790
My makeup went on so nicely today, though.

872
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:04,750
Me, too.

873
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:08,360
I really like how wavy my hair turned out today.

874
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:11,990
You should've told us in advance.

875
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:19,680
Shall we take a look?

876
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:22,140
We'll begin filming.

877
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:26,570
Men, please go inside the circle.

878
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,300
One last person standing inside the circle is the winner.

879
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:40,550
We'll begin the match with the date ticket on the line.

880
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:49,420
Fighting!

881
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:57,490
Let's be careful, so we don't get hurt.

882
00:58:57,490 --> 00:58:59,870
Let's watch out.

883
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:33,370
Come here!  Bring it!

884
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:36,620
Kim Joon Ho and Park Jae Hoon, get tight shots of them.

885
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:46,120
Whoa! Wait, wait, wait!

886
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,540
Mercy! Mercy!

887
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:49,660
Mercy! Mercy!

888
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:51,290
Let go.

889
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:53,430
Too easy.

890
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:11,680
Tight close-up on the camera.

891
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:20,140
Pull back a little bit.

892
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:40,420
John Jang. Close-up on John Jang.

893
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:43,590
- You're good. 
 - You're tough, Jae Hoon.

894
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:20,500
You're so cool!

895
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:24,230
Park Jae Hoon, the winner of the game,

896
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:27,740
please choose the woman you want to go on a date with.

897
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:02,610
Are you sure you're okay with this?

898
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,670
Even if I use you?

899
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:10,660
I said... you should do that.

900
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:22,630
The woman I want to ask out on a date is Han Ji Yeon.

901
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:44,870
All done?

902
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:47,930
Film those two people kissing on their date.

903
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:50,330
- What? 
 - Park Jae Hoon and Han Ji Yeon.

904
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:52,650
Film their kiss scene.

905
01:02:57,010 --> 01:03:04,010

906
01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:12,790
♫  What can make me flutter in the wind like this  ♫

907
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:17,810
♫  Carrying pink imaginations between the two of us  ♫

908
01:03:17,810 --> 01:03:20,710
♫  I don't even blink  ♫

909
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:25,180
♫  I can't believe this feeling  ♫

910
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:33,280
♫  You gently blow into my bleak daily life  ♫

911
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:40,260
♫  In the flow, something changed.  Oh stop it, no!  ♫

912
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:43,280
♫  The wind, called you, blew right in and shook me up again  ♫

913
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,390

914
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:48,120
 I confessed to Yeo Reum and she rejected me.

915
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,360
 I'll keep my mouth shut and wait for her.

916
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,870
 What do you plan to do while keeping your mouth shut and waiting for her?

917
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:54,870
 It's like you're there but not really. Just read the atmosphere and just be smooth...

918
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:56,140
 Goo Yeo Reum, you made a good catch.

919
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:57,660
 Park Ji Wan just dropped a bomb.

920
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:59,890
 So, we'll go with this for the early part of this season.

921
01:03:59,890 --> 01:04:01,940
 So, Park Ji Wan agreed about it airing?

922
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:04,500
 - I'll film their kiss scene. Park Jae Hoon and Han Ji Yeon's kiss scene. 
 - What?

923
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,880
 I want things to work out with Park Jae Hoon.

924
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,820
 I continued to like you.

925
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:10,140
 I won't beat around the bush.

926
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:12,090
 Are you okay with physical closeness?

927
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:14,000
 A kiss.
