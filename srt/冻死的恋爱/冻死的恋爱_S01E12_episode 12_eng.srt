1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:08,960

2
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,690

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,700
♫  Dive with you, towards the wide sea  ♫

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,120

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:24,090
♫  Jump in love, I fly with wings called you  ♫

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,140

♫  There is nothing to be afraid of  ♫

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,100
♫  In the world called you, it sparkles and lingers here  ♫

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,730
♫  What I found while wandering was you who 
 was always by my side  ♫

9
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,260
♫  I'm already ready for you  ♫

10
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,130

11
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:44,820

12
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,670
Why did we name our show "Kingdom of Love"?

13
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,080
It's exactly what you're thinking of.

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,410
It's because it reminds you of the animal kingdom.

15
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,740
How's the dating behavior of humans especially different from the mating of animals?

16
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,390
Wouldn't it be sadness?

17
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,270
Feelings of delight or pleasure might be the same,

18
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,360
but humans feel pain even at the end of a short fling.

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,360
And even though they experience sadness, they chase after love again.

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,750
I feel like... there's no right answer when it comes to love.

21
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,990
Well, I'm not really sure.

22
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:29,480
Among animals, males and females have a parity exchange based on their rank.

23
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,620
If you look closely into it, there's not that much difference between animals and humans.

24
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,010
At times, our dating relationships are also a parity exchange based on our rank.

25
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:43,300
I believe that we all go through life loving and loving again

26
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,700
as we dream of that perfect love

27
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,710
that we wouldn't regret to the very end.

28
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,970

29
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,220
What I am seeking to show is something 100% real.

30
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,270
The true face of human beings in the face of love.

31
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,600

32
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,140
During a time when it's difficult to get married, virtual marriage shows have become popular,

33
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,580
and when it gets challenging to raise children, child-rearing shows have become popular.

34
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,680
Since it's a world where it's difficult to date,

35
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,400
I feel that's why a dating reality show like "Kingdom of Love" is popular.

36
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,630

37
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,940
That's a pretty deep question.

38
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,710
Well, I'm not sure.

39
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,820
Of course! I... believe in love.

40
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,560
But...

41
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,410
what does it mean to believe in love?

42
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,620

43
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:51,010

44
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,660
Ji Wan, are you okay?

45
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,600
Yes.

46
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,310
Geez. Even if viewer ratings are important, this is too much.

47
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,760
That's what I'm trying to say.

48
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,700
Releasing a conversation like that without even consulting us!

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,820
It's my fault.

50
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:32,050
Anything said in front of cameras can always be put on broadcast...

51
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,010
We're all now so used to the cameras

52
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,380
that sometimes we don't even realize they're there.

53
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,620
It's true.

54
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,110
We end up saying our inner thoughts comfortably.

55
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,690
Isn't that why there's a production staff?

56
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:48,430
The staff has the responsibility of protecting their cast.

57
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,730
And that's why there's an editing process.

58
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,360
I agree with what Ji Yeon said.

59
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,610
- Senior... 
 - Why?

60
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,930
Did you guys make this trashy program?

61
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,200
Where is the cast?

62
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,830
Where did you hide them?

63
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,450
Excuse me, sir. I don't know why you're doing this, but please calm down first.

64
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,350
Please...

65
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,190
put that knife down.

66
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,110
I'm going to call the police.

67
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,800
C-Call... the p-police?

68
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,850
You fuckers!

69
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,770
Drop it!

70
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,420
Come here!

71
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,880
Senior, please get out first!

72
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,910
Let me go!

73
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,040
Let go!

74
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,710
This is 105 Bukam-dong, the filming location for "Kingdom of Love."

75
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,980
An unidentified man just appeared brandishing a knife. Please come quickly.

76
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,330
Let me go!

77
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,980

78
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,430
Come on, pick up your phone.

79
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
Kim Sang Woo!

80
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,060
Senior.

81
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,920
Are you okay? Are you hurt badly?

82
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,940
The knife slightly slashed my arm.

83
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,570
Did you call the police?

84
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,170
Yeah.

85
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,410
Let me take a look.

86
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,500
Are you okay?

87
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,280
Oh, Senior. The cast members.

88
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,520
I think we should have them evacuate quickly.

89
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,310
Where the fuck are they!

90
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,300
Who is that guy?

91
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,990
Fuck, that looks like a knife!

92
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,160
Kim Joon Ho!

93
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,670
Come over here, you asshole.

94
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,470
Come over here!

95
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,990
Come here!

96
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,390
Come over here, you fucker!

97
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,620
Come here!

98
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,360
Shit!

99
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,740
You son of a bitch!

100
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,740
Stop right there!

101
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,950
Are you okay?

102
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,640
Are you okay?

103
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,630
You son of a bitch!

104
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,740
You fucker!

105
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,810
You're not even human, you asshole.

106
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:43,890
You conned me out of my money and destroyed my family!

107
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,230
And now that you're on TV laughing it up

108
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,870
for a dating show. Are you happy? You crazy bastard!

109
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,980
Are you even human?

110
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,320
Are you even human, you son a bitch?

111
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,600
Wait, wait. The knife.

112
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,530
Why don't you drop the knife and talk with me?

113
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,110
Give me my money.

114
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,990
Give me the money that you conned out of me!

115
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,950
Seriously.

116
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,280
You assessed and decided to make an investment, and you lost it.

117
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,550
Why are you blaming me for it?

118
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,080
What?

119
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,650
To be blunt, if you profited from it, would you have given me part of the profits?

120
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:22,330
This bastard doesn't know when to stop talking!

121
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,480
I mean, did I say something wrong?

122
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,010
It's been ages since the Supreme Court passed its ruling on this.

123
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:30,640
Why are you fucking accusing me of being a fraud?

124
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,960
Crazy bastard...

125
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,610
Today...

126
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,460
I will kill you.

127
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:53,540
I will kill you and I'll also kill myself!

128
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,360
This bastard!

129
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,600
You evil bastard! Get over here!

130
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,340
Come over here!

131
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,330
- Come here now! 
 - Why don't you stop this?

132
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,410
The police are on their way.

133
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,200
Who the hell are you?

134
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,350
I'm PD Kang Chae Ri, the main director of "Kingdom of Love."

135
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,700
Oh, man, what do we do?

136
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,810
Is it you?

137
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:32,040
The one responsible for putting a con artist like him on the show,

138
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,770
was you?

139
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:37,190
You've already wounded our supporting director.

140
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:40,000
Please stop now before you hurt any more people.

141
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,280
Do you even know...

142
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,050
even know...

143
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:51,840
what kind of a bastard he is for you to have him on the show?

144
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,770
He's gotten people to invest in his business

145
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:01,580
with all sorts of sweet talk

146
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,780
and conned them out of their money.

147
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,060
You took our money!

148
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,960
You think I'm the only victim?

149
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,190
Do you know how many families were destroyed because of him?

150
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,250
Did I ever tell you to get divorced?

151
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,710
Why are you blaming me for that?

152
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,770
If it only weren't for you,

153
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,790
my family of three

154
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:33,260
would not have had to split up, you asshole!

155
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,170
PD.

156
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,640
Don't believe that man.

157
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,590
Hey, PD.

158
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,740
You're also an accomplice.

159
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,840
Since you have that swindling bastard on your show

160
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,110
presenting him as if he's a perfectly normal businessman,

161
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,360
you're also an accomplice!

162
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,200
From what I'm hearing, it seems a bit of a stretch.

163
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,290
- What do you mean, a bit of a stretch? 
 - Did anyone force you to invest

164
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,730
by threatening you with a knife?

165
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,940
What?

166
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,640
You put your seal on the contract based on your own judgment and agreed to take responsibility for the outcome.

167
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,800
And yet, even after the Supreme Court ruled on this, you trespassed onto someone else's filming location

168
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,760
and attacked an innocent supporting director with a knife.

169
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,090
From what I can tell,

170
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,970
you seem like the bad guy.

171
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,260
What do we do...

172
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,500
No.

173
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,560
No!

174
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,800
That's not true!

175
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:55,310
Die, everyone!

176
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,100
- Hold still! 
 - Are you okay?

177
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,390
Hold still!

178
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,520
No! It's not true...

179
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,140
It's not true!

180
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,070
I'm going to kill you!

181
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,320
No...

182
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,150
Give me back my life!

183
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,590
Hold still!

184
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,890
It's not true...

185
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:35,570
Give me back my life...

186
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,380
Senior.

187
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,110
Sang Woo... you...

188
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,760
A-Are you okay?

189
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,120
What in the world...

190
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,010
What's going on?

191
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,500
What is this...

192
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,620
Don't worry about me.

193
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,030
- All right. 
 -  You've gone through a lot.

194
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,730
You all must be in so much shock.

195
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:37,190
It seems like the situation has been taken care of somewhat,

196
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:41,120
and it's already late so please return to your rooms and rest for the day.

197
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,610
Tomorrow, we will inform you all

198
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,500
regarding our official stance on this incident and the future schedule.

199
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,970
I sincerely apologize for the unfortunate event that took place.

200
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,870
All right. Understood.

201
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,910
- It's all right. 
 - Let's go inside.

202
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,200
Let's go.

203
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,830
I'll walk you to your room.

204
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,080
Yes. Okay.

205
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,950
Go inside and rest up.

206
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,890
Could you be with me for just a bit longer?

207
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,840
I'm afraid to be by myself.

208
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,020
Okay. Sure.

209
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,580
I'll be by your side until you fall asleep.

210
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:17,800
What are you doing here?

211
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,870
Oh, that...

212
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:23,380
I didn't want to be alone in my room.

213
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,320
And that's why you're cleaning right now?

214
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,880
Yes.

215
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,130
Are you okay?

216
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,550
I'm okay...

217
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,320
Jae Hoon.

218
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,810
Yes?

219
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:25,930
Have you ever regretted... your decision to appear on "Kingdom of Love"?

220
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,980
No, I haven't.

221
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:43,490
Even after going through what we just went through,

222
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,130
you have no regrets?

223
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:52,340
♫  There's a trace of kindness that came and went  ♫

224
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,520
Appearing on this show...

225
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,530
was the best option I had.

226
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:06,120
♫  And the today and tomorrow that I've been looking forward to  ♫

227
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:12,920
♫  I become saddened all by myself  ♫

228
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:20,710
♫  Sitting on two swings that are side by side  ♫

229
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:25,830
♫  Even if I love you in my excitement  ♫

230
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:32,620
♫  I'm still in the same spot like this  ♫

231
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:36,720
♫  Saying it's okay  ♫

232
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:43,540
♫  This is what I tell myself as a wish  ♫

233
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:49,000
♫  But that's just what I want to hear from you  ♫

234
00:19:49,000 --> 00:20:00,110
♫  Or probably just telling myself  ♫

235
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:04,100
♫  As I endure  ♫

236
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:27,080
Didn't I tell you to do a proper background check on the cast?

237
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,540
A knife attack on the filming location?

238
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,400
Like, gosh...

239
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,830
Hey. I can see getting involved in a civil lawsuit during a broadcast, but isn't getting into a criminal case a bit too much?

240
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:40,100
- I'm sorry. 
 - I'm sorry.

241
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,450
Before this gets on the news and things get noisy,

242
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,310
make plans to wrap up the show earlier than scheduled.

243
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:50,150
- End the show next week. 
 - I can't do that.

244
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,950
I will rally up the cast and finish it off as scheduled.

245
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,060
PD Kang Chae Ri, don't be stubborn.

246
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,170
- Director... 
 - If we don't wrap this up quickly,

247
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:01,150
this issue will become too big to cover up!

248
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,990
If this gets on the news and things get noisy,

249
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:07,290
not only will it be a big blow to you but also to the company.

250
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,990
Goo Yeo Reum.

251
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,270
Yes, Director.

252
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,490
Make plans to wrap up the show in the next episode.

253
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:17,100
Help Kang Chae Ri to remediate this issue.

254
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,030
Let's talk somewhere quiet.

255
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,190
Supposedly you knew about it.

256
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,140
- About what? 
 - Kim Joon Ho.

257
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,200
You knew there were problems with him.

258
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,380
He had many lawsuits against him, and you knew he was pretty much a fraudster.

259
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,270
Why did you still decide to have him on the show?

260
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,740
Are you asking me because you don't know?

261
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,090
That's his role. To cause trouble and draw attention.

262
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,380
If only people who are perfectly fine are on the show,

263
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,710
would that be entertaining?

264
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,090
I can understand having people who are a bit eccentric,

265
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,270
but don't you think a conman is too much?

266
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,980
You believe the words of a crazy man who came holding a knife?

267
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,560
Even Park Ji Wan's sexual harassment issue...

268
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,450
Kim Joon Ho purposefully and intentionally mentioned that.

269
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:13,830
Did you really have to put that on the air?

270
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,380
- Hey, Goo Yeo Reum. 
 - What, Kang Chae Ri?

271
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,640
- Stop acting like you're all righteous. 
 - What?

272
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,940
I want... to make what sells.

273
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:26,080
I want to bring in the viewers by making my show entertaining and making people go wild for it.

274
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,370
I don't want the resources and energy invested in my show to go to waste.

275
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,300
Everything you said is right.

276
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,440
They're all correct, but still.

277
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,970
There's something called appropriate boundaries.

278
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,860
Appropriate boundaries...

279
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,400
Who sets that standard?

280
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,950
There's an unspoken rule—

281
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,210
You and I just have different standards.

282
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,960
Don't you dare judge or look down on

283
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,980
my pure aspiration to succeed at all costs.

284
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,250
 So what's going to happen?

285
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,420
 - What's going on? 
 - I wonder what will happen.

286
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,220
 Are you okay?

287
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,740
 Are you okay?

288
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,620
 She's coming.

289
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,490
She's here.

290
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,300
Regarding the unfortunate incident that took place last night,

291
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:34,290
I apologize for not being able to maintain control over the filming location

292
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:36,410
as the director of the show.

293
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,620
For the next two days,

294
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,210
we will stop filming the show.

295
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,740
Then, do we have to be here for those two days?

296
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,890
I will update you all again regarding the future schedule.

297
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,280
Kang Chae Ri.

298
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,890
Why didn't you tell them that we're going to wrap up the show early?

299
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:10,600
Because I'm not going to do that.

300
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,030
Then, what are you going to do?

301
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:15,370
I'm going to resolve this my way.

302
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:25,970
You sure have a talent for causing every show you touch to fail.

303
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,990
What?

304
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,180
I'm talking about you.

305
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,660
But I refuse...

306
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,590
to get sucked into the curse that you bring with you.

307
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:53,060
So... is this show even able to go on?

308
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:56,770
PD Kim Sang Woo seemed to be hurt pretty badly.

309
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:59,310
Yeah, he was bleeding quite a bit.

310
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,710
Even if a person gets stabbed with a knife and the police come out,

311
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,870
they'll probably still go on with the show.

312
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,680
You know how it goes in this industry.

313
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,170
Forget the show.

314
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:11,900
Shouldn't we file a complaint together seeking compensation for psychological trauma?

315
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:16,270
Hey, hey. Everyone, we should all calm down and go inside.

316
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,090
Since we won't be filming for the next two days,

317
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:21,810
let's organize our thoughts while resting up and catch our breaths.

318
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,600
If we're not going to be filming,

319
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,210
is it okay if we go home and come back?

320
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:29,090
I don't want to stay here...

321
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:33,350
Oh, can we do that?

322
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,090
Until we start filming again,

323
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,500
we ask that you don't leave the premises, if possible.

324
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,960
They're too much.

325
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:52,310
What's this? Having a daytime drink alone?

326
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,840
I mean, we're not filming,

327
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,450
and it's a bit hard to be stuck here sober.

328
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,330
Let's drink together.

329
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,840
Cheers.

330
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:16,030
But isn't Kim Joon Ho amazing?

331
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,610
Right.

332
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:21,230
He's amazing. Unbelievable.

333
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,160
A-Ama...?

334
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,830
U-Unbe... lible?

335
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:27,150
W-What does that mean?

336
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:32,040
Oh, I'm not really good at English.

337
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,380
It just means it's quite surprising.

338
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,620
Oh, right.

339
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:41,000
I'm not good at English, either, but you're even worse!

340
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,280
It's because I was busy training,

341
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,910
and I wasn't able to attend classes well in school.

342
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,490
Yeah, it's fine.

343
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:53,780
You're very handsome, Hoon Hui,

344
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,040
so that's all that matters.

345
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:03,300
In any case, they say that it's really hard to see into someone's heart.

346
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,610
Kim Joon Ho... I've got a bitter taste in my mouth.

347
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,450
It's really hard to see into someone's heart...

348
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:10,560
Bitter, huh...

349
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,110
You must've been...

350
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,700
really shocked last night.

351
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,430
Yes.

352
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,620
I'm sorry.

353
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:42,630
But, what that man said is not true at all.

354
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,180
It's really unfair to me.

355
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:47,240
What do you feel is so unfair?

356
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,420
Business is like that.

357
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,810
If things go well, it's great. If they don't, then you lose everything.

358
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,890
It's a high-risk, high return.

359
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,510
But just because it failed,

360
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,380
he put all the blame on me...

361
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,280
- It's unfair for me, too. 
 - Right.

362
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:08,500
I'm sure that you have your own take on this, Joon Ho.

363
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,660
As long as you trust me, that's all I need, Ji Wan.

364
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,800
Ji Wan, you believe me, right?

365
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:18,860
You do, right?

366
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,400
Are you okay?

367
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,100
Yeah.

368
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:49,400
Last night must have been quite a shock for you.

369
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,250
No need to worry about me.

370
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,820
How's PD Sang Woo?

371
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,550
He got treated at the hospital

372
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,960
and he'll be taking off work for a few days.

373
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,420
Supposedly, he's in good condition.

374
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,390
You must have been shocked by this, too.

375
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,150
Are you okay?

376
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:09,580
Well, I came at the end of the whole fiasco.

377
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,190
It was a good thing that you weren't there.

378
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:16,780
You move your body before you think.

379
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,780
When did I ever do that?

380
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,150
Yeo Reum.

381
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,350
Yeah?

382
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:26,020
Is this the work that you wanted to do?

383
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,750
What do you mean by that?

384
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,290
I don't think that this...

385
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,970
was the kind of show you wanted to produce.

386
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,340
When your dream...

387
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:48,090
becomes your job,

388
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,470
I guess this is what happens.

389
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,290
If you're having a hard time, tell me.

390
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,820
I'll listen to everything you want to say.

391
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,570
That's what I've always done.

392
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,220
Yeah.

393
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,370
Jae Hoon.

394
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,310
I should go.

395
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,810
 Winery. Should we go to a winery?

396
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,910

397
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:02,430
Mrs. Choi, what are you doing calling me when you're usually so busy?

398
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:04,560
 This is the hospital speaking.

399
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,640
 You are the guardian of Choi Soon Ok, correct?

400
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,050
Yes. Why?

401
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:13,650
 Your mother was in a car accident.

402
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,250
Excuse me?

403
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,470
Are you going somewhere?

404
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,610
Something urgent came up.

405
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:37,430
Can I go with you?

406
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,500
With me?

407
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,900
I feel like I can't breathe being stuck here.

408
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,030
Please take me with you.

409
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,120
Get in.

410
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,450
Thank you.

411
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,530
I'm going to my mother's house.

412
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,090
Did something happen?

413
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:21,320
I heard my mother was in a car accident.

414
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,850
She says that she wasn't hurt too badly, but I felt like I should go and check up on her.

415
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:28,090
I'm sorry.

416
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:30,350
I didn't know...

417
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,640
If you're uncomfortable with me going with you,

418
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,750
you can just let me out wherever.

419
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,320
We're on a highway right now.

420
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:44,290
Then, as soon as we pass through a toll gate—

421
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:48,590
I'm fine. So if you're okay, then just go with me.

422
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:04,130

423
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,830
My goodness.

424
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:15,250
- Gosh, my goodness. Just sit down. 
 - My goodness, it's all right.

425
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:18,160
- Just give it to me. 
 - Gosh.

426
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,070
Mom, you should be the one to stay seated, please. I told you I'd do it.

427
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,530
I'm perfectly fine.

428
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:28,070
Why did you come down here when you're so busy? This is nothing.

429
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:31,190
You have a cast on your arm. How is that nothing?

430
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,710
- Please sit. 
 - Take a seat, Ji Wan.

431
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:41,580
My son brought a precious guest, but this is all I have to offer.

432
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,530
No, Mother.

433
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:46,980
The table legs are going to buckle underneath all this food!

434
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:50,770
- Eat up! 
 - Yes. Thank you for the food.

435
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,480
Eat up.

436
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:10,820
- I should pack you both some to take home. 
 - Just pack some for her.

437
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,790
Thank you.

438
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:16,510
You should eat up, too, son.

439
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:19,920
Please stop sending me this. I already have so much at home.

440
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,880
But you don't get to eat Mom's cooking that often.

441
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,180
But seriously,

442
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:27,050
when I make it in Seoul, it's not as good as when you make it, Mom.

443
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,820

444
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,910
Can I ask you something?

445
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,480
What is it?

446
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,760
Who is Joon?

447
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:48,990
It's me.

448
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:52,270
I knew it.

449
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:55,480
Chef, is your original name Joon?

450
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,740
Yes. It's Jang Joon.

451
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,730
Why? Why are you laughing?

452
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:05,940
Your original name is great, too.

453
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,550
So, why did you change your name from Joon to John?

454
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,630
I wanted to seem well-off.

455
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,470
When I was young,

456
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:26,220
the English name, John, seemed really fancy and cool.

457
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,890
So as I kept using it, it just ended up becoming my name.

458
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:34,170
John is nice... and so is Joon.

459
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:36,240
They are both cool names.

460
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,510
The coffee truck is here.

461
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:55,550
Everyone on the staff, please enjoy the coffee.

462
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,840
- Hee Chang. 
 - Yes?

463
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,160
What is that?

464
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,800
What's with the coffee truck with this atmosphere?

465
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,300
Well... the advertiser sent it to us

466
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,710
but I was so out of it that I forgot to cancel it.

467
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,220
Well, okay. Since things turned out this way,

468
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,760
we might as well enjoy a cup of coffee. Let's go.

469
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,160
- Your coffee is here. 
  - Thank you.

470
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,880
Hello. Hello.

471
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,160
Hello.

472
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,270
What shall I get for you?

473
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:27,960

474
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,130
I will...

475
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,350
We also have soft-serve ice cream.

476
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:54,480

478
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,670

 - All right.

479
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,980
- Looks good. 
 - Here you go.

480
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,890
Oh, thank you. One for you, Ji Yeon.

481
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:14,450
Thank you.

Thank you.

484
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:22,320
- You like ice cream? 
 - Yes.

♫  We were in that moment  ♫

493
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,680

494
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,050
Yeah, Mom.

495
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:29,110
My daughter, what are you doing? Are you busy?

496
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:31,740
No, I'm not busy.

497
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,000
I'm just resting for a bit in my room.

498
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,670
I called because I just suddenly wanted to hear your voice.

499
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,130
 Mom...

500
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,260
Yeo Reum, what's wrong?

501
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,210
 Did something happen?

502
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:53,250
- My daughter, why are you crying? 
  - Mom...

503
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,340
Why am I like this?

504
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,500
I feel like...

505
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,800
I feel like I just messed everything up.

506
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,670
Yeo Reum, what's wrong?

507
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,680
What are you talking about?

508
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,340
I just...

509
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:09,550
It's not that anything happened.

510
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,160
 Just...

511
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,400
work was a bit of a struggle today.

512
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,370
Work was a bit of a struggle today for my daughter, I see.

513
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,050
 It's okay.

514
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:25,850
 There are times when work goes well, and times when it doesn't.

515
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,280
 Yeo Reum.

516
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,140
Should I make some tasty food and go see you?

517
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:34,610
I'm already full from just hearing you say that, Mom.

518
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:37,640
I'm okay, Mom. Don't worry about me.

519
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,510
I just...

520
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:44,190
got teary from hearing your voice, Mom.

521
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,970
If you ever want to see me, just say the word.

522
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:49,960
I'll come up to visit you with Dad.

523
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,620
All right.

524
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:56,200
I'll make some time on the weekend and come down to visit.

525
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,000
So don't worry too much about me, okay?

526
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,560
Okay. I won't worry.

527
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:07,530
Mom, I'll call you back some other time.

528
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,410
Yeah. I love you, too.

529
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:11,220
Yeah.

530
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:35,290
But what's the Chinese character for your name, Chef?

531
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,830
Well,

532
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:39,380
i-it's probably pure Korean.

533
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,720
Or am I wrong?

534
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:47,290
But weren't you surprised, Park Ji Wan?

535
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:48,770
Why?

536
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,150
About what?

537
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,010
I mean...

538
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:57,570
Everyone thinks of me as someone who comes from a rich family in Gangnam.

539
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,700
But...

540
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,490
this is who I really am.

541
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:05,810
I grew up in a small fishing town under a single mother,

542
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:08,980
was always poor, and wanted to be successful,

543
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,220
so I've struggled so hard in my life.

544
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:16,630
A country boy with only his body and guts.

545
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:22,250
But, Chef, your face looks so classy

546
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:25,050
that you don't look anything like a country boy.

547
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:28,830
- What did you say? 
 - It's true.

548
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,950
You really have a knack for making people laugh once in a while.

549
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:38,750
Chef, I can understand why

550
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:42,930
the food that you make is so warming and tasty.

551
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,970
I think you've inherited your mother's cooking ability.

552
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:57,740
Park Ji Wan, why are you always talking so prettily?

553
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:04,150
I should at least talk prettily, since my face isn't pretty.

554
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,210
Your face is pretty, too.

555
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:17,040
I've never heard that before...

556
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:19,800
It really is pretty, though.

557
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,400
Ji Wan.

558
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:33,260
What you talked about on the show...

559
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,800
What happened to you when you were little...

560
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:39,570
That's not your fault, Ji Wan.

561
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,660
Honestly, I know I have no right to say any of this to you,

562
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:46,870
but I just wanted to tell you that it wasn't your fault.

563
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:01,620
Let's go back up.

564
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,940
Oh, I'm curious about something, Ji Wan.

565
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:08,910
 Do you go to an academy?

566
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:12,540
 Like an academy where you learn to talk prettily.

567
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:43,880
Yeah, Hee Chang.

568
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:48,000
Did the stationary cameras in the garden of the Kingdom capture the incident?

569
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,200
Kang Chae Ri.

570
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,050
What is this?

571
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:56,950
Do you know how hard I worked to prevent this from getting publicized?

572
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:58,740
And you post the footage online?

573
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,070
Are you out of your mind?

574
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,890
We can't hide it forever.

575
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:08,100
It's not like we can have the staff and the cast sign a confidentiality agreement.

576
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:13,040
If it's bound to get out at some point, it's better for us to release it first.

577
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,820
Even so, how could you post the footage online—

578
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:17,540
Have you seen the public response?

579
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:22,190
A crazy person broke into the set and Park Jae Hoon, Hwang Jang Goon, and Lee Hoon Hui...

580
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:25,270
The three of them bravely subdued the culprit.

581
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:27,450
They were truly like a prince riding on a white horse.

582
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:29,850
They're amazing, brave, and cool.

583
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:32,620
Overall, the response is positive.

584
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,510
Hey, this was a gamble.

585
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:36,820
The response could have been completely the opposite.

586
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:39,170
You told me to end the show early.

587
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:42,110
From my end, I had nothing more to lose.

588
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:44,870
So I used the last card available to me.

589
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:48,950
Kang Chae Ri, you really...

590
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:52,600
Now that it's resolved, I can go on with the original number of episodes, right?

591
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,260
No, you can't.

592
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,660
- Director... 
 - Have the cast members make their final decisions as soon as possible,

593
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,830
and wrap up the show by next week.

594
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,240
Why?

595
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:14,300
I fixed the problem.

596
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,610
- Chae Ri. 
 - So why do I have to end the show early?

597
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:18,360
Kang Chae Ri,

598
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,090
from what I can see, nothing's been fixed.

599
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:24,660
Wrap up the show and take some time to cool your head.

600
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:46,290
Have you heard?

601
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:49,110
They're going to wrap up the show early.

602
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:50,320
It came to this in the end.

603
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,240
I feel like it's for the better.

604
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:56,520
So Yeon, you must've had a hard time in the Kingdom.

605
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,200
Honestly, I did.

606
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,800
Nobody took an interest in me.

607
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:09,810
There are so many guys out there in the world.

608
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:13,120
It's much more difficult to choose one of the five guys here.

609
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:17,660
So, don't get down on yourself because of it.

610
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:20,290
What's this? Are you comforting me?

611
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:22,170
No, no. I'm not trying to comfort you.

612
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:24,960
I'm just telling you like it is.

613
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:31,610
Why did you choose to come on this show, Hwang Jang Goon?

614
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:34,790
Didn't everyone have the same motive for coming?

615
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:39,040
If you meet a good match for you, then great!

616
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,490
And even if you don't, you can still gain some popularity.

617
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:45,100
Didn't you come here for the same reason?

618
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:51,380
I've ruined my image, and I've received 0 votes from start to finish.

619
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:54,550
I'm going out on a gloomy note, so I haven't gained anything but losses.

620
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:59,290
Still, it's not over until it's over, so don't think too pessimistically.

621
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:02,030
The final decision is taking place this weekend, so what can I do?

622
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:03,480
What do you mean what can you do?

623
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,320
You can wrap things up with confidence and swag.

624
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:09,960
How do I do that?

625
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,040
Well, as for that...

626
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:20,340
You should think hard about that one, So Yeon.

627
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:26,290
That's easier said than done.

628
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:28,160
So Yeon, cheer up a little!

629
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,070
It's okay. It's okay!

630
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:32,660
Fighting!

631
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:45,940
You've heard that we'll make our final decisions this weekend, right?

632
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:46,770
Yes.

633
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:48,950
What are you going to do?

634
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:53,820
I'm willing to work things out with you even after we leave, Oppa.

635
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,690
I can call you Oppa, right?

636
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:59,070
Do you really want to work it out with me even after we leave here?

637
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:00,900
- Yes. 
 - Why?

638
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,770
We look good together.

639
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:07,860
People say that we're a perfect dutch face.

640
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:11,090
Our faces are equally good-looking.

641
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:12,990
Is that so?

642
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:16,280
If we do a couple live shows or couple vlogs...

643
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:20,040
I feel like anything we do together would produce great synergy.

644
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:27,980
It's not that you like me, but you want to do business with me.

645
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:32,280
It's because I like you that I want to do business with you.

646
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:37,450
I'm not very good at lying, so I can't do something unless I really mean it.

647
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:41,840
Speaking of which, what are you doing tonight?

648
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,450
Do you want to go on a date?

649
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:46,590
Let's go eat something good.

650
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:54,580
PD Kang.

651
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,710
Let's cheer up.

652
00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:59,240
Come on.

653
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,350
What can we do? Things have gotten pretty messed up.

654
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:05,080
And it's not like it's your fault, PD Kang.

655
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:10,010
Let's wrap this up nicely, okay?

656
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,960
The viewer ratings for the last episode are going to be crazy.

657
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,170
Everyone is anticipating it.

658
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:16,740
- Writer. 
 - Yeah?

659
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:19,960
Since things have turned out like this already,

660
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:25,550
I'm going to end this as bizarre as possible.

661
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:28,960
Yes, Director.

662
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,960
We've passed it on to the cast,

663
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,410
and the staff are discussing how we should wrap up the show.

664
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:38,870
Yes, understood.

665
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:40,470
Yes.

666
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:54,050
I heard what's happening.

667
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,750
Are you okay?

668
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,050
It's times like this that I really need to keep my wits about me.

669
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:14,030
Yeo Reum.

670
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,340
Yeah.

671
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,720
The house...

672
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:24,170
It's still vacant.

673
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,270
What do you mean by that?

674
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:30,020
The first floor.

675
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:32,700
Where you used to live.

676
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:36,300
Even though you moved out, it's still vacant.

677
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:38,600
How?

678
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,120
Because I got the lease.

679
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,590
Just in case...

680
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:45,110
After what happened at your wedding,

681
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:48,270
I called the landlord and got the lease...

682
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,090
because I thought you might return.

683
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:57,840
Your stuff that Kim In Woo sent to Chuncheon were also brought back.

684
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,680
Your mother said there wasn't any space in her home for your stuff,

685
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:04,430
so I just... did that.

686
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:06,720
Why did you do that without even telling me?

687
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,690
Is it easy to find a room in Seoul all of a sudden?

688
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:15,830
When we're done filming here, you would need to vacate your room next week, too.

689
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:19,470
What would you do without a place to go right after?

690
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:23,110
Just use it comfortably until you find a house to move into

691
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:25,820
since you used to live there anyway.

692
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:10,690
♫  On this long winding road  ♫

693
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:17,820
♫  There's a trace of kindness that came and went  ♫

694
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:23,680
♫  A smile you take for granted  ♫

695
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:31,690
♫  And the today and tomorrow that I've been looking forward to  ♫

696
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:37,580
♫  I become saddened all by myself  ♫

697
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:46,190
♫  Sitting on two swings that are side by side  ♫

698
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:51,320
♫  Even if I love you in my excitement  ♫

699
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:58,310
♫  I'm still in the same spot like this  ♫

700
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:02,270
♫  Saying it's okay  ♫

701
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:09,150
♫  This is what I tell myself as a wish  ♫

702
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:14,520
♫  But that's just what I want to hear from you  ♫

703
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:18,950
♫  Or probably  ♫

704
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:21,370
 Hey, Jae Hoon. Come down to my place quickly.

705
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:22,540
 Come on, hurry up!

706
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:24,470
 It's an emergency, an emergency!

707
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:25,940
 - Why? What is it? 
 - Hurry up! Come here!

708
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,770
 What is it?

709
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,310
 - What is that? 
 - Hurry up and kill it.

710
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:31,100
 But it's so big!

711
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,470
 - If I kill it for you, what will you do for me? 
 - Come on, go.

712
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:33,920
 - Oh, no, I don't think I can kill it. 
 - Hey!

713
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,530
 Hurry up and kill it!.

714
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,110
 - I'm going to kill it. 
 - Kill it.

715
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:41,180
 Kill it.

716
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:42,060
 Go throw it out.

717
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:44,530
 Oh, it's moving.

718
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:46,430
 Go throw it out!

719
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:47,900
 I think we'll have to negotiate.

720
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:50,730
 - Don't. Don't do it... 
 - A negotiation. We'll need to negotiate.

721
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:52,690
 Stop it! I'm going to kill you.

722
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:54,250
 I asked you what insect this was.

723
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:58,600
 Hurry up and throw it out! Hurry!

724
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:06,850
♫  Everything is so far away  ♫

725
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:11,300
♫  Saying it's okay  ♫

726
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:12,970
 Is it good?

727
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:14,930
 I told you to add more kimchi juice.

728
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:16,520
 I told you it'd get too salty.

729
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,540
 If it's too salty, don't eat it. I'll eat it all.

730
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,260
 - Why? 
 - What's that!

731
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:35,100
♫  Or probably... just telling myself as I endure  ♫

732
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:41,130
♫  The word "Forever" that I wanted to believe   ♫

733
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:47,960
♫  For once pains me so  ♫

734
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:52,050
♫  I loved you with all my heart  ♫

735
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:58,230
♫  But fading away as tears well up  ♫

736
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:05,770
♫  Saying it's okay now  ♫

737
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:12,590
♫  Sighing as though I'm talking to myself  ♫

738
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:17,920
♫  But actually wiping away these words exhausted  ♫

739
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:22,190
♫  Even if things get difficult  ♫

740
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:30,880
♫  These are the words I want to tell my love   ♫

741
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,750
♫ That I dream of once again ♫

742
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,420
When did you get here?

743
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:01,070
What brings you here?

744
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:06,060
Well, it's been a while since I turned off the gas,

745
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:08,360
and it's also been a while since I used the water...

746
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,610
We're starting to film tomorrow afternoon again.

747
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:13,320
So I came to check on the house.

748
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,060
And why are you here?

749
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:18,320
Aren't you guys in a state of emergency since the final decisions got pushed up?

750
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:23,830
Jae Hoon.

751
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:25,400
Yeah.

752
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:29,850
Why are you nice to me?

753
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:32,680
Why do you keep being nice to me?

754
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,030
You want me to answer you?

755
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:43,500
Should I really answer you?

756
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,000
You should tell me why you're saying this.

757
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,260
Why do you confuse me every so often?

758
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:53,160
Did I confuse you?

759
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,530
You're doing it right now.

760
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,740
I'm also...

761
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,140
going crazy because of me.

762
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:11,990
I don't know why I keep doing this.

763
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:17,500
My heart doesn't listen to my mind.

764
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,710
I don't know why I keep getting excited,

765
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:22,290
nervous,

766
00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:24,840
and why I keep hurting.

767
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,750
I don't know why my feelings are like this.

768
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:29,970
What's the big deal about dating...

769
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:32,090
What's so great about love...

770
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:34,570
What's the big deal about all of that stuff...

771
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:37,580
that I want to do it again?

772
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:42,550
Why does my heart keep pounding and keep breaking?

773
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:50,410
My heart breaks because of you.

774
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:06,030
Why are you doing this now?

775
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:13,070
I want to be by your side.

776
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,620
♫  When I open my eyes  ♫

777
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:40,450
♫  Happiness slowly wells up within me  ♫

778
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:49,360
♫  A hot summer and you smiling in it  ♫

779
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:55,050

♫  When I open my eyes again  ♫

♫  I feel like I'm so far away  ♫

782
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:17,290

783
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:23,460
♫  As we're left behind like a beautiful scene  ♫

784
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:31,500
♫  The reason why it hurts so badly like this  ♫

785
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:37,950
♫  The reason why I keep having expectations, thinking perhaps  ♫

786
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:45,780
♫  We're so beautiful, no need to envy anyone  ♫

787
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:49,190
♫  Needing nothing more  ♫

788
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:54,610
♫  Because we were in that moment  ♫

789
00:59:56,050 --> 01:00:03,030

790
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:13,990
♫  Those moments that became memories all too quickly  ♫

791
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:20,850
♫  I'm trapped, wandering, and going in circles  ♫

792
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:28,120
♫  I've never imagined an ending like this  ♫

793
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:34,890
♫  For now, it still feels so close I can grasp it  ♫

794
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:42,060
♫  The reason why I hurt so badly like this  ♫

♫  The reason why I keep having expectations, thinking perhaps  ♫

 so badly I can't sleep  ♫

799
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:16,720
♫  The reason I smile and say it'll still be you if I had to go back  ♫

800
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:23,670
♫  So beautiful that I'll miss all of those days  ♫

802
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:30,700
 I want to act on my honest feelings without measuring or calculating anything with you.

803
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:33,300
 Let's stop missing each other.

804
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:35,550
 You seem a bit different today.

805
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:36,740
 You're a bit different from how you are usually.

806
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:39,390
 Please give us a moment by ourselves without any cameras.

807
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:40,710
 Ahn So Yeon went missing?

808
01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:42,240
