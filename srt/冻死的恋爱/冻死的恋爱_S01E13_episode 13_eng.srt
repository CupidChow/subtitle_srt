 I wonder how they're all doing.

59
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,060
 Not like that.

60
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,960
 You feel a pang in your heart when you think of that person.

61
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,670
 You feel like you absolutely need that person.

62
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,150
 While walking down the street or while eating,

63
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,730
 someone who keeps visiting your thoughts...

64
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:34,630
 Someone you want to meet even by coincidence...

65
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,270
 You have someone like that?

66
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,170
 Well, do you?

67
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,100
 Just... Well...

68
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,420
 I do have someone...

69
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:51,380
 who feels like an unfinished story.

70
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,270
 It's all over once you break up.

71
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,810
 Stop being so hung up by yourself.

72
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,530
 You shouldn't sing "Never Ending Story."

73
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,990
 Why not?

74
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,140
 Affectionate and lonesome...

75
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,020
 A never-ending love, never-ending longing!

76
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,240
 If you've never felt these things,

77
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,380
 you have no right to sing this song.

78
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,830
 You're right.

79
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,920
 Man, sorry. I won't sing it.

80
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,750

98
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,450
What clothes?

99
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,540
What do you think? My clothes!

100
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,210
- The clothes I wore yesterday. 
 - They're gone?

101
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,120
You hid them, didn't you?

102
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,230
Me?

103
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,960
Are we the fairy and the woodcutter? Why would I do that? 
  (T/N: Korean fairytale)

104
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,860
They disappeared. Knock it off and give them back.

105
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,850
- Are you sure you searched thoroughly? 
 - Yeah.

106
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,230
- Are you sure? 
 - Gosh! Go look for them. Hurry up.

107
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,370
- You want to bet? 
 - Go ahead.

108
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,100
Hold on.

109
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,100
I'm going to look for them.

110
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,210
- It's a bet, for sure. 
 - Look.

111
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,110
- A bet. 
 - They're not there.

112
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,750
Let's see.

113
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,730
You probably hid them.

114
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,590
They should be around here...

115
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,120
Look!  They're here.

116
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,830
See? They're here.

117
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,350
See?

118
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,910
I was certain they weren't there.

119
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,540
In any case, you have a tendency to suspect others.

120
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:58,130
Get out. I'll change and be right there.

121
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,540
Let's eat breakfast and then get changed.

122
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,600
Let's have breakfast.

123
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,390
Try it and see how it tastes.

124
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,290
I'll enjoy it.

125
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:31,670
Park Jae Hoon, you're quite the cook.

126
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,350
It's delicious.

127
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,270
You want some jam on that?

128
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,410
Thank you.

129
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,780
It's good.

130
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,280
I love you.

131
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,600
My heart hurts when I think of you.

132
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,570
And it absolutely has to be you.

133
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,810
I keep thinking about you.

134
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,950
Don't I have...

135
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,410
the right to sing "Never Ending Story" now?

136
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,270
Yeo Reum,

137
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,510
let's stop playing tag now.

138
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:16,590
I don't want to argue about trivial things...

139
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,540
or play hard-to-get. I just...

140
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,140
I just want to be genuine with you.

141
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,360
There's not much time left until Kingdom ends.

142
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,680
Filming ends this week,

143
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,450
so first...

144
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,740
the things I need to do in Kingdom,

145
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,970
and take care of what needs to be taken care of.

146
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,990
And then,

147
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,320
let's properly talk about this again.

148
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,060
What do you think?

149
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,160
Sure.

150
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,460
Let's do that.

151
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,930
- Writer Han. 
 - Yes.

152
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,650
Where's John Jang?

153
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,590
I think he's still at the gym.

154
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,290
Can we talk for a moment?

155
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,980
Go ahead.

156
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,730
You know how you promised to expose your butt before the program started?

157
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,900
I did.

158
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,870
I think the time has come.

159
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,590
Kingdom is going to end earlier than expected, though.

160
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,920
And?

161
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,260
I don't want to flash my butt on a sinking ship.

162
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,390
Nothing can get in my way right now.

163
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,200
The recording of the interview where you

164
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,110
volunteered to show your butt if I let you join the program...

165
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,250
It's in my hands.

166
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,230
I also have the video of you blabbering about how you flirt with hundreds of girls.

167
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,750
How about it?

168
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:23,550
Should we expose that instead of your butt?

169
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,490
Where and how do you want me to expose it?

170
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,370
My hip...

171
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,460
John Jang.

172
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,840
- Yes. 
 - Actually...

173
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,990
how do you feel about a kiss instead of exposure?

174
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,420
A kiss?

175
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,130
It's going well with Jang Tae Mi.

176
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,740
I'm not sure if it's going well enough for a kiss.

177
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,610
Like you said, we're ending the program early.

178
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,640
A butt reveal is a bit...

179
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,850
iffy timing.

180
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,840
Let's make it romantic

181
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,450
and go for a kiss on the last date.

182
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,930
- Hee Chang. 
 - Yes?

183
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,490
Are the cast all ready?

184
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,920
Yes, they're on standby.

185
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,160
- They all have their mics on? 
 - Yes.

186
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,430
Okay, make sure to follow them.

187
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,490
- Okay. 
 - All right.

188
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,740
Should we also add more flowers?

189
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,280
In my opinion, adding more flowers would be nice.

190
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,750
- Over here. 
 - Yes.

191
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,750
- When they come in later, 
 - Yes.

192
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,650
- the cast members... 
 - All right.

193
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,500
Their faces need to show.

194
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,810
So Yeon, we'll start filming.

195
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,350
Okay.

196
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,650
Excuse me, PD Goo Yeo Reum.

197
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,140
Yes?

198
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,410
I want to go home.

199
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,500
So Yeon...

200
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,580
you feel that way because filming is tough, don't you?

201
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,050
I just want to quit everything.

202
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:41,030
Do you know how lousy and embarrassing...

203
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:44,150
it feels when no one...

204
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,540
likes you?

205
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,500
Every time I have to choose someone in the Kingdom...

206
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,020
every time I have to be chosen...

207
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,980
I want to disappear.

208
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,400
So Yeon...

209
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,170
you know... my wedding was called off. Right?

210
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,270
At the time, I felt... really humiliated.

211
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:25,970
I just wanted to disappear from the earth.

212
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:29,750
But if I just run away,

213
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,030
that's really cowardly.

214
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:36,890
In the end, I need to take responsibility for my life,

215
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:40,170
so I forced myself to endure.

216
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,700
My humiliation... was directed at my acquaintances

217
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,750
and my parents' acquaintances,

218
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,930
but it must be tougher for you.

219
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,980
I know how hard it is to put your name

220
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,080
and your face on the line

221
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,040
to come out on TV.

222
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,040
So hang on...

223
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,900
Hang in there for a bit longer, So Yeon.

224
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,270
I can't endure it any longer.

225
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,120
Senior,

226
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,210
we start filming in five minutes.

227
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,090
Han So Yeon,

228
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,380
you need to be on standby...

229
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:38,000
Hee Chang, go on ahead.

230
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,110
Oh, okay. I understand.

231
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:52,200
So Yeon, let's begin filming for now,

232
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,730
and let's talk afterward.

233
00:16:54,730 --> 00:17:00,440
I'll do my best to think about what you can do from your perspective.

234
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:08,440
I'm going to mark the slate. One, two, three.

235
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,830
We'll begin filming.

236
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:18,900
Today, before the final selection, you'll go on final dates.

237
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,590
We're going to hand out time coupons to each of the members.

238
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,640
- The time coupons. 
 - Okay.

239
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:41,840
How cute.

240
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,290
You can use your time coupons on whomever

241
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:48,710
you want to go on a date with.

242
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,600
However, the date

243
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,760
is only possible when the same amount of time is exchanged with each other.

244
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,950
The members can now ask anyone they'd like on a date.

245
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,430
Will you go on a date with me?

246
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,490
You should go on a date with me.

247
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,690
This guy...

248
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,780
I'll use two hours with Hwang Jang Goon,

249
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:14,490
and one hour with Lee Hoon Hui.

250
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,270
She's using two hours on Hwang Jang Goon.

251
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,290
I know...

252
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,300
How unexpected.

253
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,850
This time,

254
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,650
I'll go.

255
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,080
Ji Wan, your first date was with me.

256
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,300
Let's go on this final date together, too.

257
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,910
Okay.

258
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,980
Do you want to do it together?

259
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,480
I'd like to.

260
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,670
Excuse me...

261
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,810
Hold on.

262
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,020
I'm sorry.

263
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:44,410
Please, go on a date with me.

264
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,020
Just for 30 minutes.

265
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,240
Sure.

266
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,700
Something must've happened between them.

267
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,290
Close up on Tae Mi's expression.

268
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,160
What just happened?

269
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,430
Writer... What's wrong with Park Ji Wan?

270
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,780
I don't know.

271
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,200
Why is she asking John Jang on a date?

272
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,810
Did something happen while the camera was off?

273
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,830
I wouldn't know.

274
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:51,010
That's so random. It's annoying.

275
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:17,650
The members who still haven't decided on their date,

276
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,580
please make a decision now.

277
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:42,420
Will you go on the final date with me?

278
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,540
Jae Hoon,

279
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:49,250
your words seem somewhat more meaningful than it sounds.

280
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,360
Hwang Jang Goon, Geum Soo Mi, two hours.

281
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,880
Geum Soo Mi, Lee Hoon Hui, one hour.

282
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,200
Jang Tae Mi, John Jang, two hours and 30 minutes.

283
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,150
John Jang, Park Ji Wan, 30 minutes.

284
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,390
Park Ji Wan, Kim Jun Ho, two hours and 30 minutes.

285
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:22,100
Park Jae Hoon, Han Ji Yeon, three hours.

286
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,850
- PD Kim. 
 - Yes.

287
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,330
What are you thinking so deeply about?

288
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,840
There's a picture I didn't predict.

289
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,790
You mean John Jang and Park Ji Wan?

290
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,860
I think it'll be entertaining.

291
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,620
As a topper.

292
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,940
We'll see once we're done filming.

293
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,830
Ji Wan.

294
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:58,090
- Joon Ho... 
 - Just now...

295
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,950
What was that?

296
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:09,580
Why did you ask Chef John Jang on a date?

297
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:14,370
- Well... 
 - Are you playing with me right now?

298
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,760
It's nothing like that.

299
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,730
Everything has come to an end now.

300
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:23,160
For the last time, I wanted to go on a brief date with him...

301
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,140
with Chef John.

302
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,480
You have a skill for screwing someone over.

303
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,340
I wasn't aware.

304
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:36,170
I don't think I did anything wrong.

305
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:41,190
In "Kingdom of Love," you can freely share conversations with anyone you want to.

306
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:45,350
All this time, there's a story we've been weaving.

307
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,510
What will people think while watching the show?

308
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,350
The picture...

309
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,310
The picture doesn't look right.

310
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:55,480
The story isn't pretty.

311
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,730
God, this is frustrating.

312
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,850
Jae Hoon.

313
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,640
Yeo Reum.

314
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,300
What are you doing here?

315
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:33,110
Just briefly in thought.

316
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,510
Sorry.

317
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,330
For what?

318
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,730
For complicating things.

319
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,240
Acting smart,

320
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,770
acting like a professional producer,

321
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:05,800
I put on all sorts of acts, and tried to look cool.

322
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,600
I thought I could at least

323
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:13,020
govern my own heart without a problem.

324
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,620
The possibility...

325
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,190
of you becoming someone else's Jae Hoon...

326
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,400
instead of my Jae Hoon pains my heart

327
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,100
and makes me so jealous.

328
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:36,370
So I'm sorry for complicating things

329
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:40,700
for you at this time.

330
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:45,430
I'm sorry I'm so selfish.

331
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,070
Yeo Reum,

332
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:00,130
it's okay for you to be selfish.

333
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:05,050
To me, anything is okay.

334
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,830
From start to finish,

335
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:13,980
it's okay for you to do whatever you want.

336
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:22,540
Why is that okay?

337
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,640
Why is everything okay with you?

338
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,100
As long as you're my Goo Yeo Reum.

339
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,960
As long as I'm your Jae Hoon.

340
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:48,510
Whenever I had a tough time, you were by my side.

341
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,530
You were by my side until the end.

342
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:55,880
I think that's why I was so confident.

343
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,500
You were always watching over me.

344
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,940
So even in humiliating situations, I didn't feel humiliated.

345
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,360
I'll continue to be like that.

346
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,410
♫  Even if I love you in my excitement  ♫

347
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:14,680
When everything goes back to the way it was,

348
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,740
at that time...

349
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,400
I'll be good to you, so you can be selfish to me

350
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:24,030
until the end.

351
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,480
I'll do that for you from start to finish as well.

352
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:46,920
♫  Or probably just telling myself as I endure  ♫

353
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,980
Thank you.

354
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:30,580
♫  A love so precious under the scorching sun 
 burned me black and left  ♫

355
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,040
♫  I hoped you'd be my final love  ♫

356
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,690
- Hee Chang, you'll accompany John Jang, Park Ji Wan, and Jang Tae Mi's date. 
 - Okay.

357
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:40,800
And Writer Han can accompany Hwang Jang Geum and Geum Soo Mi's date.

358
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,580
Okay.

359
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:46,430
♫  What's wrong with you? You saw wrong  ♫

360
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:50,010
♫  I've lived by my guts all this time  ♫

361
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:55,080
♫  But after loving once, I got hurt big time  ♫

362
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:01,200
♫  Summer, I can't live without you, never  ♫

363
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:07,770
♫  I miss you, please come back to me  ♫

364
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,660
Oh, yes!

365
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:16,300
♫  I'm going to leave you by my side again  ♫

366
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,600
It's an honor to escort you.

367
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,700
Watch your head.

368
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:27,120
♫  This summer, where are you, my love?  ♫

369
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:33,710
♫  I think I know what love is now  ♫

370
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:37,350
♫  You don't know how much I need you  ♫

371
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:40,600
♫  I can't live because I miss you so much  ♫

372
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:48,400
♫  I loved you with tears, and you made me leave  ♫

373
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:25,410

374
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:36,610
You said... you absolutely wanted to show me someplace...

375
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:39,390
It was here? Hang Jang Goon's gym?

376
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:41,150
Yes, shall we go in?

377
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:45,290
Wait! Do we need an entire hour and a half in there?

378
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:47,350
You're right. We should get a move on then.

379
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,760
Let's hurry and go in.

380
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,040
Okay, be careful.

381
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:27,990
Your date time is up.

382
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:30,730
Soo Mi will ride the staff car to Seoul now.

383
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,430
Oh, okay.

384
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,460
It's already time?

385
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,830
Gosh, what a bummer.

386
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,740
Jang Goon, you should get ready to go, too.

387
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,330
Okay.

388
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:44,370
Soo Mi, I'll go after I take a quick shower.

389
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:46,620
- See you at the resort later. 
 - Sure.

390
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,000
Okay.

391
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,350
By the way, Hwang Jang Goon.

392
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,000
Yes?

393
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,230
- To be honest, I'm upset. 
 - Why?

394
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:10,120
In order to advertise your gym, you insisted on dragging me here.

395
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,740
If I had known this would happen, I wouldn't have gone on a date with you.

396
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:17,210
What do you mean by advertisement? That wasn't the intention I had in mind.

397
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:19,460
Who do you think you're kidding?

398
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:24,370
Out of the two-hour date, we spent an hour and a half on the ride down to Cheonan,

399
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:28,070
filmed you working out, and filmed you boxing.

400
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,460
You call this a date?

401
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,690
It's an advertisement.

402
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,980
I think... there's been a misunderstanding—

403
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,180
What misunderstanding?

404
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,040
I was...

405
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:45,050
even envious of the term dirt spoon. 
  (T/N: People born into poverty)

406
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:47,180
I lived without any hope.

407
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:53,130
Without a spoon and just my bare hands and body, I worked like a dog to get to where I am now.

408
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:56,660
As soon as I graduated high school, I spent fruitless time as an uncommissioned officer in the military

409
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:00,120
and barely gathered enough money to open a Muay Thai gym.

410
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,240
And with that, I gathered more money to expand the business until I got to this point.

411
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:10,310
With just my body alone, I became the CEO of a 300-pyeong fitness center. 
  (1 pyeong = 35.5832 sq. ft.)

412
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:14,810
I understand that you're exhausted, earnest, and desperate,

413
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:17,170
but it's a fact that you manipulated me.

414
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:19,220
It wasn't that I manipulated you.

415
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,380
I just wanted to show you.

416
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,450
The merit I possess is my resilience.

417
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:26,470
Just that alone.

418
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:32,300
I've accomplished this much and will live more diligently going forward.

419
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,100
And I wanted to show you that I could fight with anyone and knock them out.

420
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,160
That's why I brought you here.

421
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:56,020
So Yeon, I'm PD Goo Yeo Reum.

422
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,870
 Are you inside?

423
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,640
 So Yeon.

424
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,150
So Yeon.

425
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:38,040
 The person you are calling is not answering the phone...

426
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,010
So Yeon?

427
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:55,080
By the way, where are we going?

428
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,020
You'll know once we get there.

429
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,960
What the heck? You're making me curious.

430
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,650
You'll probably like it.

431
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:31,200
It's so incredible here.

432
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,660
Right?

433
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,510
How did you find a place like this?

434
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:41,710
I learned about it coincidentally, and I planned to bring the woman I like here.

435
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:45,720
Am I the woman you like?

436
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,330
Jae Hoon.

437
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:16,280
Yes.

438
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,940
Today, you give off a different vibe.

439
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,000
I do?

440
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,330
It's different than usual.

441
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:28,430
Well,

442
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,250
it is the end.

443
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:41,040
It sounds... somewhat foreboding.

444
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,430
I have a feeling it'll be...

445
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:51,790
a heartbreaking ending,

446
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,840
not a joyful one...

447
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:58,370
while observing your expression.

448
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:05,450
Ji Yeon...

449
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:14,900
I'm sorry, but can we share a conversation without any cameras?

450
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,440
Would you like that?

451
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,560
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

452
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,670
Hold on.

453
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,590
Ji Yeon,

454
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:39,230
since I met you on the blind date, until I met you in "Kingdom of Love" again,

455
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:44,880
I've made great memories thanks to you.

456
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:52,810
Did you ask to talk privately, so you could tell me that?

457
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,230
I don't...

458
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,540
think I can reciprocate...

459
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,950
your feelings.

460
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,090
I'm sorry.

461
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:17,770
Is that... the conclusion you've come to?

462
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:20,690
Yes.

463
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:23,510
It's because of PD Goo Yeo Reum, isn't it?

464
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,590
What can we do with our feelings?

465
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,230
I can't control my feelings, either.

466
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:35,730
It's probably the same for you.

467
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:42,680
I don't know what you'll think of me,

468
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:48,470
but please hear me out without getting offended.

469
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,690
I'm going to...

470
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,920
make a final selection.

471
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:59,590
I'm going to select you.

472
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:07,030
In "Kingdom of Love," my final selection...

473
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:10,380
reflects my sincerity toward you.

474
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:15,560
Please regard it as my responsibility and courtesy...

475
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,400
toward a person who deserves respect.

476
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,170
What about a green onion?

477
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,650
- A green onion? 
 - Yeah.

478
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,710
They'll carry a green onion like a bouquet of flowers,

479
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:42,920
and ask, "Will you stay with me until our hair turns white like the roots of a green onion?" 
  (T/N: Common question asked in wedding ceremonies)

480
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,920
And then?

481
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,780
If rejected, they get smacked in the face with a green onion.

482
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,480
What do you think about the green onion slap? Doesn't it sound good?

483
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,570
It is funny...

484
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:56,250
This is funny?

485
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,210
I think it's totally lame.

486
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:59,650
I like it.

487
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:01,650
Keep it for now.

488
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:08,420
Kang Chae Ri, let's proceed with some sincerity.

489
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:12,990
The original plan was to make the final selection romantically happen on Jeju Island.

490
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:19,630
Can't you tell? There's no romance.

491
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:23,520
Since the moment early termination was decided, season two is bound to end ridiculously.

492
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,450
There is romance.

493
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:28,380
Confessing with a sincere heart, exchanging bouquets,

494
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,230
and also lay down some candles in the garden.

495
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,500
It's boring.

496
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,230
Let us focus on the nature of this.

497
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,830
The viewers are interested in who ends up with who anyway.

498
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:45,200
It's that result.

499
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,700
Must you mess with the process in the middle?

500
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,290
Yes, I must.

501
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:53,610
Cliché is lame.

502
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:06,200
What's up, PD Kang? Have you got a good idea?

503
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,080
Goo Yeo Reum...

504
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,910
I guess we need to go the romantic route, as you said.

505
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:14,360
What's this? This is giving me bad vibes.

506
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,130
- Writer... 
 - Yes.

507
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:19,330
Please prepare a cake... and make it...

508
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:21,550
a very sweet one.

509
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:06,600
Try some. It's the signature dessert of my restaurant.

510
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,830
Thank you.

511
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:23,240
It's... really delicious.

512
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:30,550
You were... surprised because I asked you out on... a date, weren't you?

513
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,740
I wasn't surprised.

514
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:44,740
I had in mind that you were a good person, so...

515
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:48,540
I also wanted to have a conversation with you.

516
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,310
But why is it 30 minutes?

517
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:57,880
Is there a reason why you asked only for 30 minutes, ripping the card in half?

518
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,790
I thought you might refuse if I took...

519
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:04,250
too much time from you.

520
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:10,940
Since it's the last date... every second is precious.

521
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:16,330
So I thought I shouldn't take... too much of your time.

522
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,670
You could've asked for one hour.

523
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:33,460
It's lunchtime.

524
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:37,370
You came to a restaurant, but I'm sorry I couldn't even...

525
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:39,390
treat you to a meal, you know.

526
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:41,310
It's okay.

527
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:45,150
The cake is... really delicious.

528
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,900
Excuse me, 30 minutes are up.

529
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,730
Park Ji Wan, please move to your next date location.

530
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:07,220
John Jang, we'll have Jang Tae Mi come in now.

531
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,580
Thank you so much for coming...

532
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:20,840
out to the date.

533
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:42,590
I was bored to death waiting outside.

534
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:45,020
Oppa!

535
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:50,070
Oppa, are you ready for today?

536
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:51,000
For what?

537
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,510
You didn't hear it from PD Kang Chae Ri?

538
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,220
Are you okay with that, Jang Tae Mi?

539
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,480
Even if the scene of you kissing me gets broadcast?

540
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,100
We did already come out here. So it'd be nice to gain some attention.

541
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,560
It's better than being the background.

542
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:18,880
I'll look forward to it.

543
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:01,310
It looks delicious.

544
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:03,280
Please enjoy.

545
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:30,640
What's this?

546
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,860
I'm sorry.

547
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:51,070
I left... my phone here.

548
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:55,480
Ji Wan!

549
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,610
Park Ji Wan!

550
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,830
Here.

551
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:26,880
It's your phone.

552
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,210
I'll get going.

553
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:04,420
John Jang didn't kiss her?

554
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:07,870
Yes, the mood was disrupted in the middle.

555
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:10,210
What the heck, seriously!

556
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:13,350
The dating scene came out nice and romantic, though.

557
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:16,380
Chef John did the whole fire show, too.

558
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:20,130
Should I just have him flash his butt tonight?

559
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:22,430
- Kang Chae Ri? 
 - Why?

560
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:23,830
Let's just move on.

561
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:26,120
You think I can't do it?

562
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,400
You will, and you can.

563
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,400
I'm sure you can do it.

564
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,950
However, the final selection is tomorrow.

565
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:37,730
If we just flash the butt with no context, even the cast will be awkward.

566
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:45,990
Also... we're busy tonight.

567
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:47,540
Right, Hee Chang?

568
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:50,500
We have to finish the sponsor advertisements.

569
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,890
There are more important things than Chef John's butt.

570
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:04,940
Hee Chang... go out and bring me the PPL film times.

571
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:07,430
Okay, I got it.

572
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,480
- Please get the full view. 
 - Okay.

573
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,000
You have the pictures you took during the dates today, right?

574
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,780
Male casts, please go out to the garden and upload them with your phones.

575
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,940
Female casts, please

576
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:31,040
confirm the pictures through the TV here.

577
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,390
Please move to your positions now.

578
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:40,550
All right, let's go.

579
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:43,330

580
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:48,830
Looking good. You two look good together.

581
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:52,400
We'll check the dating pictures right now.

582
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:00,960
- Isn't that Soo Mi? 
 - Yes.

583
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,590
You two went to the gym?

584
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:04,460
Yes, we went to Jang Goon's gym.

585
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:07,190
My Soo Mi is here? Was it fun?

586
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:08,450
Yes, it was. Look at the pictures.

587
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:10,630
No, I don't want to.

588
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:14,240
Whoa, Ji Yeon is so pretty.

589
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,760
You went to such a beautiful place.

590
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:21,450
By the way... she's really gorgeous.

591
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:25,920
Where's that?

592
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,110
We just had a date... at his restaurant.

593
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:32,210
What's up with that dad joke?

594
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:33,840
What? What did he say?

595
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,460

596
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:59,070
Would you...

597
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:02,170
sleep with me once?

598
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,900
- There. 
 - Yes, yes.

599
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,770
We'll begin preparing to shoot.

600
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:14,110
Male casts on the left side and

601
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:18,050
female casts on the right side, please.

602
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,810
PD Goo, what do we do?

603
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:43,150
I can't find So Yeon anywhere.

604
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:45,250
- What do you mean? 
 - She's not in her room.

605
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:48,530
I looked everywhere she might be, but she was not there.

606
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:51,690
Whoa, we have to start shooting now, though.

607
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:53,170
When did you last see her?

608
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:55,230
Well... this morning.

609
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:57,590
She was definitely here until the morning.

610
00:53:57,590 --> 00:54:00,410
- Ahn So Yeon disappeared? 
 - Yes.

611
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:03,690
I had the entire staff look for her for 30 minutes,

612
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:05,660
but she's nowhere to be seen.

613
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:10,060
Talk about pulling all the stops...

614
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:13,830
She ran away out of embarrassment.

615
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:20,120
What shall we do?

616
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,860
Postpone the shooting until we find her?

617
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,130
Let's just go with it.

618
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:30,630
She's a side character, anyway.

619
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:34,770
Even so, it doesn't...

620
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:37,520
look so great since it's the last episode.

621
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:40,580
We can't postpone the shoot just because of her.

622
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,960
We have more to lose than to gain.

623
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:48,570
Okay then.

624
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:10,370
- Are we ready? 
 - Yes, we are.

625
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:15,050
We're now going to go into final selections.

626
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:17,210
Please get ready.

627
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,660
It's the finale.

628
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:27,500
Everyone, please make your final selections in order.

629
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:45,630
I'll... also make the final selection!

630
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:47,490
Senior...

631
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:55,160
Ahn So Yeon?

632
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:02,540
- What's she doing? 
 - So Yeon?

633
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:05,400
What? What's wrong with her?

634
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:11,300
Hee Chang... call 911 first, just in case.

635
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,310
Yes, I got it.

636
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:23,050
Ahn So Yeon!

637
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,020
PD Goo.

638
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:29,890
So Yeon... what are you doing here?

639
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:33,640
What am I doing? I'm making the final selection.

640
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:37,260
So Yeon! First...

641
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:40,440
it's too dangerous over there. Just wait...

642
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:43,510
Hold my hand and come over to this side.

643
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:47,350
I don't want to. Don't come closer!

644
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:50,860
So Yeon...

645
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,030
I know...

646
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:59,900
you had a hard time at the Kingdom all this time.

647
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:02,270
Even so...

648
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:06,130
doing this here is too dangerous.

649
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:09,620
I'll hold you, So Yeon. Okay?

650
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,200
PD Goo...

651
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,540
people said...

652
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:18,390
I look cheap...

653
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:22,760
and my eyes look weird.

654
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:26,620
People who don't even know me well...

655
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:29,320
Why are they talking shit about me?

656
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:32,830
Why are they running their mouths as they want?

657
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:35,310
Who do they think they are?

658
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:37,840
Who do they think they are...

659
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:42,100
So Yeon...

660
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:46,200
That's all... my fault entirely.

661
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:50,600
You're a really good person, So Yeon.

662
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,420
I should've caught the good sides you have

663
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:59,180
on camera and showed them to people...

664
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:00,790
but I failed to do that.

665
00:58:00,790 --> 00:58:02,960
I'm really sorry.

666
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:05,140
It's all the staff's fault.

667
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:08,130
It's all my fault completely.

668
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:12,860
So, So Yeon, hold my hand...

669
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:14,880
and come over here. Okay?

670
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:19,170
Gosh...

671
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:29,030

672
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:36,030
So Yeon... one second.

673
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:37,680
Try holding my arm.

674
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,600
I feel so dizzy.

675
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,050
So Yeon...

676
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:43,340
Give me the bottle.

677
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:48,490
Get yourself together a bit.

678
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:50,360
So dizzy...

679
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:56,800
- Hee Chang... 
 - Yes.

680
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,930
- You go up there. 
 - Okay, I got it.

681
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:10,190
What do we do?

682
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:11,720
- Hold my hand and... 
 - O-Okay.

683
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,190
Pull your legs up.

684
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:14,700
Come down here now.

685
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:25,940
Yeo Reum... Goo Yeo Reum!

686
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,800
Yeo Reum, wake up.

687
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,510
Goo Yeo Reum!

688
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:33,930
Can you hear me?

689
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:35,770
Yeo Reum.

690
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:38,020
Yeo Reum, get up.

691
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:40,100
No...

692
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:48,710
♫  We laughed together, those obvious moments  ♫

693
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:54,760
♫  So that they don't get erased  ♫

694
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:58,540
♫  Your name that's always been by my side  ♫

695
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:02,060
♫  Now, closer, closer, closer  ♫

696
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:06,880
♫  I miss you even if I write it down  ♫

697
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:13,520
♫  It's engraved with happy memories  ♫

698
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:20,100
♫  After hovering around me for a long time, then little by little  ♫

699
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:24,260

700
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:27,190
 "Kingdom of Love, Season 2" filming ends here.

701
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:29,730
 Everyone may go back home now.

702
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:32,130
 A knifing incident and falling at the filming scene...

703
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:33,980
 Submit a letter of apology and stand by.

704
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:34,920
 I'm sorry.

705
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:36,320
 What happened at the location?

706
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:38,890
 Are you worrying about others even in this situation?

707
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:40,530
 I just get that way without knowing.

708
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:44,060
 I only had one thought that day.

709
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:45,130
 What thought?

710
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:48,450
 That I didn't get to answer you.

711
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:50,260
 I wanted to tell you all along.

712
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:52,320
 I love you.
