1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:09,080

2
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,710

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:17,050
♫  Dive with you, towards the wide sea  ♫

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,060

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,460
♫  Jump in love, I fly with wings called you  ♫

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,120

♫  There is nothing to be afraid of  ♫

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,140
♫  In the world called you, it sparkles and lingers here  ♫

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,720
♫  What I found while wandering was you who 
 was always by my side  ♫

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,330
♫  I'm already ready for you  ♫

10
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,130

11
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:44,760

12
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,950

13
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,470
 Oppa!

14
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,510
 What's this? How did you come with Bok Soon?

15
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,910
 My parents went on vacation, so I offered to take him for the week.

16
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,860
 Really?

17
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,720
 Bok Soon! It's nice to see you!

18
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,980
 Oh, my, you're so pretty.

19
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,440
 You're so much prettier than your photo, Bok Soon.

20
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,620
 You're all right with us three taking a walk today, right?

21
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,530
 Of course! Of course.

22
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,230
 Bok Soon, let's go, let's go, let's go.

23
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,650
 - Let's go! 
 - Let's go, let's go, let's go!

24
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,200
 - Hey! 
 - Come here.

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,050
 Let's go!

26
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,850
 Do you want to raise a dog later on?

27
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,250
 - Really? 
 - Yeah.

28
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,860
 Really? You promise!

29
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,880
 - Oppa. 
 - Yeah? 
 - I'm planning a pilot program right now.

30
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,850
 It's called "Today's Pocha."

31
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,480
 At a tent bar... At a cozy tent bar,

32
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,430
 we'll have celebrities who were once popular.

33
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,570
 And they can talk comfortably while having a drink.

34
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,270
 Bok Soon.

35
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,730
 Where did Oppa go?

36
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,760
 Why did you come alone, huh?

37
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,800
 Where's Oppa?

38
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,060
 What?

39
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,410

40
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,400
 You want me to open this?

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,910
 Yeo Reum, will you...

42
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,840
 marry me?

43
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,310
 Oppa...

44
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,300
 Yes.

45
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,790

46
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:17,840

47
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,900
The gopchang looks good.

48
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,830
We're not here for gopchang today.

49
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,210
- Why? 
 - Just trust me and follow.

50
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,800
- What are we eating, then? 
 - Rib eye steak.

51
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,490
Rib eye steak?

52
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,970
I'm about to starve to death.

53
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,340
- Hey... 
 - Nope.

54
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,740
It's not that rib restaurant, either. The rib-eye steak is that way.

55
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,110
- Hey, it's one on one! 
 - It's all coming my way.

56
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,710
 One on one!

57
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,460
It's going to you now.

58
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,030
- Senior Manager! 
 - Yes.

59
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,840

Congratulations... on your return home!

60
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,730
Your face is the same. It didn't change a bit.

61
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,580
In Woo, even if you love New York that much,

62
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,910
how could you not come back once for three years after going there as a resident employee?

63
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,870
I'm hungry. Let's go inside.

64
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,500
Goodness.

65
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,780
 - You were doing well, right? 
 - Yes, yes.

66
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,370
Is this place that great?

67
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,770
This place has...

68
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,460
- Yes. 
 - ...meats that just...

69
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,460
just melt inside your mouth.

70
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,230
- They melt? 
 - They melt.

71
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,730
- You ordered something delicious, right? 
 - Of course I did.

72
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,170
 - It smells so good though.  
 - Hello.

73
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,280
 It's going to be so good.

74
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,630
You'll have to wait a bit, would that be okay?

75
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,190
Y-You already have a waitlist at this time?

76
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,560
Yes, our tables just filled up.

77
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,600
What should we do, wait or go somewhere else?

78
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,510
What time is it?

79
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,070
I need to eat and hurry back to work.

80
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,490
Well then... we'll come back next time.

81
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,620
- I apologize. 
 - No, it's okay.

82
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,680
Please take care...

83
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,280
In Woo, what's the matter?

84
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,020
It's nothing.

85
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,130
I'll be right back.

86
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,500

Really? This place?

87
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,950
Can I pay with the company card?

88
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,840
You clearly said that you're buying this one.

89
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,610
I'm not going to eat naengmyeon (cold noodles) today...

90
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,320
I'm going to fill my stomach with just meat!

91
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,880
Hey, do you even have a sense of conscience?

92
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,350
Why? What's the matter?

93
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,660
It's a crime not to eat naengmyeon after eating meat.

94
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,850
You need to shove the naengmyeon in, even if your stomach rips apart.

95
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,140
I'd have to do that, right?

96
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,310
Don't you let me down.

97
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,870
 Who the hell are you? What relationship do you two have?

98
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,450
 - Are you lovers? 
 - Me?

99
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,500
 I'm just some guy who's trying his best to look good to her. Why?

100
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,320
 I don't do things like "some".

101
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,750
 Especially... not with someone I'm curious about, like her.

102
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,300
"You don't do things like 'some'?"

103
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,740
"Not with someone you're curious about, like me."

104
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,970
My line was pretty good, right?

105
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,340
- It wasn't bad. 
 - Be honest.

106
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,830
- Your heart skipped a beat, right? 
 - You always go around running your mouth like this, right?

107
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,930
Why you... That's so vulgar...

108
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,550
"Running my mouth"?

109
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:43,520
He who lives by his oral cavity dies by his oral cavity... so clean up your act.

110
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,060
Don't go playing innocent girls.

111
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,870
I guess you were almost played by me?

112
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,590
You were. You were played.

113
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,330
Played completely.

114
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,610
My attractive charms. My overflowing, attractive charms... Right?

115
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,820
Just eat your meat, all right?

116
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:08,390
The juice is seeping out everywhere!

117
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,140
Eat a lot.

118
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,240
Two pieces.

119
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,960
Try it.

120
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,800
I'm the Goo Yeo Reum!

121
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,880
I'm going now.

122
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,560
Hey. What about the flowers? Are you not taking them?

123
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,710
You're telling me to take them to work?

124
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,290
What are the properties of a bouquet of flowers?

125
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,130
They're to showing off and boasting. Of course, you do.

126
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,690
Nope.

127
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,740
I don't want to block off a possibility with a meaningless bouquet like that.

128
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:57,570
I need to put on a public display the image of a single woman who is always ready.

129
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,310
I think you have the wrong strategy here.

130
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:03,950
You need to look like you have something, even when you don't for men to chase you.

131
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:08,350
Whatever!  It's too heavy to carry around, so you drop it off at my house. Okay?

132
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,060
Whoa... I'm never buying you something like this again.

133
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:16,480
I'm going. I have the groceries from yesterday at the door, so please put them in the fridge. Okay?

134
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,180
Right. Take one of the one plus one dumplings.

135
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,620
Also, take half of the bananas. Okay?

136
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,430
- No, that's not it. Hurry on now. 
 - PD Goo Yeo Reum, please take your flowers.

137
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,430
- Hurry on, I said! 
 - You need to take them!

138
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,590
PD Goo Yeo Reum! Yes!

139
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,240
Bye.

140
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,670
I mean... seriously...

141
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:55,010
She looks like she'd like flowers, but she behaves like a farmhand.

142
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:58,140
No romance in her life, none at all.

143
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,830
Gosh, seriously.

144
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,130
I need to take my share.

145
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,600
You can eat this. I'm fine.

146
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,390
Gosh... what a mess.

147
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,170
What is this, but a pigsty?

148
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,630
Gosh, really...

149
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,380
What am I going to do with her?

150
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:59,320
Gosh, how are you going to live without me, Goo Yeo Reum?

151
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,290
Why would you leave your shirt on the floor?

152
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,160
Goo Yeo Reum... she

153
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,820
really likes the freestyle.

154
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,900
I knew she would be like this. They were all padded.

155
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,500
I knew that she was a fraud ever since.

156
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,850

157
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,790

158
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,910
Yes, Professor.

159
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,210
I understand... then

160
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:52,380
I'll come to your lab tomorrow in the morning.

161
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,770
Okay.

162
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:15,830
Mr. Park, I'm about to forget your face.

163
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,460
Show that handsome face more often.

164
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,020
I'm sorry.

165
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,950
I should've called to say hello first.

166
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,200
How are you doing these days?

167
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,020
These days...

168
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,770
I'm working as a paid doctor at a local plastic surgery place.

169
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,700
This is the abstract of the thesis that I published this time. Try and read it once.

170
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,990
Then, I want to...

171
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:48,160
work on the next thesis with you.

172
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,930
What's your thought, Mr. Park?

173
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,490

174
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,240
How could I... work with you?

175
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:06,340
Also... I don't belong in the medical office anymore...

176
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,620
and I'm mindful of the juniors as well...

177
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,340
I'm sorry, Professor. I don't think this is a place for me.

178
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,960
You still don't intend to... come back to the hospital?

179
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,230
Jae Hoon, a lot of time has passed.

180
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,070
Just how proud of you was your father?

181
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,120
It's about time for you to come back.

182
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,410
I'll help you out.

183
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,030
I'm sorry, Professor.

184
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:43,730
I don't ever want to... go back to the Neurosurgery Department.

185
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,630
I'm sorry.

186
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,950

187
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,500
Please take this as well.

188
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,340
Writer, I'm going to go film the insert.

189
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,500
- Okay, take care. 
 - See you later.

190
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,410
 Yes, this is the Ramen Chef team.

191
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,280
An abolition? Director...

192
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,770
I'm not saying that it'll be done right away.

193
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,990
We decided to choose after next week's viewer ratings.

194
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,360
Just how... many people's livelihoods do we have that depend on this program?

195
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,820
How could you just cut their livelihoods without notice?

196
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:39,140
That's why I said... we'll decide after next week's viewer ratings at least.

197
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:47,420
If it gets closed down all of a sudden like this... we lose our source of income right away.

198
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,520
Not even talking for myself, but what do we do for our young ones?

199
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,180
Writer, since they said they'll decide after next week's viewer ratings...

200
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,700
PD Goo, do you trust those words?

201
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,720
We're all done for.

202
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,870
Not at all. We're not done yet.

203
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,140
Even if your neck is sliced at the slaughterhouse,

204
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,210
you need to at least let out a proper scream, no?

205
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,560
That way or the other, you still die.

206
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,660
Let's scrap all the ideas that we had on the line... and make a whole new plan.

207
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,000
If the ratings go up even by 0.1 percent,

208
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,990
I'll strike a deal with the director somehow.

209
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,020
Hello?

210
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,820
Yes, I'm a writer for Ramen Chef.

211
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:43,300
I'll give you a call back later. It won't be long, okay. Thank you.

212
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,610
- PD Goo. 
 - Why? Do you have a good idea?

213
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,020
- Blue crabs. 
 - Blue crabs?

214
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,470
It's the blue crab season. A blue crab in ramen?

215
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,150
They can't switch the channel.

216
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:59,050
Also, tell Chef John... to flash his upper body while catching the crabs.

217
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,810
Why? Apparently, Kingdom's going to have his butt flashed.

218
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,740
Will he take it off?

219
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,580
He takes it off all the time.

220
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,470
Look here.

221
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,650
Nobody told him to do it, he's taking it off himself.

222
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,250
Let's do it. Come on.

223
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,050
Okay.

224
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,310
First of all, cast a ship that is available.

225
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,930
Okay, okay.

226
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:31,830
 Hey, the list of captains, please.

227
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,810
Okay.

228
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,430
Yes.

229
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,030
Please take a seat.

230
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,350
Hello.

231
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:52,140
Wait... how did you know about this place, Ms. Han Ji Yeon?

232
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,920
You want to have a consultation about...

233
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,070
- your bosom. 
 - Yes.

234
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,130
Did you come here knowing that I work here or is it a coincidence?

235
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,090
I came knowing this.

236
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:07,990
I asked the center director about where you work.

237
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,730
You knew my mother personally?

238
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:16,840
Artist Han Yoon Gi, who is exhibiting this time at the art center, is my father.

239
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:21,870
I know the center director well because I act as his manager and driver.

240
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,130
Let's have a meal together.

241
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:30,490
I'm sorry but... I have no intention of seeing someone right now...

242
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,880
or of getting married.

243
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,720
Did I ask you to marry me?

244
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,600
I said let's have a meal.

245
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,520
Studying in the U.S. since high school, I also did my master's and Ph.D. in the U.S.

246
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,330
I don't have friends in Korea.

247
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:46,920
I returned for now because my parents kept nagging me to get married, so...

248
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:52,080
it's been a while since I got to eat comfortably with someone because of the weekly blind dates.

249
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,810
Let's... just have one meal comfortably.

250
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,880
I guess you bought new a gym outfit?

251
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,120
How did you know?

252
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:17,310
You should still take off the tag first.

253
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,990
I didn't think you liked to wear gym outfits.

254
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:34,610
I tried to match your style since it looked like it was comfortable.

255
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,410
You can choose the menu, Ms. Han Ji Yeon.

256
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,390
Something you want to eat, comfortably.

257
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:41,140
Why don't we have it this weekend?

258
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,210
I have a blind date during lunch, so I'll be free in the evening.

259
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,860
Okay then, have your blind date and let's see in the evening.

260
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,500
So you're not having the consultation, right?

261
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,470
Do I...

262
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,970
- need the surgery? 
 - Well...

263
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,580
that's not the case...

264
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:06,260
Please leave me a text then.

265
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,240

266
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:24,730

267
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,480
 Cheers!

268
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:39,620
Hey... you guys didn't even buy a cake for my birthday?

269
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:43,090
I have you guys, who lack basic common sense, as my friends...

270
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:46,390
Sorry, Unni. I was going to buy one on the way, but...

271
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,540
You're pardoned. What money does a job seeker have, right?

272
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,520
Sorry, I forgot because I was busy cooking all this.

273
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,710
Your birthday is next week, what's the hurry?

274
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,720
Also, personally speaking,

275
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,840
if you've lived for this many years now, let's skip what we can skip.

276
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,420
My mood is in the depths today.

277
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,160
I need an urgent supply of sugar.

278
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,860
Why? What happened now?

279
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,100
It's just... at work...

280
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,210
it's a pain to make a living.

281
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,070
What cake do you want to eat? What flavor?

282
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:21,370
Hey, it's fine. Sit down.

283
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:24,560
- Just drink. 
 - I was going to.

284
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,040
I'll supply myself with the spicy stuff instead.

285
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,560
- Is this green chili pepper? 
 - Yes.

286
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,820
Here.

287
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,230
Why is it so bland?

288
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,390
Do you want chicken feet?

289
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,600
Hey, hurry up.

290
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,170
Okay.

291
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,150
The burning flavor that Yeo Reum loves!

292
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,010
The burning flavor that makes you feel like your insides are incinerating!

293
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,710
What's up with him?

294
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,970
That's right, Unni.

295
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:47,180
What happened to "some" with John Jang?

296
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,330
Is it going well?

297
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,240
- Well... 
 - John Jang... was rejected by Yeo Reum.

298
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,540
Whoa, incredible!

299
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,210
W-Why did you reject him?

300
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,990
Chef John Jang is really hot these days!

301
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,890
My friends are crazy about him because he's hot!

302
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,470
- Well, Hyeon So— 
 - John Jang...

303
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:07,390
was just someone Yeo Reum toyed with and discarded of, refreshingly.

304
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,460
Wow, you rock.

305
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:13,430
Unni, I'm going to age like you.

306
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,100
No, you must never become like me. Never.

307
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,360
Why? You're my role model.

308
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,790
Yeo Reum said she likes the taste of burning fire.

309
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,380
Yeo Reum, the burning flavor.

310
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:28,750
The way I see it, Yeo Reum has bad luck.

311
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,320
Who was it again? The one she almost married...

312
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,960
In Woo!

313
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,230
After her wedding with In Woo fell apart,

314
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,820
she was never once in a real relationship.

315
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,610
Honey, why would you bring up Kim In Woo, right now?

316
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:45,740
What's wrong with you?

317
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,450
Summoning an ex-boyfriend on her birthday is really crappy manners.

318
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,280
Is that bastard just any old ex-boyfriend?

319
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,980
Our Yeo Reum sincerely loved him, but she cried saying they need to break up—

320
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,640
Let's stop talking about Kim In Woo.

321
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,830
I mean... remember how difficult we had it because of that bastard?

322
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,380
I'm just pissed, that's all!

323
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,320
Everyone, stop! Don't speak of his name starting now.

324
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,640
Let's move on to a different topic. Cheers!

325
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,960
Is he Voldemort? Why must he not be named?

326
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,410
Be quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet!

327
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,970
- Happy birthday. 
  - Happy birthday!

328
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,310
- Cheers! 
 - Happy birthday.

329
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:19,010
Happy birthday!

330
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:21,850
Kim In Woo, Kim In Woo, Kim In Woo, Kim In Woo!

331
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,300
 Today, I might just lose.

332
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,630
 Wow, it's really delicious.

333
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:42,970
 I think I know why ramen cooked with a seven-year-old soy sauce tastes so good.

334
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,740
 All right then, until next time,

335
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,440
 which master will we introduce next?

336
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,900
 Please look forward to it. Ramen Chef.

337
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:57,820
Soft ice creams are nice,

338
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:01,700
but I don't like how the cone becomes soggy.

339
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,280
I don't want to eat this part.

340
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,400
Then ask for a cup, not a cone.

341
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,970
But it's a bother to use a spoon.

342
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,260
Hey, how do you not even have the strength to lift a spoon already?

343
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,100
It's not that I don't have the strength, it's just a bother!

344
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,410
Okay, okay. Give it to me.

345
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,230
Why?

346
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,510
Incredible! What an iron stomach.

347
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:26,210
Incredible! Incredible!

348
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:30,450
I'm the one who caught your vomit with my bare hands.

349
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,170
Why are you bringing that up again?

350
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:36,020
After you broke up with Kim In Woo, you drank every day and threw up every day, too.

351
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:40,580
After a while, I even carried a black plastic bag with me in here.

352
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,660
Gosh, seriously.

353
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,010
I told you not to talk about that time!

354
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,580
So annoying.

355
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:51,100
He never contacted you? After that, it was totally over?

356
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,670
Yeah. Totally over!

357
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,830
That guy's pretty strong-willed, too.

358
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,830
If it were me, I wouldn't have contacted me either.

359
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:08,090
I don't know what came over me at the time.

360
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:10,850
I rejected the man of my life who proposed to me,

361
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:14,440
because I prioritized my work before love.

362
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,610
I could've just taken a brief break.

363
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:22,720
Or... we could've been a long-distance couple, the first few years after getting married.

364
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,200
Look at you.

365
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,960
You must regret it, huh?

366
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,370
Not to the point of regret,

367
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:32,200
but sometimes... I think about it.

368
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,210
How would it have turned out if I married him at the time?

369
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,940
The things that were so important to me at the time,

370
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,000
are not that big of a deal, looking back.

371
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,200
"I should have just chilled..." is what I think now.

372
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,220
That's when you were working on your debut program.

373
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,570
Eventually, the pilot program that I made

374
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:01,460
for the debut didn't get into the regular organization...

375
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,320
It's not like I was going to make the greatest program of all time,

376
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,320
but why did I give up everything for work?

377
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,220
Wait for me!

378
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,180
Hurry up!

379
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,710
Good night.

380
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,940
Okay, you, too.

381
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,460

382
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,390
 I love you? Huh?

383
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,500
 - What the? 
 - Whoa!

384
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,510
 - Oppa! 
 - Why did you shake it?

385
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,950
 I didn't shake it!

386
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:56,570
 - Don't do it! Don't do it! No! 
 - Come here! Come here!

387
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:20,570
 Yeo Reum, stop crying.

388
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,510
 Yeo Reum, please!

389
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,260

390
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,130

391
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,350

392
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:55,500
 What do you want me to do?

393
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,920
 If I tell you not to go... will you listen?

394
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,140
 - Should I quit my job? 
 - It's not somewhere you need to go in the first place.

395
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,670
 It's something you voluntarily applied to.

396
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:10,320
 You cherish your work so much, but why can't I go there as a resident employee?

397
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,410
 I don't like that you made that decision without even discussing it with me!

398
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:21,710
 Is... going with me that difficult for you?

399
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,800
 You can just take a brief break.

400
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,480
 You said you wanted to live in New York for a few years when you get the chance.

401
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,910
 You said you wanted to take a break from work!

402
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:32,600
 Don't you know how important this period is for me right now?

403
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,300
 My colleagues are all racing forward, so how could I take a break because of marriage?

404
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,250
 Are you telling me to age without even debuting?

405
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,660
 Let's stop fighting.

406
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,980
 It's all been said before.

407
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,920
 Let me go in peace.

408
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,620
 We can't even go to Seoul at this rate.

409
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,010
 We're going to get into an accident like this!

410
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,270
 You can go by yourself.

411
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:16,800
 Yeo Reum!

412
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,420
 Yeo Reum.

413
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,060
 - Let go of me! 
 - Goo Yeo Reum!

414
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,780
 Do you know how selfish you are?

415
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,700
 I can't do it comfortably... I can't act like normal!

416
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,060
 Why did you even come this far to Chuncheon?

417
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,130
 You should've just left! Why did you come and find me?

418
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,780
 Why did you get my hopes up?

419
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,100
 I got my hopes up...

420
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,990
 i thought you weren't leaving!

421
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,470
 If you're not staying in Korea,

422
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,900
 you can go back alone.

423
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:17,670
Gosh, look at him...

424
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,620

425
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,280
Senior!

426
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,360
The driver to take us to the boats didn't show up. What should we do?

427
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,150
- Then you drive. 
 - Me?

428
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,330
Do you have a Class 1 or 2 license?

429
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:51,100
I have Class 1, but... I've never driven a van...

430
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,140
I'll do it. I should.

431
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,770
But how come the director isn't here yet?

432
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,660
He went to the restroom.

433
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,240
Is he taking a dump?

434
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,370
Hey, Kang Chae Ri!

435
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:11,290
What will you do about this? This is all your fault!

436
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,420
Because of the vicious comments,

437
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,710
I've been on medication by a psychiatrist.

438
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,310
What will you do about it?

439
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,410
I'm going to sue you, bitch!

440
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,860
Do it. Sue me.

441
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:26,000
But... I'm sure it's written out in the contract.

442
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,970
"You cannot object to the director's editorial rights.

443
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:33,350
You cannot claim the portrait rights of the photographed."

444
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:39,100
Kang Chae Ri, you evil bitch!

445
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,760
I... I begged you...

446
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,430
Please... I asked you to please edit it out...

447
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:49,500
You knew the camera was rolling yet you were flipping out.

448
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,780
Why are you blaming me?

449
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:55,160
Thanks to you, my Instagram followers tripled.

450
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,770
Go and sell those cheap diet products.

451
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:01,170
I'm going to kill you!

452
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,690
That female participant...

453
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:12,690
She received about one million vicious comments after the show aired last week.

454
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:16,570
Her Instagram ID was listed on the real-time search for days.

455
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:19,320
I haven't seen the show...

456
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,400
Here.

457
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,600

458
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,210

459
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,460
Her breast— She aired it without editing this part out?

460
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,000
Did the director approve this? How about the program director?

461
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,080
The final version wasn't available until right before it aired.

462
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,300
They just turned it on in order to avoid a broadcasting accident.

463
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,490
Wow... it's incredible...

464
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:49,730
That evil bitch.

465
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:52,040
Turn it off.

466
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,380
I thought you'd come out wearing a track suit.

467
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,350
Why are you dressed so nicely?

468
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,360
Well, now that I know your blind date fashion,

469
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,760
I tried to match your style.

470
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,900
Did you decide on the menu?

471
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,500
Well, I think you'll like it.

472
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,000
 Isn't she making it too obvious with her menu choice?

473
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,550
 Her chest last time, too.

474
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,760
 Am I reading into it too much?

475
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,820
Please eat. It's all done.

476
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:53,130
I guess you like eel?

477
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:55,920
It's good for your stamina.

478
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,910
You should eat health food when the seasons change.

479
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,760
Stamina?

480
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,840
Please eat plenty.

481
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,880
Gosh, you can't! Why don't you understand me?

482
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,780
How many times do I have to tell you that I can't let a woman on?

483
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:17,370
Captain, you gave permission when you spoke to our writer on the phone.

484
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:19,940
I gave my permission when they said a PD was coming.

485
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,450
I'm that PD.

486
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:24,400
When I heard PD, I thought it was a man, obviously.

487
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,540
If a woman comes near a boat, it brings bad luck!

488
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,740
We'll never catch any fish again!

489
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,820
How can you say no women in this day and age?

490
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,740
Captain, what you just said is sexual discrimination.

491
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,760
- What did you say? 
 - Sang Woo, stay put.

492
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,600
So you're okay with all the male staff going on the boat except for me, right?

493
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,070
No problem with men going on.

494
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:48,140
All right, sir.

495
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,850
Go, go.

496
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,770
I'll stay back. You be in charge.

497
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:55,080
Senior, this doesn't make sense.

498
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,160
This boat means his livelihood and his survival.

499
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,400
We're just guests visiting temporarily.

500
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,210
Even if we don't like it, we should follow his rule.

501
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:07,070
What if we cancel the shoot and look into another boat—

502
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,710
We're running out of time. Do you want to have a no-show for our slot?

503
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:12,190
Stay calm and just follow the cue sheet.

504
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,690
Call me if you're confused about anything.

505
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:16,560
What if I ruin everything?

506
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,870
You can do it.

507
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:21,560
Discuss with the director aboutthings you can't discuss with me.

508
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,030
I'm going crazy.

509
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:36,560
Sang Woo! You can do this!

510
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,220
Call me if you have any questions!

511
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,820
Shit...

512
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,440
I'm seriously going nuts.

513
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,790

514
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:24,390
Honey, it's so nice to getaway, huh?

515
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,610

516
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,530
Hey, Hye Jin.

517
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,160
Hey, Yeo Reum.

518
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:55,190
The home shopping channel is selling black garlic extract for 29,900 won health restoration.

519
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,390
Do you want me to order yours, too?

520
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:58,420
Sure. Order for me, too.

521
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,980
But why do you sound like that?

522
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:05,200
Hye Jin, what's life?

523
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,530
Why must we continue to live in the midst of pain?

524
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:11,200
Why? What's wrong now?

525
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,180
What?

526
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,960

527
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,750
Ji Yeon, excuse me for a moment.

528
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,590
I have an important call.

529
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,020
Hye Jin.

530
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,270
What?

531
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:52,820

532
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:10,300
Gosh, I'm sorry. I had to get that call.

533
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,900
It's good here. Right?

534
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,740
Do you want to eat one more portion?

535
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,240
Shall we?

536
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,590
Excuse me.

537
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,720
 Next news.

538
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,830

A 37-year-old female, Goo,

539
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:31,010
 - was found dead in the Ganghwa Island ocean. 
 - Goo?

540
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:34,520
 Goo who got on a crab boat this morning...

541
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:53,150
Gosh...

542
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:56,940
Come on now...

543
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,130
Why are you banging your head here?

544
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,980
Are you a rocker?

545
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,510
Why are you here?

546
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:08,510
Well... I wanted to see the ocean... it's been a while.

547
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:11,560
I was also worried that you may be found as a corpse.

548
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,370
So, you ate all this, huh?

549
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,310
Did all that go into your tummy all at once?

550
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:19,320
What? Did you come to pick a fight?

551
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,590
Go sleep in my car.

552
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:26,220
Three more hours to go before the sun comes up.

553
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,680
Okay?

554
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:31,810
Let's go.

555
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:14,580
 I took 20,000 won from your wallet.

556
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:17,110
 Thanks, Jae Hoon.

557
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:23,410
I'll have to collect interest.

558
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,330
Whoa, it's nice.

559
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:45,720
It's a full load of crab.

560
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,920
 Thank you! Good work!

561
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,670
Thank you!

562
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,460
Good work! Thank you!

563
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,920
- Sang Woo, good work! 
 - Thank you!

564
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,320
Thank you.

565
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,420
Gosh, drink this.

566
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,290
Good work!

567
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:03,340
Good work. Please drink this.

568
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:07,570
Gosh, Captain! Congratulations on a full load of crabs.

569
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:10,110
Did you wait here alone without going home?

570
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:14,830
A PD can't abandon the location and the staff.

571
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:20,670
See you next time.

572
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,600
You filmed all night through. I'll drive.

573
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,210
No. I'm fine.

574
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:33,330
On a day like today with a blue sky,

575
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:36,640
I don't want to put my precious life in your hands.

576
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,140
Get in.

577
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,250
Did you sleep okay?

578
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:29,620
Yes.

579
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:35,720
Senior, thank you.

580
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,020
What for?

581
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,810
I'm learning a lot from you.

582
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:42,490
You were especially awesome this time around.

583
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:45,230
I didn't even get to go on the boat. You did everything.

584
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:46,340
What's so awesome about that?

585
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:50,230
If it were me, I'd be so pissed that I would've canceled everything.

586
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:54,220
But you held it all in and stayed on location through the night.

587
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:56,050
You're amazing.

588
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:00,740
Work is pretty tough, huh?

589
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:04,610
The seniors are always scolding you, and the work-life balance sucks.

590
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:09,650
You joined the company splendidly as a PD yet all you do is tough physical labor.

591
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:12,030
It's so rough, huh?

592
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:17,850
To be honest, I'm having a hard time.

593
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:25,930
Sang Woo, I'm really looking forward to

594
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:29,690
the program you'll create in a few years with your name on it.

595
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:33,910
Whenever I call your name on location, I rely on you.

596
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:38,790
I know you work hard on everything, and you do it well.

597
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:42,490
I'm saying I feel dependent on you, and I look forward to your work.

598
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:51,260
Can I... ask you something?

599
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:56,350
Are you happy about working at the variety show division?

600
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,410
Have you ever thought this before?

601
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:01,120
This spot that we're in right now.

602
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:05,210
For some, it's a dream that they couldn't obtain.

603
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:09,930
A PD at a TV station... is a very special career.

604
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:12,550
Even if you want it and desire it so desperately,

605
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:14,320
so many people are looking at our career

606
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:18,260
like looking at the stars in the sky because they weren't given a chance.

607
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:22,440
And... before this job became a part of my daily life,

608
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,420
I wanted it so desperately.

609
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:29,480
I'll mind my manners and have a sense of responsibility for the chance that was given to me.

610
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,840
One percent of the viewer rating represents 500,000 people.

611
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:37,750
For the 500,000 people who watch our program whom I'm grateful for,

612
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:40,510
I can get fired up.

613
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:42,030
Let's go.

614
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:04,540

615
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:40,490

That stupid mosquito!

616
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:49,190

617
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,430

618
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:10,050
Director, please give me one more time. Please?

619
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:12,610
I'm done talking to the higher-ups.

620
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:14,620
Last week's episode was your last.

621
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:17,720
Release the writers and contractors.

622
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,890
Submit the expenses.

623
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:32,260
Senior, are you okay?

624
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:34,740
I'll be fine...

625
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:37,080
How is everyone doing?

626
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:41,250
They're making calls here and there, looking for jobs...

627
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:43,680
It's not a good vibe at all.

628
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:47,210
I'm sorry.

629
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:48,920
We should've worked hard.

630
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,830
Why are you sorry?

631
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:54,760
It's my fault as the producer.

632
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,470
Set up a wrap-up party next week.

633
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:01,240
Well... everyone's waiting for you, Senior.

634
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,200
- Why me? 
 - It's your birthday.

635
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,610
Have a cake or something.

636
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:07,500
You haven't eaten all day.

637
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:11,870
How can we eat a cake when they just lost their meal ticket?

638
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:14,140
Sang Woo.

639
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:19,440
Take this and... buy drinks for people who want to go out and drink.

640
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,400
I'm off.

641
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:41,200
Your assistant PD you're working with. That Sang Woo. How is he?

642
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,710
Why do you ask?

643
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:44,590
Ramen Chef got canceled.

644
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:48,320
Sang Woo seems pretty good. I wanted to take him in for Kingdom of Love 2.

645
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:53,330
He's polite and sensible.

646
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:55,260
Okay. Then I'll put dibs on him.

647
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:57,610
You'll be taking a break for now anyway.

648
00:49:57,610 --> 00:49:59,110
No...

649
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:02,230
I wonder if the director will put you somewhere as a sub.

650
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:04,810
Stop sticking your nose into my next steps.

651
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:07,510
I'm sorry, but I'm not interested in what you do.

652
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:10,600
I'm interested in your assistant producer.

653
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,730
What happened to your face?

654
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:19,110
Crap.

655
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,180
What are you doing? It's your birthday.

656
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,730
 You don't even have any plans since you're an outcast these days, huh?

657
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:28,980
Gosh. Why did you call me?

658
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:33,530
Well, I was wondering if an alienated neighbor needs some compassion. Just calling to check.

659
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:37,430
On a blessed and plentiful day like today, I don't need your compassion.

660
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:38,740
Really?

661
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,330
Are you having a great party somewhere?

662
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:42,790
Yeah. Mind your own business.

663
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:47,570
What's with her?

664
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,440

665
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:08,800
Ji Yeon.

666
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,830
Jae Hoon.

667
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:13,190
You were surprised at my sudden call, huh?

668
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:15,240
Gosh, no. Well...

669
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,770
I did feel bad about something.

670
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:22,580
 Ji Yeon, I'm so sorry, but something urgent came up.

671
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,830
 I have to leave first. I'm so sorry.

672
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:28,770
 I'll treat you to dinner next time when you're free.

673
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:31,230
 I'm really sorry. All right then.

674
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:37,170
You can't leave me behind today.

675
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:40,180
Probably not. Yeah...

676
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,650

677
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:53,960

678
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,240
 Mom!

679
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:58,670
My daughter! It's your birthday. Did you eat some seaweed soup?

680
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:02,230
 How come I couldn't reach you all day?

681
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:05,170
I was busy all day, so I couldn't call you.

682
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:07,670
Daughter! Happy birthday!

683
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:09,710
Your mom and I went to the market today

684
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:13,360
and I bought beef ribs and all the fixings for fish patties.

685
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,230
 You'll come home this weekend, right?

686
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:17,860
Yeo Reum, I'll marinate the beef ribs

687
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:21,370

and make some squash pancakes and everything.

688
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:25,180
 Hey, don't set up a filming schedule this weekend. Be sure to come home.

689
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:27,540
 I really miss you!

690
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:31,590
 Just because you're working on a ramen program, you're not eating only ramen, are you?

691
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:37,000
 A person should always eat hearty meals.

692
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,100
I'm eating very well, so don't worry.

693
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:42,700
My daughter, I love you!

694
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:43,760
My Yeo Reum,

695
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,500
♪  Happy birthday to you!  ♪

696
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:55,000
Mom, you too...

697
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,410
You worked hard to give birth to me 37 years ago.

698
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,810
I love you, Mom and Dad!

699
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:03,770
I love you!

700
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:42,430

701
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:47,510

702
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:52,510

703
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:56,300

704
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:32,120

705
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:38,100
It's good, huh?

706
00:54:44,330 --> 00:54:49,420

707
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:54,500

708
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,380
Welcome.

709
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,630
One roll of tuna kimbap, please.

710
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:11,820
Okay.

711
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:14,480
Why do you like Klimt, Ji Yeon?

712
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,980
Klimt?

713
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:21,500
In a Klimt, you can see both loneliness and love in his paintings.

714
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:25,290
Klimt was quite a player...

715
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:48,690
- Ma'am. 
 - Thank you.

716
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:51,610
- Bye now. 
 - Thank you!

717
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:59,200
 At a certain point, a birthday became just one of those days.

718
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:05,940
 The 20th birthday was loud with lots of laughter, and it was special.

719
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:09,970
 But the 37th birthday wasn't too eventful.

720
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:14,790
 It became one of the days out of 365 days of the year.

721
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:21,210
 One of those days when my program was canceled.

722
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:27,160
 It was the day I secretly cried while talking to Mom and Dad on the phone.

723
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:32,130
 The day I ate tuna kimbap for dinner.

724
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,900
 I kept thinking "It's okay" and "I don't care."

725
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:41,100
 So what if it's an uneventful day?

726
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,460
 And all of a sudden,

727
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:53,070
 I wanted to feel butterflies in my stomach.

728
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:55,370
 I want to feel special.

729
00:56:56,260 --> 00:57:00,120
 At least one day out of 365 days of the year,

730
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:03,130
 I want to sparkle.

731
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,320
Yeo Reum.

732
00:57:52,530 --> 00:57:54,240
Yeo Reum.

733
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:57,170
Happy birthday.

734
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:03,390
I came back to Korea a few days ago.

735
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,810
I missed you.

736
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:14,550
What are you doing here?

737
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:16,700
Do you have a moment?

738
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:19,140
I want to say something to you.

739
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:23,110
I have nothing to say to you, Oppa.

740
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,680
Here.

741
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:31,080
It's from your favorite bakery.

742
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,320
It was still there.

743
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,500
Leave.

744
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:41,250
I'm not all that thrilled to see you.

745
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,990
I'll leave for now, but...

746
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:54,800
I'll be back.

747
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:10,020
In New York,

748
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:14,220
I missed Korea more on your birthday...

749
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:17,720
than on my birthday.

750
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:49,240
What's going on?

751
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:52,240
Why was that jerk here?

752
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,050
He wished me happy birthday.

753
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,450
Talk about pulling all the stops.

754
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:11,410
Let's go in.

755
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:28,760
He's got no taste, no taste. Gosh...

756
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:45,660
What came over you to buy me a cake?

757
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:47,590
You sounded like you were on your way to a fantastic party.

758
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:49,110
How come you're home so early?

759
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:50,230
Just open the wine bottle.

760
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:51,950
I'll put a candle on the cake.

761
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:54,100
Forget it! What candle? How embarrassing!

762
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:55,770
Don't.

763
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:09,890
Don't. Don't.

764
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:15,620
Hey, don't do this. Stop it.

765
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:17,700
You're embarrassing me.

766
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:19,580
- I can't look. 
 - Why not? Why can't you look?

767
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:21,750
 Look how cute I look.

768
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:24,370
 I'm embarrassed for you.

769
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:27,870
I'm embarrassed. Stop it!

770
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:30,380
- Come on! 
 - You're embarrassed?

771
01:01:35,310 --> 01:01:38,570
- Happy birthday. 
 - Thanks, Jae Hoon.

772
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:43,900
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

773
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,410
You make me laugh.

774
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:56,600
How did it feel? It's been a while.

775
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,810
Kim In Woo.

776
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:04,810
How did it feel seeing him after all this time?

777
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,400
Jae Hoon.

778
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:15,400
Today, the program I was working on got canceled.

779
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:21,910
Half of the staff who worked with me became jobless.

780
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:26,800
Are you okay?

781
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,200
I'm not okay.

782
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,780
By chance, if I ever got to meet him again,

783
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:38,530
I wanted to be more splendid.

784
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,810
Not on a day like today.

785
01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:45,180
On a day when I'm in a better place.

786
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:40,510
I'm telling you this just in case.

787
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:42,490
Don't try to get back together with Kim In Woo.

788
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:45,910
I wasn't really going to try...

789
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:47,470
but why are you telling me not to?

790
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:50,960
If you start dating, I have no one to play with.

791
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,620
- I'd be bored. 
 - Am I a bouncing ball that plays with you?

792
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:56,530
I'm a bouncing ball playing with you, too.

793
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:04,600
Kim In Woo...

794
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:08,140
He applied to work overseas without discussing it with you

795
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:10,850
and he notified you after it was decided.

796
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:13,370
His plan to live overseas for a few years after getting married

797
01:04:13,370 --> 01:04:17,510
was inconsiderate of your life and your career.

798
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:24,300
You're saying stuff like that for the first time.

799
01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:30,590
Well, unless a really good guy shows up,

800
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:34,330
just play with me until then.

801
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,790
What's that?

802
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:53,220
A mosquito tent.

803
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:57,610
Put that together with me when you have time later. Okay?

804
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:01,660
Where's the directions...

805
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:04,370
- Is this it? 
 - Let me see this.

806
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:07,630
- How do you do it? 
 - This...

807
01:05:07,630 --> 01:05:09,270
Here.

808
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:12,570
The bar that protrudes is male.

809
01:05:12,570 --> 01:05:14,380
The one with the hole is female.

810
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:17,010
Put the male bar into the female bar like this.

811
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:19,270
- And? 
 - Turn.

812
01:05:20,330 --> 01:05:21,320
Okay.

813
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:25,960
Put the male bar into the female bar hole and turn.

814
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,540
The bar...

815
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,470
Put it in.

816
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:34,700
Male... female...

817
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:37,470
Is it going in?

818
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:39,900
Female bar...

819
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:41,550
- Male bar... 
 - Female bar...

820
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:43,560
Male bar. Female bar.

821
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:44,820
Female, male bar...

822
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:47,540
 Female, male bar.

823
01:05:51,970 --> 01:05:54,040
Jae Hoon, not there.

824
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,180
Lift your leg.

825
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:57,290
You can put it in nicely.

826
01:05:57,290 --> 01:05:58,560
Wait, wait, wait!

827
01:05:58,560 --> 01:05:59,720
Wait. No, no, no...

828
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,200
Okay. Got it.

829
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,490
- Okay, okay. Okay, okay. 
 - Got it?

830
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:05,240
Okay...

831
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:10,480
Assembly is more complicated than I thought.

832
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,930
Thanks to you, I'll get a goodnight sleep tonight.

833
01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:15,080
Thank you!

834
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:18,500
- It's cozier than I expected. 
 - Right?

835
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:19,880
I should've gotten it a long time ago.

836
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:21,170
Did you catch the mosquito?

837
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:22,620
Not yet.

838
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:25,930
It bit your face and you let it live?

839
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:27,810
I have to see it to catch it.

840
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:31,890
Gosh, I bought an electric fly swatter to catch it. It's not here, though.

841
01:06:31,890 --> 01:06:33,520
What if it's in here by chance?

842
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,670
Don't get bitten all night. Check before you go to sleep.

843
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:37,350
All right.

844
01:07:26,990 --> 01:07:34,000

845
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:39,340
♫  What can make me flutter in the wind like this  ♫

846
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:44,320
♫  Carrying pink imaginations between the two of us  ♫

847
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:47,360
♫  I don't even blink  ♫

848
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:51,660
♫  I can't believe this feeling  ♫

849
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:59,810
♫  You gently blow into my bleak daily life  ♫

850
01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:05,430
♫  In the flow, something changed.  Oh stop it, no!  ♫

851
01:08:05,430 --> 01:08:08,580

852
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:10,600
 So? You hugged and then what happened after?

853
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,200
 Describe it in more detail.

854
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:16,130
 - It's been so long since someone gave me that look. 
 - What look?

855
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,570
 You're mine!

856
01:08:17,570 --> 01:08:19,330
 How is my son?

857
01:08:19,330 --> 01:08:20,710
 I really like you, Ji Yeon.

858
01:08:20,710 --> 01:08:23,330
 We're slowly getting to know each other.

859
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:25,280
 Jae Hoon and Yeo Reum aren't in a man-and-woman relationship.

860
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:26,890
 It's more like human-to-human.

861
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:29,280
 We should help them, so they get together.

862
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,600
 You let a man into your house at 1:00 a.m.?

863
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,910
 Yeo Reum, I'm still not over you.

864
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:36,900
♫  Wrap your body around me  ♫

865
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:40,200
♫  Even with your subtle breath, I feel dizzy  ♫
