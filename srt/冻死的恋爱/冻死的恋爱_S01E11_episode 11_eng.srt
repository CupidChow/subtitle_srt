00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:08,070

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,680

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,720
♫  Dive with you, towards the wide sea  ♫

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,060

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:24,120
♫  Jump in love, I fly with wings called you  ♫

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,120

♫  There is nothing to be afraid of  ♫

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,120
♫  In the world called you, it sparkles and lingers here  ♫

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:36,720
♫  What I found while wandering was you who 
 was always by my side  ♫

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,240
♫  I'm already ready for you  ♫

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,070

11
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,760

12
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,340
 - Who is it? 
 - Me!

13
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:09,060
 What? Your shoe size is 39, right?

14
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,780
 Yeah, why?

15
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,480
 How about these?

16
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,400
 Well... not bad.

17
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,970
 Want to buy them?

18
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,510
 Where did you get them? They're a limited edition

19
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,290
 I went through so much trouble buying them.

20
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,910
 But I bought the wrong size.

21
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:33,670
 I'll especially sell them to you at the price of...

22
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,300
 235,000 won.

23
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,110
 Just exchange them to your size.

24
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,960
 These were really hard to get. My size is already sold out.

25
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,840
 You can sell these at a premium price.

26
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,860
 Fine, I'll try them on.

27
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,240
 It fits well. It's perfect!

28
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,010
 100,000 won!

29
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,560
 You're crazy, you're crazy.

30
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,110
 You should be reasonable in your offer.

31
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,030
 - 150,000 won? 
 - Forget it. Give it to me.

32
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,640
 Gosh! All right.

33
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,580
 This is a limited edition?

34
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,620
 Do you know how much the resale price is?

35
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,220
 How much is it?

36
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,060
 This conversation isn't going smoothly.

37
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,900
 If you're not going to buy them, take it off. It's going to smell.

38
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,220
 If it smells, I can't sell them.

39
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,630
 - Just take it off. Give it to me. 
 - Hey, hold on. Hold on.

40
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,290
 Okay, deal. I'll buy them.

41
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,190
 You must like them, huh?

42
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,330
 Well, I guess.

43
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,110
 They're okay.

44
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,460
 Man, I really shouldn't sell them for so cheap.

45
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,160
 Hey, the negotiation is over.

46
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,530
 Come on, stop being so clingy!

47
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,520
 I'll wire you the money right away.

48
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,520
 - You can just keep them. 
 - What?

49
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,520
 Now that I think about it, it was your birthday recently.

50
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,900
 Just keep them.

51
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,640
 I'm leaving.

52
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,140
 Hey, Park Jae Hoon!

53
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,380
 - What? 
 - You...

54
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,440
 bought these for my birthday, but they arrived late, huh?

55
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,630
 I said I bought the wrong size.

56
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,960
 Hey! I absolutely love them!

57
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,890
 Thank you!

58
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,820
 Yay!

59
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,740

60
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,350

61
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,080
- Hee Chang. 
 - Yes?

62
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,890
Pack all of the equipment and return to the Kingdom with the cast first.

63
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,930
What about you, Senior? I'll collect the stationary cameras inside and be right behind you.

64
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,300
No, I'll collect them.

65
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,740
No, it's fine.

66
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,760
We need to move the large equipment first.

67
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,410
- Are you sure you're fine? 
 - Yeah. I'm fine.

68
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,400
Well, Senior, at least take a raincoat.

69
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,420
- It's really coming down. 
 - It's okay.

70
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,290
- Move quickly. Hurry, hurry, hurry! 
 - Got it.

71
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,230

72
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,320

73
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,510
Gosh.

74
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,060
It's coming down so fiercely.

75
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,170
Wipe yourself with this.

76
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,230
- You go ahead. 
 - I'm fine.

77
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,100
Go on and wipe off.

78
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,010
Thank you.

79
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,890
Is there a hole in the sky?

80
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:27,210
It's so cold.

81
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,460
What should we do?

82
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,480
You might catch a cold if we're not careful.

83
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,250
Right?

84
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,630
If you're okay with it, I can give...

85
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,520
give you a small hug like this.

86
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,000
Oh, you don't have to...

87
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,990
But... it's warm.

88
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,210
I'm a human heater.

89
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,210
Mister! Please turn off the air conditioner.

90
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,970
It's fucking cold.

91
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,320
Everyone's here, right?

92
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,760
We'll head to the Kingdom now.

93
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,540
Excuse me, Producer.

94
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,640
I don't see PD Goo Yeo Reum.

95
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,900
Senior said she'll pack the cameras and come later.

96
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,000
By herself?

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,060
Yes, she's going to ride the staff bus and come separately.

98
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,520
Ji Yeon, I'm really sorry.

99
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,520
You go ahead.

100
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,310
Producer, I left something behind.

101
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,390
I'm going to go back.

102
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,240
Hey, wait a minute.

103
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,340
Jae Hoon. Jae Hoon!

104
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,130
Goo Yeo Reum!

105
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,430
- Jae Hoon... 
 - Stay there.

106
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,100
Hey!

107
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,500
♫  On this long winding road  ♫

108
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,640
Hey, you...

109
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,200
♫  There's a trace of kindness that came and went  ♫

110
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,900
♫  There's a trace of kindness that came and went  ♫

111
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:42,720
♫  A smile you take for granted  ♫

112
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:49,670
♫  And the today and tomorrow that I've been looking forward to  ♫

113
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:55,600
♫  I become saddened all by myself  ♫

114
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:04,200
♫  Sitting on two swings that are side by side  ♫

115
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,330
♫  Even if I love you in my excitement  ♫

116
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:16,170
♫  I'm still in the same spot like this  ♫

117
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:20,230
♫  Saying it's okay  ♫

118
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:27,140
♫  This is what I tell myself as a wish  ♫

119
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:32,450
♫  But that's just what I want to hear from you  ♫

120
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:44,100
♫  Or probably just telling myself as I endure  ♫

121
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,940
Gosh, wipe yourselves with this.

122
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,870
Thank you.

123
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,540
Thanks for today.

124
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:11,800
Don't get me wrong. I came as a friend.

125
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,660
I didn't mean anything else by it.

126
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,260
Yeah.

127
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,570
I'm also thanking you as a friend.

128
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:33,870
Must you... always do it yourself when there are so many other staff members?

129
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,460
I'm the one in charge.

130
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,280
In this rain, without any backup...

131
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,600
I know it's your job, but it's dangerous.

132
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,450
There weren't even any streetlights.

133
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,960
- It's reckless. 
 - Exactly.

134
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,610
That's why I should do it instead of ordering someone else to do it.

135
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,370

136
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,780
Look at the shrimp. They're huge!

137
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,430
These are really big.

138
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,240
Everyone did great today, so shall we raise our glasses?

139
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,230
- Shall we? 
 - Shall we?

140
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:28,180
- Good job! 
 - Yes, good job.

141
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,140
How was the haunted house experience?

142
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:39,590
Hwang Jang Goon was totally all over Soo Mi.

143
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,820
I did want to get to know her all this time.

144
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,810
Your physical closeness was quite extreme.

145
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,760
You were also stuck on Jang Tae Mi's side.

146
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,970
I thought you guys were Siamese twins.

147
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,640
What did you say? Shitese twins? 
  (T/N: Similar sound)

148
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,880
What's that?

149
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,770
Whoa, whoa!  Let's not fight amongst ourselves.

150
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,280
- That's right. 
 - Why fight?

151
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,520
This is where we can be open and get to know anyone we want to.

152
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,100
That's what I also think. But he suddenly got angry.

153
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,000
Calm down, calm down. Okay?

154
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,340
But what are Shitese twins?

155
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,150
A type of twin.

156
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,360
Twins who are conjoined...

157
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,700
Are you sure?

158
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,410
I think he was cursing.

159
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,370
It's not profanity.

160
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,050
By the way, what was with Park Jae Hoon earlier?

161
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,850
Does he have something going on with PD Goo Yeo Reum?

162
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,220
I think he went to go get her.

163
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,510
That's a bit weird,huh?

164
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,620
- All that trouble? To go back there? 
 - I know!

165
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,740
Han Ji Yeon had a totally crappy look on her face earlier.

166
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,600
They're... high school friends.

167
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,750
Really? Friends?

168
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,950
I'm aware that Jae Hoon joined this program because of PD Goo.

169
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:54,540
What the? Is it friend chance or something?

170
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:59,320
And where might our bro John get that kind of top intel?

171
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,850
You should be friendly with the staff.

172
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,540
You might get some special treatment.

173
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,830
That's how I happened to find out.

174
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,030
But if you consider Ji Yeon,

175
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,060
he shouldn't have done that even if they're friends, no?

176
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,460
Exactly!

177
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,920
All that trouble to go back.

178
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,040
Don't you guys have any female friends?

179
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,450
You're all overreacting.

180
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,140
What's this?

181
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,530
Why is he taking sides? I know.

182
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,240
What's going on?

183
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,410
Me? When?

184
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,270
I'm not someone who takes sides.

185
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,010
Hurry up and eat.

186
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,030
- You're suspicious. 
 - Eat up.

187
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,310
Thank you.

188
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,840
Go in.

189
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,230
Okay. You get some rest, too.

190
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:08,040
What a load of bullshit. Fuck.

191
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,810
Fuck!

192
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:25,250
They're all bullshitting, those bastards.

193
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:34,770

194
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:39,240
Okay, everyone's pathway at first is going to be

195
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,940
right here. Right here. Here.

196
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,180
Please set up the cameras around here.

197
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,960
Yes, here. The cast is on standby, right?

198
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,290
Yes?

199
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,910

200
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,140
Good morning.

201
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,130
Yes...

202
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,770
What brings you to my room?

203
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:08,460
I usually don't stick my nose where it doesn't belong,

204
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,920
but it kept bothering me.

205
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,730
This.

206
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,630
What is this?

207
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,040
What do you mean?

208
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,170
It's the string that you severed before you left last night.

209
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,970
Did you know people on the internet

210
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,040
call you superior Jae Hoon, inferior Ji Yeon?

211
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,190
Superior Jae Hoon... Inferior Ji Yeon?

212
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,660
You're superior, and Ji Yeon is inferior.

213
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,730
Just because Han Ji Yeon likes you more,

214
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:40,010
she's getting ridiculed online.

215
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,970
I had no idea about that.

216
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,180
That string...

217
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,060
Everyone severed it as soon as we got back to our rooms.

218
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:54,600
But... it holds a different meaning when the man severs it one-sidedly.

219
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,450
Women get hurt, Superior Jae Hoon.

220
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,530
I happened to come across her last night.

221
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:06,400
Han Ji Yeon was crying a lot by herself.

222
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,720
I grabbed it out of the trash,

223
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,180
and it's up to you whether you officially sever it again or not.

224
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:20,640
Whether you explain to her why you left her behind or not.

225
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,630
Stay still.

226
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,630
We'll start filming now!

227
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,990
I'm going to mark the slate!

228
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,260
One, two, three!

229
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,810
The male cast will ask the female cast out on a date today.

230
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,980
When the female cast member you want to date passes by,

231
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,940
you just need to walk along with her.

232
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,890
The female cast can move to the top of the stairs!

233
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,960
We'll begin the selection!

234
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,960
Han So Yeon, please head down!

235
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:39,600
Park Ji Wan, please head down!

236
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,830
Shall we go?

237
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,990
It's as I predicted.

238
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,660
They look so good together.

239
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:09,900
Jang Tae Mi, please head down!

240
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,950
Geum Soo Mi, please head down!

241
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,030
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

242
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,570
Han Ji Yeon, please head down!

243
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,580
Ji Yeon.

244
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,740
- Do you like macarons? 
 - Yes.

245
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,180
I know a place that bakes really great macarons.

246
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,280
What do you want to eat today?

247
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,180
How about gnocchi? What you made me was really delicious.

248
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,540
I don't have potatoes today.

249
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,540
- It's hot, isn't it? 
 - Yes.

250
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,650
The sun's shining down from here. What use is it to shade her from there? Do this.

251
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:48,480
- Soo Mi, I'll shade you— 
 - There's a fly here.

252
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,050
I think we can see the big picture. Right?

253
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:05,370
It's only fun with variants.

254
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:09,620
We even added a random date, but they won't mix.

255
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,970
Gosh...

256
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,420
Why are they all so obvious? So boring.

257
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,560
We can just add another random date next time.

258
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,800
I don't think that will be enough to shake things up.

259
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:24,600
Then...

260
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,700
shall we release some gossip, so they can yank on each other's hair?

261
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,180
We can tell the kids to do so. Do it subtly.

262
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,080
We did that in Season 1.

263
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,880
We need to bring in something new.

264
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,880
Should we rile up Han So Yeon?

265
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,400
Let's not mess with her.

266
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,960
Why not?

267
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,390
She said during her interview that she was treated for bipolar disorder.

268
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:56,680
That's why I chose her. So she can cause trouble.

269
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,950
That's true, but not now.

270
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,640
I think now is the perfect time to rile her up, though.

271
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,930
No.

272
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,230
Look at her expression.

273
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,830
She's scary. Don't mess with her.

274
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,700
Excuse me, Writer!

275
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,210
Yes?

276
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:30,680
I don't see PD Sang Woo these days.

277
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,740
Is anything wrong?

278
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,800
You see...

279
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,370
PD Kim Sang Woo can't come to the location for now.

280
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,800
Why?

281
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,460
- Is he sick? 
 - No.

282
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,030
That's not it...

283
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,830
Well, actually...

284
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,820

285
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:01,750

286
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,910
Yes?

287
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,950
Yes, hello, Park Ji Wan.

288
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:08,970
How can I help you?

289
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:11,480
I'm sorry, PD Kim.

290
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,200
What? For what?

291
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,820
I heard...

292
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,530
that you tried to stop...

293
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:22,280
what I said from being broadcasted,

294
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,970
 and got scolded

295
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:27,400
and was even banned from coming to the location.

296
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,540
I'm really sorry.

297
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,250
There's no reason for you to apologize.

298
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,060
This is my job,

299
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:37,540
and I'm just taking responsibility for my judgment.

300
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,540
You absolutely don't need to be sorry.

301
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,040
Thank you...

302
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,270
PD Kim.

303
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:48,770
More than me, Senior Goo Yeo Reum is really looking out for you.

304
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:51,010
 She said she wants to show the viewers

305
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:55,120
what a good person you are.

306
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:02,490
Please arrange this for Soo Mi.

307
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:05,430
Since it's a love triangle.

308
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,700
Do you want to go?

309
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,480
We should.

310
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,730
Yeah. I think that's fine.

311
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,210
Okay.

312
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,040

Drink! Drink!

313
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,060
Welcome.

314
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,920
- One black, please. 
 - Okay.

315
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,440
It's 4,500 won.

316
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,780
Is this...

317
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,510
fun?

318
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,350
Is a program like this fun?

319
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,840
Sorry?

320
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,530
Is a trashy program like this fun for you?

321
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:05,210
I-I'm sorry.

322
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,160
Please go first.

323
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,850
PD Goo!

324
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,120
Yes.

325
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,060
If you have time, can we talk?

326
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,440
There's something I need to tell you.

327
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,790
What is it you want to say?

328
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,620
Well...

329
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:57,190
I want to apologize.

330
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,760
I'm sorry for mistreating you...

331
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,050
back then.

332
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:05,210
Why all of a sudden?

333
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,750
When "Ramen Chef" was at its high,

334
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:12,050
I came out on TV and people recognized me,

335
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:15,710
so I must've turned arrogant with no regard for anything else.

336
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:20,060
But after coming here and spending each day with you,

337
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:23,900
I realized you're a very good person.

338
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,520
You have a great sense of responsibility and are very considerate.

339
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,370
I don't have other intentions.

340
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:33,630
Really, as I said...

341
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:37,710
I recently started thinking I should apologize to you.

342
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,900
And well, perhaps,

343
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,240
I think you could've been the best woman I had flirted with

344
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,230
and realized I have very poor taste in women...

345
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,400
What's this? You're embarrassing me.

346
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,930
We could at least say hi from now on, right?

347
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,500
You've been ignoring me all this time.

348
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,320
Sure.

349
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,480
Let's at least greet each other from now on.

350
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,850
Okay.

351
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,160
Then I'll get going.

352
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,070
Chef John.

353
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,310
Thank you for saying that.

354
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:34,340
My pleasure. Yeah.

355
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:07,130
Who is it?

356
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,800
What were you doing?

357
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,470
I was just taking a break.

358
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,950
I came to see if you're doing okay.

359
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,010
Oh, I see.

360
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,160
I'm okay.

361
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,370
Are you really okay?

362
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:30,320
You couldn't get selected even once and couldn't go on a single date.

363
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,540
If it were me, I would go crazy with humiliation.

364
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:39,550
I'm... really okay.

365
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,540
Is there a male cast member you're interested in?

366
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,420
It's okay to poke around here and there.

367
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:49,410
The love line hasn't been finalized yet.

368
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,370
You're trying to have people badmouth me, aren't you?

369
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,430
Trying to get me to hit on the guys.

370
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,840
Isn't that better than being a wallflower?

371
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,660
If it were me...

372
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:04,200
I would choose to be a villain rather than a nameless side character.

373
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,440
Or you can continue with no presence.

374
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,270
The decision is up to you.

375
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,920
Ji Yeon.

376
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,850
Thank you.

377
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:01,300
Ji Yeon,

378
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:07,670
I'm very sorry for leaving like that... last night.

379
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,710
It's okay.

380
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,760
You don't need to speak any more about last night.

381
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,800
There's a camera, too.

382
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,630
Okay.

383
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,030
Ji Yeon, what would you like to drink?

384
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,650
Isn't that Superior Jae Hoon and Inferior Ji Yeon?

385
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:07,590
It is them! Whoa, amazing!

386
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,140
I'll get fruit juice.

387
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:17,180
I'll get a hot Americano.

388
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,040
Hey, look.

389
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,100
I got a good shot.

390
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:40,280
When I went off the grid, thank you for coming to find me.

391
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,590
I never properly thanked you.

392
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:47,360
I didn't... believe in the malpractice rumors.

393
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,230
Why didn't you?

394
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:51,250
It could've been true.

395
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:56,310
Oddly... I wanted to trust you.

396
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,880
You know what they say.

397
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,690
Liking someone means...

398
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:06,950
trusting that they possess a kind heart.

399
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,560
I guess...

400
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,150
I just wanted to believe you.

401
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,100
How did you hurt your hand?

402
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:24,100
Oh, during the haunted house date.

403
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,680
Let me see.

404
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,110
The wound is pretty deep.

405
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:29,880
Oh, it's fine. It'll heal with time.

406
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,390
No, give me a second. I'll go to the pharmacy.

407
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:34,900
Oh, I'm really fine.

408
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,760
No, the wound is open. How can you be fine?

409
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,610
Stay here for a sec.

410
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,530
Hey, this is amazing!

411
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:52,240
Superior Jae Hoon and Inferior Ji Yeon are on a date right now.

412
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,520
What are they like in person? Hey!

413
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,910
Inferior Ji Yeon is totally bending over backward for him.

414
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,310
For real! For real, yes!

415
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,500
She must not have any pride.

416
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,470
I wouldn't be able to do that.

417
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,250
You, too? Yeah.

418
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,290
Anyway, hurry up and get over here.

419
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:17,020
Ji Yeon, get up.

420
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,650
- Come with me. 
 - What?

421
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:21,140
I don't want to make you wait by yourself.

422
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,040
Come with me to the pharmacy.

423
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,270
 How are you with your parents?

424
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:34,100
 Me? Well, I really don't listen to them.

425
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:37,390
 - Oh, really? 
 - Yeah, do you have a good relationship?

426
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:38,570
 Me?

427
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:42,390
 It's been a while since I buried my younger sister... in my mind.

428
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:45,710
 - Why, why? 
 - I don't see her as a human being.

429
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,920
 - Why? 
 - Even this morning...

430
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,170
It'll scar.

431
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:06,020
It's fine.

432
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,810
You shouldn't leave a scar on your hand.

433
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,930
It doesn't hurt?

434
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:13,050
It's tolerable.

435
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,550
Are you usually good at tolerating things?

436
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:33,940
My wound?

437
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,280
It heals well, even if I leave it alone.

438
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,910
My regeneration skills are better than you think.

439
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,660
Did you know people look at us

440
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,510
and call us Superior Jae Hoon and Inferior Ji Yeon?

441
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,940
- Yes. 
 - It doesn't bother you?

442
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,430
It's true, though.

443
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:19,500
I like you more, so I am inferior.

444
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,470
- Ji Yeon... 
 - Must you...

445
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:25,040
kill me twice with that?

446
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:32,420
You could just act like you don't know.

447
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,970
Saying it to my face...

448
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:39,180
Hearing it directly from you...

449
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,560
does hurt a bit.

450
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:07,660
Did you know people look at us and call us Superior Jae Hoon and Inferior Ji Yeon?

451
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,050
- Yes. 
 - It doesn't bother you?

452
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,270
It's true, though.

453
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,820
I don't like it.

454
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:19,440
I wish you were the superior one.

455
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,530
Thank you for liking me first.

456
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:25,200
But from now on, I'll like you more.

457
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,930
Lovely view here, isn't it?

458
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:03,070
Yes, it's nice.

459
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,230
Oh, try the macarons, too. They're delicious.

460
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,660
Okay.

461
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,720
By the way...

462
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,720
Yes.

463
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:35,020
Joon Ho... what do you like about me?

464
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,770
Why do you ask, all of a sudden?

465
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:42,770
I get curious once in a while,

466
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:47,540
why an attractive man like you is being nice to me.

467
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:51,500
Well, I think you're...

468
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,900
overall a bit...

469
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:00,180
I like almost everything about you.

470
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,130
Okay.

471
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,900
Oh, but... um...

472
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,040
sometimes I get upset because of you.

473
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,720
Why?

474
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,360
You're still having trouble opening your heart to me.

475
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,250
Does it seem like I can't open up to you?

476
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,980
Yes.

477
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:32,420
I think you're... scared of men.

478
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,030
What?

479
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,440
Ji Wan,

480
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,610
I'll be honest with you.

481
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:44,380
You know how you told me last time that as a child...

482
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:48,720
you were sexually harassed.

483
00:39:56,830 --> 00:40:00,340
I think you're scared of men because of that,

484
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,470
and that's why you can't open up to me, either.

485
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:07,020
That's absolutely not true. It's really not!

486
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,640
But that's how I feel.

487
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:15,260
If I... upset you...

488
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:18,470
in any way...

489
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:20,170
that's...

490
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:25,020
because I've never been in a relationship...

491
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:29,170
and don't know how to express my feelings.

492
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:32,720
I've never thought of you...

493
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:39,060
as a bad person because of my...

494
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:44,230
personal history... or trauma of being...

495
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,300
sexually harassed.

496
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,210
All right.

497
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:58,100
Ji Wan, I must've misunderstood you.

498
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,130
I'm sorry.

499
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:02,120
I'm really sorry.

500
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,890
Unni, it's me.

501
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,950
Things got hot over here.

502
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,670
What did you say?

503
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,500
Really?

504
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,760
O-Okay. Hang up.

505
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:35,420
Yes, Writer.

506
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:47,290
Please send the film tape to the editing room as soon as possible.

507
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:51,030
- The food is here. 
 - Thank you.

508
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:53,850
- Thank you. 
 - Enjoy.

509
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,150
Yeo Reum!

510
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,170
Hey, what brings you here without any notice?

511
00:41:58,170 --> 00:41:59,840
I'm suddenly craving soju.

512
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,340
What?

513
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,560
Have a seat.

514
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,510
Honey! Yeo Reum is here.

515
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:09,560
- Oh, Yeo Reum is here? 
 - Yeah.

516
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,140
- Gosh. You want me to stir up some pig feet? 
 - Yeah. Extremely spicy.

517
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:15,190
Okay, I'll stir some up to set your butthole on fire!

518
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,990
Let's go!

519
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,920
But what's with your expression?

520
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,470
Is something wrong?

521
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:26,470
I just... feel weird.

522
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:28,320
You feel weird?

523
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,470
How is it weird? What's weird?

524
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:35,660
I just want to eat something really spicy and make my nose run.

525
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,510
That kind of weird.

526
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:12,330
Whoa, this one's really fun. Let's watch this for now.

527
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,710
- This is fun? 
 - Yeah.

528
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:17,470
Ours airs after this one, anyway.

529
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:22,090
Huh? Only 10 minutes left until our broadcast.

530
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:23,590
Should I bring more beer?

531
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:25,250
Sounds good.

532
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,290
- Hey, Jae Hoon. 
 - Yes.

533
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:39,140
Before the broadcast starts, can we talk for a moment?

534
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,740
Sure. Right now?

535
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:50,300
Shouldn't it disappear?

536
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,230
Why did you do that earlier?

537
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:57,920
Do what?

538
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,440
What you said in front of the camera.

539
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:04,280
I was really touched,

540
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,060
but it was unlike you.

541
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:14,210
What you said to me was more passionate than our actual relationship.

542
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:19,400
I didn't like that you heard those things from people.

543
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:22,770
Someone as great as you...

544
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:27,400
calling you inferior when it doesn't even ring true at all.

545
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,680
I think it was quite... insulting.

546
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:36,330
I said so before, but it's true.

547
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:41,040
I don't like you... as much as you like me.

548
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:45,910
But at least... in front of the camera,

549
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:48,010
I want to protect you.

550
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:54,820
I don't want you to hear those things from people who don't even know you.

551
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:57,490
That's the temperature of my heart right now.

552
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:10,560
Shall we head in?

553
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,920
Thank you! Come again.

554
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,020
- Take care. 
 - Okay.

555
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:16,690
Thank you! Come again!

556
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:20,090
Ta-da.

557
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:28,950
Hey, Goo Yeo Reum.

558
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:30,960
You should've come with Jae Hoon. Why did you come alone?

559
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,360
He's at the location.

560
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,060
I see.

561
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,630
Jae Hoon and Han Ji Yeon?

562
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:40,140
They really seem to be hitting it off. Right, Yeo Reum?

563
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,380
Yeah.

564
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,220
It seems like she really likes our Jae Hoon.

565
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:50,880
She has great taste in men. Right, Goo Yeo Reum?

566
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,530
I said, stop it.

567
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:57,210
(Stop.)

568
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,950
The show's starting.

569
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:02,450
Gosh. Our Hye Jin never misses an episode each week.

570
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:05,380
She's Kingdom's true fan.

571
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:09,970

572
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:21,480
Jae Hoon and Ji Yeon are really destined for each other!

573
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,900
Soo Mi, we came out nicely, too.

574
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,160
- Oh, really? 
 - Yes.

575
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,110
- Another glass? 
 - Sure.

576
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:29,100
Us, too. Raise our glasses.

577
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,530
- Me, too. 
 - Yes, yes.

578
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:41,480
Damn, just thinking about that time gets me f***ing scared.

579
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:44,430
I almost peed that time. Whoa!

580
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:47,820
Hoon, your language got rougher these days.

581
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:50,940
Hoon, you really played ice hockey. Right?

582
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:53,470
National player.

583
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,050

584
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,590

585
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:02,760
 - Scared me.  
 - I asked them to edit this out.

586
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,970
 Oh, my!

587
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,740
 Are you okay?

588
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:30,620
 I think you're...

589
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:33,100
 scared of men.

590
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,390
 What?

591
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:36,030
 I'll be honest with you.

592
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:39,890
 You know how you told me last time, that as a child...

593
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:42,740
 you were sexually harassed?

594
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:48,150
Yeo Reum, was Park Ji Wan really sexually harassed as a child?

595
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:50,820
Wow, your show is hardcore.

596
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:53,440
Can you open up about things like that?

597
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:58,090
Hye Jin. Dae Shik. I'm going to get going.

598
00:47:58,090 --> 00:47:59,650
Okay.

599
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:01,060
Oh, okay.

600
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:04,180
 Because I've never been in a relationship

601
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:07,500
 and don't know how to express my feelings,

602
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:11,010
 I've never thought of you...

603
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:16,010
 as a bad person because of my... personal history...

604
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:19,060
 or trauma of being...

605
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:23,200
 sexually harassed.

606
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:27,490
J-Ji Wan!

607
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:29,150
Ji Wan!

608
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,950
What should we do about this...?

609
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:37,170
This is so shocking.

610
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:40,700
Can something like that be aired?

611
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:43,160
it's unbelievable.

612
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,780
I think there will be tons of articles.

613
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:50,370
Ji Wan!

614
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:52,960
Ji Wan, hold on. Ji Wan.

615
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,770
Ji Wan, are you okay?

616
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,020
I didn't think they would broadcast that.

617
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:08,020
They edited it out last time, so I thought they would do the same this time.

618
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,310
I...

619
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:14,660
want to be alone for a moment.

620
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:37,800
 ...or trauma of being sexually harrassed.

621
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:51,650
 Ji Wan, I'm sorry I misunderstood.

622
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:05,520

623
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,780
Please take me to this address.

624
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:15,380
Okay.

625
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:28,610

626
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:43,300

627
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:48,080

628
00:50:54,370 --> 00:50:56,450
Kim Sang Woo, what brings you here?

629
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:58,230
Oh, well...

630
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:03,910
Senior Hee Chang left the company card at the office so I brought it back.

631
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:05,400
Put it there and leave.

632
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,980
Okay.

633
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:18,680
Senior Kang Chae Ri...

634
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,280
Why?

635
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,560
I wanted to apologize to you formally.

636
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,200
What difference does it make now?

637
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:30,570
All authority regarding editing is on you, the producer.

638
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:32,530
I overstepped my boundary.

639
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:35,400
Also, the film is the company's property...

640
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:40,900
so I really believe I'm wrong for having deleted it without permission.

641
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:44,120
- However... 
 - However?

642
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:49,070
I lost all desire to apologize after watching today's episode.

643
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:50,810
Are you making fun of me right now?

644
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:56,910
It's something I tried so hard to prevent so I felt empty.

645
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:51,740
- Kim Sang Woo, you should return to the scene. 
 - Sorry?

646
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:55,920
Try it yourself, so I can see what a great and eloquent

647
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,300
show you're trying to make.

648
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:00,590
I've got to see with my own eyes because you're so arrogant.

649
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:34,810

650
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,300
You can leave.

651
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,900
Okay.

652
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,810
Who are you?

653
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:12,410
- Senior... 
 - Why?

654
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:40,650
Did you guys make this trashy program? Did you?

655
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:42,710
Where is the cast?

656
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:44,430
Where did you hide them?

657
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:46,660
Excuse me, sir. I don't know why you're doing this,

658
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:49,740
- but please calm down first— 
 - Please...

659
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:53,650
put that knife down.

660
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:55,730
I'm going to call the police.

661
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:58,220
C-Call the p-police?

662
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:00,240
You fuckers!

663
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,120
Come here!

664
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,590
Move aside.

665
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:06,700
Hey...

666
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,530
Come here!

667
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:09,680
Senior, please get out first!

668
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,590
Let me go!

669
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:53,020

670
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:55,750
This is seriously nuts.

671
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,570
Sir, I'll get off here.

672
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:31,290
Jae Hoon.

673
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,580
Give me back my life.

674
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:39,710
Stay still!

675
00:56:58,110 --> 00:56:59,440
Senio...

676
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,600
Sang Woo, you!

677
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:04,710
Are you okay? Huh?

678
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,140
I mean...

679
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:11,490
What in the world...

680
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:13,600
Sang Woo.

681
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:57,970

682
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:03,030
♫  Saying it's okay  ♫

683
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:09,900
♫  This is what I tell myself as a wish  ♫

684
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:15,210
♫  But that's just what I want to hear from you  ♫

685
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:26,360
♫  Or probably just telling myself as I endure  ♫

686
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:33,320
♫  I wanted to believe at least once  ♫

687
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:40,170
♫  The word forever hurts  ♫

688
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:43,430
♫  I love you with all my heart  ♫

689
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:46,380

690
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:49,710
 Didn't I tell you to do thorough background checks on the cast members?

691
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:51,150
 Brandishing a knife on location?

692
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:54,630
 Did you ever regret joining "Kingdom of Love"?

693
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:56,900
 - Direct it for early termination. 
 - I'm not doing that.

694
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,960
 Even the company's severely impacted, not just you!

695
00:58:58,960 --> 00:58:59,940
 I heard you were aware of this.

696
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:01,480
 What's your reason for allowing him to appear on the show?

697
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,310
 I'm going to resolve things my way.

698
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:05,140
 You were really shocked, too. Are you okay?

699
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:06,870
 I don't know why I'm like this.

700
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:09,860
 I can't control my feelings.

701
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:13,620
 My heart hurts so much because of you.

702
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:17,570
♫  I dream again  ♫
