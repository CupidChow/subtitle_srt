00:07:27,078 --> 00:07:27,837
Rest assured, Young Master.

(Consciousness)

169
00:07:32,758 --> 00:07:34,078
Master Ma, this is your first time here
in Lingzhou City.

170
00:07:34,717 --> 00:07:37,078
Matchmaker Liu tried so hard
to find you.

171
00:07:37,997 --> 00:07:40,677
You must've not known
about my historical ties with Miao.

172
00:07:41,517 --> 00:07:43,038
I'm all ears.

173
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:43,638
Pei Yanzhen.

174
00:07:43,638 --> 00:07:45,038
What a strong wind.

175
00:07:49,237 --> 00:07:50,957
It has opened the door.

176
00:07:52,837 --> 00:07:54,277
Aren't these Miaomiao and Official Pei?

177
00:07:54,997 --> 00:07:56,957
As the saying goes, it's a small world.

178
00:07:57,437 --> 00:07:58,158
The strong wind

179
00:07:58,318 --> 00:08:00,717
has actually brought
the three of us here.

180
00:08:01,237 --> 00:08:02,397
Master Song must've got work to do.

181
00:08:02,957 --> 00:08:04,158
Why don't we leave first?

182
00:08:04,397 --> 00:08:05,557
Even Official Pei has time for this.

183
00:08:05,717 --> 00:08:06,758
I'm just an idle man,

184
00:08:06,758 --> 00:08:08,557
I should join in the fun.

185
00:08:18,358 --> 00:08:19,397
Madam Liu!

186
00:08:19,997 --> 00:08:21,038
Come with me, Miaomiao.

187
00:08:23,117 --> 00:08:23,598
I...

188
00:08:30,437 --> 00:08:32,078
Will you stop?

189
00:08:34,517 --> 00:08:35,158
Miss Shen?

190
00:08:35,717 --> 00:08:37,238
Who is this?

191
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:41,438
I'm Song Xiyuan.

192
00:08:41,998 --> 00:08:42,957
Third Master Song?

193
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:44,957
Seven out of ten stores belong
to Shen family,

194
00:08:45,397 --> 00:08:46,358
while Song family owns the rest.

195
00:08:47,197 --> 00:08:49,397
It's so lucky of me.

196
00:08:49,397 --> 00:08:51,517
That I can meet the three of you today.

197
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:52,397
You're too polite.

198
00:08:52,397 --> 00:08:52,957
Let me ask you.

199
00:08:53,678 --> 00:08:54,637
You're the organizer,

200
00:08:54,637 --> 00:08:56,837
why did you only invite Official Pei?

201
00:08:57,798 --> 00:08:59,358
We're Miaomiao's ex-husbands.

202
00:08:59,678 --> 00:09:01,158
Why is Official Pei
on the invitation list?

203
00:09:01,558 --> 00:09:03,598
But I'm excluded?

204
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:04,397
Ex-husbands?

205
00:09:06,118 --> 00:09:07,837
Isn't Official Pei her uncle?

206
00:09:08,077 --> 00:09:08,798
Uncle?

207
00:09:10,957 --> 00:09:12,317
I didn't expect that with a meal,

208
00:09:12,358 --> 00:09:13,998
they've become so close.

209
00:09:14,197 --> 00:09:14,957
As such,

210
00:09:15,277 --> 00:09:15,957
Official Pei

211
00:09:15,957 --> 00:09:17,517
once was my uncle too.

212
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:18,837
Once an uncle,

213
00:09:19,077 --> 00:09:20,358
always an uncle.

214
00:09:21,397 --> 00:09:22,717
I even forgot to greet you.

215
00:09:23,277 --> 00:09:23,798
Never mind.

216
00:09:24,038 --> 00:09:26,077
I don't need a nephew-in-law like you.

217
00:09:27,957 --> 00:09:28,678
Uncle.

218
00:09:29,558 --> 00:09:30,358
Ex-husband.

219
00:09:31,558 --> 00:09:32,238
Ex-husband.

220
00:09:33,837 --> 00:09:34,558
Niece.

221
00:09:36,238 --> 00:09:36,837
Master Ma,

222
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:37,957
let me explain.

223
00:09:37,957 --> 00:09:39,438
It's not like this.

224
00:09:40,558 --> 00:09:40,957
Well,

225
00:09:40,957 --> 00:09:42,077
it's like what they said,

226
00:09:42,358 --> 00:09:43,038
but now,

227
00:09:43,038 --> 00:09:43,598
what matters

228
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:44,837
is our marriage, isn't it?

229
00:09:45,158 --> 00:09:46,197
Please consider me.

230
00:09:46,358 --> 00:09:47,197
Actually, I'm still a...

231

Er Bao, San Bao,

232
00:09:48,717 --> 00:09:52,317
this is ridiculous, it's ridiculous.

233
00:09:53,957 --> 00:09:54,957
Brilliant.

234
00:09:55,798 --> 00:09:57,517
You got here before me.

235
00:09:57,717 --> 00:09:59,038
But you still need my help

236
00:09:59,317 --> 00:10:00,317
to handle it.

237
00:10:01,038 --> 00:10:01,717
Don't you think, Miaomiao?

238
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:05,077
Miao.

239
00:10:05,077 --> 00:10:05,558
Miaomiao.

240
00:10:06,478 --> 00:10:07,277
- Miao.
- Miaomiao.

241
00:10:11,717 --> 00:10:12,277
Go forward!

242
00:10:12,517 --> 00:10:13,077
Wait.

243

244

Miao.

245
00:10:15,478 --> 00:10:15,957
Don't move.

246
00:10:17,277 --> 00:10:17,678
Miaomiao.

247
00:10:18,038 --> 00:10:19,558
My feelings for you are real.

248
00:10:19,717 --> 00:10:21,277
But he's insincere.

249
00:10:21,478 --> 00:10:22,158
Miao,

250
00:10:22,158 --> 00:10:22,717
hear me out.

251
00:10:22,717 --> 00:10:23,158
That's enough.

252
00:10:24,077 --> 00:10:26,637
The two of you always make
a scene at my house.

253
00:10:26,717 --> 00:10:27,957
You even came here today.

254
00:10:28,197 --> 00:10:28,957
Aren't you tired?

255
00:10:29,077 --> 00:10:29,558
- No.
- No.

256
00:10:30,837 --> 00:10:31,238
But

257
00:10:31,238 --> 00:10:32,158
I'm tired.

258
00:10:33,197 --> 00:10:34,238
It was written clearly

259
00:10:34,238 --> 00:10:35,038
on the divorce papers.

260
00:10:35,358 --> 00:10:36,197
We're square.

261
00:10:36,197 --> 00:10:37,678
Do not intervene
with another party's future marriage.

262

Miao,

263

- don't speak in anger.

If you let go of me,

00:13:08,918 --> 00:13:10,517
I'm a bad judge of character?

335
00:13:11,317 --> 00:13:12,038
Let me tell you this.

336
00:13:12,438 --> 00:13:13,517
Miao is already 15 years old.

337
00:13:13,517 --> 00:13:14,558
She's not my daughter.

338
00:13:14,558 --> 00:13:15,598
But we're like sisters.

339
00:13:15,877 --> 00:13:16,837
As you make a rash decision,

340
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:17,678
it'll be fine if it's a good husband.

341
00:13:17,678 --> 00:13:18,277
What if it's not that case?

342
00:13:18,277 --> 00:13:19,197
What will she think of you?

343
00:13:25,478 --> 00:13:26,998
Do you think I don't know that?

344
00:13:27,478 --> 00:13:29,478
It's just that this is different.

345
00:13:30,918 --> 00:13:31,798
If Miao isn't married

346
00:13:32,238 --> 00:13:34,077
within the month,

347
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:37,238
Shen family might be annihilated.

348
00:13:39,717 --> 00:13:40,317
Quick.

349
00:13:40,317 --> 00:13:41,038
Give me a massage.

350
00:13:41,957 --> 00:13:42,957
Old Master.

351
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:44,438
Old Master.

352
00:13:48,918 --> 00:13:49,478
Old Master,

353
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,238
I've brought the selected men over.

354
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:53,717
I see.

355
00:13:57,598 --> 00:13:58,877
Someone is even holding sledgehammers.

356
00:14:00,397 --> 00:14:00,957
Housekeeper,

357
00:14:01,957 --> 00:14:02,918
according to the rules,

358
00:14:03,397 --> 00:14:05,478
those who don't conform
to the age requirement,

359
00:14:05,998 --> 00:14:07,158
those who are underweight

360
00:14:07,358 --> 00:14:08,757
and those with ordinary looks,

361
00:14:09,238 --> 00:14:10,238
please send them out.

362
00:14:10,998 --> 00:14:11,438
Yes.

363
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:14,358
Break it up.

364
00:14:14,358 --> 00:14:14,798
Dismiss.

365
00:14:14,798 --> 00:14:15,358
Come back.

366
00:14:15,558 --> 00:14:16,798
What do you mean by dismissing?

367
00:14:16,798 --> 00:14:18,397
Save some for me.

368
00:14:19,798 --> 00:14:20,637
Yes, Old Master.

369
00:14:21,118 --> 00:14:22,358
What is he doing?

370
00:14:22,358 --> 00:14:23,397
He asks them to leave?

371
00:14:23,837 --> 00:14:25,158
Is Old Master Shen here?

372
00:14:28,277 --> 00:14:29,118
Old Master Shen.

373
00:14:32,517 --> 00:14:34,077
It's you, Constable Zhao.

374
00:14:34,077 --> 00:14:36,118
What a pleasant surprise.

375
00:14:37,757 --> 00:14:39,238
Your full fury

376
00:14:39,238 --> 00:14:41,038
has frightened me.

377
00:14:41,358 --> 00:14:42,277
Peace breeds wealth.

378
00:14:42,598 --> 00:14:44,358
Peace breeds wealth.

379
00:14:44,358 --> 00:14:44,837
Yes.

380
00:14:45,998 --> 00:14:46,558
Constable Zhao.

381
00:14:48,918 --> 00:14:49,998
You're too polite, Old Master Shen.

382
00:14:50,317 --> 00:14:51,598
(Constable Zhao)
We're here today

383
00:14:51,598 --> 00:14:53,077
(Constable Zhao)
for an official business.

384
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:55,918
Come forward!

385
00:14:58,558 --> 00:15:00,038
Come, over here.

386
00:15:02,038 --> 00:15:04,358
Congratulations, Old Master Shen and Madam Shen.

387
00:15:12,717 --> 00:15:13,358
Constable Zhao,

388
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:14,877
what is this about?

389
00:15:36,877 --> 00:15:37,397
Official.

390
00:15:41,478 --> 00:15:44,438
Based on the betrothal years ago,
I, Magistrate Pei Yanzhen, am here

391
00:15:44,918 --> 00:15:46,238
to ask to marry your daughter.

392
00:15:47,517 --> 00:15:49,238
Please give me your permission.

393
00:15:58,717 --> 00:15:59,277
Lvying,

394
00:15:59,637 --> 00:16:02,038
prepare a reward for the martial artist later.

395
00:16:02,798 --> 00:16:04,637
He does have an imposing figure.

396
00:16:04,637 --> 00:16:06,118
He's fascinating.

397
00:16:06,197 --> 00:16:07,158
Miao, Miao.

398
00:16:07,678 --> 00:16:08,197
Zai?

399
00:16:08,998 --> 00:16:09,877
Why are you here?

400
00:16:10,277 --> 00:16:11,918
Weren't you watching
the selection process in the front yard?

401
00:16:12,717 --> 00:16:13,118
Here,

402
00:16:13,317 --> 00:16:13,957
a candied fruit for you.

403
00:16:15,038 --> 00:16:16,565
(Shen Zai)
There's a poor scholar in the front yard

404
00:16:16,565 --> 00:16:17,877
(Shen Zai)
who brings betrothal gifts over.

405
00:16:18,517 --> 00:16:19,678
He looks arrogant.

406
00:16:19,798 --> 00:16:20,918
I don't like him.

407
00:16:21,957 --> 00:16:23,438
Didn't they only enlist
those who practised martial arts?

408
00:16:24,077 --> 00:16:25,238
There's even a scholar.

409
00:16:25,358 --> 00:16:26,397
He even brings the betrothal gifts over?

410
00:16:27,397 --> 00:16:28,277
It was remiss of me

411
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:30,038
to come without informing you.

412
00:16:30,038 --> 00:16:31,238
I'm flattered, Official Pei.

413
00:16:31,717 --> 00:16:32,717
But I don't remember

414
00:16:33,598 --> 00:16:35,238
there's a marriage contract

415
00:16:35,238 --> 00:16:36,877
between Shen family and Pei family.

416
00:16:37,358 --> 00:16:40,077
Besides, Official Pei is
the magistrate of Lingzhou City.

417
00:16:40,637 --> 00:16:43,918
My daughter sees you
as a brother and a father.

418
00:16:45,317 --> 00:16:46,717
I think we should just forget

419
00:16:47,637 --> 00:16:49,038
about the marriage proposal.

420
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,438
We, Shen family, are a merchant family.

421
00:16:51,837 --> 00:16:53,598
Miaomiao is the only daughter we have.

422
00:16:53,957 --> 00:16:56,717
First off, we want her
to stay with us a little longer.

423
00:16:57,678 --> 00:16:59,558
Secondly, you're an outstanding man.

424
00:16:59,957 --> 00:17:01,877
We're not good enough for you.

425
00:17:04,918 --> 00:17:06,117
Keep her with you?

426
00:17:06,397 --> 00:17:08,477
Then, why are you looking
for a son-in-law in the back

427
00:17:08,477 --> 00:17:10,438
but claiming that you're hiring
an armed escort?

428
00:17:10,637 --> 00:17:12,078
Everyone in Lingzhou City has

429
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,877
witnessed us bringing
the betrothal gifts over.

430
00:17:15,277 --> 00:17:17,477
You can't deny it.

431
00:17:17,477 --> 00:17:18,158
That's presumptuous!

432
00:17:18,357 --> 00:17:20,357
Don't try to make
an irresponsible comment.

433
00:17:21,637 --> 00:17:24,477
Since you're here for a personal matter,

434
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,158
we're equal, then.

435
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:27,357
Someone!

436
00:17:27,637 --> 00:17:28,117
Yes.

437
00:17:28,477 --> 00:17:31,198
Whoever can get Master Pei out
of Shen's Residence

438
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:35,438
will be the head of the armed escort
of Shen family.

439
00:17:35,718 --> 00:17:36,198
Yes.

440
00:17:37,438 --> 00:17:38,117
Guys.

441
00:17:52,397 --> 00:17:53,277
I understand

442
00:17:54,318 --> 00:17:55,038
your worries.

443
00:17:55,877 --> 00:17:56,678
Did you forget

444
00:17:57,158 --> 00:17:58,277
the promise you made

445
00:17:58,637 --> 00:17:59,438
to His Majesty?

446
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,357
Our northern region suffered
a long drought.

447
00:18:07,357 --> 00:18:07,877
(Imperial palace)

448
00:18:07,877 --> 00:18:08,678
(Imperial palace)
The harvest was poor.

449
00:18:08,678 --> 00:18:09,397
(Imperial palace)

450
00:18:09,397 --> 00:18:10,660
(Imperial palace)
Luckily, Old Master Shen donated food and money

451
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,798
Luckily, Old Master Shen donated food and money

452
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:12,597
to them.

453
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:14,477
It has avoided a disaster.

454
00:18:15,718 --> 00:18:17,637
Old Master Shen, you're rich but kind

455
00:18:17,918 --> 00:18:18,718
(The Emperor)
and you care about the nation.

456
00:18:18,718 --> 00:18:19,558
(The Emperor)

457
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:20,637
(The Emperor)
You save them from trouble.

458
00:18:21,357 --> 00:18:23,958
You're the role model of all merchants.

459
00:18:24,918 --> 00:18:26,477
The people live in peace,

460
00:18:27,078 --> 00:18:29,397
thanks to Your Majesty's grace.

461
00:18:29,718 --> 00:18:30,678
I was just trying

462
00:18:31,117 --> 00:18:33,877
to share the burden of Your Majesty
and the Empress Dowager.

463
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:35,078
I dare not take credit

464
00:18:35,078 --> 00:18:36,918
for other achievements.

465
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:40,597
That's so humble of you, Old Master Shen.

466
00:18:40,597 --> 00:18:40,958
(Empress Dowager)

467
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,299
(Empress Dowager)
I heard that you've taught

468
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:43,397
(Empress Dowager)
your daughter well.

469
00:18:43,877 --> 00:18:47,477
Your eldest daughter, Shen Miao,
is as kind as you, Old Master Shen.

470
00:18:48,597 --> 00:18:49,477
Now that

471
00:18:49,637 --> 00:18:52,718
Miss Shen is old enough to get married.

472
00:18:53,318 --> 00:18:55,558
And His Majesty is young and strong.

473
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:56,918
Why not...

474
00:18:57,198 --> 00:18:58,318
You can't do this!

475
00:18:58,597 --> 00:18:59,198
(Jing De)
How dare you!

476
00:19:04,158 --> 00:19:06,038
Old Master Shen, do you

477
00:19:06,637 --> 00:19:08,198
dislike my son?

478
00:19:08,637 --> 00:19:09,798
How would I dare to do that?

479
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:13,198
It's just that my daughter is
a common-looking lady

480
00:19:13,198 --> 00:19:14,357
without virtue.

481
00:19:14,838 --> 00:19:16,918
I was worried she'd end up alone

482
00:19:16,918 --> 00:19:18,877
so I've found her a husband.

483
00:19:20,397 --> 00:19:22,678
They'll get married in a month.

484
00:19:24,078 --> 00:19:24,877
Is that true?

485
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:26,718
It's true.

486
00:19:31,158 --> 00:19:32,477
I understand

487
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:33,798
your fatherly concern.

488
00:19:34,678 --> 00:19:36,397
Since your daughter has been betrothed,

489
00:19:37,117 --> 00:19:39,038
how could I steal someone's fiancee?

490
00:19:39,438 --> 00:19:40,838
Thank you, Your Majesty.

491
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,277
Since the wedding is around the corner

492
00:19:44,678 --> 00:19:46,397
and Shen family has rendered
meritorious service,

493
00:19:47,198 --> 00:19:48,038
a month later,

494
00:19:48,597 --> 00:19:50,718
I'll send the censor to Lingzhou City

495
00:19:51,277 --> 00:19:53,918
to attend Shen family's wedding,
is that alright?

496
00:19:57,477 --> 00:19:58,198
Everybody, stand down.

497
00:19:59,198 --> 00:19:59,637
Yes.

498
00:20:00,877 --> 00:20:01,877
Stand down, stand down.

499
00:20:02,198 --> 00:20:02,477
Quick.

500
00:20:02,477 --> 00:20:03,117
Hurry up.

501
00:20:03,158 --> 00:20:03,517
Quick.

502
00:20:03,517 --> 00:20:05,318
Put it down, quick.

503
00:20:05,318 --> 00:20:05,877
Hurry up.

504
00:20:14,277 --> 00:20:15,558
Who is he?

505
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:16,637
He's just a small official.

506
00:20:16,637 --> 00:20:18,198
How dare he come
and throw his weight around?

507
00:20:18,397 --> 00:20:19,078
Madam Shen,

508
00:20:19,397 --> 00:20:20,798
Official Pei hasn't left yet.

509
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:22,198
Mind your words.

510
00:20:22,198 --> 00:20:22,958
I'm just saying.

511
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:23,877
He can't hear me.

512
00:20:32,637 --> 00:20:33,678
Official Pei,

513
00:20:35,477 --> 00:20:36,958
it's impressive.

514
00:20:38,877 --> 00:20:40,397
You're out here in Lingzhou City.

515
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:42,718
But you know everything

516
00:20:43,718 --> 00:20:46,277
in the capital and the palace.

517
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,477
I'm impressed.

518
00:20:49,918 --> 00:20:50,798
I apologize

519
00:20:51,158 --> 00:20:52,198
for my suddenness.

520
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:53,318
I just

521
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:55,958
don't want Shen family
to reach a dead end.

522
00:20:56,877 --> 00:20:58,277
Old Master Shen made a smart excuse.

523
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,718
But no secret can be kept forever.

524
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:02,597
Even I know about this,

525
00:21:03,198 --> 00:21:05,318
let alone the imperial palace.

526
00:21:05,838 --> 00:21:06,958
If His Majesty knows this,

527
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,678
Shen family will be convicted
of defrauding the emperor.

528
00:21:09,678 --> 00:21:10,477
It's absurd.

529
00:21:11,158 --> 00:21:13,038
If my daughter marries you,

530
00:21:13,718 --> 00:21:15,718
isn't that also defrauding the emperor?

531
00:21:15,838 --> 00:21:16,397
What a coincidence.

532
00:21:17,357 --> 00:21:19,117
I once rejected the marriage proposal

533
00:21:19,477 --> 00:21:21,477
from Ninth Princess at Qionglin Banquet

534
00:21:22,158 --> 00:21:24,078
with the excuse of being engaged
to someone else.

535
00:21:24,357 --> 00:21:26,477
It coincides with your statement.

536
00:21:27,277 --> 00:21:27,798
Secondly,

537
00:21:28,637 --> 00:21:30,078
as I brought a lot
of betrothal gifts over,

538
00:21:30,718 --> 00:21:32,318
if I returned with nothing,

539
00:21:35,477 --> 00:21:36,558
what do you think

540
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:40,038
the others would think?

541
00:21:44,277 --> 00:21:44,798
Miss,

542
00:21:45,078 --> 00:21:45,997
this is a public place.

543
00:21:45,997 --> 00:21:46,718
There are many people watching.

544
00:21:46,718 --> 00:21:48,117
You can't ruin the image
that you spent

545
00:21:48,117 --> 00:21:49,237
16 years to build.

546
00:21:50,838 --> 00:21:51,357
Miss.

547
00:21:57,718 --> 00:21:58,357
Come here.

548
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,877
It's you, Aunt.

549
00:22:01,877 --> 00:22:03,318
You have a death wish, Miaomiao.

550
00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:04,798
We've talked about this many times.

551
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:07,237
You must keep a good image
before getting married.

552
00:22:07,237 --> 00:22:08,477
Do not play with swords

553
00:22:08,477 --> 00:22:10,277
until your marriage is finalized.

554
00:22:10,277 --> 00:22:11,517
I got it.

555
00:22:12,237 --> 00:22:12,798
Where is my dad?

556
00:22:13,277 --> 00:22:15,958
Your dad is dealing
with that arrogant scholar.

557
00:22:17,237 --> 00:22:17,757
Great.

558
00:22:18,198 --> 00:22:18,558
Lvying,

559
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:19,078
let's go.

560
00:22:19,718 --> 00:22:20,198
But you've

561
00:22:20,198 --> 00:22:20,958
brought the blade.

562
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:24,237
My dad is here,
there's nothing to be afraid of.

563
00:22:24,237 --> 00:22:25,597
My dad values my will the most.

564
00:22:25,597 --> 00:22:26,718
He won't sell me out.

565
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:27,997
Right, Aunt?

566
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:29,597
Congratulations,

567
00:22:29,597 --> 00:22:30,397
Official.

568
00:22:30,757 --> 00:22:32,918
Since Old Master Shen has agreed
to this marriage,

569
00:22:33,237 --> 00:22:35,357
we should get ready for this.

570
00:22:37,117 --> 00:22:37,838
What?

571
00:22:38,117 --> 00:22:39,038
He did sell me out?

572
00:22:39,597 --> 00:22:40,078
Well...

573
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,920
(Pei's Residence)

574
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,160
(Zhan Yue)

575
00:23:08,078 --> 00:23:08,757
You're back?

576
00:23:12,117 --> 00:23:13,517
If I was an assassin,

577
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:14,877
you would've died already.

578
00:23:17,117 --> 00:23:18,958
Very few people can draw a sword
at my residence.

579
00:23:19,757 --> 00:23:20,558
You can do that

580
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:23,117
because I give you the right.

581
00:23:25,597 --> 00:23:26,477
Just come on down.

582
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,558
This tasteless thing again?

583
00:23:41,078 --> 00:23:42,237
It's fine even if it's not liquor.

584
00:23:42,637 --> 00:23:44,318
But at least give me something strong.

585
00:23:51,918 --> 00:23:53,038
Strong tea harms our tastebuds.

586
00:23:53,397 --> 00:23:54,558
Noise harms our mentality.

587
00:23:55,158 --> 00:23:57,678
Taking everything lightly is
the gentlemanly thing to do.

588
00:23:59,877 --> 00:24:00,397
Tell me.

589
00:24:00,918 --> 00:24:01,798
What have you found out

590
00:24:02,397 --> 00:24:03,438
about Miss Shen?

591
00:24:05,438 --> 00:24:06,438
About Miss Shen,

592
00:24:06,918 --> 00:24:07,558
you know what?

593
00:24:09,597 --> 00:24:10,918
This Old Dragon-Bead

594
00:24:11,237 --> 00:24:12,038
is me.

595
00:24:12,997 --> 00:24:14,517
Shen family has a great fortune.

596
00:24:16,918 --> 00:24:18,078
And the Emperor

597
00:24:18,438 --> 00:24:20,318
wants to have it.

598
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:22,838
The merchant is not allowed to be an official.

599
00:24:23,158 --> 00:24:23,877
The simplest way is

600
00:24:24,117 --> 00:24:25,198
to have me as his concubine.

601
00:24:25,517 --> 00:24:26,038
Am I right?

602
00:24:26,517 --> 00:24:27,958
That's how it is.

603
00:24:29,158 --> 00:24:30,958
Shen family is rich

604
00:24:31,158 --> 00:24:32,117
but we're not a fool.

605
00:24:32,918 --> 00:24:34,117
If I was married to him,

606
00:24:34,397 --> 00:24:35,637
death would be the only way out.

607
00:24:36,117 --> 00:24:37,997
Father doesn't have the heart
to see me suffer.

608
00:24:38,318 --> 00:24:39,678
Therefore,

609
00:24:41,237 --> 00:24:42,918
he picks the best of a bad bunch

610
00:24:43,318 --> 00:24:46,597
and chooses Pei Yanzhen.

611
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:48,637
First off,

612
00:24:48,918 --> 00:24:50,277
it can save the family from danger.

613
00:24:51,117 --> 00:24:54,078
Secondly, Official Pei is
a poor low-rank official.

614
00:24:54,318 --> 00:24:55,678
It's easy to divorce him by then.

615
00:24:56,198 --> 00:24:56,997
Right?

616
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,038
About what you said,

617
00:25:00,678 --> 00:25:02,597
it's true and not true.

618
00:25:02,997 --> 00:25:03,798
What do you mean it's true?

619
00:25:08,198 --> 00:25:08,958
Miaomiao,

620
00:25:09,678 --> 00:25:10,277
you're

621
00:25:10,678 --> 00:25:13,038
the young lady of Shen family,
aren't you?

622
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:15,958
It's inappropriate to think of a divorce

623
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:17,277
before getting married.

624
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:18,718
The point is...

625
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:21,558
The point is
that gossip is a fearful thing.

626
00:25:22,277 --> 00:25:24,158
Gossip is fearful to the outsiders.

627
00:25:24,158 --> 00:25:24,958
But I'm not afraid of it.

628
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:26,718
Miao.

629
00:25:27,438 --> 00:25:28,678
Aunt,

630
00:25:29,117 --> 00:25:30,958
I know you love me.

631
00:25:31,757 --> 00:25:32,558
Let me ask you this.

632
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:34,477
Why do women follow the virtue

633
00:25:34,838 --> 00:25:35,918
and obey their husbands

634
00:25:36,198 --> 00:25:36,958
after marriage?

635
00:25:37,997 --> 00:25:40,038
It's certainly to have
a happy married life

636
00:25:40,477 --> 00:25:41,958
and make the husband happy.

637
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:42,517
Is that true?

638
00:25:43,357 --> 00:25:43,877
Shut up.

639
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:49,357
Look.

640
00:25:49,997 --> 00:25:51,318
No matter what you look like,

641
00:25:51,597 --> 00:25:52,757
my father will also feel happy.

642
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:54,158
Because he treats you sincerely.

643
00:25:54,718 --> 00:25:55,997
I'd like to find someone like this.

644
00:25:57,038 --> 00:25:59,277
But due to a quirk of fate

645
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,318
and the situation,

646
00:26:00,757 --> 00:26:02,038
I don't have the time to find one.

647
00:26:03,477 --> 00:26:05,558
Luckily, Shen family is well-known.

648
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:07,158
I'm carefree and I like freedom.

649
00:26:07,158 --> 00:26:08,637
I don't want to be restrained.

650
00:26:08,637 --> 00:26:10,958
I'll divorce him right away
when I have the chance.

651
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:12,877
This young scholar has made a move

652
00:26:12,877 --> 00:26:13,718
before us,

653
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:17,357
but as long as the emperor trusts us,

654
00:26:17,357 --> 00:26:20,078
we can do anything we want by then.

655
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:27,597
So,

656
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,757
she wants to marry an outlaw?

657
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:39,637
I think

658
00:26:39,997 --> 00:26:41,958
it's not late for you to resign
and learn martial arts now.

659
00:26:42,838 --> 00:26:43,397
What do you think?

660
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:45,838
Do you need me to make a referral?

661
00:26:46,318 --> 00:26:47,117
No, thanks.

662
00:26:48,517 --> 00:26:49,637
You take a few days off.

663
00:26:50,078 --> 00:26:51,198
After the wedding,

664
00:26:51,397 --> 00:26:52,517
make a run to the capital for me.

665
00:26:53,637 --> 00:26:54,277
Hey,

666
00:26:54,597 --> 00:26:55,277
why are you so sure

667
00:26:55,277 --> 00:26:56,637
that Shen Miao will marry you?

668
00:26:57,237 --> 00:26:58,397
Nothing is certain

669
00:26:59,438 --> 00:27:00,357
in the world.

670
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:02,597
Moreover, marriage is unpredictable.

671
00:27:02,838 --> 00:27:03,558
How can I be sure of it?

672
00:27:05,997 --> 00:27:06,718
What do you mean?

673
00:27:07,357 --> 00:27:08,318
Marriage is unpredictable

674
00:27:09,757 --> 00:27:10,718
but I can predict one's thoughts.

675
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:13,397
If Shen Miao doesn't want
to enter the palace,

676
00:27:13,637 --> 00:27:14,357
she'll marry me for sure.

677
00:27:15,838 --> 00:27:17,277
It goes without saying.

678
00:27:17,397 --> 00:27:18,597
Many martial arts experts

679
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:21,357
are keen to marry
to the richest Shen family.

680
00:27:21,357 --> 00:27:22,958
Why would Old Master Shen have

681
00:27:23,158 --> 00:27:24,718
his eye on you?

682
00:27:25,237 --> 00:27:25,838
Read his mind

683
00:27:26,517 --> 00:27:27,158
and observe his movements.

684
00:27:28,918 --> 00:27:31,357
I can solve his crime
of defrauding the emperor

685
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:32,798
and I promised him

686
00:27:33,438 --> 00:27:34,597
that I won't fail Shen Miao.

687
00:27:35,078 --> 00:27:36,838
Old Master Shen has no other choices.

688
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:40,718
What a schemer.

689
00:27:40,877 --> 00:27:42,477
I'm not into love affairs.

690
00:27:43,397 --> 00:27:44,517
I just want to protect myself.

691
00:27:45,517 --> 00:27:49,237
I'll keep my promise
once we get married.

692
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:51,558
You're heartless and ruthless.

693
00:27:52,597 --> 00:27:54,678
Who knows if you'll be swayed
after getting married?

694
00:28:00,397 --> 00:28:03,637
Everything about you is good.

695
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:06,078
Just that your marriage...

696
00:28:10,918 --> 00:28:12,198
Geez.

697
00:28:29,357 --> 00:28:30,277
Miao,

698
00:28:31,318 --> 00:28:32,718
you're a smart girl.

699
00:28:33,517 --> 00:28:36,357
You figure things out
without me telling you.

700
00:28:36,877 --> 00:28:38,678
What you said is

701
00:28:39,357 --> 00:28:41,877
not the only reason
why I pick Official Pei.

702
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:44,198
Why is that?

703
00:28:50,597 --> 00:28:53,038
Now that Shen family has reached
its apogee.

704
00:28:53,678 --> 00:28:56,198
I don't seek for a successful

705
00:28:56,198 --> 00:28:57,877
and peerless man.

706
00:28:58,237 --> 00:28:59,597
All I want is

707
00:29:00,158 --> 00:29:02,318
a person who can take care of you

708
00:29:02,757 --> 00:29:05,798
on that day
when the family falls from its pinnacle.

709
00:29:05,798 --> 00:29:06,718
We don't know

710
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:08,477
what kind of a person

711
00:29:08,718 --> 00:29:09,798
Pei Yanzhen is.

712
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:12,637
How are you so sure that he's the one?

713
00:29:17,678 --> 00:29:18,718
He said...

714
00:29:32,357 --> 00:29:33,798
You're a weak scholar.

715
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,637
What makes you think
you can ask to marry me?

716
00:29:39,637 --> 00:29:40,637
I'll eat with you every day.

717
00:29:41,438 --> 00:29:41,918
You...

718
00:29:44,237 --> 00:29:45,357
I won't take a concubine.

719
00:29:46,438 --> 00:29:46,918
You...

720
00:29:47,838 --> 00:29:49,078
Do not take another step.

721
00:29:54,237 --> 00:29:55,357
I'll never fail you.

722
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:09,198
As such,

723
00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:12,477
maybe we can kill two birds
with one stone.

724
00:30:12,997 --> 00:30:15,117
We can deceive the Emperor

725
00:30:15,517 --> 00:30:18,558
and find you a good man
at the same time.

726
00:30:23,397 --> 00:30:23,918
Father,

727
00:30:24,718 --> 00:30:25,838
you've taught me

728
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:28,397
that we can't be greedy.

729
00:30:28,597 --> 00:30:29,438
A good man is

730
00:30:29,838 --> 00:30:31,597
something we can't ask for.

731
00:30:32,237 --> 00:30:35,078
Besides, Pei Yanzhen brought
the betrothal gifts over

732
00:30:35,078 --> 00:30:36,198
and forced me to marry him.

733
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:38,117
A divorce is a minimum requirement.

734
00:30:38,517 --> 00:30:39,997
The rest is just an accident.

735
00:30:40,517 --> 00:30:41,038
You...

736
00:31:11,838 --> 00:31:14,158
The first combing,
may you grow old together.

737
00:31:15,198 --> 00:31:17,678
The second combing,
may you love and respect one another.

738
00:31:18,597 --> 00:31:19,918
The third combing,

739
00:31:20,237 --> 00:31:21,798
may your bloodlines be fruitful.

740
00:31:23,918 --> 00:31:24,517
Miss,

741
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:27,678
normally, the married couple love
each other and can't bear

742
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:28,877
to leave one another.

743
00:31:29,237 --> 00:31:30,678
But things don't go your way.

744
00:31:31,237 --> 00:31:33,918
That you have to marry
to a weak scholar.

745
00:31:35,237 --> 00:31:36,438
Bride! Bride!

746
00:31:37,678 --> 00:31:38,438
It's time.

747
00:31:38,678 --> 00:31:39,877
The sedan chair is here.

748
00:31:41,718 --> 00:31:43,198
Why aren't you covered
with a bridal veil?

749
00:31:43,397 --> 00:31:44,637
It's inauspicious if it's past

750
00:31:44,877 --> 00:31:45,958
the propitious hour.

751
00:31:46,678 --> 00:31:47,558
Miss.

752
00:31:48,918 --> 00:31:50,757
That's enough, stop acting like this.

753
00:31:51,078 --> 00:31:52,357
I'm pretty and rich.

754
00:31:52,597 --> 00:31:53,918
It's easy to get a husband I like.

755
00:31:54,397 --> 00:31:55,117
Besides,

756
00:31:55,117 --> 00:31:55,958
after getting married,

757
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:58,038
I'll find a chance to get divorced.

758
00:31:58,397 --> 00:32:00,438
The emperor won't want
to marry me by then.

759
00:32:03,637 --> 00:32:04,318
Alright, then.

760
00:32:04,477 --> 00:32:05,158
Miss,

761
00:32:05,517 --> 00:32:06,438
it's the propitious hour.

762
00:32:06,438 --> 00:32:08,237
Will you marry him or not?

763
00:32:08,237 --> 00:32:09,078
Let's go.

764
00:32:09,277 --> 00:32:10,277
I'll marry him.

765
00:32:11,438 --> 00:32:12,477
What are you waiting for?

766
00:32:12,477 --> 00:32:14,117
I'm getting married,
walk me to the door.

767
00:32:14,637 --> 00:32:15,357
Yes, right.

768
00:32:15,357 --> 00:32:16,637
Cover her with the bridal veil.

769
00:32:18,517 --> 00:32:19,678
Hold it tight.

770
00:32:20,078 --> 00:32:20,718
Good.

771
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:22,558
Cover her with the bridal veil.

772
00:32:26,918 --> 00:32:29,558
Here comes the bride!

773
00:32:29,918 --> 00:32:30,918
(Peace and Prosperity)
Mind your step.

774
00:32:30,918 --> 00:32:31,357
(Peace and Prosperity)
Be careful.

775
00:32:31,357 --> 00:32:32,237
(Peace and Prosperity)
Come, over here.

776
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,318
Miss Shen and Master Pei are

777
00:32:44,678 --> 00:32:45,877
a match made in heaven.

778
00:32:46,918 --> 00:32:48,277
It's just a scholar.

779
00:32:48,277 --> 00:32:50,198
I'm not as rich as Shen family.

780
00:32:50,597 --> 00:32:51,997
If I was Shen family's daughter,

781
00:32:52,397 --> 00:32:54,597
the scholar would've fought for me.

782
00:32:55,078 --> 00:32:55,678
Shut up.

783
00:32:56,038 --> 00:32:57,117
Pei family has been officials
for generations.

784
00:32:57,318 --> 00:32:59,078
Master Pei doesn't need that money.

785
00:32:59,198 --> 00:33:00,798
I think it's Miss Shen
who tries everything

786
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:01,838
to marry him

787
00:33:01,838 --> 00:33:03,477
as Master Pei is handsome and charming.

788
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:05,637
Miss, Miss.

789
00:33:05,637 --> 00:33:06,517
Are you asleep?

790
00:33:07,158 --> 00:33:07,718
No.

791
00:33:07,718 --> 00:33:08,277
What's wrong?

792
00:33:09,078 --> 00:33:10,117
Based on my count,

793
00:33:10,397 --> 00:33:11,997
there are about 128 boxes of dowry.

794
00:33:12,477 --> 00:33:14,678
It needs eight persons
to carry each box of dowry.

795
00:33:14,997 --> 00:33:16,558
Why do I feel like you're richer

796
00:33:16,678 --> 00:33:18,277
than you were after getting married?

797
00:33:18,838 --> 00:33:19,997
Keep an eye on them.

798
00:33:20,277 --> 00:33:21,158
When I get divorced,

799
00:33:21,158 --> 00:33:22,198
I have to take them with me.

800
00:33:22,637 --> 00:33:23,357
Miss,

801
00:33:23,637 --> 00:33:24,597
this is your big day.

802
00:33:24,597 --> 00:33:26,038
Don't say such an inauspicious word.

803
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:27,877
I even marry to Pei Yanzhen.

804
00:33:27,877 --> 00:33:28,997
What could be more inauspicious?

805
00:33:39,198 --> 00:33:40,438
Miss, are you alright?

806
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:43,277
Lvying.

807
00:33:43,597 --> 00:33:44,158
Miss.

808
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:45,558
What happened?

809
00:33:45,558 --> 00:33:46,477
I don't know either.

810
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:54,877
Without my order,

811
00:33:54,877 --> 00:33:55,718
do not come over.

812
00:33:56,877 --> 00:33:57,597
Protect the people.

813
00:33:58,078 --> 00:33:58,558
Yes.

814
00:33:58,838 --> 00:34:00,678
Protect the people!

815
00:34:00,678 --> 00:34:01,277
Miss,

816
00:34:01,277 --> 00:34:02,678
there's a group of people in our way.

817
00:34:05,237 --> 00:34:06,838
Are they trying to steal me?

818
00:34:07,237 --> 00:34:08,038
Don't be afraid, Miss.

819
00:34:08,158 --> 00:34:08,877
I'll protect you.

820
00:34:09,037 --> 00:34:10,478
I won't let the bad guys have you.

821
00:34:10,678 --> 00:34:12,597
(I'd like to see
what you're going to do.)

822
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:14,438
Miss.

823
00:34:26,357 --> 00:34:26,918
Official!

824
00:34:28,077 --> 00:34:28,637
Miss!

825
00:34:28,637 --> 00:34:29,918
So they're trying to steal

826
00:34:30,198 --> 00:34:31,077
- Pei Yanzhen?
- Master-in-law?

827
00:34:43,478 --> 00:34:46,077
Didn't you usually like to play cards?

828
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:48,758
Why are you wandering around?

829
00:34:49,037 --> 00:34:50,117
Just go to the yard.

830
00:34:50,317 --> 00:34:50,877
Miaomiao is gone.

831
00:34:50,877 --> 00:34:51,958
No one plays with me.

832
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:52,837
It's no fun.

833
00:34:58,637 --> 00:34:59,797
Old Master, Old Master.

834
00:35:00,397 --> 00:35:00,877
Old Master,

835
00:35:00,877 --> 00:35:02,678
something bad happens.

836
00:35:02,678 --> 00:35:03,278
Slow down.

837
00:35:03,278 --> 00:35:04,077
Shen,

838
00:35:04,397 --> 00:35:05,637
you're too old

839
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:07,317
to be so clumsy.

840
00:35:07,597 --> 00:35:09,397
Just take it slow.

841
00:35:09,637 --> 00:35:11,077
Is there a fire in the rice shop

842
00:35:11,077 --> 00:35:12,678
or is there a flood at the dock?

843
00:35:12,758 --> 00:35:13,198
Right.

844
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:14,438
Old Master, Madam,

845
00:35:14,438 --> 00:35:15,158
it's neither.

846
00:35:15,317 --> 00:35:17,317
Someone robbed Miss.

847
00:35:17,317 --> 00:35:18,958
- What did you say?
- What?

848
00:35:19,758 --> 00:35:20,718
Whoever lays a hand on my sister,

849
00:35:20,797 --> 00:35:21,797
I'll teach him a lesson.

850
00:35:22,597 --> 00:35:23,877
My young master,

851
00:35:24,077 --> 00:35:25,117
it wasn't Miss,

852
00:35:25,117 --> 00:35:26,438
but Master.

853
00:35:26,438 --> 00:35:28,238
Someone abducted him.

854
00:35:28,397 --> 00:35:29,877
Someone kidnapped Master.

855
00:35:30,077 --> 00:35:30,637
Gosh.

856
00:35:31,998 --> 00:35:32,758
What?

857
00:35:53,037 --> 00:35:53,797
Official Pei,

858
00:35:54,597 --> 00:35:55,278
guess

859
00:35:56,278 --> 00:35:58,077
who I am.

860
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:01,278
Ninth Princess, you could've just issued

861
00:36:01,758 --> 00:36:02,837
an edict if you wanted to see me.

862
00:36:03,238 --> 00:36:03,918
Why did you do this?

863
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,900
(Ninth Princess)

864
00:36:15,518 --> 00:36:16,918
Because you didn't write me back

865
00:36:17,478 --> 00:36:18,877
and secretly married another woman.

866
00:36:19,397 --> 00:36:21,478
Otherwise, why would I come
all the way to Lingzhou City?

867
00:36:25,117 --> 00:36:25,918
Look at my outfit.

868
00:36:26,357 --> 00:36:28,597
I look much better than Shen Miao.

869
00:36:29,357 --> 00:36:29,998
Yanzhen.

870
00:36:32,077 --> 00:36:32,797
Please behave, Princess.

871
00:36:33,317 --> 00:36:34,117
We're men and women.

872
00:36:34,518 --> 00:36:36,678
Besides, I'm your subordinate.

873
00:36:36,837 --> 00:36:38,117
It's an offense
to stay in the same room.

874
00:36:38,357 --> 00:36:40,238
Please send me back to my house.

875
00:36:40,797 --> 00:36:41,877
So I can explain it to my wife.

876
00:36:42,198 --> 00:36:43,278
How dare you, Pei Yanzhen!

877
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:45,317
What are you thinking?

878
00:36:45,918 --> 00:36:48,397
I'm from the royal family.

879
00:36:49,797 --> 00:36:50,357
Am I no better

880
00:36:50,357 --> 00:36:52,637
to a merchant's daughter like Shen Miao?

881
00:37:04,557 --> 00:37:05,397
Pei,

882
00:37:06,797 --> 00:37:08,478
I came all the way to Lingzhou City

883
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:10,718
without letting my brother
and mother know

884
00:37:11,478 --> 00:37:14,238
just to marry you.

885
00:37:14,877 --> 00:37:17,357
We can get married today.

886
00:37:18,317 --> 00:37:21,198
If you're still thinking of Shen Miao,

887
00:37:23,117 --> 00:37:25,238
I'll kill the entire Shen family.

888
00:38:00,158 --> 00:38:00,637
Miss,

889
00:38:01,678 --> 00:38:02,278
Miss.

890
00:38:04,557 --> 00:38:06,317
Just say it, there's no one here.

891
00:38:07,037 --> 00:38:07,797
I've asked about it.

892
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,077
It was Ninth Princess
who stole him away.

893
00:38:10,077 --> 00:38:11,637
All of them were the imperial guards.

894
00:38:14,317 --> 00:38:15,518
What did I tell you?

895
00:38:16,317 --> 00:38:18,117
A scholar is a useless man.

896
00:38:18,438 --> 00:38:21,158
If Pei Yanzhen knew
some fighting skills,

897
00:38:21,158 --> 00:38:21,637
he wouldn't

898
00:38:21,637 --> 00:38:23,438
have been easily kidnapped.

899
00:38:24,637 --> 00:38:25,397
Otherwise,

900
00:38:25,597 --> 00:38:27,317
we could've enjoyed a fighting show.

901
00:38:27,317 --> 00:38:28,397
So I can broaden my vision.

902
00:38:29,158 --> 00:38:29,837
Miss,

903
00:38:29,837 --> 00:38:31,037
that was Ninth Prince.

904
00:38:31,357 --> 00:38:33,117
How could low-rank Magistrate Pei
fight her?

905
00:38:33,518 --> 00:38:34,117
Besides,

906
00:38:34,117 --> 00:38:35,478
don't you worry about Master?

907
00:38:37,158 --> 00:38:38,117
What Master?

908
00:38:38,117 --> 00:38:38,837
Call him the emperor's brother-in-law.

909
00:38:40,637 --> 00:38:41,478
A great joy!

910
00:38:41,478 --> 00:38:43,037
It's a great joy.

911
00:38:44,837 --> 00:38:46,357
They always say Shen family is lucky.

912
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:48,317
I didn't expect
to be blessed with good luck.

913
00:38:48,678 --> 00:38:50,158
My luck is unstoppable.

914
00:38:50,158 --> 00:38:51,037
I can't help it.

915
00:38:51,877 --> 00:38:54,317
I thought that my plan would fail.

916
00:38:54,557 --> 00:38:55,317
Now,

917
00:38:55,637 --> 00:38:56,797
after twists and turns,

918
00:38:56,797 --> 00:38:57,918
there's a way out.

919
00:38:58,637 --> 00:38:59,278
Well, now,

920
00:38:59,278 --> 00:39:00,438
I don't have to ask for a divorce.

921
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:01,278
Lvying,

922
00:39:01,278 --> 00:39:01,958
quick, go pack our things.

923
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:02,958
Let's go home.

924
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:04,238
What are you talking about, Miss?

925
00:39:04,238 --> 00:39:05,117
Even if you want a divorce,

926
00:39:05,117 --> 00:39:06,837
you can't run away
on your wedding night.

927
00:39:07,077 --> 00:39:07,877
What do you mean

928
00:39:07,877 --> 00:39:08,597
by my wedding night?

929
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:10,397
It doesn't count
as we haven't performed the ceremony.

930
00:39:10,958 --> 00:39:13,158
I thought
Pei Yanzhen wouldn't let me go.

931
00:39:13,557 --> 00:39:15,278
Now that the princess likes him.

932
00:39:15,557 --> 00:39:16,837
No man can resist her.

933
00:39:17,238 --> 00:39:17,758
Quick.

934
00:39:17,758 --> 00:39:19,037
Take the dowry with us.

935
00:39:19,037 --> 00:39:20,117
Let's go, come on.

936
00:39:20,117 --> 00:39:21,117
Chop, chop.

937
00:39:22,117 --> 00:39:22,678
Miss.

938
00:39:23,797 --> 00:39:24,158
Miss,

939
00:39:24,158 --> 00:39:24,797
this is a huge matter.

940
00:39:24,797 --> 00:39:25,918
You should tell Old Master.

941
00:39:25,918 --> 00:39:26,478
If not,

942
00:39:26,478 --> 00:39:27,597
you can discuss it with Madam.

943
00:39:27,597 --> 00:39:28,117
No need.

944
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:28,918
Anyway, I've already got married.

945
00:39:28,918 --> 00:39:29,998
I'm sure the emperor won't marry me.

946
00:39:29,998 --> 00:39:30,637
Let's leave now.

947
00:39:43,238 --> 00:39:43,877
Miss.

948
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:11,998
It's my bad.

949
00:40:12,438 --> 00:40:13,518
Sorry to startle you.

950
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:20,597
I'm screwed.

951
00:40:21,518 --> 00:40:22,637
It's too late.

952
00:40:23,397 --> 00:40:25,278
Do you mean we should hurry up?

953
00:40:25,278 --> 00:40:26,077
No.

954
00:40:26,797 --> 00:40:27,797
I just regret

955
00:40:28,837 --> 00:40:30,877
why I didn't take a good look
at his face before.

956
00:40:40,278 --> 00:40:42,557
Are you heading home?

957
00:40:48,918 --> 00:40:49,597
Well,

958
00:40:53,637 --> 00:40:54,438
Pei,

959
00:40:54,837 --> 00:40:56,557
there are many people here.

960
00:40:56,918 --> 00:40:59,077
We should go inside and talk.

961
00:41:01,317 --> 00:41:02,278
It's our wedding night.

962
00:41:03,837 --> 00:41:04,797
You're running away

963
00:41:05,438 --> 00:41:06,438
before performing the ceremony.

964
00:41:07,518 --> 00:41:10,438
Are you looking down upon me?

965
00:41:18,357 --> 00:41:20,557
It's not like this.

966
00:41:21,357 --> 00:41:22,678
I've got something to say.

967
00:41:22,758 --> 00:41:23,597
Don't worry, Dear.

968
00:41:24,718 --> 00:41:25,397
I've

969
00:41:26,557 --> 00:41:27,557
