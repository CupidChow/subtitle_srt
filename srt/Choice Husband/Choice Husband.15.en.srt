We

Why?

Because my heart
belongs to someone else.

It is against the social moral

69

and I was rejected by her too.

00:05:20,641 --> 00:05:22,880
But we cannot always have

he is defying Her Highness.

00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,681
with your confession at the port.

167
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,561
If he likes you,

168
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:06,361
why would he hurt you?

169
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:09,481
And even if we assume

170
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,881
the feelings he expressed today
are true,

171
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,160
power is still his utmost priority.

172
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,801
Where do you think
you rank in his heart?

173
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,121
Why are you taking risks for him?

174
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,801
Third Master Song.

175
00:10:23,801 --> 00:10:25,160
I admit that it's hard to read his mind.

176
00:10:26,681 --> 00:10:28,801
But all I can think about now

177
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,520
is to save him.

178
00:10:34,321 --> 00:10:36,121
Whether he was referring to me just now

179
00:10:37,481 --> 00:10:38,321
and regardless

180
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:39,121
of my ranking

181
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:40,600
in his list of priorities,

182
00:10:43,481 --> 00:10:44,760
I want him to live.

183
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,801
Humans are compassionate.

184
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:53,041
You know

185
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,681
what I've done for you

186
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,280
and you feel nothing at all?

187
00:10:58,881 --> 00:10:59,441
Miaomiao.

188
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:01,441
In the past three years,

189
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,640
was there a moment

190
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,760
when you developed some feelings...

191
00:11:05,241 --> 00:11:05,801
No.

192
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,801
Not even some.

193
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,881
Just an ounce of feeling for me?

194
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,760
Third Master Song.

195
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,760
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.

196
00:11:19,881 --> 00:11:21,481
I am grateful for what you've done

197
00:11:21,921 --> 00:11:23,001
for Xiao and my family.

198
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,840
And if you

199
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:26,760
are in danger today,

200
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,921
I will sacrifice my life to save you.

201
00:11:29,921 --> 00:11:31,361
But there's only friendship between us.

202
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:32,801
No romantic feelings.

203
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,241
As for Pei Yanzhen,

204
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,921
perhaps

205
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,321
I do take a liking to him.

206
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,561
Miao.

207
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,481
You can save him

208
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,121
but this is a complicated matter.

209
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:11,361
I have sent the housekeeper out

210
00:12:11,361 --> 00:12:13,361
to the capital with a few letters
to gather intel.

211
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:15,121
Return to your room first.

212
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,420
(Shen's Residence)

213
00:12:24,481 --> 00:12:26,681
Guard Zhan, I need your help.

214
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,520
Pei Yanzhen is a cautious person.

215
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,280
Did he leave you any instructions?

216
00:12:33,321 --> 00:12:34,001
He did.

217
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,441
You could have told me earlier.

218
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,160
Pei Yanzhen is now in prison.

219
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,080
Qin Miuzhen sure is getting bolder.

220
00:12:40,321 --> 00:12:41,801
She ignored my intervention

221
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:43,241
and took Pei Yanzhen away.

222
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,441
Once I'm back to the capital,

223
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:46,200
I'll be sure to report her behavior

224
00:12:46,441 --> 00:12:47,960
so that Mother can punish her.

225
00:12:50,881 --> 00:12:52,121
Say something!

226
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,441
He did leave some instructions but...

227
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:57,481
- But what?
- But what?

228
00:12:59,001 --> 00:13:01,321
He said you could only see it

229
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
once the dust settles.

230
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,561
Once the dust settles?

231
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,441
He will have been dead by then

232
00:13:06,441 --> 00:13:07,681
so what's the purpose of seeing it?

233
00:13:12,481 --> 00:13:12,921
I see.

234
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,720
Come with me, Miss Shen.

235
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,200

00:15:25,121 --> 00:15:26,280

251
00:15:26,441 --> 00:15:29,041
There, there.

252
00:15:33,361 --> 00:15:34,241
All right now.

253
00:15:46,121 --> 00:15:46,760
Miss Shen.

254
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:48,840
The Qin family is powerful

255
00:15:49,001 --> 00:15:49,760
and has eyes everywhere.

256
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,881
To protect you and your son,

257
00:15:53,921 --> 00:15:56,160
Yanzhen cut himself off from you
and feigned indifference.

258
00:15:57,441 --> 00:15:59,241
For three years, he trod carefully

259
00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:00,881
on thin ice,

260
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:03,361
but he told me to stay in Lingzhou

261
00:16:03,361 --> 00:16:04,640
to protect you and your son.

262
00:16:06,241 --> 00:16:08,080
The Qin family then began
targeting the Shen family.

263
00:16:09,121 --> 00:16:10,840
He was forced to grovel to them

264
00:16:11,441 --> 00:16:12,960
because he didn't want you to be harmed.

265
00:16:13,481 --> 00:16:14,840
He planned to dismantle them
from the inside.

266
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,881
If he already had a plan,

267
00:16:19,121 --> 00:16:20,200
why did he refuse the marriage

268
00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:21,681
sacrificing his life?

269
00:16:22,361 --> 00:16:23,241
You

270
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,801
already know the answer.

271
00:16:28,481 --> 00:16:29,520
I didn't foresee this either.

272
00:16:30,121 --> 00:16:31,441
He vowed to marry into

273
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,600
the Qin family and dismantle it.

274
00:16:35,241 --> 00:16:36,200
But he forgot

275
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,600
about them all when he saw you.

276
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,001
He must be ready to

277
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,720
face death when he was sent to prison.

278
00:16:43,681 --> 00:16:44,121
He hates to see you

279
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:45,960
misunderstand his feelings

280
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,321
after his death.

281
00:16:48,321 --> 00:16:49,121
So he said

282
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:51,681
I could only bring you here

283
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,881
once the dust has settled.

284
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:57,361
It seems like

285
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,441
we misunderstood him.

286
00:17:05,321 --> 00:17:07,400
If he knows that everything is a trap,

287
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:10,400
why did he happily walk into it?

288
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,561
He can die without a regret

289
00:17:13,561 --> 00:17:14,321
but what about me?

290
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,681
Does he want me to take my own life

291
00:17:16,681 --> 00:17:17,841
once I learn about this?

292
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,280
How selfish of him.

293
00:17:23,561 --> 00:17:24,120
Well...

294
00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:26,000
What should we do now?

295
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,400
If Yanzhen doesn't have a plan,

296
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,520
then he

297
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,880
will definitely die.

298
00:17:37,441 --> 00:17:38,441
Tell Pei Yanzhen

299
00:17:39,681 --> 00:17:40,760
that he will not have my forgiveness

300
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,921
with all this.

301
00:17:43,081 --> 00:17:44,921
He wants to end it like this

302
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,441
but I will not allow that.

303
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,201
Shen Miao!

304
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:49,120
Miss Shen.

305
00:17:53,201 --> 00:17:56,041
I came from a modest background
of a low-ranked official.

306
00:17:56,921 --> 00:17:58,120
I was selected to enter the palace

307
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,681
and was lucky enough to earn
the late emperor's favor.

308
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,360
But soon,

309
00:18:02,921 --> 00:18:04,441
he abandoned me.

310
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,561
Consequently, he didn't like you.

311
00:18:09,561 --> 00:18:10,721
During those years,

312
00:18:10,721 --> 00:18:13,041
we were looked down upon by many others.

313
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,000
Fortunately, First Prince died
of the sickness.

314
00:18:17,321 --> 00:18:19,081
Third Prince fell from a tree
and passed away.

315
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:20,321
Sixth Prince went missing.

316
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:22,160
Your uncle and I

317
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,921
worked hard to fend for ourselves
in the imperial court.

318
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,921
That is why

319
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:27,441
you have your current position.

320
00:18:28,201 --> 00:18:29,081
Have you forgotten?

321
00:18:31,201 --> 00:18:31,801
No, I have not.

322
00:18:31,801 --> 00:18:33,321
Yes, you have.

323
00:18:39,081 --> 00:18:40,520
Pei Yanzhen

324
00:18:41,201 --> 00:18:42,601
refused the marriage

325
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:44,681
and disrespected the royal family.

326
00:18:45,321 --> 00:18:46,441
He has committed an egregious crime

327
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,120
and should be killed to set an example.

328
00:18:49,441 --> 00:18:51,801
I have sent others
to deliver my judgment.

329
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,441
He is to be beheaded

330
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,280
tomorrow noon.

331
00:19:00,441 --> 00:19:01,041
Mother.

332
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,760
Pei Yanzhen is nonetheless
the head of a ministry.

333
00:19:05,681 --> 00:19:06,681
He's an important member
of the imperial court.

334
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,441
You can't possibly kill him like that.

335
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:10,561
I'm sure he has a reason

336
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,081
to turn down the marriage.

337
00:19:12,441 --> 00:19:13,280
- So...
- Your Majesty.

338
00:19:14,081 --> 00:19:15,360
A good sword is only complete

339
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,000
with a good scabbard.

340
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,160
It is true

341
00:19:18,801 --> 00:19:20,681
that Pei Yanzhen has contributed a lot

342
00:19:20,681 --> 00:19:21,921
to the capital.

343
00:19:22,441 --> 00:19:25,120
And he also returned the power
to govern to you.

344
00:19:25,201 --> 00:19:26,321
You want to keep him alive.

345
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,601
Is it because there is more to be done

346
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,280
or because you want my head

347
00:19:34,801 --> 00:19:36,360
and the Qin family's demise?

348
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,000
General Qin!

349
00:19:39,561 --> 00:19:40,201
Enough.

350
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:45,160
I have made up my mind.

351
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:47,201
Son.

352
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,880
Do not let one person ruin

353
00:19:50,561 --> 00:19:52,321
the harmony of the royal family.

354
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,400
(Lingzhou Prison)

355
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:08,561
You have a visitor.

356
00:20:15,921 --> 00:20:16,640
Pei Yanzhen.

357
00:20:17,561 --> 00:20:19,081
If I'm not mistaken,

358
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:20,921
His Majesty and you planned

359
00:20:21,441 --> 00:20:22,760
to marry Qin Miuzhen first

360
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,000
before dismantling
the Qin family from the inside.

361
00:20:25,961 --> 00:20:26,441
But

362
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:29,000
why would an astute person like you

363
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,921
turn himself in?

364
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,280
How foolish.

365
00:20:36,321 --> 00:20:37,681
Say whatever you want.

366
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,601
Once I'm dead,

367
00:20:40,681 --> 00:20:43,601
please take good care
of Miao and her son.

368
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,640
I will do that

369
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,681
with or without your reminder.

370
00:20:52,921 --> 00:20:53,841
The Qin family is the one

371
00:20:53,841 --> 00:20:55,760
stirring up trouble in Zhezhe Tavern.

372
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,760
You are too weak

373
00:21:00,561 --> 00:21:01,880
to fight against them.

374
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:15,441
Now that I'm jailed,

375
00:21:19,681 --> 00:21:22,120
the Qin family will try to entice you
to join them.

376
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,681
I'm about to meet my end.

377
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,760
But before I do that,

378
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,640
I want to work with you one last time.

379
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,041
Go ahead.

380
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,561
I might not agree to it though.

381
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,681
But I know

382
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,441
your feelings towards Shen Miao.

383
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,841
Please be a spy

384
00:21:45,801 --> 00:21:46,681
in the Qin family.

385
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,480
Tell His Majesty what they plan to do
and what they are doing.

386
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,921
Only by getting rid of the Qin family,

387
00:21:57,601 --> 00:21:58,400
the Shen family

388
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:01,360
can be saved.

389
00:22:10,321 --> 00:22:10,841
Thank you.

390
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,640
Pei Yanzhen has committed a huge crime.

391
00:22:20,441 --> 00:22:21,841
No one can visit him.

392
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,041
Sir.

393
00:22:35,601 --> 00:22:37,160
Help yourself to it.

394
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,520
Sir.

395
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,841
I am Official Pei's ex-spouse.

396
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,480
Because of me,

397
00:22:47,921 --> 00:22:50,201
he is stuck
in this precarious situation.

398
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,921
I know very well

399
00:22:51,921 --> 00:22:53,441
that seeing him is a luxury for me, sir.

400
00:23:00,201 --> 00:23:02,280
Official Pei is a respectable

401
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,480
and loyal man.

402
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,561
I'll be frank

403
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,081
with you.

404
00:23:09,081 --> 00:23:10,601
Someone told me

405
00:23:11,601 --> 00:23:13,520
that regardless of
how much you bribe me,

406
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:16,160
as long as I refuse your entry,

407
00:23:16,681 --> 00:23:19,321
I will be paid double your bribery.

408
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,721
- So...
- Who asked you to do that?

409
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,480
I...

410
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:24,681
Please, sir.

413
00:23:33,841 --> 00:23:35,321
I...

414
00:23:35,841 --> 00:23:36,921
You can have them all.

415
00:23:37,441 --> 00:23:39,240
A peek.

416
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,041
Just one peek.

417
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,601
He only promised you that,

418
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,200
but he might refuse to deliver it
when you actually ask for it.

419
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,681
Do you know how others describe him

420
00:23:48,681 --> 00:23:49,880
outside of Lingzhou?

421
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,721
Petty and stingy.

422
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:53,240
Besides,

423
00:23:53,801 --> 00:23:54,681
he won't know,

424
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:56,081
will he?

425
00:23:56,681 --> 00:23:57,360
You think so?

00:24:07,081 --> 00:24:07,841
Miaomiao.

427
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:10,120
I'll ask you again.

428
00:24:11,681 --> 00:24:12,360
Is he worth it?

429
00:24:14,081 --> 00:24:15,000
It's a life nonetheless.

430
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,041
I thought you would give up

431
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,441
if you see him

432
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,640
get married.

433
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,400
We can talk

434

Sorry.

It's all my fault.

or pity.

out of my own volition.

My bridal march will sprawl ten lis.

The ceremony will be grander

459
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,360
than yours from yesterday.

460
00:26:47,721 --> 00:26:48,360
Much grander.

Don't be silly now.

Your bride was kidnapped once.

You refused a marriage too.

No.

I let you remarry. I left you.

are my regrets.

But I hate myself.

I hate that I did not defy the edict

What's the point of saying this now?

I won't allow it.

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,921
Why refuse the marriage?
Why defy the edict?

You endured everything for three years.

if you defy the edict?

491

And if you're dead,

492
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,561
you'll lose everything.

If I carry on,

494

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,801
about this witch

I'm long acquainted with those slanders.

You're just taking your incompetency
out on us,

The Empress Dowager

It'd better be a joke.

548
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,280
Otherwise, it would lead me

549
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,201
to think

550
00:32:58,681 --> 00:33:00,240
that you have a penchant
for divorced men.

551

Just one after another.

552

You're funny, Master Song.

553

Her Highness said you could do better

than being a mere court purveyor.

After all, it's the lowest

After the death of Pei Yanzhen,

the Qin family can recommend you

You'll be part of the elite.
What do you think?

560
00:33:25,201 --> 00:33:26,921
As long as it's not a marriage,
it is negotiable.

561
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,601
But I know very well

562
00:33:28,921 --> 00:33:30,441
that everything comes with a price.

563

Now, name the price.

You will have to serve the Qin family.

He couldn't see you the entire day

570
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:08,960
so he cried a lot.

571
00:34:09,601 --> 00:34:10,440
I just put him to sleep.

Mother, were you talking
about Great-uncle?

They asked me to call him Great-uncle.

But every time you see him,
you are beside yourself.

Is this what happens

I won't do it again.

00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,361
Pei Yanzhen!

669
00:40:05,081 --> 00:40:05,520
Official Pei!

670
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,200
Wake up.

671
00:40:06,841 --> 00:40:07,520
Pei Yanzhen.

672
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,321
Immunity Token does exist?

673
00:40:15,161 --> 00:40:16,401
I have investigated thoroughly.

674
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,561
The token was given

675
00:40:18,801 --> 00:40:21,161
to the Pei family by the Grand Emperor

676
00:40:21,161 --> 00:40:22,801
because they saved his life.

677
00:40:23,361 --> 00:40:25,801
As they settled in Lingzhou

678
00:40:26,121 --> 00:40:27,200
and their power declined,

679
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,121
it slowly faded out of history.

680
00:40:31,801 --> 00:40:33,000
If it exists,

681
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,200
why didn't he use it earlier?

682
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,081
He suffered in jail for nothing then.

683
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,960
Shen Miao came with the token.

684
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:47,720
He gave this protective item
to the Shen family?

685
00:40:48,561 --> 00:40:50,081
Did lust cloud his judgment?

686
00:40:51,841 --> 00:40:52,960
I think

687
00:40:53,561 --> 00:40:54,680
Pei Yanzhen

688
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,121
has an ulterior motive.

689
00:41:00,121 --> 00:41:00,960
He covets

690
00:41:02,121 --> 00:41:04,601
the fortune of the Shen family?

691
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,361
Either way,

692
00:41:10,161 --> 00:41:12,720
Pei Yanzhen is all battered and bruised.

693
00:41:13,561 --> 00:41:15,480
He won't be able
to return to the capital.

694
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,361
(Daqing Gate)
(Per His Majesty's imperial edict,)

695
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,401
(Pei Yanzhen challenged
the imperial authority)

696
00:41:30,401 --> 00:41:31,641
(and defied the edict.)

697
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:33,641
(Although he is spared
from a death sentence,)

698
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,760
(he is no longer a role model
among the officials.)

699
00:41:36,361 --> 00:41:38,920
(Shen's Residence)
(His title will be revoked)

700
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,520
(and he will be demoted to commoner.)

701
00:41:40,561 --> 00:41:41,720
(He is to return to his hometown)

702
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,401
(and his residence
will be sequestrated.)

703
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,000
(Thus concludes the imperial edict.)

704
00:41:55,401 --> 00:41:59,440
Fly. Fly.

705
00:42:00,041 --> 00:42:00,841
Fly already.

706
00:42:02,641 --> 00:42:04,841
Xiao, if it flies away,

707
00:42:05,121 --> 00:42:06,200
it will never come back.

708
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,641
Are you mad now?

709
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,841
Master Song, you are now an esteemed
guest of the Qin family.

710
00:42:11,121 --> 00:42:12,240
Why did you come here?

711
00:42:13,121 --> 00:42:14,081
He isn't.

712
00:42:15,601 --> 00:42:16,960
Xiao, listen to me.

713
00:42:18,321 --> 00:42:18,881
Xiyuan,

714
00:42:19,081 --> 00:42:21,240
how can you be a bad guy

715
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,200
and harm Great-uncle?

716
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,321
Mother and I don't want to see you.

717
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,881
It's your bird.

718
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,401
Take it away.

719
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:28,920
