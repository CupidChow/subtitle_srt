20
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,280
My mother once told me

21
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,640
that the lines on our palm

22
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,400
are the marks
from the hair of our loved one

23
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,320
when we got married in our past life.

24
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,960
Tell me.

25
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,080
How deeply do you have to love someone

26
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,799
that you'll hold her hair
until its marks

27
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:08,720
are etched onto your palm?

28
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,520
If you can really have marks
on your palm from hair,

29
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,399
I think you'll have to pull out
all of the hair.

30
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:32,039
Then, the loved one will be too unlucky.

31
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,599
My mother loved my father so much.

32
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,160
But in the end,

33
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,959
she just lost her life
without getting anything.

34
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,080
I can't accept it.

35
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:54,880
Miaomiao.

36
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,559
All these years,

37
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,720
my aunts were everywhere,

38
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:02,800
my brothers were spying on me,

39
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:05,199
and my family business
was almost ruined.

40
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:07,160
I had no one to rely on.

41
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,160
I put in a lot of effort to survive.

42
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,000
And I managed to keep
the Song family alive.

43
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,599
And I made it to where I am today.

44
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,319
I know that a person

45
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,880
shouldn't have all the good things
in this world in his possession.

46
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:31,839
When you've got what you asked for,

47
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,640
you should be content with it.

48
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,080
But,

49
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,880
I just want to be greedy for this once.

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,039
Do you understand?

51
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:45,000
Okay.

52
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,479
I admit it.

53
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,959
Your mother really loved your father.

54
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,280
She loved him deeply.

55
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:59,280
At least her love was deeper
than the treasury of the Song family.

56
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,479
Is that the only thing you heard?

57
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,199
You don't make sense.

58
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,360
You are the one
who forced me to admit it, right?

59
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:13,640
In my opinion,

60
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:18,719
I rather believe
that there are ghosts in this world

61
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:23,640
instead of anything that a man says.

62
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,479
So what if your father

63
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:32,279
had planted a whole forest
of bayberry trees for your mother?

64
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,879
In the end, he still had
so many concubines.

65
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,279
And your mother

66
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:42,520
died in hatred.

67
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,400
Let me tell you.

68
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,319
Now,

69
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,560
I don't have any love in me anymore.

70
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,680
Only anger.

71
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,759
But

72
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,039
my mother told me before she died

73
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,279
that she didn't regret anything at all.

74
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,479
At first, I thought
that she was quite stubborn.

75
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,240
But now,

76
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,680
I have

77
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,599
the same mindset as her.

78
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,199
Maybe I shouldn't have

79
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,759
married you in the beginning.

80
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,159
I should've stuck
to my duty as the master,

81
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,159
focused on protecting my family business

82
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,479
and expanded the business
of the Song family.

83
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,800
I shouldn't let myself
get troubled by love.

84
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,360
But

85
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:00,360
the luckiest thing

86
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,199
in this life of mine

87
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,439
is meeting you.

88
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,560
Let her go.

89
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,980
(Shen's Residence)

90
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,759
Third Master Song.

91
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,400
Why are you still here?

92
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,960
I can't hold my liquor well.

93
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,240
Did I take advantage of you?

94
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,640
Miao.

95
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,680
Why are you here?

96
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,080
Why can't I be here?

97
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,400
Since you have no feelings for me,

98
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,199
why do you continue to tease me?

99
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:22,840
Since you have feelings for me,

100
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:25,439
why did you do that yesterday?

101
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:27,599
Yesterday?

102
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,120
What happened yesterday?

103
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,240
Don't worry.

104
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,120
You were drunk last night.

105
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,599
So, I took you back.

106
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:38,800
That was it.

107
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,080
Thank you.

108
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,599
Don't worry.

109
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:47,879
No one will find out
that I came into your room.

110
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:49,520
I'll leave now.

111
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:55,360
Be careful when you leave.

112
00:07:57,999 --> 00:07:58,879
I will be careful.

113
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,439
I won't let someone see me
walking out of your room.

114
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:04,319
Pei Yanzhen.

115
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:05,960
You are the one who did me wrong.

116
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,279
Why are you being sarcastic here

117
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,840
instead of going back to Miss Qin?

118
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,560
Do you want me to marry
another woman so badly?

119
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,520
Do you think

120
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,039
I will dare to put my hopes
on you again?

121
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,360
When His Majesty ordered us
to divorce four years ago,

122
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,479
I should've fought against it.

123
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,879
I didn't know

124
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,599
that it would cause so much trouble

125
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:22,800
until the two of us

126
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,279
were forced into this dilemma.

127
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,279
You are the only one who's in a dilemma.

128
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,240
Why will it be hard for you

129
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,279
to lose me?

130
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,560
I'm just a woman,

131
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,159
Official Pei.

132
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,959
You are talented,
powerful and respected.

133
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:36,440
You can have any women you want.

134
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,399
You...

135
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,760
Three years ago, I had just given birth.

136
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:39,599
I wasn't thinking properly.

137
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,560
I got carried away

138
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,680
and disturbed your peace.

139
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,639
And I must have gone crazy yesterday

140
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,440
to humiliate myself
in front of everyone.

141
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,240
It seems like Miss Qin
is infatuated with you.

142
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,079
When you marry her,

143
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,639
the Shen family
will give you a huge gift.

144
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:56,479
And please don't stop me
from finding my love too.

145
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,560
Are you talking about Song Xiyuan?

146
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,279
It's none of your business.

147
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,519
Let go of my mother!

148
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,240
Xiao.

149
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,800
Mother, don't be afraid.

150
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,959
I won't let

151
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,039
this bad man who hurt Xiyuan bully you.

152
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,719
Let's go, Xiao.

153
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,279
Take me to Xiyuan.

154
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,320
Let's go.

155
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,920
You are a bad guy!

156
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:39,959
Miaomiao.

157
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,279
Is this bronze mirror curved outward?

158
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,079
What?

159
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:44,800
Is my face swollen?

160
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,839
This is

161
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:50,719
a convex mirror to start with.

162
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,079
And its surface is rough.

163
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,039
Before this,

164
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,920
Lvying accidentally dropped it.

165
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,839
And it became worse
than your face right now.

166
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,320
Because it's an ancient relic,

167
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,639
we got it fixed

168
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:01,599
and continued to use it.

169
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,279
Are you comforting the mirror

170
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,240
or are you comforting me?

171
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,440
You are a handsome

172
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,399
and charming man.

173
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:10,399
You don't need me to comfort you.

174
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:15,800
Xiyuan, are you in pain?

175
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,680
This is so painful.

176
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,320
Xiyuan, let me blow
on your wounds for you, okay?

177
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,279
Then, you won't be in pain.

178
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:25,839
Sure.

179
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,680
You are such a good boy.

180
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,800
No wonder they say people
raise kids to provide for their old age.

181
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:36,880
Xiao.

182
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
Your treatment

183
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,320
is more effective than
any of the medicine out there.

184
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,039
Xiao, go out and play.

185
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:44,760
Okay.

186
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,560
Go.

187
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,680
You know martial arts, right?

188
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,800
How did Pei Yanzhen
beat you up like this?

189
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,760
What happened last night?

190
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,000
Miaomiao.

191
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:05,399
You are not allowed to mention
that violent, shameless,

192
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,440
cruel, unreasonable,
sinister and cunning man.

193
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,959
He's indeed violent, shameless,

194
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:11,719
cruel, unreasonable,
sinister and cunning.

195
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:13,440
You have to believe me.

196
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,360
Look at these wounds on my face.

197
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,800
He caught me off guard.

198
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,440
Despicable and foul.

199
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,560
I'm being serious.

200
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,839
Why are you looking at me?

201
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,800
I want to see

202
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,719
when you can stop

203
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:29,000
being so dramatic.

204
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,440
Pei Yanzhen is not better than me.

205
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,399
He just reads more than I do.

206
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,200
But

207
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,079
last night,

208
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:44,479
no matter what you wanted to do to me,

209
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,279
I was a willing participant.

210
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,479
Third Master Song.

211
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,560
No matter what happened last night,

212
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,399
I've always wanted to tell you

213
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,920
that I

214
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,200
have...

215
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,719
Why are you bleeding again?

216
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:10,959
Let me dress your wound for you.

217
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:21,120
Here.

218
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,880
Miaomiao.

219
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:34,639
I'm a little bit hungry.

220
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,560
I haven't eaten the porridge
that the servant sent.

221
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,800
But I am...

222
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,000
I'll help you.

223
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:39,959
Okay.

224
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,599
Here.

225
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,479
It's delicious.

226
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:22,839
Thank you.

227
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,599
But

228
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,440
if you really want to thank me,

229
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,000
let's go to the street market today.

230
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,279
It's Qixi Festival tonight.

231
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,800
We can forget all troubles

232
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,959
and enjoy it to the fullest.

233
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:37,039
What do you say?

234
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,959
Are you not interested?

235
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,360
Is it because Pei Yanzhen...

236
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:45,880
I'll go.

237
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,560
He's the one who should regret it.

238
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,440
Not me.

239
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:50,440
Why shouldn't I go?

240
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,560
Great.

241
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,240
Beautiful scented sachet is here.

242
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,719
It's so lively here. Are you having fun?

243
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:10,800
Look. Are these lanterns pretty?

244
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,039
Miss, take a look at these lanterns.

245
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,920
Miaomiao, you have a unique taste.

246
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,240
Sir, all of my lanterns are unique.

247
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,360
You can choose one
for your wife and son.

248
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,639
That's my plan. My dear.

249
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:27,399
I'm not his...

250
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,360
Miaomiao, talk much, and err much.

251
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:30,959
How much for one?

252
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:32,599
It's the Qixi Festival today.

253
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,120
So, you have to solve some riddles.

254
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,399
Riddles?

255
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,039
I'm not good at riddles.

256
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,039
But I have a lot of money.

257
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,320
Stop squandering your money.

258
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,719
They have the pitch-pot too.

259
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,639
You are good at that.

260
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,240
We can play pitch-pot here?

261
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:46,320
Where are your eyes?

262
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,680
I only have eyes for you and Xiao.

263
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:51,240
Other stalls only provide
the riddle option.

264
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,880
Only you have the pitch-pot option.

265
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,479
After seeing your stall,

266
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:56,479
I realize that other stalls
are so uncreative.

267
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,440
Here.

268
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,159
I'll play your game.

269
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,240
Sir, this is too much.

270
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:01,479
It's not.

271
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,639
Excuse me.

272
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:07,639
Go ahead, Sir.

273
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:09,120
Put Xiao down.

274
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,800
Xiao, I'll play it
while carrying you, okay?

275
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,599
Okay.

276
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,079
Sir, go ahead.

277
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:16,959
Sir,

278
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,200
I want to do it blindfolded.

279
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:20,479
- What?
- Blindfolded?

280
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,200
Okay.

281
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,440
Here. This is the first arrow.

282
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,839
- Great!
- Great!

283
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:19,880
Sir.

284
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,599
- Great!
- Great!

285
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:30,519
Sir.

286
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,719
- Great!
- Great!

287
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:40,360
You are amazing.

288
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,399
Let me get the lantern for you.

289
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,639
What do you think?

290
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,120
Not bad.

291
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:49,800
Sir.

292
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,719
Here's your lantern.

293
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:52,800
Xiao.

294
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,719
Doesn't this look like the cat

295
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:56,120
that I gave you and Miaomiao?

296
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:57,360
Yes.

297
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:57,920
Right?

298
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,719
Thanks to your capability,

299
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:04,239
I'll accept this lantern
on behalf of Xiao first.

300
00:17:05,999 --> 00:17:06,639
Thank you.

301
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,800
Xiao, what else do you want to play?

302
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,279
I want to eat Tanghulu.

303
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:12,279
You want Tanghulu?

304
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,960
Okay. Let's look
for the Tanghulu then.

305
00:17:16,639 --> 00:17:17,080
Come.

306
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:27,960
Be careful.

307
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:31,440
Here. One for you, mother.

308
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,639
One for you, Xiyuan.

309
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:36,519
One for Xiaoxiao.

310
00:17:36,879 --> 00:17:38,279
Xiao, I'm carrying you now.

311
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:39,320
I can't take it.

312
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,119
I'll hold it for you then.

313
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,480
Thank you.

314
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:47,560
Miaomiao.

315
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,840
I really hope

316
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:52,399
that this moment can stay still forever.

317
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,680
But I'm famished.

318
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,720
If this moment stays still forever,

319
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,239
I'll be hungry forever.

320
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,920
I'm delicious enough to eat.

321
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,239
You have such a glib tongue.

322
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:08,239
Okay. Let's go and eat.

323
00:18:09,879 --> 00:18:10,399
Let's go.

324
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:10,960
Xiao.

325
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,399
Let's go and eat.

326
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,440
Let's go.

327
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,480
Are you happy, Xiaoxiao?

328
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,440
Be careful.

329
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,840
Are you happy, Xiaoxiao?

330
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:23,239
Be careful.

331
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,239
They are fighting together.

332
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,759
Xiao, be careful.

333
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:36,920
Xiao, are you happy today?

334
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,239

Miaomiao, let me tell you.

Pei Yanzhen is really not a good man.

He's really the master of seduction

He disgusts me.

658
00:39:21,379 --> 00:39:22,260
Others might think

659
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:24,260
that you are here
to steal the groom.

660
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:27,500
I won't lose in appearance
even if I lose him.

Pei Yanzhen.

Getting married is part
of your and His Majesty's plan.

663
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,179
You have to bear with it.

664
00:39:39,899 --> 00:39:42,179
I understand.
You don't have to remind me.

665
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,339
My fellow guests.
The auspicious time has arrived.

666

it's good for me.

677
00:40:47,859 --> 00:40:50,540
I don't have to pine after you
anymore like a clown.

678
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:52,179
Miao.

679
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:53,899
You don't understand.

680

Let's talk in the backyard.

681
00:40:56,139 --> 00:40:56,859
You shouldn't.

682
00:40:58,139 --> 00:41:01,379
You should be with your bride.

683

It's your wedding today.

684
00:41:03,339 --> 00:41:04,139
If you delay it,

685
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:06,139
your bride will be upset.

686
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,060
I don't remember inviting you.

687
00:41:09,579 --> 00:41:11,139
Because I'm here

688
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,659

689
