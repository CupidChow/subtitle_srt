Do you know

that both of you are relatives?

You can't get married.

It's taboo!

If you don't give up on your marriage,

you will be executed.

Did you call a physician?

54
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:04,399
This is a chronic illness.

(Pei's Father, Pei's Mother)
I'm afraid it's untreatable.

I'm dying soon.

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240
I only hope

65
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,479
they stop questioning

66
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,439
and investigating.

67
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,319
I just hope

68
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:42,999
you can be safe.

69

70
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,159
I'm afraid they are already suspicious.

71
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:56,240
I already gave you the jade pendant
the late emperor rewarded me with.

72
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,279
I'm just afraid that...

What happened?

79
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,520
The people of the clan were asking

80
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,840
about your divorce again.

81
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,080
One of the clan elders

82
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,560
was asking about your background.

83
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,479
He said many things.

84
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,719
Master Pei was anxious

85
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:21,360
so he...

86
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,719
Old Master.

87
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,240
Call the physician!

93
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,800
(Shen's Residence)
An imperial edict from His Majesty.

94
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,240
Pei and Shen must divorce immediately.

95
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,080
That's all.

96
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,199
Shen.

97
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,240
Why won't you accept the imperial edict?

98
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,520
I didn't expect a small marriage

99
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,759
in a small city like Lingzhou

100
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:52,800
would catch the attention of His Majesty

101
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,840
to the point of forcing a divorce
through an imperial edict.

102
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,719
How dare you!

103

Think about it carefully.

Do you know the consequences of
going against an imperial edict?

107
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,120
I understand

108
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:16,920
His Majesty's intention.

109
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,039
My father is old.

110
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,719
He also loves me the most.

111
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,240
After this incident,

112
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,800
he is probably feeling anxious.

113
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,199
Please forgive him.

114
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,319
Official Pei
has a bright future ahead of him

115

and is currently progressing well.

116
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,920
If Miss Shen interfered with his future

117
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,840
and bring danger to the Shen family

118
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,800
because of your selfishness,

119
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,120
who will take responsibility for this?

120
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,120
Yes. I understand.

(luxuriant display)

122
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,439
Are we just
going to let this incident go?

123
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,800
Old Master, please say something.

124
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,199
Things aren't that bad yet.

125
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,759
I will send a letter to the capital
and think of a way.

126
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,159
If we can discuss a few more days,

127
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,719
there must be a way.

128
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:17,719
Forget it.

129
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,439
Civilians should
never fight with officials.

130
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,680
I wanted a divorce anyway.

131
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,759
It saves me the trouble.

132
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:44,640
I'm leaving.

133
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,759
I need to send the divorce letter
to the Pei family.

134
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:48,840
Miao!

135
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:13,879
Uncles. What's the meaning of this?

136
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,319
Magistrate.

137
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,719
I'm not being unreasonable

138
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,319
but you insist on
not divorcing your wife.

139
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:24,199
Now, you are no longer
a part of the Pei clan.

140
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:26,080
Since you are not part of the clan,

141
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,840
how can you simply ask someone
to enter the residence?

142
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,439
Even if I'm not from the clan,

143
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:32,880
I can still be filial as someone's son.

144
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,639
Ask them to move away.

145
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,000
Who dares to do that?

146
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,719
I'll see who dares to move!

147
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:44,360
Why not?

148
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,320
How dare you disrespect your elders

149
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:48,240
outside your father's room.

150
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,279
What are you trying to do?

151
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,479
Pei Yanzhen.

152
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:56,039
I watched you grow up.

153
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,880
I know you have a firm resolve

154
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,880
and extraordinary talent.

155
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,760
You will definitely be
someone powerful in the future.

156
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,880
That is why I cannot

157
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,279
see you spoiling your career

158
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,440
as the clan leader.

159
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,519
Listen to me.

160
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,000
Since we are from the same clan,

161
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:14,760
just be tolerant.

162
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,000
All of you say you are doing this for me

163
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,479
but you won't treat my father
when he is seriously ill.

164
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,519
Is that how you treat someone
from the same clan?

165
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:27,880
Zhan Yue.

166
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,079
Call a physician!

167
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:34,079

Regarding the Shen family,

333
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:35,840
you...

334
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,720
Miao is my wife.

335
00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:40,480
That will never change.

336
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:43,960
I have a plan regarding the thing in the
Shen family that affects the situation.

337
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,399
However, we must be patient.

338
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,399
We must live on.

339
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,600
Hold it!

340
00:19:50,999 --> 00:19:52,200
Brat, where did you come from?

341
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,320
This is Pei's residence.

342
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,119
You can't trespass.

343
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:54,639
Move!

344
00:19:55,639 --> 00:19:56,159
Stop.

345
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,680
See?

346
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,239
This is my Master.

347
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:01,320
Who do you think you are?

348
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,879
You'll regret it later.

349
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:03,920
Official.

350
00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:05,119
Ninth Princess.

351
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,920
Ninth Princess?

352
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:08,480
Your Highness!

353
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,080
May Your Highness be blessed.

354
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,440
I was blind!

355
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,320
Please forgive me!

356
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,999
I have no time for you.

357
00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:14,560
Move.

358
00:20:17,239 --> 00:20:18,080
Yanzhen.

359
00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:19,480
When did Your Highness come to Lingzhou?

360
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:21,239
I did not
receive any official documents.

361
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,239
I came out without Mother's knowledge.

362
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,239
Yanzhen.

363
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:25,999
I have something important to tell you.

364
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,080
Let's talk inside.

365
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:27,800
A man and a woman

366
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
shouldn't be alone in a room.

367
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:30,239
Your Highness,

368
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:31,239
just say it here.

369
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,239
I forgave you

370
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,680
for lying to me.

371
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,080
Why are you still

372
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,560
rejecting me?

373
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:39,920
I came here

374
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:41,920
to report this to you.

375
00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:43,119
Yanzhen.

376
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,480
How did you offend my mother?

377
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:46,840
She even sent

378
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,440
the royal guards all the way here
to investigate you.

379
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,279
You must be careful.

380
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,759
The empress dowager
wants to investigate me?

381
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:54,639
Yes.

382
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,999
I heard it myself.

383
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,159
You need to thank me.

384
00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:02,800
They divorced for real?

385
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:06,399
I dare not lie to Your Majesty.

386
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:16,720
Mother.

387
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,759
Pei Yanzhen could

388
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:20,600
give up the riches of the Shen family.

389
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:23,359
It seems like
he doesn't have any evil intentions.

390
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:25,080
In my opinion,

391
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,399
if he is a capable official,

392
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:28,840
he might become

393
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,200
one of my trusted aides in the future.

394
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:34,840
Your Majesty.

395
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:38,119
How can you be so reckless
when you observe someone?

396
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,800
You are the emperor.

397
00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:41,999
You must be calm.

398
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,039
Being impatient

399
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,519
and making your feelings apparent

400
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:47,840
isn't right.

401
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:51,320
Yes.

402
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:54,720
I heard Jiu went to Lingzhou

403
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:56,680
with your document.

404
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,159
Mother.

405
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:03,759
Jiu is my sister after all.

406
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:05,239
Blood is thicker than water.

407
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,999
She admires Yanzhen

408
00:22:07,399 --> 00:22:08,680
and threatened me with her life.

409
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,519
That was why I...

410
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:10,119
Nonsense!

411
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:11,920
Don't you know

412
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,320
Pei Yanzhen's identity
even if Jiu doesn't?

413
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,200
But Mother,

414
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,920
we have no evidence.

415
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,560
We shouldn't ruin Yanzhen's future

416
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:20,440
because of some clues.

417
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,680
Between his future

418
00:22:21,879 --> 00:22:23,159
and your throne,

419
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:24,879
do you think I need to make a choice?

420
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:26,680
But I believe in Yanzhen's character.

421
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:27,519
I also believe...

422
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:28,200
Nonsense!

423
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,119
Do you really

424
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,999
want to get rid of everyone
that I can use?

425
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,239
You need to know

426
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,840
that I'm doing this for your own good.

427
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,759
I'd rather
kill ten thousand innocent people

428
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,159
instead of letting one traitor live.

429
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,200
Well,

430
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,720
if that is not Pei Yanzhen's identity,

431
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,119
I can let him stay alive.

432
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:12,920
For real?

433
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,200
Now that Pei and Shen have divorced,

434
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,720
you need to think about

435
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:23,879
getting Shen Miao into the palace.

436
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:25,920
Shen Miao?

437
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,560
Mother,

438
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,879
Shen Miao

439
00:23:31,239 --> 00:23:32,320
is a divorced woman.

440
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,800
What's wrong with that?

441
00:23:35,639 --> 00:23:37,399
I want you to marry her

442
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:39,200
but I didn't ask you to love her.

443
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,639
Do you think

444
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:43,039
I want her as your wife?

445
00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:02,560
Sister.

446
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,359
Isn't there target shooting
at the Dragon Boat Festival?

447
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,039
It hasn't started yet.

448
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,600
It'll be strange if you can see it.

449
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,960
Look at that distance.

450
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,960
You eat so much candy.

451
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,759
All your teeth might fall off.

452
00:24:15,999 --> 00:24:18,480
Just like the teacher who taught us?

453
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,560
Exactly.

454
00:24:19,639 --> 00:24:20,879
See if you dare eat again.

455
00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:22,159
Father said

456
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,680
the teacher's teeth fell

457
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,601
because he recites all those poems.

458
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:28,600
Don't listen to his nonsense.

459
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,480
Why doesn't
Brother-in-law's teeth fall off?

460
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,800
I heard

461
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,680
he is good at writing poems too.

462
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,399
That is the reason why

463
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,159
he became your former brother-in-law.

464
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,560
Former brother-in-law?

465
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,960
Master, this way.

466
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:49,720
Please.

467
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,960
Master San is here!

468
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:52,359
Master San?

469
00:24:52,639 --> 00:24:53,359
Who is he?

470
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,080
I don't know.

471
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:07,080
Brother-in-law?

472
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:07,800
Sister.

473
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:09,119
Brother-in-law is there.

474
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:09,879
What?

475
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:19,680
Stop calling him brother-in-law
from now on.

476
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:21,680
I got rid of his title.

477
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,340
(Lingzhou Pier)

478
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,680
Good!

479
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,399
All of you...

480
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:50,800
Stop pushing!

481
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,840
Miss!

482
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:57,279
-Sister!
-Miss!

483
00:25:57,399 --> 00:25:58,320
-What?
-Sister!

484
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,840
There's actually a lady
who would jump into the water

485
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:00,639
to catch my attention?

486
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:01,239
What's wrong

487
00:26:01,239 --> 00:26:02,239
with the ladies of Lingzhou City?

488
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:03,840
They'd sacrifice their life
for Third Master Song?

489
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,239
Help!

490
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:05,440
Isn't that Miss Shen?

491
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,560
Help!

492
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:08,560
Help! I can't swim!

493
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:19,159
Help!

494
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:19,960
Help!

495
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:32,480
Miss. You got what you wanted.

496
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,039
Being admired by a pretty lady

497
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,920
is a normal thing.

498
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,519
However, jumping into the river

499
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,800
is a very dangerous act.

500
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,960
Master, please don't misunderstand.

501
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:42,920
I don't

502
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:44,480
feel anything about you.

503
00:26:50,879 --> 00:26:51,440
Miao.

504
00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:52,960
Are you all right?

505
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,159
I'm fine.

506
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,639
Don't hold me so tight.

507
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,560
Make way!

508
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,639
Make way!

509
00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:00,519
Miss!

510
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,639
Former brother-in-law.

511
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,119
I'm your brother-in-law

512
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,239
no matter when.

513
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,080
Sorry for being rude.

514
00:27:06,639 --> 00:27:08,399
Since this lady admires me,

515
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,279
the time matters.

516
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,119
Right,

517
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:11,840
Miss?

518
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,080
Miss Shen is having an affair?

519
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,720
What a good show.

520
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,359
What are you talking about?

521
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:21,840
Didn't you hear about their divorce?

522
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:24,680
It's not what you think.

523
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,920
You must believe me.

524
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:27,159
We are not...

525
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,560
I'm betting five taels of silver.

526
00:27:28,879 --> 00:27:30,680
She already had an affair
with Master Song

527
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:31,960
before her divorce.

528
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,039
My head hurts!

529
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:43,320
I'm feeling dizzy!

530
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,440
Miao. Miao!

531
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:44,920
Miss.

532
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:47,080
Miss!

533
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,800
Former Master.

534
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,720
You should send Miss back.

535
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,399
She is weak

536
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:55,039
and can't stand the chills.

537
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:55,480
Miao.

538
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,840
I'm taking you back now.

539
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,020
(Shen's Residence)

540
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:17,279
Miss is back.

541
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,279
What's wrong with Miss?

542
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,800
Thank you, Official Pei.

543
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,800
Carry Miss here.

544
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:24,840
No need.

545
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,960
Order the servants to boil some water.

546
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:27,920
Lvying.

547
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,119
Get Miao some clean clothes.

548
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:29,440
Yes.

549
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:29,960
Shen Da.

550
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,600
Call a physician.

551
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,639
(Peace and Prosperity)

552
00:28:55,639 --> 00:28:56,200
This way.

553
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:12,660
(Peace and Prosperity)

554
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,239
Take care, Physician.

555
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:24,480
Aunt.

556
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:25,680
How is she?

557
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:27,519
Miao is fine.

558
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,759
She was frightened.

559
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,720
She will become better

560
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,720
after drinking some calming soup
and getting some rest.

561
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,560
If I don't see Miao feeling better,

562
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,720
I can't leave with peace of mind.

563
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,840
Please forgive me.

564
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,759
Forgive me for being blunt.

565
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:42,600
Official Pei is educated.

566
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,039
I'm sure you know
how to respect your elders.

567
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,600
Besides, both of you
have to seek another relationship.

568
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,119
It's better not to
spoil each other's reputation.

569
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:51,800
Reputation?

570
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,080
Official Pei is a royal court official.

571
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,480
I'm sure no one will say anything bad

572
00:29:57,999 --> 00:29:59,359
but Miao is a lady.

573
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,920
Official Pei, please leave her alone.

574
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,080
What a joke.

575
00:30:07,151 --> 00:30:08,271
A royal court official

576
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,560
who can't even protect his own wife.

577
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,440
Forget it.

578
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,639
I'll take my leave.

579
00:30:33,639 --> 00:30:34,920
Both of them are so pitiful.

580
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,759
He left.

581
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,359
Miao is finally awake.

582
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:54,200
Old Master went to Hangzhou
a few days ago.

583
00:30:54,639 --> 00:30:56,320
If something were to happen to you,

584
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,440
what should we tell Old Master?

585
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,600
-Exactly.
-Yes.

586
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,200
Well,

587
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,560
sorry for making all of you worried.

588
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,159
Actually, I don't feel that bad.

589
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:09,999
I was only pretending...

590
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,960
Pretending to faint.

591
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,680
What?

592
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,759
I knew you were pretending.

593
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,920
You wanted to hide
from Official Pei, right?

594
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:18,920
I don't think

595
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,320
you should hide.

596
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:23,879
Miao.

597
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:25,440
You were frightened.

598
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,759
You should rest soon.

599
00:31:26,999 --> 00:31:27,480
I'll ask the kitchen

600
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,159
to make some good food for you.

601
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:29,879
Sure.

602
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:31,080
Thank you.

603
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:31,920
Let's go.

604
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,560
Go.

605
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,999
Aunt.

606
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:40,680
Don't tell Father what happened today.

607
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:49,920
I went out to work

608
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,039
but I didn't know
an esteemed guest is here.

609
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,320
Forgive me

610
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,200
for not welcoming you.

611
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,399
It's all right.

612
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,480
I am here
to congratulate Old Master Shen.

613
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,560
Please take a seat.

614
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:05,279
Have a sip of tea.

615
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:09,800
Why am I being congratulated?

616
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,480
Old Master Shen, it's like this.

617
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,680
His Majesty is a magnanimous person.

618
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,560
He appreciates
the Shen family's patriotism.

619
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,119
His Majesty heard your daughter

620
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,039
has been staying at home

621
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,639
since the divorce with Pei Yanzhen.

622
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:25,720
Recently,

623
00:32:25,879 --> 00:32:28,879
there are even rumours
that she is an indecent woman.

624
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,320
She might not

625
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,399
find a good partner in this situation.

626
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:33,639
Old Master Shen,

627
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,119
if you take the initiative,

628
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:36,359
perhaps

629
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:38,159
His Majesty will still give you a chance

630
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,080
in this year's concubine selection.

631
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:43,200
Old Master Shen.

632
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,879
That's all I'm going to say.

633
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,879
Don't miss out on this opportunity.

634
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:47,759
Yes.

635
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:48,399
I've given you the message.

636
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,399
I won't be drinking this tea.

637
00:32:50,879 --> 00:32:51,759
My work

638
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:53,560
is done.

639
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:56,560
Thank you.

640
00:33:09,879 --> 00:33:10,680
It seems like

641
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,879
we have offended some sly fox.

642
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,279
Did you hear?

643
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,239
The lady of the Shen family,

644
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,440
Official Pei's former wife

645
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,239
and current niece, Shen Miao

646
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,600
stayed single for a few days

647
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,639
and started to be unfaithful.

648
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:31,808
She fell in love with

649
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,519
the famous Third Master Song
in Lingzhou City.

650
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:34,800
Really?

651
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,680
That's not all.

652
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,800
She even jumped into the Yun River

653
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,800
for him.

654
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,200
She is really shameless

655
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,119
and indecent.

656
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:40,999
Exactly.

657
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:42,399
Stop talking about him.

658
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,960
Official Pei who was cuckolded

659
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,399
is also not a good man.

660
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:46,800
What's wrong?

661
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,960
I heard he liked finding prostitutes

662
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,999
at brothels.

663
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,039
Now, everyone knows
about the shame in his family.

664
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,119
He might be punished.

665
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:55,800
Really?

666
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,239
All of them are so vulgar.

667
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,279
Exactly.

668
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,999
None of them is good.

669
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:02,680
Yes.

670
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,799
What's going on?

671
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,520
It feels weird today.

672
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,119
Constable Zhao.

673
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:13,520
All of us heard about Official Pei.

674
00:34:13,799 --> 00:34:14,559
I feel sorry for him.

675
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,639
Sorry?

676
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,000
Please accept this, Constable Zhao.

677
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,399
Wait.

678
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:18,799
These are our gifts.

679
00:34:18,799 --> 00:34:19,920
Thank you.

680
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,280
Wait.

681
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:20,720
What's the meaning of this?

682
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,799
Please accept this, Constable Zhao.

683
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,480
We'll be placing them here.

684
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,799
We understand Official Pei's trouble.

685
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,280
Please tell Official Pei

686
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:28,000
to be patient and tolerant

687
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,119
so things will change for the better.

688
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:30,559
Wait.

689
00:34:31,549 --> 00:34:32,760
What's the meaning of this?

690
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,720
What things will change for the better?

691
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,980
(Pei's Residence)

692
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:02,660

(A single thought, A calm heart)

694
00:35:24,879 --> 00:35:25,359
Madam.

695
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:26,520
If you are not praying,

696
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,760
please make some space.

697
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:29,280
Who are you calling Madam?

698
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:30,720
Hurry up.

699
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,799
Otherwise, it'll be too late.

700
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,520
The Shen family
has good relationship luck.

701
00:35:33,879 --> 00:35:35,200
The two lovers of Lingzhou City

702
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,760
are at the residence's Hongluan Star.

703
00:35:36,879 --> 00:35:37,879
Let's get some of its blessings.

704
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:39,720
Miss Shen, please bless me.

705
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,559
I want to get married this year.

706

(Shen's Residence)

707
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:46,000
I...

708
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:52,280
There are

709
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,559
so many people at the gate.

710
00:35:53,799 --> 00:35:55,480
How can we live our lives in peace?

711
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,520
Forget it.

712
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,079
They will

713
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,520
be gone after a few days.

714
00:35:59,879 --> 00:36:01,200
Forget it, Miss.

715
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,839
Do you know who Master Song is?

716
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:03,879
Your rumour

717
00:36:03,879 --> 00:36:05,359
will probably go on
for half a year at least.

718
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:07,599
Master Song?

719
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:08,480
Do you know him?

720
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:11,680
Song Xiyuan. Master Song.

721
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,119
The largest merchant

722
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,119
besides the Shen family.

723
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,240
He is gentle, rich,

724
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,240
and talented.

725
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,079
He and Master Pei

726
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:19,599
are always in the top two spots
of the talent ranking.

727
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:20,520
Everyone knows about him.

728
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,079
This is bad.

729
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,359
What's wrong?

730
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:28,680
Enemies don't see eye to eye
with each other.

731
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,639
If Pei Yanzhen finds out about this,

732
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,879
he will feel extremely sad.

733
00:36:34,879 --> 00:36:36,639
No. I need to explain it to him.

734
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:37,079
Miss.

735
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:38,240
Both of you are divorced.

736
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,359
What's there to explain?

737
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:39,879
Besides,

738
00:36:39,879 --> 00:36:41,280
there are so many people out there.

739
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:42,520
It'll be hard for you to go out.

740
00:36:43,879 --> 00:36:44,359
It's fine.

741
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,760
I have a way.

742
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,639
I finally know why those warriors

743
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:59,359
wear black suits during the day.

744
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,119
This...

745
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,280
It's tough being a female warrior.

746
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:17,040
Miss, do you need help?

747
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,040
No need. Thank you for your concern.

748
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:24,720
Song Xiyuan?

749
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,040
Why are you here?

750
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,359
Miaomiao.

751
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:29,399
You already know my name.

752
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:30,639
Master.

753
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,359
It seems Miss Shen

754
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,359
does have feelings for you.

755
00:37:34,799 --> 00:37:35,839
You don't say.

756
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,280
If she doesn't,

757
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,200
she won't climb over a wall
just to meet me.

758
00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:41,359
Let me stop you right there.

759
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,200
I'm just trying to leave my house

760
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,159
and saw you here coincidentally.

761
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,839
How is that climbing a wall to meet you?

762
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:47,440
Leave your house?

763
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:49,960
Why aren't you using the gate?

764
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,200
I understand.

765
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,240
What do you mean?

766
00:37:58,559 --> 00:37:59,000
What do you mean?

767
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,720
What do you understand?

768
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,760
Why are you looking at me like that?

769
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,720
Why are you looking at me like that?

770
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,000
I'm asking you what...

771
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:14,799
This is

772
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,079
the second time

773
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,599
you come into my embrace.

774
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:22,599
Master Song.

775
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,079
I beg you.

776
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,480
Let's not have
any more misunderstandings.

777
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,079
I don't have
any feelings for you at all.

778
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,399
Please be lenient

779
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:30,359
and spare me.

780
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:31,240
That won't do.

781
00:38:31,879 --> 00:38:34,359
Everyone in the city knows about us.

782
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,240
You must take responsibility.

783
00:38:38,319 --> 00:38:38,920
It's Shen Miao!

784
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:40,319
Stop her.

785
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:41,520
We must ask her

786
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,599
how she got her good luck.

787
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:43,079
Let's go.

788
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:43,920
Otherwise, we'll be in trouble.

789
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,359
Let's go.

790
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,359
Wait!

791
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,000
Official Pei.

792
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,879
This is my brother's edict.

793
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,079
He is afraid I might be bored
in Lingzhou

794
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,040
and ordered
Lingzhou's magistrate, Pei Yanzhen

795
00:38:59,399 --> 00:39:00,399
to serve

796
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,599
and accompany me.

797
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,359
I'm busy.

798
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:10,319
I'm afraid I can't obey that.

799
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:14,639
Are you going to
go against an imperial edict?

800
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,399
Fine.

801
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,599
I know you are in a bad mood

802
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:23,920
because of your recent divorce

803
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,839
but I'm just having fun
outside the palace.

804
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,240
If you make me happy

805
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,399
by accompanying me,

806
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,520
I might return to the capital tomorrow.

807
00:39:33,879 --> 00:39:34,799
It's better than

808
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,760
staying in your little yamen every day.

809
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,879
What do you want to do?

810
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,319
Miaomiao, why are you staring at me?

811
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:01,879
Master Song,

812
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,399
isn't it rude of you to call

813
00:40:05,399 --> 00:40:06,639
a divorced lady's nickname?

814
00:40:07,879 --> 00:40:09,359
It's my first time
seeing a divorced lady

815
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:10,680
climbing over the wall indeed.

816
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,040
Master Song.

817
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:20,399
The premium Maojian tea,

818
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:21,920
Osmanthus Cake, Plum Cake,

819
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,680
three preserved fruits,

820
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,399
and four fruits you ordered.

821
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,119
Do you

822
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:25,240
still need anything else?

823
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:28,599
The waiter is talking to you.

824
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:38,280
Why are you laughing?

825
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,119
I'm laughing at this situation.

826
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:42,079
The both of us here

827
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:44,159
with Miao Miao looking scared.

828
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:46,359
Isn't this a face you show in an affair?

829
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:47,720
Stop saying nonsense.

830
00:40:48,399 --> 00:40:48,839
Master.

831
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,240
I beg you.

832
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,319
What do you want?

833
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,359
Since I'm not married

834
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:55,200
and you...

835
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,119
I guess you are not married too.

836
00:40:58,879 --> 00:41:00,119
Since you hugged me

837
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,399
and spoiled my reputation,

838
00:41:01,399 --> 00:41:02,960
you need to take responsibility.

839
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,599
Why don't

840
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:07,799
I pay you?

841
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:08,879
Name your price.

842
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:11,200
Miaomiao.

843
00:41:11,799 --> 00:41:13,119
How can you say that?

844
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:15,319
It hurts me

845
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:18,359
to hear you say that.

846
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:21,359
Call me Miss Shen.

847
00:41:28,799 --> 00:41:29,720
Master Song.

848
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,000
I'm grateful to you
for saving my life yesterday

849
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,920
but rumours are fiercer than a tiger.

850
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,520
I'm a lady after all.

851
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,319
Please stop harming me.

852
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,119
Fine.

853
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,240
The Song family has been interested
in the shipping business.

854
00:41:48,879 --> 00:41:51,319
I'll ask father to give you
two vessels in Nanyang.

855
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,040
2,000 taels of profit per year.

856
00:41:53,399 --> 00:41:54,000
How is that?

857
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,680
I don't want anything.

858
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,520
I just want to ask you a question.

859
00:41:58,159 --> 00:41:58,879
What is it?

860
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,440
Miss Shen, do you still have
an unresolved relationship?

861
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:03,799
A goat.

862
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,559
A camel!

863
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:15,200
Quick!

864
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:21,960
Yanzhen,

865
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,359
I heard in the capital

866
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:25,359
that Lingzhou City
has great opera actors.

867
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:26,559
Can you take me to watch an opera show

868
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:27,879
after lunch?

869
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,079
I don't like to watch operas.

870
00:42:31,399 --> 00:42:32,119
It's all right.

871
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,319
Then,

872
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,720
let's walk around the bookstore.

873
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:40,000
Or you can walk around
the rouge shop with me.

874
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,040
I've been here for a long time.

875
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,680
I don't have enough clothes to wear.

876
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,559
I need to buy new clothes.

877
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,720
What's wrong with your eyes?

878
00:42:47,319 --> 00:42:47,879
It's nothing.

879
00:42:47,879 --> 00:42:48,799
The smell of the tea blinds me.

880
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:52,839
Constable Zhao.

881
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,839
See where's the nearest rouge shop.

882
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:55,879
Yes.

883
00:42:55,879 --> 00:42:56,599
I'll do it now.

884
00:42:58,839 --> 00:42:59,760
Why are you still here?

885
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,839
Didn't you pull me...

886
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:01,639
Shut up.

887
00:43:01,799 --> 00:43:02,799
I'll beat you up otherwise.

888
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:10,839
Let's go.

889
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:12,200
We'll have a look at the rouge shop.

890
00:43:13,879 --> 00:43:14,839
