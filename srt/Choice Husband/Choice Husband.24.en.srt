Steward Tie,

20
00:01:33,798 --> 00:01:34,919
we've looked over the city.

21
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:36,919
We've searched
Miss's favorite restaurants

22
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:37,599
and theaters all night.

23
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:39,319
But she is nowhere to be seen.

24
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:43,199
Before Young Master left,
he specifically told us

00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,398
that whatever happens,

26
00:01:44,398 --> 00:01:45,718
we must immediately inform him.

Well, Zhao,

28
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:48,919
you bring several men to the capital

29
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,078
to look for Young Master.

- Yes.

00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:53,678
Wait.

34
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:56,118
Search around
Pei's Residence thoroughly.

Tie Niu, he frets about love.

38
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:07,199
He's unreliable.

don't you?

Sooner or later,

42

I'll savor you

Miss,

51
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,678
is there any discomfort?

52
00:03:19,518 --> 00:03:20,038
(I'm fine.)

53
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:23,118
(Didn't you ask me
to teach the Prince?)

54
00:03:23,678 --> 00:03:24,719
(Where is he?)

55
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:27,758
Xiao is naughty.

56
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:29,159
He's being punished.

57
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:31,999
If you don't mind,

58
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,999
you can stay here for a few more days.

59
00:03:45,678 --> 00:03:46,639
You fainted yesterday.

60
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,478
I was freaked out.

61
00:03:49,478 --> 00:03:51,639
So I asked a physician over.

62
00:03:53,118 --> 00:03:54,398
Only then I knew you had a history.

63
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,238
So I had the prescription changed.

64
00:03:56,839 --> 00:03:57,839
I think you'll get

65
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,038
your voice back in a few days.

66
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:00,919
By then,

67
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:04,598
I'd like to hear

68
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:06,478
you sing.

69
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:16,439
(Your Highness is such a show lover.)

70
00:04:20,078 --> 00:04:20,599
I'm not.

71
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,159
It was my deceased wife.

72
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:30,798
She liked to watch shows.

73
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,279
(I didn't expect you)

74
00:04:39,198 --> 00:04:42,159

78
00:04:53,798 --> 00:04:55,599
(Your Highness,
have you ever failed your wife?)

79
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:04,398
(But the dead can't be resurrected.)

80
00:05:06,118 --> 00:05:08,599
(The same goes for the relationship.)

81
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:13,638
I know.

82
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,039
Hence,

83
00:05:21,398 --> 00:05:22,999
I wish I'd never met her

84
00:05:24,678 --> 00:05:25,879
and that I'd never liked her.

85
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:27,518
Maybe...

86
00:05:32,238 --> 00:05:33,719
Maybe she wouldn't have died.

87
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:03,678
Your Highness.

88
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,599
Thank you, Miss.

you haven't had your eyes treated.

91
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,358
There are many things
awaiting you in the capital.

92
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,159
Are you going to leave her here

93
00:06:37,518 --> 00:06:38,279
or bring her back?

94
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,398
I don't have

much hope

Give me a few more days.

99
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,358
A few more days will do.

100
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,039
I knew I can't have her,

101
00:07:05,678 --> 00:07:07,358
but I just can't let her go

102
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:11,638
due to my greed.

Don't worry, Official Song.

All of us are the daredevils
of the noble families from the capital.

Our task is

to kill Regent.

Even if we fail,

112
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,678
it won't implicate you.

If I was worried,

114
00:07:34,798 --> 00:07:36,279
I wouldn't have fought against Regent.

115

However,

116
00:07:38,118 --> 00:07:39,678
you have to promise me one thing first.

00:07:40,678 --> 00:07:42,958
Whether the assassination succeeds
or not,

118
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:45,118
you must get the Prince

119

back safely.

120
00:07:47,678 --> 00:07:48,439
Otherwise...

121

Don't worry, Official.

122
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,518
We dare not fail you.

123
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,358
Very well.

124
00:07:54,638 --> 00:07:55,159
Go on.

I've been looking for you.

00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,279
Why did you come here?

137
00:09:03,318 --> 00:09:04,318
But Tie Niu knows martial arts.

138
00:09:04,638 --> 00:09:05,638
If he finds out,

139
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,318
I'll teach you a trick.

140
00:09:07,758 --> 00:09:08,919
It can get you away with it.

141
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,558
There are mice!

142
00:09:10,998 --> 00:09:11,479
Where?

143
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:12,078
I'll protect you.

144
00:09:13,758 --> 00:09:14,919
I don't know where they went.

145
00:09:16,758 --> 00:09:17,599
I see nothing.

146
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:20,479
I feel a little dizzy.

147
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:22,159
Why don't

148
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,719
you help me to the yard?

149
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,198
Sure.

150
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:27,679
Let's go.

151
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:28,438
Let me help you.

152
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:31,679
You must be freaked out.

153
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:33,078
It's alright.

154
00:09:33,558 --> 00:09:34,239
I'm here with you.

155
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,318
Easy.

156
00:09:50,638 --> 00:09:51,239
Miss,

157
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,599
Master Song did withhold

158
00:09:52,599 --> 00:09:53,758
the letters Old Master sent over.

159
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,159
The Shen family has collapsed.

160
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,159
Why would he deceive you

161
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:03,758
and keep you away from your family?

162
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:06,958
Let's wait and see.

163
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:09,078
To him, profit always comes first.

164
00:10:09,438 --> 00:10:10,839
He never did a profitless deal.

165
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,239
I must've been useful to him.

166

In my life,

167

I've been deceived,

cheated

169
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,119
and lied to.

00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,599
I was set up
that my family was broken apart.

171
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:30,438
If I didn't learn the lesson,

172
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:32,919
my previous death would be for nothing.

173
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:44,479
(Miao,)

174
00:10:44,998 --> 00:10:47,799
(I've given Song Xiyuan a great fortune)

175
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:48,758
(to ask for his help)

176

(In these several years,)

(I only realized the mistakes
I made in the past.)

182
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:02,998
If I could study earlier,

183
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:05,919
I would be able to see

184
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:08,119
through Pei Yanzhen's disguise sooner.

185
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:11,159
Self-drawn win!

186
00:11:14,558 --> 00:11:15,078
Miao,

187
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:16,159
don't listen to your dad.

188
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:18,318
All he cares about is
the family fortune.

189
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:19,599
(To me,)

190
00:11:19,758 --> 00:11:21,479
(it's fine as long as we're alive.)

(We can just make a comeback.)

Now,

193
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,039
our business at the border area is
going well.

194
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:30,558
We've had the people

195
00:11:30,558 --> 00:11:32,119
in Yanlan eating out of our hands.

196

(When you come back,)

(it's been so long
since the letter was sent out.)

00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:41,359
(Why aren't you coming back?)

201
00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:43,919
(Third Master Song said
you were injured.)

202
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:45,599
(How are you doing now?)

203
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:48,159
(Now I've mastered the riding skills.)

204
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,359
(I'm waiting for you
to teach me martial arts.)

205
00:11:51,558 --> 00:11:52,479
Sister.

206
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:08,558
Miss,

207
00:12:10,318 --> 00:12:11,039
what's wrong?

208
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:14,479
Lvying,

209
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:16,839
Dad, Aunt

210
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:18,239
and Shen Zai

211
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:19,919
are doing well.

212
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:21,119
Lvying,

213
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:22,878
the Shen family is still here.

214
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:27,758
This is a good thing.

215
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:29,998
Why are you crying?

216
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:33,878
I won't cry.

217
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,239
I have to get Xiao out of here

218
00:12:36,998 --> 00:12:38,159
and go north to reunite with Dad.

219
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:40,799
What are you going to do?

220
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,479
I went snooping around the residence

221
00:12:50,758 --> 00:12:52,039
and drew a map.

222
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,359
Pei Yanzhen is paranoid.

223
00:12:54,638 --> 00:12:56,119
He's had his men positioned everywhere.

224
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:57,799
By then,

225
00:12:58,518 --> 00:13:00,198
I'll need to distract Zhan Yue.

226
00:13:00,878 --> 00:13:02,438
So I can get Xiao out.

227
00:13:04,558 --> 00:13:05,558
But Guard Zhan has

228
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,638
always been sticking close
to Young Master.

229
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:09,039
It's extremely hard to achieve.

230
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:12,479
I have my own plan.

231
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,438
Even if we've succeeded in escaping,

232
00:13:15,558 --> 00:13:16,998
how are we supposed
to avoid the pursuers?

233
00:13:18,518 --> 00:13:19,518
With Third Master Song's help?

234
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:20,599
No.

235
00:13:21,518 --> 00:13:23,039
If anything happens this time,

236
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:23,479
I'm afraid

237
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:25,398
the three of us might die

238
00:13:25,398 --> 00:13:26,638
right away.

239
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,438
We can't trust anyone.

240
00:13:56,558 --> 00:13:58,039
What are you doing, Miss Xu?

241
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:04,599
She heard that Young Master was
punished yesterday because of her.

242
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:06,998
She's making some pastries for him.

243
00:14:20,438 --> 00:14:21,558
(Xiao likes to eat pastries.)

244
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:22,919
(He usually)

245
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,198
(eats some two hours after dinner.)

246
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:26,839
(Xiao is smart.)

247
00:14:27,239 --> 00:14:28,599
(I'm sure he can recognize my writing)

248
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:30,078
(and understand what I mean.)

249
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:05,701
(Get away by setting fire)

250
00:15:09,558 --> 00:15:10,799
The capital has been restless lately.

251
00:15:11,518 --> 00:15:12,958
(Pei's Residence)
His Majesty seldom leaves his chamber.

252
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:14,998
The officials in the court knew

253
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:16,518
that you secretly left the capital.

254
00:15:16,998 --> 00:15:18,039
All of them tried to seize the power.

255
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,679
Pass on my order.

256
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:20,919
I'll return to the capital

257
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:21,679
in several days.

258
00:15:26,438 --> 00:15:27,359
What's your worry?

259
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:30,998
You want to bring Shen Miao back,
don't you?

260
00:15:31,758 --> 00:15:33,119
We finally came to Weiyang.

261
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:34,758
What about your eyes?

262
00:15:35,878 --> 00:15:36,638
Are you not going to wait

263
00:15:36,638 --> 00:15:37,359
for the monk to treat your eyes?

264
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:39,679
The monk hasn't returned yet.

265
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:40,599
This is Heaven's will.

266
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:42,239
Besides, Miao is still alive.

267
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:43,719
Since she has come back,

268
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:46,119
it no longer matters
if I treat it or not.

269
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:49,839
Don't blame me for not warning you.

270
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:51,679
Today at the loft,

271
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:54,239
Shen Miao seemed to intend to kill you.

272
00:15:55,398 --> 00:15:57,078
Are you sure
she hasn't regained her memory?

273
00:15:57,558 --> 00:15:58,479
In any case,

274
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,198
even if she doesn't remember it now,

275
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:02,719
as you try everything to keep her
by your side,

276
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:04,919
she might remember the past one day.

277
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:06,839
I'm afraid it'll get you killed.

278
00:16:08,998 --> 00:16:10,279
If she does remember this,

279
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:12,758
it's all the more reason
not to leave her here.

280
00:16:17,758 --> 00:16:18,239
There's...

281
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:19,719
There's a fire
in the Prince's room!

282
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:20,599
Help!

283
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:21,799
Quick, Zhan Yue.

284
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:39,039
Come and put it out!

285
00:16:47,638 --> 00:16:48,078
Let's go.

286
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:54,839
Xiao.

287
00:16:55,398 --> 00:16:55,919
Xiao.

288
00:16:56,318 --> 00:16:56,919
Are you alright?

289
00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:57,799
Mother.

290
00:16:58,119 --> 00:16:59,198
I've left you here
for the past two years.

291
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:00,078
It's my bad.

292
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:01,638
I'll be sure to take you away

293
00:17:01,638 --> 00:17:02,839
and never come back again, okay?

294
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,278
As long as I can be with you,

295
00:17:04,278 --> 00:17:05,599
anywhere is fine for me.

296
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:07,239
Good boy.

297
00:17:10,438 --> 00:17:10,999
Let's go.

298
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:11,999
Let's go.

299
00:17:20,879 --> 00:17:21,438
Miss,

300
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:23,999
the fire is spreading over this room.

301
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:25,158
We have to leave now.

302
00:17:25,399 --> 00:17:26,158
Is everything ready?

303
00:17:26,438 --> 00:17:26,958
Yes.

304
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:27,438
Let's go.

305
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:35,198
Calm down.

306
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:36,558
Don't mind me.

307
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:37,359
Just go and find Xiao.

308
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,158
Xiao is afraid of fire.

309
00:17:38,438 --> 00:17:39,158
And send some men

310
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:39,759
to Miao's room.

311
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:40,198
Go.

312
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:41,038
Okay.

313
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:49,558
Traitor Pei, I'll kill you.

314
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:50,958
Do you think you have the ability?

315
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:52,479
Leave this to me.

316
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:53,399
You go and find Xiao.

317
00:17:54,719 --> 00:17:55,438
Be careful.

318
00:18:24,078 --> 00:18:24,519
Come.

319
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:27,038
Lvying,

320
00:18:27,318 --> 00:18:28,999
this rope can only withstand
the weight of one person.

321
00:18:29,158 --> 00:18:29,719
Xiao is still young.

322
00:18:29,879 --> 00:18:30,759
You go down and catch him.

323
00:18:31,078 --> 00:18:31,558
Okay.

324
00:18:32,158 --> 00:18:32,678
Easy.

325
00:18:38,678 --> 00:18:39,158
Be careful.

326
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:49,278
Okay.

327
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:02,519
Come, Xiao.

328
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:09,639
Come.

329
00:19:11,278 --> 00:19:12,399
You're amazing, Mother.

330
00:19:13,918 --> 00:19:14,759
After leaving here,

331
00:19:15,278 --> 00:19:16,678
I'll teach you this

332
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,198
so you can be a hero too.

333
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:19,038
By then,

334
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:20,958
all the heroines will fight to be
your wife.

335
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:21,519
Okay?

336
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:25,438
Sure.

337

Drink less, Master.

509
00:30:10,078 --> 00:30:11,078
Let me make your bed.

510
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:12,198
It's not necessary.

511
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:14,918
I'll go and check
on Miss Shen again later.

512
00:30:16,438 --> 00:30:16,999
Noted.

513
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:20,958
It is

514
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:22,239
an unrequited love.

515
00:30:23,078 --> 00:30:24,558
Master, why bother troubling yourself?

516
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,038
I'm a mediocre man.

517
00:30:27,798 --> 00:30:29,519
I thought if she forgot that guy

518
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:31,399
and gave up on him,

519
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:33,438
she'd look at me.

520
00:30:36,438 --> 00:30:37,639
You should stop drinking, Master.

521
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:44,318
Huashan,

522
00:30:45,438 --> 00:30:46,158
do you think

523
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:48,438
I'm not a reliable man?

524
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:51,239
You look like a playboy.

525
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:53,119
In fact, you're a devoted lover.

526
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:02,158
Master,

527
00:31:02,158 --> 00:31:03,359
put on the coat as it's getting cold.

528
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:04,479
Never mind.

529
00:31:08,479 --> 00:31:09,719
You're not the only person

530
00:31:10,918 --> 00:31:12,678
who brings angst on yourself.

531
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:16,198
Take a look.

532
00:31:16,198 --> 00:31:17,239
Nice plotted plants.

533
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:18,678
Sir, take a look.

534
00:31:19,918 --> 00:31:20,678
Take a look.

536
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:33,479
Miaomiao,

537
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:35,599
there are many things

538
00:31:36,678 --> 00:31:37,999
I have to explain to you.

539
00:31:39,879 --> 00:31:40,399
Miaomiao,

540
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:41,999
since we got married,

541
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:44,198
I did adhere to our contract.

542
00:31:44,678 --> 00:31:45,918
I've never touched your body.

543
00:32:19,558 --> 00:32:20,479
I knew

544
00:32:21,318 --> 00:32:22,038
Xiao is

545
00:32:22,918 --> 00:32:23,359
the son

546
00:32:24,879 --> 00:32:26,599
of Pei Yanzhen's the whole time.

547
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:28,639
Why did you pretend not to know?

548
00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:29,719
Because I was afraid

549
00:32:29,719 --> 00:32:31,318
you'd leave me if you knew the only bond

550
00:32:31,318 --> 00:32:32,599
between us didn't exist.

551
00:32:33,198 --> 00:32:34,038
The outsiders might not know,

552
00:32:34,038 --> 00:32:35,198
but I'm well aware

553
00:32:35,798 --> 00:32:37,759
that he's always been the one
in your heart.

554
00:32:40,479 --> 00:32:41,198
I admit

555
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:43,999
that I married you
for another purpose at first.

556
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:44,759
But then...

557
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:46,158
Then, you took it too far.

558
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:47,359
You know what?

559
00:32:48,158 --> 00:32:49,879
Regent said the same thing as well.

560
00:32:56,879 --> 00:32:58,359
Ever since I regained my memory,

561
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:00,759
I've been thinking

562
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:02,719
how Pei Yanzhen and I

563
00:33:03,078 --> 00:33:05,158
went this far.

564
00:33:06,678 --> 00:33:08,558
The bird unintentionally revealed
the truth back then.

565
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:11,759
Or else, I wouldn't have noticed
the truth.

566
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:14,999
But Song Xiyuan,

567
00:33:17,318 --> 00:33:18,879
was it really an unintentional move

568
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:21,719
to give me the bird back then?

569
00:33:31,798 --> 00:33:33,278
But people will learn from mistakes.

570
00:33:34,158 --> 00:33:34,879
Now,

571
00:33:36,038 --> 00:33:37,999
I don't want to care
about the past anymore.

Third Master Song,

let me go.

574

Let me and Xiao leave this place,

575
00:33:47,078 --> 00:33:47,599
will you?

576
00:33:55,879 --> 00:33:56,479
No.

577
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:58,198
They'll surely turn

578
00:33:58,678 --> 00:34:00,198
Weiyang City upside down now.

579
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:02,038
Don't ever think of leaving
through the city gate.

580
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:03,798
And Baima Temple is

581
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:06,038
a well-known place

582
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:07,879
where everyone visits.

583
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:11,078
Yet, it's a quiet and safe spot.

584
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:14,758
It's in the city
but it's in the mountain.

585
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,359
You and Xiao can stay there

586

and wait for the news.

And you

will always be my wife.

Master, something happens downstairs.

592

We're doing legitimate business.

593
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,798
I wonder what we did to offend you.

Please state it.

Where is Song Xiyuan?

596

Ask him to come out.

00:35:20,478 --> 00:35:21,558
I was wondering who it was.

It's you, Your Highness.

599

I'm sorry

for not being able to welcome you.

601
00:35:29,798 --> 00:35:31,159
I don't have time for this.

we're not in the capital.

With your arrogant attitude,

606
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:43,639
you even expect me
to tell you the truth?

607

I'll ask you one more time.

Where is Miao?

609
00:35:46,798 --> 00:35:48,199
I should ask you this.

Two years ago,
when we were in the capital,

Miaomiao died because of you.

that Xu Sheng is Miao.

hide her?

you to have this arrangement.

It seems like you've been working
on something.

Something thick and warm.

Didn't Third Master Song want
to send you

to Baima Temple?

641

Why would you need these?

Neither Pei Yanzhen

After careful consideration,

it's better to go north

Sorry to be rude.

661
00:38:47,798 --> 00:38:49,399
I might need you and Miss Lvying

662

not to walk around now.

663

Don't bring trouble to Master.

why did you tell me this?

Everything I did is

667

for Master.

668
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,278
I saved you for Master yesterday.

669
00:39:11,718 --> 00:39:13,639
Today, I gave
the heartless person the advice

670
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:15,318
for his sake.

671
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,639
But he can only forgo

672
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:26,278
the obsession and notice your existence

673
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:27,998
and the beauty of the world

674
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:29,998
when the heartless person leaves.

675
00:39:30,478 --> 00:39:33,159
This is the right thing
to do for his sake,

676
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,038
isn't it?

677
00:39:51,278 --> 00:39:53,599
It's Song Xiyuan who's eyeing
the Shen family's fortune.

678
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:56,078
It's also him
who's colluded with Pei Yanzhen.

679
00:39:56,718 --> 00:39:57,919
Why did Huashan make it

680
00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:00,078
sound like I'm the heartless person?

681
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:02,998
Why did you acknowledge it

682
00:40:02,998 --> 00:40:03,998
and took the blame?

683
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:06,518
I'm worried she'd sow discord

684
00:40:06,879 --> 00:40:07,639
among them and make

685
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:08,599
a false show of compliance.

686
00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:10,919
But I can tell

687
00:40:10,919 --> 00:40:12,718
that she is
the legendary rival of love.

688
00:40:12,998 --> 00:40:14,119
Will she listen to you?

689
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:14,879
It doesn't matter.

690
00:40:15,399 --> 00:40:16,758
We should leave as soon as possible.

691
00:40:21,718 --> 00:40:22,359
I'll get going.

692
00:40:41,998 --> 00:40:42,518
Your Highness,

693
00:40:43,038 --> 00:40:43,879
I've looked into it.

694
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:46,798
Guchun Restaurant is
the property Song Xiyuan bought

695
00:40:46,798 --> 00:40:47,599
when he was in the capital.

696
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:49,798
It's disguised as a restaurant.

697
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:52,038
It's actually used to gather
information from the court.

698
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:53,199
He's well-connected.

699
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:53,879
It's unassailable.

700
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:55,199
Song Xiyuan

701
00:40:55,879 --> 00:40:57,159
leads a life of debauchery

702
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:58,278
and always fools around.

703
00:40:58,679 --> 00:40:59,639
I've underestimated him.

704
00:41:00,278 --> 00:41:00,998
Don't mind him.

705
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:03,639
What matters is Miao and her son.

706
00:41:04,238 --> 00:41:05,359
Shall we lay a hand on this?

707
00:41:06,078 --> 00:41:06,798
Your wife is

708
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:08,359
most likely hiding here.

709
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:10,599
But I'm worried

710
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:12,599
if we forcibly make a move,

711
00:41:13,318 --> 00:41:14,758
it'll only push Miao away.

712
00:41:15,078 --> 00:41:15,879
But if we do nothing,

713
00:41:16,399 --> 00:41:17,758
once they leave Weiyang City,

714
00:41:18,038 --> 00:41:19,038
how are we going to find them

715
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:20,199
as it's a big world?

716
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:21,839
I'm sure Song Xiyuan

717
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:23,599
will reckon

718
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:26,758
that we'll continue
to focus on Guchun Restaurant.

719
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:27,718
Hence,

720
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:30,238
he'll keep acting
and putting on some shows.

721
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:31,639
Yet, secretly,

722
00:41:32,238 --> 00:41:33,518
he'll try everything

723
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:36,119
to send Miao and Xiao out of Weiyang.

724
00:41:36,518 --> 00:41:38,318
Rather than wasting our efforts

725
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:39,439
on watching over Guchun Restaurant,

726
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:42,599
we might as well guard
the roads out of the city.

727
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,679
If you could put such an effort

728
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:48,879
on treating your eyes,

729
00:41:49,318 --> 00:41:50,199
they'd be cured already.

730
00:42:00,439 --> 00:42:01,038
Mother,

731
00:42:01,038 --> 00:42:02,399
where are we going?

732
00:42:02,399 --> 00:42:03,798
Aren't we going with Xiyuan?

733
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,119
We're going to find your grandpa.

734
00:42:05,478 --> 00:42:06,278
As for Song Xiyuan,

735
00:42:06,478 --> 00:42:07,278
there's a long road ahead.

736
00:42:07,439 --> 00:42:08,798
We'll meet again one day.

737
00:42:09,399 --> 00:42:10,599
Do you really mean it?

738
00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:16,159
I don't think I'll ever see you again

739
00:42:16,558 --> 00:42:18,518
once you leave this place.

740
00:42:19,278 --> 00:42:20,159
I'm sorry.

741
00:42:20,758 --> 00:42:21,879
I dare not ask for more.

742
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:23,879
I can only tell Master

743
00:42:23,879 --> 00:42:24,758
everything I know.

744
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:27,919
Pei Yanzhen has formed a dragnet.

745
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:28,639
Miaomiao,

746
00:42:29,038 --> 00:42:30,919
do you really think
you can escape from here?

747
00:42:37,078 --> 00:42:38,318
I thought I couldn't.

748
00:42:39,038 --> 00:42:39,839
But now,

749
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:41,318
I have an idea.

00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,000

751
