Third Master Song is a cunning man.

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,840
He's most likely to disguise
himself to sneak out.

Do not fail His Highness.

as you predicted,

34
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:06,880
it's heavily guarded.

I'm sorry, Miss Shen.

60
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,680
But His Highness is waiting for you
and the Prince at the residence.

61
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,721
Please follow me.

62
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,280
You...

63
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,120
Miaomiao, we're here.

64
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,961
After the fuss Huashan made,

65
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:49,001
Pei Yanzhen must've thought
that you've left the city.

66
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:51,001
Who could've expected one's essence

67
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:52,200
and the original self could be pure?

68
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,680
It's indeed a good place.

69
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,680
Pei Yanzhen doesn't believe
in the supernatural.

70
00:03:56,721 --> 00:03:58,161
As the saying goes,
it's dark under the light.

71
00:03:58,521 --> 00:04:00,721
No matter how smart he is,
he'll never think of this place.

72
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,001
Master Song, you're here.

73
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,040
Abbot has told me about it.

74
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,640
- Come. Give me the package.
- The abodes in the rear hill are ready.

75
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,321
Please follow me.

76
00:04:10,441 --> 00:04:11,361
Thank you, Master.

77
00:04:11,881 --> 00:04:12,361
Miaomiao,

78
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:13,840
there are more great things inside.

79
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,760
Let's go.

80
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,800
Xiao.

81
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:34,641
This is it.

82
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:39,840
It's beautiful.

83
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,201
As if it was a secluded world.

84
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:42,321
Abbot said

85
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:43,601
there are many monks in the temple.

86
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:44,761
It's inconvenient for female prayers.

87
00:04:44,761 --> 00:04:46,441
So he specifically vacates
the space for you.

88
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:57,800
Butterflies!

89
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,641
Xiao, do you like it here?

90
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:03,721
We can hear the dawn bell ring

91
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:05,161
and enjoy the flowers
and sunset here.

92
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,761
We can also wander
around the mountain

93
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:08,280
and play with small animals and birds.

94
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,041
On top of that, you'll be here with me.

95
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,481
I couldn't be more pleased about that.

96
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,881
That's great.

97
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,360
Well, go and have fun now.

98
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:16,560
Let's go.

99
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,560
Thank you, Third Master.

100
00:05:27,481 --> 00:05:28,321
But,

101
00:05:28,881 --> 00:05:30,481
according to your arrangement,

102
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,280
how long do I have to stay here?

103
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,360
When can I go to Yanlan?

104
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:35,761
Pei Yanzhen is the Regent.

105
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,560
He won't stay in Weiyang for long.

106
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,400
When he leaves,

107
00:05:39,721 --> 00:05:42,120
you can take your journey to Yanlan.

108
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:46,921
If you could bring me along,

109
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,921
that'll be even better.

110
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,201
Look at the fish.

111
00:05:58,481 --> 00:05:59,201
Does it look pretty?

112
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:01,161
Look at the bridge.

113
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:32,800
Everyone,

114
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,921
please take it seriously.

115
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:39,041
His Highness has booked
the entire place today.

116
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,960
Those who disobey

117
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,041
will be executed.

118
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,721
Master,

119
00:06:49,001 --> 00:06:49,960
we got word from the staff.

120
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,641
Official Pei brought his men
to Guchun Restaurant.

121
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:52,680
Master,

122
00:06:53,161 --> 00:06:54,120
you should go back.

123
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:07,400
Your Highness.

124
00:07:08,321 --> 00:07:09,001
Continue.

125
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:10,921
You guys

126
00:07:11,201 --> 00:07:12,800
have informed Song Xiyuan, don't you?

127
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,280
Do not stop until he's back.

128
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,400
Your Highness,

129
00:07:16,921 --> 00:07:17,641
I've repeatedly

130
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,321
played this song

131
00:07:19,321 --> 00:07:20,721
all afternoon.

132
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,400
I thought Guchun Restaurant is
a recreational place.

133
00:07:25,201 --> 00:07:26,960
Your duty is to play Guqin.

134
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,921
Did I get the wrong idea?

135
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:33,001
Just get to the point, Your Highness.

136
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:34,960
However,

137
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:37,360
if you want to know
Miss Shen's whereabouts,

138
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:39,280
I won't be able to tell you that.

139
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,680
You knew

140
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,321
but you can't say it.

141
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:46,680
As you're always
by Third Master's side,

142
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,680
you must've been aware
of my relationship with Miao.

143
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:53,560
If she's with Third Master Song,

144
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,080
there'll never be a room for you.

145
00:08:00,761 --> 00:08:01,680
You've got the wrong idea.

146
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,601
You...

147
00:08:02,721 --> 00:08:03,240
Huashan.

148
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:04,921
Master?

149
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,840
Pei Yanzhen,

150
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:13,560
Miaomiao is not in Guchun Restaurant.

151
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,161
I don't care how much more time

152
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,680
you want to waste here.

153
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,400
But I have to remind you of this.

154
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,041
It's a big world.

155
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,881
You can't hoodwink the public.

156
00:08:23,761 --> 00:08:25,240
So is Miaomiao's heart.

157
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,400
Huashan,

158
00:08:30,721 --> 00:08:31,280
show him the door.

159
00:08:40,841 --> 00:08:41,360
Your Highness.

160
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,521
Thanks

161
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,160
for today, Miss.

(Guchun Restaurant)

165
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,120
(Guchun Restaurant)
should we come again tomorrow?

166
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,081
It's not necessary.

167
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,321
I've figured out where Miao is.

168
00:09:10,401 --> 00:09:12,040
Since the moment
we surrounded Guchun Restaurant,

169
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,600
Huashan had sent someone over
to inform Song Xiyuan.

170
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:17,321
It took Huashan 15 minutes

171
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:19,001
to play the song each time.

172
00:09:20,001 --> 00:09:21,281
She had played it 13 times

173
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:23,680
from the moment the sender went out

174
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,281
until Song Xiyuan came back.

175
00:09:25,841 --> 00:09:26,680
And it was the time

176
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:30,641
he spent to travel back and forth
between Guchun Restaurant

177
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:32,201
and Miao's hiding place.

178
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:35,001
I see.

179
00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:36,881
Your Highness is so brilliant.

180
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:38,881
I'm sure Song can't come up

181
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:40,641
with such a brilliant method
even if he racks his brain.

182
00:09:40,761 --> 00:09:41,160
Your Highness,

183
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,560
I'll bring our men over
to search around.

184
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,441
According to this duration,

185
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:44,720
I'm sure I can bring
Miss Shen back to you.

186
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,201
Wait.

187
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:48,441
If you find Miao,

188
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:49,680
do not act recklessly.

189
00:09:50,321 --> 00:09:54,001
Miao is like the sand in the palm now.

190
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:55,600
The tighter you hold,

191
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,800
the further she escapes.

192
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,281
I have to find a chance

193
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:01,761
to show her my true feelings.

194
00:10:04,881 --> 00:10:05,761
Understood.

195
00:10:12,081 --> 00:10:13,401
Mother, does it look nice?

196
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,600
Yes, it does.

197
00:10:16,881 --> 00:10:17,881
The flower smells

198
00:10:17,881 --> 00:10:20,441
as nice as your scent.

199
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:22,680
You smartass.

200
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,001
Mother,

201
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:24,761
can you catch a fish in this way?

202
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:25,961
Sure we can.

203
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,881
Just wait and see.

204
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,560
(Baima Temple)

205
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:34,881
Your Highness,

206
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,761
there are many spots
that comply with your assumption.

207
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:38,560
We can't search every one of them.

208
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,160
Your Highness,

209
00:10:40,401 --> 00:10:41,281
you've got poor eyesight.

210
00:10:41,521 --> 00:10:42,160
Why don't you let

211
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:44,281
me and Guard Zhan check out
the temple first?

212
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:45,920
Very well.

213
00:10:47,321 --> 00:10:48,961
Be careful, both of you.

214
00:10:49,521 --> 00:10:50,521
Do not spook them.

215
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,201
Noted.

216
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,441
Ladies,

217
00:10:59,841 --> 00:11:00,680
I'd like to ask

218
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:01,560
if you've seen a lady,

219
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,201
about this tall,

220
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,841
with a kid, about this tall.

221
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,961
- No.
- No.

222
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:07,720
No?

223
00:11:08,761 --> 00:11:09,480
Think it over.

224
00:11:09,841 --> 00:11:11,201
- Please stay, Master.
- I've never seen them.

225
00:11:11,201 --> 00:11:12,040
It's alright.

226
00:11:12,401 --> 00:11:13,040
May I ask

227
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,001
if there's a lady with a kid

228
00:11:14,001 --> 00:11:15,321
staying in the temple?

229
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,961
Why are you asking this?

230
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:21,160
Amitabha.

231
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,360
Master,

232
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,761
this buddy of mine is having
a brain fade.

233
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,961
The fortune teller said he'll meet
the love of his life today.

234
00:11:27,441 --> 00:11:29,920
That he's got to come to Baima Temple
for his future wife.

235
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,521
It's not an ordinary single lady.

236
00:11:31,521 --> 00:11:33,321
It has to be a married woman.

237
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:35,120
That's why he's nervous.

238
00:11:37,521 --> 00:11:38,441
I see.

239
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,480
Amitabha.

240
00:11:41,081 --> 00:11:41,641
Master,

241
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:42,920
I'd like to ask

242
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:44,240
where the abodes

243
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,761
for the pilgrims in the temple are.

244
00:11:46,961 --> 00:11:48,160
We're tired

245
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,360
and need some water.

246
00:11:51,321 --> 00:11:51,881
Over here.

247
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,800
Amitabha.

248
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:01,841
Buddy,

249
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,521
you excel in martial arts.

250
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,401
But you have to learn

251
00:12:05,401 --> 00:12:07,081
some negotiation skills from me.

252
00:12:07,081 --> 00:12:07,600
Don't you think?

253
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,040
You're amazing, Mother.

254
00:12:16,521 --> 00:12:18,120
I know you don't like to eat fish.

255
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:19,841
I'll go hunt a pheasant for you later.

256
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:20,441
Okay?

257
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,281
It's not necessary.

258
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:23,001
I've developed a taste for fish.

259
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,480
In the two years
when you weren't around,

260
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,240
Great-uncle made

261
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,160
your favorite dishes in every meal.

262
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,800
I've gotten used to it.

263
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,321
Mother,

264
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,001
what's wrong?

265
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,040
Are you tired?

266
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,360
Let me carry you, okay?

267
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,040
You're still young.

268
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,240
When you grow up and have a wife,

269
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,401
you'll forget

270
00:12:43,401 --> 00:12:44,600
about me by then.

271
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,641
I don't want one.

272
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:46,560
You're all I need.

273
00:12:47,761 --> 00:12:48,201
Let's go.

274
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,441
Come.

275
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,600
Be careful.

276
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:08,720
Great-uncle.

277
00:13:10,201 --> 00:13:10,680
Hurry up.

278
00:13:10,881 --> 00:13:11,881
Come on. Let's go.

279
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,001
Mother.

280
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:23,441
Miao.

281
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:25,201
Is that you?

282
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:29,961
Stop there!

283
00:13:31,441 --> 00:13:32,001
Miao,

284
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,480
are you afraid of me?

285
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,720
Did you

286
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,560
fall down just now?

287
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,160
Are you hurt anywhere?

288
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:43,281
Is it serious?

289
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,600
It's been two years.

290
00:13:53,521 --> 00:13:55,201
Don't you want to listen
to my explanation?

291
00:14:14,881 --> 00:14:15,480
(Miao,)

292
00:14:16,761 --> 00:14:18,120
(are you that eager
to turn away from me?)

293
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,120
Have you found them?

294
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,720
No.

295
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,120
I've searched through the East area.

296
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,240
But nothing gained.

297
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,480
Could it be that they're not here?

298
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,401
How is that possible?

299
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,240
This is our last resort.

300
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:33,001
Let's find them again.

301
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:33,521
Sure.

302
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:34,881
You try and ask a monk again.

303
00:14:34,881 --> 00:14:35,920
Okay, I'll go over there.

304
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,521
Master,

305
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,920
my young master has finished reading it.

306
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,001
Miss asked me to return it to you.

307
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,560
Young Master is such a fast reader.

308
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,401
Yes.

309
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,680
Xiao's teachers

310
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,001
always said that he's a genius.

311
00:14:48,441 --> 00:14:48,961
By the way,

312
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:49,920
Miss said

313
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,560
Tie Niu will come here in a few days.

314
00:14:52,441 --> 00:14:53,841
I'll need you to hand this over to him.

315
00:14:54,001 --> 00:14:54,441
Sure.

316
00:14:56,761 --> 00:14:57,201
You...

317
00:14:57,761 --> 00:14:58,240
Official Zhao,

318
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,321
why are you here?

319
00:14:59,321 --> 00:15:00,240
You're really here.

320
00:15:00,761 --> 00:15:02,720
You brat is so ignorant.

321
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,560
How could you do this
at a sacred place like this?

322
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,321
It's confiscated.

323
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,401
This is not yours.

324
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,720
You've pushed too far.

325
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,641
It's with me.

326
00:15:09,641 --> 00:15:10,761
Shouldn't it be mine now?

327
00:15:10,961 --> 00:15:11,560
Sir,

328
00:15:12,001 --> 00:15:12,881
it's immoral

329
00:15:12,881 --> 00:15:13,800
to do this.

330
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,160
I...

331
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,680
Right.

332
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:15,841
Beware of being alone

333
00:15:15,841 --> 00:15:16,600
all your life.

334
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,040
I...

335
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,201
Your poor insight is

336
00:15:19,201 --> 00:15:20,720
the punishment from Heaven.

337
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,081
Let me tell you this.

338
00:15:22,081 --> 00:15:23,281
As you have a secret deal now,

339
00:15:23,521 --> 00:15:24,040
will you

340
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,201
have a secret wedding then?

341
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:29,641
Even if I end up being
a loner in this life,

342
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:30,881
I'll still pursue justice

343
00:15:30,961 --> 00:15:31,800
and separate you lovers.

344
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,800
I must keep you from seeing
that simple-minded Tie Niu.

345
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:34,441
You...

346
00:15:36,881 --> 00:15:37,321
Lvying.

347
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:38,120
Sir.

348
00:15:39,001 --> 00:15:40,001
Amitabha.

349
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,441
Lvying.

350
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,641
Lvying.

351
00:15:47,641 --> 00:15:48,040
Xiao,

352
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,800
we have to get out of here now.

353
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,081
But Mother,

354
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,240
where else can we go now?

355
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,441
Anywhere will do.

356
00:15:54,641 --> 00:15:56,441
Anyway, I won't let them take you away.

357
00:15:56,441 --> 00:15:56,961
Do you understand?

358
00:15:58,881 --> 00:15:59,321
Xiao,

359
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,761
stay in the room and wait for me.

360
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:01,800
I'll go get Lvying back.

361
00:16:06,521 --> 00:16:07,401
Wait here.

362
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,120
Lvying.

363
00:16:21,761 --> 00:16:22,281
Lvying.

364
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:22,800
Miss.

365
00:16:23,321 --> 00:16:23,841
Miss.

366
00:16:24,281 --> 00:16:25,040
This is a temple.

367
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,800
Please don't make noise.

368
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,081
I'm sorry.

369
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,961
Sir,

370
00:16:51,521 --> 00:16:52,321
the incenses are burnt.

371
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:53,641
Watch your hand.

372
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,480
Master,

373
00:16:56,841 --> 00:16:57,360
I've

374
00:16:58,001 --> 00:16:59,321
never prayed to the immortal before.

375
00:17:00,401 --> 00:17:03,001
I don't know
where I should put the joss sticks.

376
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,401
I'm surprised there's someone
who doesn't pray to the immortal.

377
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,840
I didn't believe it

378
00:17:10,521 --> 00:17:11,801
because my wish can only be fulfilled

379
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:14,161
through my own effort.

380
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:16,681
Now I believe it

381
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,761
because what I wish for is

382
00:17:20,881 --> 00:17:21,801
dependent on Heaven.

383
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,200
Have you wished for a lot of things?

384
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:31,001
That you haven't finished praying
even when the incenses are burnt.

385
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:32,761
My master said

386
00:17:33,401 --> 00:17:34,600
there's no need to make many wishes.

387
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:35,801
Your sincerity is what matters.

388
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:38,120
It seems greedy to make many wishes.

389
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,360
It won't necessarily be efficacious.

390
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,761
It's not that many.

391
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,120
I've only wished for one thing.

392
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:48,641
But for many times.

393
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:50,840
The incenses were

394
00:17:51,641 --> 00:17:53,480
finished burning before I realized it.

395
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,480
Thank you, Master.

396
00:18:02,641 --> 00:18:05,840
Everything in the world is an illusion.

397
00:18:06,561 --> 00:18:07,641
An obsession

398
00:18:07,881 --> 00:18:09,521
will only create a trap

399
00:18:09,801 --> 00:18:11,401
to constrain yourself.

400
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,120
It's exhausting.

401
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,641
It's not necessarily a good thing.

402
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,360
Not understand,

403
00:18:16,761 --> 00:18:17,600
not realize,

404
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,200
not give up,

405
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,080
not abandon,

406
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:21,401
not fathom,

407
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,881
and refusal to say goodbye.

408
00:18:23,641 --> 00:18:26,120
It's the source
of all kinds of sufferings.

409
00:18:26,641 --> 00:18:28,001
Living a miserable life is

410
00:18:28,401 --> 00:18:31,080
like repeatedly falling into hell

411
00:18:31,521 --> 00:18:32,840
without relief.

412
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,320
You're right.

413
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,881
But in this mortal world,

414
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,840
if we could figure out

415
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,641
what we can't understand,

416
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,240
can't realize,

417
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,641
can't give up,

418
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,001
can't abandon,

419
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:47,521
can't fathom,

420
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,001
and can't let go,

421
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,761
wouldn't it define real happiness?

422
00:18:53,561 --> 00:18:54,401
But I'm a fool.

423
00:18:55,881 --> 00:18:56,960
I blinded myself.

424
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,641
In order to confuse falsehood
with the truth,

425
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,840
I actually pretend to understand

426
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,120
what I can't;

427
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:04,881
to realize

428
00:19:04,881 --> 00:19:05,761
what I can't;

429
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,360
to give up

430
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:09,320
on what I can't;

431
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,641
to abandon

432
00:19:13,641 --> 00:19:14,320
what I can't;

433
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,720
to fathom

434
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,281
what I can't;

435
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:17,080
and to let go

436
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:18,641
of what I can't.

437
00:19:19,881 --> 00:19:21,120
The months and years are
suddenly far behind me.

438
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:23,080
Longing for someone makes me old.

439
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:24,641
Besides,

440
00:19:24,641 --> 00:19:26,641
I've been living in hell
since I was born.

441
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:30,080
To me, it's no such thing
as falling into hell.

442
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,641
As such,

443
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,401
are you here to pray

444
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,881
to get back something you've lost?

445
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,041
I was.

446
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,120
But I met her today.

447
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
She'd rather get hurt

448
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:46,881
than reunite with me.

449
00:19:47,641 --> 00:19:48,761
It's time for me to let go.

450
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:52,881
And now, I ask for nothing.

451
00:19:53,641 --> 00:19:57,200
All I wish is for her
to be safe and happy.

452
00:19:58,401 --> 00:19:59,320
That'd be enough.

453
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,881
Amitabha.

454
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,641
Miss Xu.

455
00:20:19,881 --> 00:20:20,480
Miss Xu.

456
00:20:20,641 --> 00:20:21,480
Just now, Miss Lvying...

457
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,120
Miss Xu?

458
00:20:24,561 --> 00:20:25,120
Miao.

459
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,240
Miao.

460
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,120
Miao.

461
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:31,960
Miss Xu!

462
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:32,641
Miao.

463
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,240
Miao.

464
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:35,041
Miss Xu!

465
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,080
Miao.

466
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:39,001
Miao.

467
00:20:42,561 --> 00:20:43,080
Miao.

468
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,641
Miao!

469
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,200
Miao.

470
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:54,720
Miao.

471
00:20:55,641 --> 00:20:56,120
Miao.

472
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,681
Miao.

473
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:02,080
Miao.

474
00:21:05,881 --> 00:21:06,401
Miao.

475
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,281
Miao!

476
00:21:20,761 --> 00:21:21,360
Official Zhao,

477
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,240
my relationship with Tie Niu is
none of your business.

478
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:23,960
Don't come near me.

479
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,641
Miss Lvying,

480
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,320
you're

481
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,080
breaking my heart.

482
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,240
How about this?

483
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,161
As the compensation,

484
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,761
tell me the whereabouts of Miss Shen.

485
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:36,240
What do you think?

486
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,240
I won't betray my miss.

487
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,681
You and Pei Yanzhen are
no good men.

488
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,080
Is Tie Niu a good person, then?

489
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:42,840
Tell me.

490
00:21:43,401 --> 00:21:44,480
How far along are you?

491
00:21:49,921 --> 00:21:50,360
Well...

492
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,681
Lvying,

493
00:21:57,681 --> 00:21:58,600
you're the best.

494
00:21:58,761 --> 00:21:59,360
Thank you.

495
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:10,840
Miao.

496
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:12,840
Miao.

497
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:15,960
Miao!

498
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,360
Miao!

499
00:22:21,881 --> 00:22:22,440
Pei Yanzhen.

500
00:22:22,761 --> 00:22:23,281
Miao.

501
00:22:23,561 --> 00:22:24,720
Stop following me.

502
00:22:27,881 --> 00:22:29,281
Listen to me, Miao.

503
00:22:37,521 --> 00:22:38,080
Pei Yanzhen.

504
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:39,561
Pei Yanzhen.

505
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:41,080
Pei Yanzhen!

506
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:41,960
Pei Yanzhen.

507
00:22:44,681 --> 00:22:45,320
Pei Yanzhen.

508
00:22:48,161 --> 00:22:49,440
Pei Yanzhen, are you out of your mind?

509
00:22:49,681 --> 00:22:51,001
Pei Yanzhen, why are you acting tough?

Are you going to say it or not?

680
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:26,681
I used to be a fool

681
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,001
that I took everything seriously.

682
00:32:32,281 --> 00:32:33,161
If you said this

683
00:32:34,401 --> 00:32:35,881
to me back then,

684
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,521
I would be extremely happy.

685
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,281
But it's different now.

686
00:32:45,801 --> 00:32:47,281
Since you've gone blind,

687
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,320
let's just pretend not

688
00:32:50,521 --> 00:32:51,440
to know each other,

689
00:32:52,401 --> 00:32:53,320
not to recognize

690
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,921
and not to see each other.

691
00:32:58,881 --> 00:32:59,921
But why would you

692
00:33:01,681 --> 00:33:03,801
persecute me like this now?

693
00:33:05,521 --> 00:33:07,360
What do you want from me?

694
00:33:09,281 --> 00:33:10,120
Is it Xiao?

695
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,440
Are you trying

696
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,480
to take away the only person left

697
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,921
in my life?

698
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,400
You still keep it.

699
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:10,640
Miao,

700
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,200
I don't want anything.

701
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:18,720
All I want is to be with you.

702
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:22,240
I won't fight for the custody
of our kid.

703
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:26,160
And I don't want the fortune
of the Shen and Lu families.

704
00:34:27,801 --> 00:34:28,601
Without you,

705
00:34:30,521 --> 00:34:31,801
I've got nothing left.

706
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,601
Even with great fortune in my hands,

707
00:34:39,081 --> 00:34:39,801
I'd only be

708
00:34:39,801 --> 00:34:41,801
a broken man.

709
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,761
In the past,

710
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,041
I've done a lot of foolish things

711
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,601
and made many mistakes.

712
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,160
I've disappointed you.

713
00:35:02,081 --> 00:35:03,041
But Miao,

714
00:35:04,281 --> 00:35:05,680
can you listen to me?

715
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,761
What else do you want to say?

716
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:13,920
Let me ask you this.

717
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,561
You asked to marry me back then.

718
00:35:19,081 --> 00:35:20,400
Was it a scheme

719
00:35:23,601 --> 00:35:24,561
right from the start?

720
00:35:28,321 --> 00:35:28,801
Yes, it was.

721
00:35:32,321 --> 00:35:33,920
I'm sorry about this.

722
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:39,841
Forget it.

723
00:35:42,801 --> 00:35:44,561
I agreed with your proposal
for another purpose as well.

724
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,761
You don't have to feel sorry.

725
00:35:51,801 --> 00:35:52,400
As for

726
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,081
the contraceptive soup,

727
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,761
was it your doing?

728
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,561
If you didn't love me,

729
00:36:02,321 --> 00:36:04,081
why would you let me
give birth to Xiao?

730
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,400
If you didn't want to acknowledge Xiao,

731
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,801
why would you

732
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,200
pester me?

733
00:36:20,801 --> 00:36:21,720
I did make

734
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,680
the contraceptive soup.

735
00:36:25,361 --> 00:36:27,920
But your preterm labor wasn't
an accident.

736
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,601
You were poisoned by Empress Dowager.

737
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:34,321
Your father told me

738
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:36,601
that the physician said

739
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,160
you can't be pregnant in recent years,

740
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:45,160
or it'll put your life at risk.

741
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,081
My dad?

742
00:36:50,081 --> 00:36:50,680
Yes.

743
00:36:51,761 --> 00:36:53,240
Back then in Lingzhou,
you asked me

744
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,920
if it was my plan

745
00:36:55,761 --> 00:36:56,680
that Third Master Song asked
to marry you.

746
00:36:59,041 --> 00:36:59,561
Miao,

747
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:02,680
with my feelings for you,

748
00:37:03,841 --> 00:37:06,321
how would I bear
to let you marry another man?

749
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,920
I did have other motives
for approaching

750
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,160
the Shen family at first.

751
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,121
But after getting along with you,

752
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:22,601
I've fallen for you.

753
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,041
I was too silly.

754
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,521
I didn't even realize

755
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,081
I was deeply in love with you.

756
00:37:40,361 --> 00:37:41,400
Look how fat it is.

757
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,780
(Good Virtue)

758
00:38:00,841 --> 00:38:01,960
(Then, I've got eyes)

759
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:04,400
(at Song's Residence.)

760
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,920
(I knew from the outset)

761
00:38:08,521 --> 00:38:10,260
(that you never slept with him.)

762
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,920
I was planning

763
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,361
to separate you two

764
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,920
to get you back.

765
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,361
Unexpectedly,

766
00:38:22,601 --> 00:38:25,240
you were diagnosed with pregnancy.

767
00:38:48,601 --> 00:38:49,640
(That time, Empress Dowager)

768
00:38:50,801 --> 00:38:52,200
(was suspicious of my identity.)

769
00:38:53,281 --> 00:38:53,920
(I was afraid if the physician told)

770
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,561
(the fact that you were pregnant
for four months,)

771
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,920
(Empress Dowager would hurt you.)

772
00:38:59,841 --> 00:39:02,841
I was also afraid if the physician said
you were pregnant for two months,

773
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,121
Xiao would acknowledge
another man as his father

774
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,321
and I'd part with my son.

775
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,200
(So I came up with an idea)

776
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,400
(and asked the physician)

777
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,801
(to lie that you were pregnant
for three months.)

778
00:39:16,281 --> 00:39:19,281
(To create confusion
about the identity of the kid.)

779
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,720
Hoping that it could protect
you and Xiao.

780
00:39:31,801 --> 00:39:32,400
Then,

781
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,561
I'll find a way to get Xiao back
to his real family.

782
00:39:42,521 --> 00:39:43,440
Unexpectedly, Empress Dowager

783
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,440
directly poisoned the fish soup,

784
00:39:48,521 --> 00:39:49,680
trying to kill the both of you.

785
00:39:51,521 --> 00:39:52,601
Since then, Third Master Song

786
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,281
noticed Empress Dowager's ill intention.

787
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,640
We formed an alliance

788
00:40:01,521 --> 00:40:02,640
because of you and Xiao.

789
00:40:10,121 --> 00:40:10,680
Miao,

790
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,440
this is everything.

791
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,361
Do you trust me now?

792
00:40:18,561 --> 00:40:21,521
What you said is too complicated.

793
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:23,761
I can't understand.

794
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:30,321
Pei Yanzhen,

795
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,761
I just want to ask

796
00:40:37,121 --> 00:40:38,561
if you've said

797
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,400
to annihilate my family?

798
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,640
Yanzhen,

799
00:40:52,321 --> 00:40:53,880
I just want you to tell me the truth.

800
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:58,841
Whatever you say today,

801
00:40:59,121 --> 00:40:59,920
I'll believe it.

802
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,160
Just

803
00:41:03,841 --> 00:41:05,121
don't lie to me again.

804
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:13,920
Yes.

805
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,440
I did say it.

806
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,680
But Miao,

807
00:41:36,281 --> 00:41:37,400
Song Xiyuan and I were...

808
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,640
"After the army was defeated,

809
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,601
the Shen family's 161 stores

810
00:41:42,281 --> 00:41:43,761
and 18 river routes used to deliver silk

811
00:41:43,761 --> 00:41:45,640
to the six provinces will be given
to Song Xiyuan."

812
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,601
It was also you who said it?

813
00:41:48,841 --> 00:41:49,400
Yes.

814
00:41:52,561 --> 00:41:53,920
Before you gave me
the jade pendant,

815
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,400
you already knew
it was an immunity token.

816
00:41:56,081 --> 00:41:58,440
You rejected the proposal
and put yourself at risk.

817
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,081
Meanwhile, you told
your foster mother to ask me for help.

818
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,400
It's to gain the Shen family's trust

819
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,081
and to catch
the imperial family off guard.

820
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:06,920
Am I right?

821
00:42:09,081 --> 00:42:09,680
Miao,

822
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,640
listen to me.

823
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,281
You chose the Song family
who wasn't as rich as the Shen family

824
00:42:14,561 --> 00:42:16,200
because they were
the royalty's insiders.

825
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,400
So they can work on the inside.

826
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,640
In this way,

827
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,720
the Shen family can't resist
the temptation, right?

828
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:22,240
Hence, the Shen family was always

829
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,841
the prerequisite
for the interest of your alliance.

830
00:42:24,281 --> 00:42:25,121
Just that my existence

831
00:42:25,121 --> 00:42:26,720
had ruined your entire plan.

832
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,200
Am I right?

833
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:27,960
Miao,

834
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,761
what makes you think so?

835
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,480
About what you've said,

836
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:33,001
part of it is true.

837
00:42:33,601 --> 00:42:34,041
But I'm...

838
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:34,920
There was a foreshadowing
of your doing.

839
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:35,960
Everything was interconnected.

840
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,081
Pei Yanzhen,

841
00:42:37,561 --> 00:42:39,361
have you always been

842
00:42:39,361 --> 00:42:40,281
so scheming?

843
00:42:41,121 --> 00:42:42,601
Everyone you love or hate,

844
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,121
the people who love or hate you,

845
00:42:44,121 --> 00:42:44,601
each of them

846
