I don't know

170
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,719
but I can tell

171
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,600
your father

172
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,800
is as immoral as you are.

173
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,279
Wang.

174
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,320
She's insulting you.

175
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:01,519
You don't say.

176
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,040
Sir.

177
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:03,320
Lend me your walking staff.

178
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,600
My friends.

179
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,239
Let's charge in.

180
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:23,640
Let's go.

181
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,839
Xu Sheng, is it?

182
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,959
Just you wait.

183
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:34,519
I live in the first house
by Shuangshi Bridge.

184
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:35,839
The one and only

185
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,440
- Xu Sheng is here.
- The first house by Shuangshi Bridge...

186
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,519
Don't run next time.

187
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:40,279
Sure.

188
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:42,199
Because the one running will be you.

189
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:43,639
Come anytime.

190
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:48,839
Come.

191
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,040
It's all right now.

192
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,639
Don't leave.

193
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,160
It's okay.

194
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,839
I chased them away.

195
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,040
However, you need to know

196
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,079
that if you have limited mobility,
don't visit the restaurant alone.

197
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,719
The world is unsafe.

198
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,480
You have to be extra careful.

199
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:06,839
Miss.

200
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:11,480
You said just now

201
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:13,519
that you are

202
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:15,839
Xu Sheng?

203
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:20,800
Sir, no need to repay

204
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,519
my kindness.

205
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,319
I'm on escort duty,

206
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,719
so my job is to fend off all evildoers.

207
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,839
Their simple tricks

208
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,360
are no match to me.

209
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,680
Sit down, Sir.

210
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,920
I have to go now.

211
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:37,319
Xu Sheng?

212
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,560
Sheng!

213
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:58,839
Sheng!

214
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:04,959
I'm here.

215
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,399
Where did you go?

216
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,719
Where did you go?

217
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:12,600
It's none of your business.

218
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,260
(Gujian Escort Agency)

219
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,160
Spare me, Warrioress.

220
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,920
Spare me.

221
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,680
I don't know where you learned

222
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,560
the Fist of Iron,

223
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,879
but my heart here

224
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,719
is already broken as it is.

225
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,680
If you hit it again, it'll shatter.

226
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,480
Enough of your quick wits.

227
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,199
If you want to live,

228
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,360
you have got to explain everything.

229
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,639
What happened today?

230
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,079
Tie Niu.

231
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,600
I'm thirsty.

232
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,000
Zhang San.

233
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,079
Leave him be.

234
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,519
He's pretending to be mysterious.

235
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,480
I hate people who make things up

236
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,000
and plot schemes.

237
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,519
Sheng.

238
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,519
If I'm thirsty,

239
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:14,680
I don't want to speak.

240
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,440
The pain

241
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:17,560
will affect my eloquence.

242
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,360
As expected from my beloved wife.

243
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:35,519
Are you done?

244
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,680
All right.

245
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,360
Our visit to Guchun Restaurant today

246
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:47,079
wasn't just a whimsical thought.

247
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:50,079
Today is the Dragon Boat Festival.

248
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:52,800
So?

249
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,480
Five years ago,

250
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,079
we met

251
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,040
on this day.

252
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:02,759
Young Master.

253
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,839
All the women are calling your name!

254
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,319
I only have my eyes on knowledge

255
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,480
and I never like to fool around.

256
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,719
Please refrain from bringing

257
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,879
romance up again.

258
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,279
How can you say that, Young Master?

259
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,160
You

260
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,199
are charming, handsome,

261
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:19,040
and dashing.

262
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,279
If you reject romance,

263
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,360
how many women will suffer?

264
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,360
They will have to live with this regret!

265
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,240
Such

266
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:27,040
is life.

267
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,879
Despite my jade-like beauty,

268
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,719
I am a man of restraint.

269
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:32,199
I'm afraid I have to

270
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:34,040
let those belles down.

271
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,719
Perhaps I will die alone.

272
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,399
I will wait
until the one I love appears.

273
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:44,000
What a shame.

274
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:49,759
Wait.

275
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:55,759
Yes, Sheng?

276
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,879
Master Song.

277
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,480
I might not be very bright

278
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:01,800
but I was asking you

279
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,040
if I had a history

280
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:05,000
with that blind man.

281
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,839
Why did you talk about
the Dragon Boat Festival

282
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:07,920
and the archery game?

283
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,639
Sheng.

284
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,800
The story is about to begin.

285
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:12,920
Patient now.

286
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,319
I...

287
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:14,560
I have another request.

288
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,319
Go ahead.

289
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,399
Can we

290
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,160
skip the part when you
exaggerate your appearance?

291
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,440
I had a huge lunch

292
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:20,279
and I don't want to puke.

293
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,759
But Sheng,

294
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,399
if we skip that part,

295
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,279
the entire story loses its soul.

296
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,360
- You...
- I don't mind.

297
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:33,600
If you add that part,

298
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,399
my ears might fall off.

299
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,800
All right.

300
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,519
May the man in the pavilion

301
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,160
be Third Master Song,
my prince charming?

302
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,079
Exactly.

303
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,360
Are you here for him too?

304
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,000
Not just that.

305
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,680
I'm here to kidnap him.

306
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,120
Who are you?

307
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,680
I'm your future wife.

308
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,079
Third Master!

309
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:04,920
Let him go!

310
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,440
In broad daylight,

311
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:08,399
you...

312
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:13,440
Wait.

313
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:17,719
Sheng.

314
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,480
I was about to get into the flow.

315
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:21,279
Can you stop interrupting me?

316
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,079
If I am strong and powerful,

317
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,240
how could I possibly fall into the river

318
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,120
when you shoved me?

319
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,480
That is because you

320
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,480
were head over heels for me

321
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,719
and I'm the only man you'd ever marry.

322
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,519
No girls

323
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,079
would want to hit their prince charming,

324
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,319
don't you agree?

325
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:38,199
Hear, hear.

326
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,839
That makes sense.

327
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,279
And then?

328
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:43,160
And then,

329
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,120
you struggled in the water.

330
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,399
I knew your life was in danger.

331
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:50,160
Although I am a fine gentleman

332
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,600
and I cannot share inappropriate
contacts with a woman,

333
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:52,480
as you

334
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:54,920
flew across the river

335
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,680
and landed before me,

336
00:14:57,319 --> 00:14:58,199
I finally understood

337
00:14:58,719 --> 00:14:59,360
what

338
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,000
love

339
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:05,199
at first sight meant.

340
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,120
Miss.

341
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:10,319
Are you all right?

342
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,719
You

343
00:15:14,719 --> 00:15:16,399
saved me.

344
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,240
For your deep feelings toward me,

345
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,959
I have to save your life.

346
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,839
Although I roam
in the martial arts world,

347
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,959
I still respect all moral codes

348
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,360
and keep a distance from men.

349
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,440
When you hug me like this,

350
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,319
it means I'm yours.

351
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:35,240
If you don't want this responsibility,

352
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,519
I would rather...

353
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,000
Sheng.

354
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,199
Hush.

355
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,040
My heart was aflutter

356
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,319
when I saw you fly across the river.

357
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,480
I hereby swear

358
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,279
that I will only ever marry you.

359
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:49,839
We will stay together

360
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,639
and I won't abandon you.

361
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:53,719
Xiyuan.

362
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,519
Sheng.

363
00:15:56,839 --> 00:15:58,079
The love story between

364
00:15:58,319 --> 00:15:59,519
a brave woman and a heroic man.

365
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,360
That will move everyone

366
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:03,199
to tears!

367
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:04,920
My heart!

368
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:07,440
Wait.

369
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,120
You...

370
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,560
What is this blatant obscenity?

371
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,480
His Highness developed this river.

372
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,680
His Highness planted this tree.

373
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,519
Without his permission,

374
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:23,399
no one

375
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,120
can get married here.

376
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,440
His Highness...

377
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,040
Are you...

378
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,319
That's right.

379
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,399
I am

380
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,800
the intimidating, the frightening,

381
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,199
and the impartial Regent.

382
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,639
That's me all right.

383
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,440
Wait.

384
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,839
What?

385
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:51,879
Zhang San.

386
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:52,959
Take him away.

387
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,199
I don't want to see him anymore.

388
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:55,879
Young Master.

389
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,120
- Don't play with a blade.
- Take it back.

390
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,040
What's the matter?

391
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,279
The Regent in your tale

392
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:02,800
isn't the one I met.

393
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:04,359
He looks like a courteous gentleman

394
00:17:04,639 --> 00:17:05,879
but you painted him

395
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,519
to be a bandit.

396
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,239
How do you know
he's a courteous gentleman?

397
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,960
Do you remember who he is?

398
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,160
I just know it.

399
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:32,599
You don't.

400
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,399
Come.

401
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:34,560
Sit down.

402
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,440
Sheng.

403
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,399
Listen to me.

404
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:40,560
Back then, you were

405
00:17:40,879 --> 00:17:41,879
a plunderer.

406
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:43,040
And Pei Yanzhen

407
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,160
killed everyone in your hideout.

408
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,999
But now, he's blind.

409
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:48,080
Karma catches up to him.

410
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,160
And it's only normal

411
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,759
that his temper softens.

412
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,399
But the hatred between you two

413
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,200
will not disappear.

414
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,519
But I saved him today.

415
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:58,560
So?

416
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,399
Even if you have the largesse

417
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,440
to forgo

418
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,200
this animosity,

419
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:03,879
it doesn't mean he'll do the same.

420
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:06,320
He is following you now

421
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,160
because he wants

422
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:09,359
your life.

423
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,160
Therefore,

424
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,800
lay low for the moment.

425
00:18:13,399 --> 00:18:14,279
And in the future,

426
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,200
stay far, far away from him.

427
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:18,080
Understood?

428
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:20,840
You're still sick.

429
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:22,200
So don't worry about this.

430
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,840
I'll take care of you.

431
00:18:38,399 --> 00:18:39,399
Have you done what I told you?

432
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,279
Yes, Young Master.

433
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:42,800
I told everyone to keep the secret.

434
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,239
She won't be able to find
anything at all.

435
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,279
But

436
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:48,759
we can't

437
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:50,560
hide it from her forever.

438
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,359
When Pei Yanzhen knows both of us
are here,

439
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:55,759
he will begin suspecting
Miaomiao's identity.

440
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:58,960
But since they are in Weiyang,

441
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:01,200
we might as well take Xiao away from him

442
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,320
and we'll leave together.

443
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:05,999
Young Master,

444
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,200
Official Pei has lost his sight.

445
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:10,960
He won't be as shrewd as he was before.

446
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,519
I'm sure you can outwit him

447
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:13,920
by working harder.

448
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:21,440
You're so bad

449
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,440
at conversations.

450
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:38,119
Young Master,

451
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,359
you are always obedient.

452
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,879
What got into you today?

453
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,040
Let's clean our faces

454
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,519
and sleep early, all right?

455
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:50,560
Mother is still alive.

456
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,239
Lvying, let me do it.

457
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,800
I did see Mother today.

458
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,479
I know.

459
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:32,040
Why won't Lvying believe me?

460
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:33,399
Also,

461
00:20:33,639 --> 00:20:35,999
why did Mother leave me?

462
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,720
Because I made a mistake.

463
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,840
Your mother is mad at me.

464
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:52,680
I miss her.

465
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,080
Me too.

466
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,320
Careful.

467
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,720
Okay.

468
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,599
Come.

469
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,720
What's the situation down there?

470
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:13,759
- Come.
- Come.

471
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:14,560
Be careful.

472
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:16,399
Steady.

473
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,560
Make sure you catch me.

474
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,359
Okay.

475
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:19,879
Here he goes.

476
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,759
Quiet!

477
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,680
Wang.

478
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,040
Pipe down.

479
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,720
Don't make any sound

480
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,080
and alert the people
from the escort agency.

481
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:32,800
I wanted my father

482
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,399
to teach them a lesson.

483
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,479
But when he heard that it's
Xu's Escort Agency,

484
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,359
he grounded me.

485
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,759
Quiet!

486
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:41,759
Pfft.

487
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,560
Who do they think they are?

488
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,359
Wang.

489
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,720
We'll burn this place down

490
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,840
and that should show the fierce woman
who's boss.

491
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:50,560
I like it.

492
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,080
Make sure we do it properly.

493
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,359
What should we light up first?

494
00:21:57,239 --> 00:21:57,960
We have to think hard.

495
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,639
The firewood storeroom.

496
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,720
Right.

497
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,479
That's a brilliant idea.

498
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:02,800
Where is the firewood storeroom?

499
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,759
I'll bring you there.

500
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,840
- No!
- Don't!

501
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,639
Are you running now?

502
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,399
Pull me up.

503
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:12,720
Pull me up!

504
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,759
Run now!

505
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,599
Go ahead.

506
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,279
Warrioress,

507
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,359
we are sorry.

508
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:29,440
Please let us go.

509
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:31,479
If you leave,

510
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:32,759
who's going to finish the supper?

511
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,279
I

512
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,160
have a question.

513
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,639
Does your father work in politics?

514
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,680
Warrioress,

515
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,160
please don't report my father.

516
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:54,680
Do I look like someone who does that?

517
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,479
If all your fathers work in politics,

518
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,920
do you know the Regent?

519
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,920
Regent?

520
00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:07,720
Why do you ask?

521
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:10,119
Well...

522
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:12,920
We had a history.

523
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:14,200
He's your enemy?

524
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,560
Someone who afflicted

525
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,320
the Regent is still alive?

526
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,680
Tell me everything.

527
00:23:18,879 --> 00:23:20,160
Don't waste my time.

528
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:21,800
I'll tell you everything.

529
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:22,999
Everything.

530
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:55,960
I found it.

531
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,040
There's a Xu's Escort Agency
by Shuangshi Bridge.

532
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:01,359
While they were offering
their escort service two years ago,

533
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:02,440
they ran into bandits

534
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:04,519
and only their daughter survived.

535
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,720
Her name is Xu Sheng.

536
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:08,479
Have you seen the daughter?

537
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:10,759
No.

538
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:13,759
But Pei Yanzhen,

539
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,879
allow me to remind you

540
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:19,160
that Shen Miao is dead.

541
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,920
Even if you find her doppelganger,

542
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,840
she will never be
the Shen Miao you knew.

543
00:24:24,399 --> 00:24:25,279
No, it's not a doppelganger.

544
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,960
It is her. I'm sure.

545
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:29,960
Have you forgotten

546
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,519
the last two years you had with Xiao?

547
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,560
We finally moved on from the incident.

548
00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:35,440
And we

549
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,239
are away from the capital
that fills you with so much pain.

550
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,320
So why can't you let go of your past?

551
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:40,960
Some things

552
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,560
cannot

553
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,599
be forgotten.

554
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,800
But false hopes

555
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,440
will turn into despair.

556
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:04,560
So this Regent

557
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,840
is such

558
00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:10,720
a cold-blooded man.

559
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,119
He seduced and tricked

560
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:17,999
Shen Miao and His Majesty.

561
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,680
His scheme was so thorough
that nothing was spared.

562
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,200
But he's blind now...

563
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,999
This...

564
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:28,560
This...

565
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,519
This is called a payback!

566
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:32,119
It feels amazing.

567
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,639
Right?

568
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:42,399
Blind...

569
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,479
Blind?

570
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:46,239
It sounds familiar.

571
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:48,399
Wang!

572
00:25:48,879 --> 00:25:51,680
Didn't you hit a blind man
during the day?

573
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,560
Exactly.

574
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,840
Xu,

575
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,960
you said the Regent
is a blind man?

576
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,359
Wang.

577
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:58,519
What's there to be afraid of?

578
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:00,720
I'm here.

579
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,119
I'll protect you.

580
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:04,639
I don't care how powerful he is.

581
00:26:04,879 --> 00:26:08,200
I'll make him eat dirt.

582
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:10,999
Xu.

583
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,279
You shouldn't inquire
about the Regent.

584
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:15,160
I heard

585
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:17,999
that in the capital,

586
00:26:18,639 --> 00:26:20,519
those who upset him

587
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,759
either lost a limb

588
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,119
or the entire family.

589
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:27,920
Even the distant relatives...

590
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,119
Wang.

591
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:31,599
Continue, please.

592
00:26:32,879 --> 00:26:34,080
Even the distant relatives
will not be spared.

593
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:37,599
For real?

594
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,639
- Wang.
- Wang.

595
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:40,840
- Wang.
- Wang.

596
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,680
You can't drink at all.

597
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,440
(Guchun Restaurant)
Anyway,

598
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,879
it's getting late.

599
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,560
Bring him back.

600
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,560
Let's hang out another time.

601
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,599
Yes.

602
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,519
Let's hang out another time.

603
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:50,800
Yes.

604
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,399
Xu.

605
00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:52,479
Keep in touch.

606
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:53,239
Visit the restaurant often!

607
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,960
See you, Xu.

608
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,080
Put it under their tab.

609
00:26:57,639 --> 00:26:58,359
Yes, miss.

610
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,470
(Guchun Restaurant)
Xu.

611
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:02,720
Young Master!

612
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:04,680
Young Master!

613
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,599
So?

614
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,519
Did you find her?

615
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,560
I checked everywhere.

616
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:10,800
I even went to the places she frequents.

617
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:11,879
Young Master,

618
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:14,479
perhaps Miss Sheng is bored

619
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,999
and she went to another place?

620
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:17,200
Oh, no.

621
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,960
Pei Yanzhen must have taken her away.

622
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:21,800
I knew what happened during the day

623
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,639
couldn't be covered up that easily.

624
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,279
All of you,

625
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,399
bring your weapons.

626
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,320
Come!

627
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:30,560
Young Master,

628
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,239
what is our plan?

629
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,759
Break her out.

630
00:27:33,639 --> 00:27:34,239
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

631
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,279
It's so crowded.

632
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:04,960
So...

633
00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:08,080
So beautiful.

634
00:28:11,879 --> 00:28:13,200
Mother!

635
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,399
Come!

636
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,920
Mother,

637
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:17,399
come!

638
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,599
Mother.

639
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,359
Come!

640
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,200
Mother.

641
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,639
You're still alive.

642
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,800
It's been two years.

643
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,479
I finally found you.

644
00:28:26,479 --> 00:28:28,720
Why didn't you come to find me?
I'm Xiao.

645
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,519
Xiao?

646
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,040
Ask Pei Yanzhen to come out.

647
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:42,239
I tolerated him for three years

648
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,200
and he dares to come to Weiyang
to stir up troubles again?

649
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:47,440
Master Song,

650
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,320
I remember you said you never
wanted to see His Highness again

651
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,519
(Pei's Residence)
when you left the capital.

652
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,920
But you came to us today.

653
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,519
I guess you're eating your words today.

654
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,840
You stole something from us

655
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:00,879
so don't pretend you're in the right.

656
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:02,080
Master Song,

657
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,999
if it weren't for
His Highness's generosity,

658
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,800
you would have been beheaded

659
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,519
for the assassination attempt.

660
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,879
His Highness is now the Regent.

661
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,599
He can have all the things he wants.

662
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,639
What does he want

663
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,040
from you?

664
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:21,160
His Highness is used to commit

665
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,599
theft.

666
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:24,359
It's only logical
that we suspect him first.

667
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,279
And you're just his underling.

668
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:28,080
Get off your high horse.

669
00:29:28,639 --> 00:29:29,119
You...

670
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,560
Tie Niu.

671
00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:31,399
Attack.

672
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,200
Stop.

673
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:39,800
Cease now.

674
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:42,720
Your Highness.

675
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:48,200
Third Master.

676
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:50,440
It's been a few years.

677
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,879
How do you do?

678
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:52,879
Better than you,

679
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,920
undoubtedly.

680
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,320
(Moral)
Oh, sweet vengeance.

681
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,840
Karma finally catches up to you.

682
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:00,879
Song Xiyuan!

683
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:02,080
Calm down now.

684
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:03,999
Your master is weak.

685
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,560
Don't yell

686
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:07,160
lest you frighten him.

687
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,440
Also,

688
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,999
may I remind you

689
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:12,119
that I am now

690
00:30:12,639 --> 00:30:14,960
the Minister of Revenue?

691
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,359
Getting in my way

692
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:19,560
is akin to disrespecting His Majesty.

693
00:30:20,639 --> 00:30:21,720
Your Highness,

694
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,759
do you truly want to mess with me

695
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:24,759
in Weiyang?

696
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,519
It seems like your blindness
did not cloud your judgment.

697
00:30:33,239 --> 00:30:35,639
You agree with me, don't you?

698
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,639
Oh, Master Song,

699
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,200
I just arrived at Weiyang today.

700
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,239
I am traveling around

701
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:43,080
to seek a way to restore my vision.

702
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,399
I'm sure your nightly visit

703
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:47,519
stems from a misunderstanding,
Official Song.

704
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,840
You think I'd believe that?

705
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:49,800
Why not?

706
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,320
Does a Regent have nothing to do?

707
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:58,160
I'm not as free as you are,

709
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,359
Have you forgotten, Your Highness?

710
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,879
Official Song left the capital

711
00:31:05,879 --> 00:31:09,160
because you took his spot.

712
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,119
Nonsense!

713
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:12,200
My master left the capital for his...

714
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,639
His what?

715
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:20,680
We both know the answer.

716
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,599
Don't play dumb.

717
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,519
I will not stop tonight

718
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:25,759
unless I go in for a search.

719
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:27,359
Move aside.

720
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:34,160
I don't know which of your belongings
went missing

721
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,239
but it sure sounds precious.

722
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:37,279
Official Zhao.

723
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:39,599
Allow Official Song
to search the premise.

724
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:41,960
Your Highness!

725
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:42,879
Do it.

726
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:45,040
My friends.

727
00:31:45,879 --> 00:31:46,399
Search the place.

Young Master.

729
00:31:51,879 --> 00:31:52,519
What now?

730
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,920
Pei Yanzhen is cunning.

731
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,399
The fact that he allowed us
to walk in like that

732
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:00,920
means it's a trap.

733
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:01,920
Trap?

734
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:02,639
What trap?

735
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:03,599
I don't know.

736
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,759
But they don't look like

737
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,119
they are aware of Miaomiao's survival.

738
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:12,160
Are you done whispering there?

739
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:14,359
His Highness wants to rest already.

740
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:19,720
I'm in a great mood today

741
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,040
so I will let it slide for the moment.

742
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,399
We

743
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:23,960
will meet again.

744
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:24,879
Hold on.

745
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:27,800
Third Master.

746
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:30,720
Although we go way back,

747
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,720
whatever bond between us was destroyed

748
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:36,399
when Miao died.

749
00:32:37,879 --> 00:32:40,239
It's fine that you made a scene
before my residence today.

750
00:32:40,879 --> 00:32:42,080
But if this occurs again...

751
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,840
Pei Yanzhen.

752
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:44,840
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

753
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,279
Miaomiao died because of you

754
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,999
and I haven't settled
this score with you yet.

755
00:32:50,879 --> 00:32:51,759
You think you can?

756
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:52,720
I do.

757
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:54,080
But how?

758
00:32:55,639 --> 00:32:57,080
One life for another.

759
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:01,200
Then heed my words.

760
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,359
I will also blame you

761
00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:05,879
for Miao's death.

762
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,119
Sure.

763
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,239
Show me what you have then,
Your Highness.

764

Let's go.

765
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,040
He lost something

766
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,879
but instead of searching for it,

767
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:19,560
he came to make a fuss here.

768
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,119
I think he

769
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:22,399
is slowly losing his sanity.

774

where can she be?

775
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,879
It's all my fault.

776
00:33:42,239 --> 00:33:43,239
I didn't keep a close eye on her.

777

856
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,000
Why did I drink yesterday?

857
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,160
Now, I can't recall anything at all.

858
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,399
I finally got some information yesterday

859
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:52,559
but I can't remember it.

860
00:38:54,319 --> 00:38:54,680
I...

861
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,280
Drunkard.

862
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:56,839
Sheng is a drunkard.

863
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:57,799
Drunkard.

864
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,079
Sheng is a drunkard.

865
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:01,559
Stupid bird, who are you calling
a drunkard now?

866
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,839
Eat your worms

867
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:04,280
and stop spilling nonsense.

868
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:06,799
I am a warrioress
from the escort agency.

869
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:08,200
Call me Warrioress.

870
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,399
Hurry up.

871
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,000
Warrioress.

872
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,160
Call me "Mother",

873
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,160
Xiao.

874
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,559
Come on now.

875
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:19,520
Xiao?

876
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,760
Xiao?

877
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,639
What Xiao?

878
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,079
Who is this Xiao?

879
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,399
Tell me, you stupid bird.

880
00:39:25,399 --> 00:39:26,079
Who is this Xiao?

881
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,119
Stupid bird.

882
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:28,720
Come back!

883
00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:30,520
The Attendant, Ji Yun, submitted this.

884
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:32,920
- He said...
- Your Highness!

885
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:33,760
Your Highness!

886
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:35,319
I have bad news.

887
00:39:35,879 --> 00:39:36,639
Xiao went missing.

888
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:37,480
When did that happen?

889
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,280
I went to rouse Young Master

890
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,399
but his bed was cold.

891
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:42,000
I figure he must have left
for a long time.

892
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,079
I found a letter on his bed.

893
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,280
What did it say?

894
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:50,839
(To Father)
Xiao said

895
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,839
he didn't want to stay by your side

896
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,599
and he wanted to leave.

897
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,039
Zhan Yue.

898
00:39:58,359 --> 00:39:59,000
Go look for him.

899
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:00,839
Noted.

900
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,119
Stupid bird.

901
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,119
Stop there.

902
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,599
Stop!

903
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,280
Weird.

904
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,879
It flew in here.

905
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,639
Where did it go?

906
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,440
(Beans)

907
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,520
It's you.

908
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,760
Mother!

909
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:57,079
Why are you calling me "Mother" again?

910
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:58,680
Don't call me that.

911
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:00,280
You can call me "Sister".

912
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:02,920
What?

913
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,720
Don't look at me with those eyes.

914
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:07,160
Just so you know,

915
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,720
they won't work on me.

916
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,960
I won't grow soft.

917
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:11,839
I'm a warrioress. It won't work.

918
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,200
Mother.

919
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:18,319
Whatever.

920
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,160
It's by sheer luck
that we met each other again.

921
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,319
Come.

922
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,639
If you listen to me

923
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:26,359
you won't throw a tantrum,

924
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:27,720
and you will follow me quietly,

925
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,799
I'll take you with me.

926
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:29,520
All right?

927
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,000
Let's go.

928
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:34,480
We'll catch a bird.

929
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:39,280
I'll definitely catch that stupid bird.

930
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,119
It won't be able to escape.

931
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:00,879
Do I look good in it?

932
00:42:00,879 --> 00:42:01,520
You do.

933
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:15,240
There's a performance.

934
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:16,280
Come.

935
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,200
