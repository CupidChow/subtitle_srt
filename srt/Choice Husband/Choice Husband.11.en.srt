00:01:34,892 --> 00:01:36,731
I wonder what your question is.

20
00:01:39,371 --> 00:01:41,292
May I ask who is the father

21
00:01:41,292 --> 00:01:42,331
of the baby inside your tummy?

22
00:01:46,532 --> 00:01:46,972
What's wrong?

23
00:01:47,252 --> 00:01:48,331
You do want to answer me?

24
00:01:48,892 --> 00:01:50,451
Do you refuse to pay up on your promise?

25
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:53,731
Of course not.

26
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:55,371
I'm all ears.

27
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:02,091
As I'm pregnant with the baby,

28
00:02:02,532 --> 00:02:03,972
it certainly is my baby.

29
00:02:08,651 --> 00:02:11,772
I mean the father of the baby.

30
00:02:13,412 --> 00:02:14,772
We agreed to ask only one question.

31
00:02:14,772 --> 00:02:16,332
This is the second question.

32
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:18,252
Are you going to break your promise?

33
00:02:18,812 --> 00:02:19,412
Besides,

34
00:02:19,731 --> 00:02:21,692
how could you ask such a question?

35
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:23,532
You knew
I'm the daughter of the Shen family.

36
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:25,211
May I know who you are?

37
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:31,091
Your Majesty.

38
00:02:31,571 --> 00:02:34,332
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

39
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:43,211
Your Majesty, I'm Magistrate Pei Yanzhen
of Lingzhou City.

40
00:02:43,692 --> 00:02:47,132
- Long live Your Majesty!
- Long live Your Majesty!

41
00:02:52,332 --> 00:02:53,011
You may rise.

42
00:02:53,451 --> 00:02:54,812
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

43
00:02:59,371 --> 00:03:00,252
Come.

44
00:03:01,491 --> 00:03:02,731
Yanzhen, that's so fast of you.

45
00:03:03,332 --> 00:03:05,011
I don't know if you're here for me

46
00:03:05,332 --> 00:03:06,371
or for Miss Shen?

47
00:03:06,972 --> 00:03:08,851
I didn't know Your Majesty is here.

48
00:03:08,851 --> 00:03:09,692
Please forgive me

49
00:03:09,931 --> 00:03:11,011
for not greeting you properly.

50
00:03:11,332 --> 00:03:11,772
Well,

51
00:03:12,252 --> 00:03:13,651
if I wanted to condemn you,

52
00:03:14,132 --> 00:03:15,332
I wouldn't have talked to you like this.

53
00:03:15,812 --> 00:03:17,011
Don't push it.

54
00:03:19,772 --> 00:03:20,651
I guess Miss Shen

55
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,291
doesn't know

56
00:03:22,532 --> 00:03:23,772
about my relationship with Yanzhen.

57
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:27,332
I'm slow-witted.

58
00:03:27,692 --> 00:03:29,412
I dare not speculate
on the royal family.

59
00:03:30,651 --> 00:03:31,291
Pei Yanzhen.

60
00:03:31,892 --> 00:03:32,692
You vixen gave

61
00:03:33,211 --> 00:03:34,651
your heart to another vixen.

62
00:03:35,692 --> 00:03:37,091
You're in big trouble now.

63
00:03:41,332 --> 00:03:42,571
Well, break it up.

64
00:03:43,532 --> 00:03:45,172
I'm here to mingle among the commoners.

65
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:47,451
Don't gather here
and interrupt the people.

66
00:03:48,412 --> 00:03:49,091
Noted.

67
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:53,972
It's been years.

68
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:57,332
The bridge and lake look
the same as they did.

69
00:03:57,651 --> 00:03:59,532
I think you must've renovated them.

70
00:04:01,172 --> 00:04:02,332
You keep the look

71
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:04,651
of the house like it used to be
when I was young.

72
00:04:05,571 --> 00:04:07,291
How sweet of you.

73
00:04:08,451 --> 00:04:09,851
You're being overly gracious.

74
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:11,451
I got

75
00:04:11,731 --> 00:04:14,172
this residence by chance

76
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:15,571
a few years ago.

77
00:04:15,852 --> 00:04:16,412
Now

78
00:04:16,891 --> 00:04:18,532
I can present it to you.

79
00:04:22,621 --> 00:04:24,328
(Property deed)

80
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:31,572
You don't have to do this.

81
00:04:33,132 --> 00:04:36,091
Actually, I didn't mean to seize

82
00:04:36,331 --> 00:04:37,771
Shen's Rice Shop.

83
00:04:38,852 --> 00:04:40,412
Just that Miss Shen's matter has

84
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:42,331
implicated the leading officials

85
00:04:42,572 --> 00:04:44,452
and the future candidate
of court purveyor.

86
00:04:45,532 --> 00:04:46,972
If you were exempted from the penalty,

87
00:04:47,452 --> 00:04:49,732
it'd bring trouble to the Shen family.

88
00:04:51,211 --> 00:04:53,572
I understand.

89
00:04:53,812 --> 00:04:54,331
Well,

90
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:56,412
it's a matter in the past.

91
00:04:57,572 --> 00:04:59,211
I wonder

92
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:02,812
what Miss Shen looks like
as she has made

93
00:05:02,812 --> 00:05:04,211
the two talented men fall for her.

94
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:08,171
How about this?

95
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:09,651
We'll have dinner

96
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:11,812
at your residence today.

97
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:16,171
Yes, noted.

98
00:05:17,331 --> 00:05:18,972
I'll go arrange it now.

99
00:05:19,532 --> 00:05:20,852
Shen Qian.

100
00:05:24,452 --> 00:05:25,692
Keep it well.

101
00:05:28,572 --> 00:05:29,812
I'll excuse myself.

102
00:05:38,651 --> 00:05:39,972
It's too risky for you to mingle

103
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:41,452
among the commoners.

104
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,532
You and Her Highness are
not in the capital.

105
00:05:43,532 --> 00:05:45,171
Who is it that handles
the public affairs?

106
00:05:45,771 --> 00:05:46,891
I rarely came out.

107
00:05:47,572 --> 00:05:48,292
Can't you

108
00:05:48,732 --> 00:05:50,252
treat me like your friend?

109
00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:53,091
If you

110
00:05:53,532 --> 00:05:54,331
were my friend,

111
00:05:55,532 --> 00:05:57,051
why would you come and see Miao?

112
00:05:59,491 --> 00:06:00,812
I came just to see

113
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:03,852
if the woman who made your heart flutter

114
00:06:05,012 --> 00:06:06,611
is an ugly woman without virtue

115
00:06:06,611 --> 00:06:07,692
like Shen Qian said.

116
00:06:09,732 --> 00:06:10,211
Your Majesty.

117
00:06:10,891 --> 00:06:11,331
Don't worry.

118
00:06:12,252 --> 00:06:12,891
I know

119
00:06:13,611 --> 00:06:15,012
the Shen family refuses
to marry her to me.

120
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:17,532
I'm not a narrow-minded person.

121
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:19,252
I won't get mad because of this.

122
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:21,692
But,

123
00:06:21,812 --> 00:06:22,891
Mother and I

124
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:24,331
came to Lingzhou City

125
00:06:25,091 --> 00:06:26,532
just to look into one thing.

126
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:29,371
This is related to Shen Miao.

127
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:30,771
What is it?

128
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,091
The former court purveyor, Lu family.

129
00:06:35,252 --> 00:06:36,051
Mother heard

130
00:06:36,532 --> 00:06:38,012
that the fortune Lu family left behind

131
00:06:38,852 --> 00:06:40,852
is currently in Shen Miao's hands.

132
00:06:42,091 --> 00:06:42,611
Pei Yanzhen,

133
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:44,931
according to Mother's personality,

134
00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:47,091
what do you think
she'll do to Shen Miao?

135
00:07:03,611 --> 00:07:04,331
What do you think

136
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:06,891
Pei Yanzhen's relationship

137
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,211
with His Majesty is?

138
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:10,012
Whatever it is,

139
00:07:10,412 --> 00:07:11,452
it has nothing to do with you.

140
00:07:12,491 --> 00:07:13,611
Why do I feel like

141
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:14,732
they're like friends

142
00:07:14,732 --> 00:07:15,852
and enemies?

143
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:17,852
By the way,

144
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:19,091
didn't you say

145
00:07:19,091 --> 00:07:20,972
the Empress Dowager came
to Lingzhou City today?

146
00:07:21,771 --> 00:07:22,572
One of them came

147
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:24,891
looking for my dad
and another one came to me.

148
00:07:25,931 --> 00:07:26,572
Third Master Song,

149
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:28,692
did they take this southern tour

150
00:07:28,692 --> 00:07:30,171
for the Shen family?

151
00:07:32,012 --> 00:07:32,771
What are you thinking?

152
00:07:33,611 --> 00:07:36,012
An inspection tour has existed
since ancient times.

153
00:07:36,211 --> 00:07:36,852
Besides,

154
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:39,091
we're just lowly merchants.

155
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:40,651
No matter how good our business is,

156
00:07:41,171 --> 00:07:42,331
they don't have to go this far.

157
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:45,292
Indeed.

158
00:07:49,532 --> 00:07:50,132
Your Highness,

159
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,491
I heard that you love tea.

160
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:54,931
I happen

161
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:58,491
to have a piece of fine brick tea.

162
00:07:59,091 --> 00:08:00,771
Please have a taste.

163
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,532
That's so thoughtful of you.

164
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:06,132
The Shen family is rich.

165
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:09,132
What you have is
certainly extraordinary.

166
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:12,331
One moment, please.

167
00:08:34,892 --> 00:08:36,252
This is it.

168
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:39,971
Your Highness,

169
00:08:40,212 --> 00:08:41,692
smell the fragrance of the tea

170
00:08:44,531 --> 00:08:46,092
and look at its color.

171
00:08:46,572 --> 00:08:48,572
It's a treasure of the century.

172
00:08:49,171 --> 00:08:50,411
I wouldn't take it out

173
00:08:50,411 --> 00:08:51,851
and share it with the guest

174
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:53,411
if it's an idler.

175
00:08:55,371 --> 00:08:56,171
Shen Qian,

176
00:08:57,452 --> 00:08:58,531
is this

177
00:09:00,411 --> 00:09:02,171
a briquette?

178
00:09:06,652 --> 00:09:08,531
You're so funny, Your Highness.

179
00:09:09,892 --> 00:09:10,851
Bring the boiled water over.

180
00:09:49,252 --> 00:09:49,851
Your Highness.

181
00:09:50,572 --> 00:09:51,171
Your Highness,

182
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:54,611
it's an odd way of brewing tea.

183
00:09:54,851 --> 00:09:56,892
But only the strangest way is

184
00:09:57,012 --> 00:10:00,012
good enough
for the most extraordinary tea leaves.

185
00:10:02,892 --> 00:10:03,931
Please have a taste.

186
00:10:04,572 --> 00:10:05,772
You don't have to do this.

187
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,291
This is such a precious thing.

188
00:10:07,572 --> 00:10:08,812
Just save it for yourself.

189
00:10:08,812 --> 00:10:10,291
You're too polite, Your Highness.

190
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,371
I'm not.

191
00:10:12,371 --> 00:10:14,291
Your Highness,
you must drink it while it's hot.

192
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,332
- So...
- Geez.

193
00:10:15,332 --> 00:10:17,132
His Majesty is here!

194
00:10:21,092 --> 00:10:22,652
Greetings to Your Majesty.

195
00:10:23,132 --> 00:10:24,012
Shen Qian, don't be too formal.

196
00:10:26,332 --> 00:10:26,892
Mother.

197
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,132
The place is surrounded
by bamboos and trees.

198
00:10:34,692 --> 00:10:36,692
Shen's Residence surely deserves
the praise.

199
00:10:37,611 --> 00:10:39,452
I didn't know Your Majesty was here.

200
00:10:39,611 --> 00:10:40,652
It's my bad

201
00:10:40,652 --> 00:10:42,572
for not greeting you in advance.

202
00:10:43,611 --> 00:10:44,892
Don't say that.

203
00:10:45,252 --> 00:10:46,092
If I didn't come today,

204
00:10:46,531 --> 00:10:49,171
I wouldn't know it is a rumor
that Miss Shen is an ugly woman.

205
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,012
When were you planning to tell me this?

206
00:10:56,851 --> 00:10:57,371
Rest assured.

207
00:10:57,812 --> 00:10:58,931
Yanzhen has explained it

208
00:10:59,252 --> 00:11:00,491
to me on our way here.

209
00:11:02,572 --> 00:11:03,772
Well, don't just stand there.

210
00:11:04,212 --> 00:11:05,051
Since we're in civil society,

211
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:06,692
just be casual.
Let's sit down and talk.

212
00:11:10,931 --> 00:11:12,371
I've long heard that you love tea.

213
00:11:12,892 --> 00:11:14,851
The tea is well-brewed.

214
00:11:15,772 --> 00:11:17,572
I'll help myself.

215
00:11:17,812 --> 00:11:18,611
- Son.
- Your Ma...

216
00:11:29,812 --> 00:11:30,291
As expected.

217
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:32,692
It's a nice tea.

218
00:11:45,812 --> 00:11:48,252
Miss, you need to take care
of your baby.

219
00:11:49,212 --> 00:11:50,491
I can't care about it.

220
00:11:50,692 --> 00:11:52,491
If I'm to put on a show
in the foyer later,

221
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:53,611
my life will be cut in half.

222
00:11:54,132 --> 00:11:54,772
Why is that?

223
00:11:55,171 --> 00:11:56,652
His Majesty seems like a gentleman

224
00:11:56,652 --> 00:11:57,692
who's easy to deal with.

225
00:12:01,252 --> 00:12:03,652
You're back, Miss Shen.

226
00:12:04,012 --> 00:12:06,452
I've waited here for so long.

227
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,611
Who are you?

228
00:12:13,611 --> 00:12:16,371
I'm Jingde who serves His Majesty.

229
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,491
His Majesty would like to use the fish

230
00:12:19,692 --> 00:12:23,212
he caught today to make a feast
for everyone at Shen's Residence.

231
00:12:23,731 --> 00:12:25,772
Please move to the foyer.

232
00:12:26,491 --> 00:12:27,411
A feast?

233
00:12:28,652 --> 00:12:31,212
I just came back with His Majesty.

234
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:32,731
But I didn't hear of this.

235
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:35,012
It's the Emperor's kindness.

236
00:12:35,012 --> 00:12:37,012
We can't doubt it.

237
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:38,252
His Majesty said

238
00:12:38,851 --> 00:12:41,371
Lingzhou is well-known
with its seafood.

239
00:12:41,931 --> 00:12:43,892
And the fish was caught by His Majesty.

240
00:12:44,171 --> 00:12:45,772
So he wanted to share it
with his people.

241
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,491
I'm pregnant

242
00:12:55,971 --> 00:12:57,252
and I'm exhausted today.

243
00:12:58,252 --> 00:13:01,171
Can you please count me out?

244
00:13:01,652 --> 00:13:03,012
You're too polite, Miss Shen.

245
00:13:03,652 --> 00:13:06,092
But this is His Majesty's order.

246
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:07,971
I can't disobey it.

247
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:10,731
Her Highness has
compassion for you

248
00:13:11,012 --> 00:13:13,171
so she asked us to prepare
a sedan chair for you.

249
00:13:24,572 --> 00:13:25,772
I dare not trouble you.

250
00:13:26,491 --> 00:13:27,652
I'll just go by myself.

251
00:13:28,252 --> 00:13:29,411
Please, Miss Shen.

252
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,040
(A refreshing scene after rain)

253
00:13:44,012 --> 00:13:47,491
I haven't had the delicacies
of Lingzhou for so long.

254
00:13:47,971 --> 00:13:50,611
I can finally satisfy my cravings today.

255
00:13:51,892 --> 00:13:53,012
Thank you

256
00:13:53,452 --> 00:13:54,611
for preparing a hearty meal.

257
00:13:55,411 --> 00:13:56,772
I'm flattered.

258
00:13:57,731 --> 00:13:59,332
They're all homely dishes.

259
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:03,012
This is the fish Your Majesty caught.

260
00:14:03,452 --> 00:14:05,772
It's my pleasure to be able to eat

261
00:14:05,931 --> 00:14:07,971
with Your Majesty and Your Highness.

262
00:14:10,332 --> 00:14:11,971
Your Majesty, Your Highness,

263
00:14:12,611 --> 00:14:13,611
since everyone is here,

264
00:14:14,012 --> 00:14:14,931
please start the feast.

265
00:14:15,212 --> 00:14:17,212
The fish soup won't taste good
if it gets cold.

266
00:14:17,892 --> 00:14:18,491
Wait.

267
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,611
Someone is not here yet.

268
00:14:27,171 --> 00:14:28,411
Greetings to Your Highness.

269
00:14:28,411 --> 00:14:30,452
It's unnecessary. Please rise.

270
00:14:30,772 --> 00:14:32,411
Thank you, Your Majesty, Your Highness.

271
00:14:33,652 --> 00:14:35,931
I'm flattered
as Your Majesty grants us a feast.

272
00:14:36,212 --> 00:14:37,252
You're gracious.

273
00:14:37,652 --> 00:14:38,572
I grant you a feast?

274
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:39,772
When did I...

275
00:14:39,772 --> 00:14:42,332
Miss Shen, you're pregnant.

276
00:14:42,692 --> 00:14:43,692
Please take a seat.

277
00:14:44,491 --> 00:14:45,012
Come.

278
00:14:45,411 --> 00:14:46,572
Sit with me.

279
00:14:55,491 --> 00:14:57,411
Miss Shen is indeed

280
00:14:57,411 --> 00:14:59,132
brilliant, beautiful

281
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:00,411
and lovely.

282
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:05,931
I see why
these two young men fall for you

283
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:07,692
and they're obsessed with you.

284
00:15:09,212 --> 00:15:10,132
I'm flattered.

285
00:15:10,252 --> 00:15:11,731
I'm just the daughter of a merchant.

286
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:12,772
I can be ignorant.

287
00:15:13,332 --> 00:15:14,772
If you're offended,

288
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:16,491
please forgive me.

289
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:17,491
Look at this girl.

290
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:19,772
Of course not, I like you.

291
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:21,611
I'm not offended at all.

292
00:15:23,692 --> 00:15:24,892
By the way, Shen Qian,

293
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:26,692
quickly take a seat.

294
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:28,572
- Help yourselves.
- Yes.

295
00:15:28,692 --> 00:15:30,371
Come, sit down and eat.

296
00:15:35,531 --> 00:15:37,892
It feels like she doesn't come in peace.

297
00:15:37,892 --> 00:15:39,171
Let's play it by ear.

298
00:15:57,132 --> 00:15:58,171
I've grown

299
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:00,772
rather fond of you.

300
00:16:01,892 --> 00:16:02,491
Well,

301
00:16:03,772 --> 00:16:05,252
here is a rose pie.

302
00:16:06,012 --> 00:16:07,212
See if it tastes good.

303
00:16:07,892 --> 00:16:08,572
Your Highness,

304
00:16:09,692 --> 00:16:11,772
rose has the effect
of promoting blood circulation.

305
00:16:12,252 --> 00:16:14,012
Miao is pregnant. She can't eat it.

306
00:16:15,371 --> 00:16:17,652
Yanzhen is knowledgeable.

307
00:16:17,652 --> 00:16:19,452
I'm such an old woman.

308
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:21,252
I'm confused about everything.

309
00:16:23,652 --> 00:16:24,252
By the way,

310
00:16:24,892 --> 00:16:26,611
that fried Chinese yam is neutral

311
00:16:26,772 --> 00:16:27,772
in nature and sweet.

312
00:16:28,012 --> 00:16:29,332
It's suitable for a pregnant woman.

313
00:16:30,371 --> 00:16:31,252
Try it, Miao.

314
00:16:31,971 --> 00:16:33,452
Your Highness, you might not know

315
00:16:33,611 --> 00:16:35,772
that Miaomiao doesn't like
to eat Chinese yam.

316
00:16:36,132 --> 00:16:38,252
I love my wife.

317
00:16:38,772 --> 00:16:41,491
I'll have to say this
even if there's a risk

318
00:16:41,731 --> 00:16:43,212
of being condemned by you.

319
00:16:45,332 --> 00:16:48,252
You're such a love fool.

320
00:16:52,252 --> 00:16:54,491
As both of you love each other so much,

321
00:16:55,051 --> 00:16:55,731
well,

322
00:16:56,171 --> 00:16:58,572
you'll finish the plate of Chinese yam
as a punishment.

323
00:16:59,892 --> 00:17:00,851
Thank you, Your Highness.

324
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,092
Your Majesty, Your Highness,

325
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:07,051
since Miao got pregnant,

326
00:17:07,051 --> 00:17:09,852
she can't bear the smell of fish
and eat meat.

327
00:17:10,732 --> 00:17:13,531
We wouldn't want Miao

328
00:17:13,531 --> 00:17:15,492
to disfigure your mood.

329
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,492
Why don't we let her go back first?

330
00:17:18,931 --> 00:17:19,732
Look at her.

331
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:24,812
It's my loss.

332
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:27,651
I'm afraid I can't eat with you,
Your Majesty,

333
00:17:28,051 --> 00:17:29,051
Your Highness.

334
00:17:33,212 --> 00:17:35,852
I haven't seen Jiu for a long time.

335
00:17:36,732 --> 00:17:38,092
Today, I finally see

336
00:17:38,732 --> 00:17:40,612
a kid I like.

337
00:17:41,332 --> 00:17:42,931
But we couldn't even have

338
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,452
a meal together.

339
00:17:46,171 --> 00:17:48,291
Miao, are you not willing
to eat with me?

340
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:49,891
Mother,

341
00:17:50,732 --> 00:17:52,931
I agree with Shen Qian.

342
00:17:53,931 --> 00:17:56,692
Miss Shen has taken a lake trip
with me for half a day.

343
00:17:56,692 --> 00:17:58,332
She must've been exhausted.

344
00:17:58,852 --> 00:18:01,011
Why don't we let her take a break?

345
00:18:05,891 --> 00:18:06,651
Well,

346
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:09,492
I'm sure Miss Shen has eaten a lot

347
00:18:10,051 --> 00:18:11,891
of Lingzhou City's delicacies.

348
00:18:12,732 --> 00:18:14,651
But this fish soup is

349
00:18:15,531 --> 00:18:17,612
personally prepared by His Majesty.

350
00:18:17,692 --> 00:18:18,771
It's fresh.

351
00:18:19,372 --> 00:18:19,931
Jingde.

352
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:20,852
Yes.

353
00:18:21,051 --> 00:18:22,771
Get Miss Shen a bowl of it.

354
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:23,291
Yes.

355
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:56,612
Well.

356
00:18:56,612 --> 00:18:57,291
Your Highness,

357
00:18:58,051 --> 00:19:00,411
I wonder if I have the chance

358
00:19:00,852 --> 00:19:01,612
to be

359
00:19:01,931 --> 00:19:03,531
the honored one to try the fish?

360
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:06,852
Of course, there'll be one bowl
for each of you.

361
00:19:07,092 --> 00:19:08,212
All of you can have it.

362
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:10,612
Mother,

363
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:13,131
this is the fish I caught.

364
00:19:13,972 --> 00:19:15,612
I should have the first bowl.

365
00:19:17,212 --> 00:19:19,051
What a hungry man.

366
00:19:21,492 --> 00:19:22,092
Fine.

367
00:19:23,051 --> 00:19:25,372
One for each of us.
Let's share the happiness.

368
00:19:27,171 --> 00:19:27,812
Jingde.

369
00:19:28,212 --> 00:19:28,692
Yes.

370
00:19:56,891 --> 00:19:58,212
The fish soup is fresh and tasty.

371
00:19:59,011 --> 00:20:00,612
You can drink it, Miss Shen.

372
00:20:11,572 --> 00:20:13,131
Thank you, Your Majesty, Your Highness.

373
00:20:15,411 --> 00:20:17,212
Thank you, Your Majesty, Your Highness.

374
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,291
Thank you, Your Majesty, Your Highness.

375
00:20:34,931 --> 00:20:35,812
Miss Shen,

376
00:20:36,692 --> 00:20:38,931
the fish soup is bestowed
by His Majesty.

377
00:20:39,212 --> 00:20:42,011
You can't knock it over.

378
00:20:44,692 --> 00:20:47,092
Gramercy, Your Majesty, Your Highness.

379
00:20:47,531 --> 00:20:48,372
Drink up.

380
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,640
(A refreshing scene after rain)

381
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,092
- How is she, Physician?
- How is she?

382
00:21:42,332 --> 00:21:43,972
Miss Shen has a stable pulse.

383
00:21:44,251 --> 00:21:45,612
There's no sign of being poisoned.

384
00:21:45,612 --> 00:21:47,051
What about the red dot on her neck?

385
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:48,732
What about the little red rash?

386
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:50,692
What about the color
of Miaomiao's lips?

387
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:51,812
She doesn't look right.

388
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:52,852
Is she poisoned?

389
00:21:53,492 --> 00:21:53,972
Well.

390
00:21:54,572 --> 00:21:55,011
Well.

391
00:21:55,452 --> 00:21:57,291
So, is she poisoned?

392
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:57,771
Yes.

393
00:21:57,771 --> 00:21:59,411
What do you mean?

394
00:21:59,411 --> 00:22:00,492
Just go.

395
00:22:01,051 --> 00:22:01,692
Yes.

396
00:22:02,852 --> 00:22:03,251
No.

397
00:22:03,852 --> 00:22:04,131
Well...

398
00:22:04,372 --> 00:22:04,812
You...

399
00:22:06,332 --> 00:22:07,131
How could you...

400
00:22:07,131 --> 00:22:08,251
Guys,

401
00:22:09,612 --> 00:22:10,771
I wasn't the only one

402
00:22:11,171 --> 00:22:12,411
who drank the fish soup.

403
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,972
Official Pei and Third Master Song,

404
00:22:14,972 --> 00:22:16,332
even His Majesty drank it.

405
00:22:16,332 --> 00:22:17,212
What can happen to me?

406
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:19,692
And this.

407
00:22:20,852 --> 00:22:22,531
I got this mosquito bite
when I was fishing

408
00:22:22,531 --> 00:22:23,531
by the lake yesterday.

409
00:22:23,852 --> 00:22:25,251
And hair loss is

410
00:22:25,452 --> 00:22:27,251
a normal sign during pregnancy.

411
00:22:28,411 --> 00:22:29,131
As for this,

412
00:22:29,771 --> 00:22:31,572
this is the lip balm

413
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:33,572
messed up after dinner.

414
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,372
I was going to fix my makeup.

415
00:22:36,372 --> 00:22:37,732
Yet, someone lied and said

416
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,452
I wasn't well when I just left.

417
00:22:39,612 --> 00:22:40,812
Then, I was sent back here.

418
00:22:44,092 --> 00:22:45,131
As long as you're fine.

419
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:47,572
Just get some rest.

420
00:22:47,572 --> 00:22:49,092
Yes, go back and rest.

421
00:23:03,051 --> 00:23:05,411
I hope that person can't find
cracks in this.

422
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:06,732
The fish soup was

423
00:23:06,732 --> 00:23:08,572
distributed to all of us.

424
00:23:08,732 --> 00:23:10,931
I guess there's nothing fishy about it.

425
00:23:11,612 --> 00:23:12,131
That person?

426
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:13,372
We're screwed.

427
00:23:14,251 --> 00:23:14,891
What do you mean?

428
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:16,411
We're screwed.

429
00:23:16,411 --> 00:23:18,320
(A refreshing scene after rain)

430
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,732
They have a lot of guts.

431
00:23:30,852 --> 00:23:33,131
Even though Shen Miao does
not feel well,

432
00:23:33,492 --> 00:23:35,651
how dare they forget to see us off?

433
00:23:40,651 --> 00:23:42,131
We're late.

434
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:44,492
Please condemn us,
Your Highness, Your Majesty.

435
00:23:45,171 --> 00:23:48,372
- Long live Your Majesty.
- Long live Your Majesty.

436
00:23:48,372 --> 00:23:51,972
- Long live Your Highness.
- Long live Your Highness.

437
00:23:52,452 --> 00:23:52,771
You...

438
00:23:52,771 --> 00:23:53,291
That's enough.

439
00:23:54,011 --> 00:23:55,051
Before creating a peaceful nation,

440
00:23:55,651 --> 00:23:56,692
we must take good care of the family.

441
00:23:57,171 --> 00:23:58,171
It's moral ethics.

442
00:23:58,931 --> 00:24:00,972
A family is
the basis of ethical culture.

443
00:24:01,651 --> 00:24:03,372
Besides, Miss Shen is pregnant now.

444
00:24:03,931 --> 00:24:05,891
It's understandable
that you care about her.

445
00:24:07,092 --> 00:24:07,732
All of you, rise.

446
00:24:08,251 --> 00:24:09,651
Thank you, Your Majesty.

447
00:24:10,891 --> 00:24:11,852
Come, easy.

448
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:21,212
What's wrong, Official Pei?

449
00:24:22,531 --> 00:24:23,692
I'm feeling a little dizzy.

450
00:24:23,852 --> 00:24:24,572
Thank you.

451
00:24:25,492 --> 00:24:26,572
You're welcome, Official Pei.

452
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:48,612
I'll get going.

Look at me.

455
00:25:20,651 --> 00:25:22,251
My monthly wage is less than five taels.

456
00:25:22,452 --> 00:25:23,492
I have to be your coachman,

bodyguard and hitman,

458

and do all those dirty things for you.

459
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:29,612
I might as well be the guard
of Shen family if I knew this.

460
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:30,692
I would be paid higher.

461
00:25:31,492 --> 00:25:33,212
I'm afraid you'll have
to do a thing for me.

What is it?

00:25:35,131 --> 00:25:36,332
Search the kitchen of Shen's Residence.

Impressive.

Wen Hao, it's from Nan Realm.

479
00:26:42,251 --> 00:26:44,372
The male and female plants
will never separate.

480
00:26:44,612 --> 00:26:46,852
The male plant is crimson in color.
It can hasten the baby delivery.

481
00:26:47,131 --> 00:26:48,891
It can kill
the pregnant woman invisibly.

482
00:26:49,212 --> 00:26:49,931
Once one eats it,

483
00:26:49,931 --> 00:26:52,011
she'll die of heavy blood loss
in four hours.

484
00:26:54,492 --> 00:26:55,732
Only the white female plant can
detoxify it.

485
00:26:56,692 --> 00:26:57,812
Wen Hao likes a warm and damp place.

486
00:26:57,812 --> 00:26:58,572
It's afraid of light and fire.

487
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:00,492
There's only one place

488
00:27:01,212 --> 00:27:03,411
in the palace
that is suitable to grow it.

489
00:27:04,612 --> 00:27:05,732
But it's been a while.

490
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:07,812
What if Jingde destroys the antidote?

491
00:27:08,332 --> 00:27:09,332
This is a unique thing.

492
00:27:09,812 --> 00:27:11,051
I'm sure the perpetrator

493
00:27:11,812 --> 00:27:13,011
will keep some so it can be

494
00:27:13,411 --> 00:27:14,411
of use in the future.

Go get the antidote.

496
00:27:18,411 --> 00:27:19,612
I'll hold them off.

I can't remember it all.

00:28:14,572 --> 00:28:16,011
you're a master of chess.

500
00:28:17,011 --> 00:28:18,852
Can you help me?

501
00:28:20,972 --> 00:28:22,891
It's an offense to interrupt

502
00:28:23,092 --> 00:28:23,852
your game.

503
00:28:24,131 --> 00:28:25,251
How would I dare to show myself off?

504
00:28:36,171 --> 00:28:37,011
I think

505
00:28:37,732 --> 00:28:38,771
the methods of playing chess vary

506
00:28:39,372 --> 00:28:40,291
in different situations.

507
00:28:42,332 --> 00:28:44,092
This pawn poses no threat to you.

508
00:28:44,812 --> 00:28:45,732
In my opinion,

509
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:47,891
it's best to wait and see.

510
00:28:51,492 --> 00:28:53,291
Your Majesty and Yanzhen,

511
00:28:53,651 --> 00:28:57,251
have you ever heard
of sacrificing a pawn to take the lead?

512
00:29:14,051 --> 00:29:15,212
What is the time now?

513
00:29:17,092 --> 00:29:18,011
It's already nine.

514
00:29:20,651 --> 00:29:21,732
So,

515
00:29:21,852 --> 00:29:25,011
it's less than one hour
before I go to bed.

516
00:29:42,732 --> 00:29:44,572
(Remember,
the crimson one is poisonous.)

517
00:29:44,852 --> 00:29:46,051
(The white one is the antidote.)

518
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,011
Who are you?

519
00:29:53,612 --> 00:29:54,852
There's an assassin!

520
00:29:55,452 --> 00:29:56,291
Help me!

521
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:56,732
Go!

522
00:29:58,852 --> 00:29:59,572
Don't make a sound.

523
00:30:07,171 --> 00:30:08,771
It's bad. There's an assassin!

524
00:30:11,651 --> 00:30:12,291
Quick.

525
00:30:13,572 --> 00:30:14,212
Go over there.

526
00:30:14,411 --> 00:30:15,051
Yes.

527
00:30:16,332 --> 00:30:17,171
Catch the assassin.

528
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:55,452
Miss.

529
00:30:56,612 --> 00:30:57,852
What's wrong, Miss?

530
00:30:59,051 --> 00:30:59,732
Do you have a stomachache?

531
00:31:03,051 --> 00:31:04,732
You're bleeding, Miss!

532
00:31:05,332 --> 00:31:07,332
Someone, help! Miss is bleeding!

533
00:31:07,771 --> 00:31:08,291
Miss.

534
00:31:10,212 --> 00:31:11,251
Someone. Help!

535
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:23,212
Quick, go get all the physicians over.

536
00:31:23,212 --> 00:31:23,692
Yes.

537
00:31:30,812 --> 00:31:32,092
Who are you?

538
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:33,692
How dare you lay a finger on me?

539
00:31:36,531 --> 00:31:38,531
Your Highness, look carefully.

540
00:31:38,531 --> 00:31:40,572
It's me. We met
at Pei's Residence last time.

541
00:31:46,812 --> 00:31:48,011
You're that silly guard.

542
00:31:48,692 --> 00:31:50,131
Did Pei Yanzhen ask you to come here?

543
00:31:50,572 --> 00:31:51,572
I know.

544
00:31:51,812 --> 00:31:53,771
I know that I'm an innate beauty

545
00:31:53,771 --> 00:31:55,531
that it's hard to forget.

546
00:31:56,931 --> 00:31:58,692
He even asked you
to bring me a token of love.

547
00:31:59,332 --> 00:32:01,051
But I already...

548
00:32:01,051 --> 00:32:01,812
Oh gosh.

549
00:32:02,332 --> 00:32:04,011
With your eloquence and personality,

550
00:32:04,332 --> 00:32:06,251
you and Pei Yanzhen could make
a good couple.

551
00:32:06,612 --> 00:32:07,212
You know?

552
00:32:07,612 --> 00:32:08,612
I'm handling a matter of life and death.

553
00:32:08,612 --> 00:32:09,332
So what?

554
00:32:17,011 --> 00:32:18,092
What are you doing?

555
00:32:18,092 --> 00:32:18,812
What is that sound?

556
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:19,612
Go look over there.

557
00:32:19,612 --> 00:32:20,291
- I...
- Yes.

558
00:32:25,212 --> 00:32:25,931
Give it to Pei Yanzhen.

559
00:32:26,092 --> 00:32:26,651
What?

560
00:32:38,051 --> 00:32:38,931
He should be in here.

561
00:32:39,011 --> 00:32:39,812
Let's guard here.

562
00:32:39,812 --> 00:32:40,931
Her Highness's men will be here soon.

563
00:32:42,812 --> 00:32:43,612
Beg for my help.

564
00:32:44,492 --> 00:32:45,092
You're here.

565
00:32:45,092 --> 00:32:46,171
The assassin is in the room now.

566
00:32:46,812 --> 00:32:47,332
Search it.

567
00:32:48,131 --> 00:32:48,651
Yes.

568
00:32:49,251 --> 00:32:51,011
I beg of you.

569
00:32:51,212 --> 00:32:52,051
Please help me.

570
00:33:01,492 --> 00:33:04,332
Jingde!

571
00:33:09,251 --> 00:33:10,011
Pei Yanzhen.

572
00:33:10,492 --> 00:33:12,212
What is this about?

573
00:33:12,572 --> 00:33:13,212
I don't understand.

574
00:33:13,332 --> 00:33:14,492
Please enlighten me.

575
00:33:16,171 --> 00:33:17,812
It was usually safe here.

576
00:33:18,452 --> 00:33:20,812
But many problems happened
when you came.

577
00:33:21,612 --> 00:33:22,051
Mother.

578
00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:23,171
Well...

579
00:33:23,171 --> 00:33:23,972
I don't understand

580
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:25,651
what you're talking about.

581
00:33:26,651 --> 00:33:27,492
Very well.

582
00:33:28,732 --> 00:33:30,931
You still want to beat around the bush.

583
00:33:32,692 --> 00:33:33,651
As such,

584
00:33:34,092 --> 00:33:35,332
let's talk

585
00:33:36,972 --> 00:33:38,291
about your mother.

586
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:47,972
Mother.

587
00:33:55,332 --> 00:33:56,212
Mother,

588
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:58,212
you have to seek justice for me.

589
00:33:58,812 --> 00:34:00,011
Jingde sneaked a peek

590
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:03,812
at me when I was getting changed.

591
00:34:04,572 --> 00:34:05,212
Your Highness,

592
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:07,092
I didn't do it.

593
00:34:07,092 --> 00:34:08,132
How dare you deny it?

594
00:34:10,652 --> 00:34:11,812
Mother,

595
00:34:12,731 --> 00:34:15,211
you had dinner
at Shen's Residence without me.

596
00:34:15,731 --> 00:34:17,612
So I took a walk at the Royal Garden

597
00:34:17,812 --> 00:34:19,652
and stepped on the flowers
to vent my anger.

598
00:34:19,652 --> 00:34:21,332
But he sent the soldiers out after me.

599
00:34:21,771 --> 00:34:24,132
He even sneaked a peek at me
when I was getting changed.

600
00:34:26,812 --> 00:34:28,971
That's enough. I understand.

601
00:34:30,612 --> 00:34:32,172
Come out with me, Jingde.

602
00:34:33,932 --> 00:34:34,531
Yes.

603
00:34:38,092 --> 00:34:41,971
Brother, you have to seek justice
for me.

604
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,572
Say something.

605
00:34:50,451 --> 00:34:51,491
What's going on?

606
00:34:53,172 --> 00:34:55,812
Your Highness, I didn't do it.

607
00:34:57,092 --> 00:34:58,691
This must be Pei Yanzhen's plan.

608
00:34:58,691 --> 00:34:59,172
Shut up.

609
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:02,451
If this continues,

610
00:35:03,132 --> 00:35:04,812
it'll only build walls
between me and His Majesty.

611
00:35:06,691 --> 00:35:07,932
Pei Yanzhen,

612
00:35:10,491 --> 00:35:11,812
I'd like to see

613
00:35:11,812 --> 00:35:13,932
how you're going to rescue Shen Miao.

614
00:35:16,771 --> 00:35:17,172
Quick.

615
00:35:17,172 --> 00:35:18,172
Be careful.

616
00:35:18,652 --> 00:35:20,211
Wash the towel.

617
00:35:20,771 --> 00:35:22,251
Get the warm water, quick.

618
00:35:23,812 --> 00:35:24,731
Take more warm water.

619
00:35:25,211 --> 00:35:26,771
Physician, how is she?

620
00:35:27,132 --> 00:35:28,092
I've practiced medicine for decades.

621
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:29,172
But I've never seen such a situation.

622
00:35:29,531 --> 00:35:30,092
Madam, you...

623
00:35:30,852 --> 00:35:32,652
You should leave it to chance.

624
00:35:33,491 --> 00:35:34,731
Physician! Physician!

625
00:35:34,971 --> 00:35:35,332
Someone!

626
00:35:35,332 --> 00:35:36,771
Go get me more physicians.

627
00:35:36,771 --> 00:35:38,332
Get all the physicians in the city over.

628
00:35:38,332 --> 00:35:39,132
Quick!

629
00:35:39,332 --> 00:35:40,612
Hurry up!

630
00:35:45,251 --> 00:35:45,852
Miss!

631
00:35:46,612 --> 00:35:47,211
Miss!

632
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:50,812
It hurts!

633
00:35:52,092 --> 00:35:52,932
Miss!

634
00:35:55,852 --> 00:35:57,852
Let us in.

635
00:35:57,852 --> 00:35:58,332
Let go of me!

Third Master, Old Master said

637
00:35:59,812 --> 00:36:00,852
no one is allowed to come in.

638
00:36:00,852 --> 00:36:01,812
Don't make things difficult for us.

639
00:36:01,812 --> 00:36:04,491
We're the paternal side of the baby.

640
00:36:04,731 --> 00:36:05,612
How dare you stop us?

641
00:36:07,051 --> 00:36:08,092
Stop pushing.

642
00:36:08,531 --> 00:36:09,051
Close the door.

643
00:36:09,051 --> 00:36:09,812
Let us in.

644
00:36:09,812 --> 00:36:10,771
Quick, close the door.

645
00:36:12,011 --> 00:36:12,491

To the back door.

Yes.

are you alright?

662
00:38:07,132 --> 00:38:08,531
The osmanthus flowers are blooming
at Pei's Residence

663
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,332
and the moon is bright.
