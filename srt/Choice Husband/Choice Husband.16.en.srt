After spending a few days

I had a narrow escape this time.

75
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:46,265
It means

76
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:49,066
His Majesty and I will usher
in the final battle

you wouldn't be

Third Master, you might not know.

116
00:07:23,865 --> 00:07:25,906
I became one of the Ministry of War

117
00:07:26,106 --> 00:07:28,226
from a petty official
because of the Empress Dowager.

118
00:07:29,106 --> 00:07:30,626
I've spent decades of effort

119
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:33,265
to become who I am today.

120
00:07:36,185 --> 00:07:38,745
Obviously, this is the destiny
of the Qin family

121
00:07:38,985 --> 00:07:40,386
and your great strategy.

122

With your protection of the country,

the ruling will last forever

124

and the people can rest easy.

125
00:07:48,745 --> 00:07:49,946
None of the officials

126
00:07:50,185 --> 00:07:52,826
would dare to compete
with you, General.

127
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,305
I didn't know

128
00:07:57,906 --> 00:08:01,066
you admired
my father so much.

129
00:08:03,145 --> 00:08:04,546
Miss Qin, have you ever heard

130
00:08:04,546 --> 00:08:07,066
"One can develop strong feelings
for someone in short time"?

131
00:08:07,786 --> 00:08:09,386
My admiration for General Qin is

132
00:08:09,546 --> 00:08:11,465
like the surging river.

133
00:08:14,506 --> 00:08:15,425
Unfortunately,

134
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:19,305
His Majesty is not
as broad-minded as you are.

135
00:08:19,546 --> 00:08:22,025
To him, the power
of the Qin family has

136
00:08:22,386 --> 00:08:24,465
restricted his authority as the Emperor.

137
00:08:24,745 --> 00:08:25,786
He never thought of this.

138
00:08:26,265 --> 00:08:28,906
The soldiers of the Qin family are
stationed at border gates.

139
00:08:29,985 --> 00:08:31,986
Otherwise, the nation wouldn't be
so peaceful.

140
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:35,625
So, it was a strategy

141
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,065
to set Pei Yanzhen up and evict him

142
00:08:38,546 --> 00:08:39,906
from the capital?

143
00:08:42,746 --> 00:08:43,746
He's just a mere man.

144
00:08:44,186 --> 00:08:46,546
I attached no importance to him.

145
00:08:47,705 --> 00:08:51,945
I admire your determination
and assertiveness.

146
00:08:52,546 --> 00:08:54,825
I'm willing to seek
a bigger picture with you.

147
00:08:55,186 --> 00:08:55,866
I wonder

148
00:08:56,546 --> 00:08:58,746
if you like that.

149
00:09:01,986 --> 00:09:03,786
I'm willing to work with you, General.

150

I'll do whatever you ask

00:10:31,906 --> 00:10:32,546
But now,

170
00:10:33,145 --> 00:10:34,226
it's been four years.

171
00:10:36,186 --> 00:10:38,145
Four years and yearning for

172
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:39,825
are a homonym.

173
00:10:40,825 --> 00:10:44,226
I won't forget my promise
for even a moment.

174
00:10:45,866 --> 00:10:46,346
Miao,

175
00:10:47,065 --> 00:10:47,786
do you remember that?

176
00:10:50,145 --> 00:10:51,866
You're attentive today.

177
00:10:52,465 --> 00:10:53,746
Is there something you want?

178
00:10:55,746 --> 00:10:56,986
Is that all?

179
00:10:57,786 --> 00:10:59,025
I've prepared this for so long.

180
00:10:59,385 --> 00:11:00,505
I thought you'd cry.

181
00:11:01,226 --> 00:11:02,226
You want me to cry?

182
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:05,346
Then, you should at least prepare
80 pairs of shadow puppets.

183
00:11:06,705 --> 00:11:07,746
Are you saying

184
00:11:08,986 --> 00:11:10,385
that you want to grow old
with me?

185
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,320
(Shen)

186
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,000
(Shen Xiao)

187
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,120
(Shen)

188
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,380
(Shen Miao)

189
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:19,666
What do you think?

190
00:12:20,346 --> 00:12:21,186
It's nice.

191
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,465
-Shen Xiao.

193

Xiao.

194
00:12:29,265 --> 00:12:29,825
Xiao.

195
00:12:30,465 --> 00:12:31,025
Miao.

196
00:12:31,145 --> 00:12:31,585
Miao.

197
00:12:33,306 --> 00:12:34,585
Xiao.

198
00:12:35,585 --> 00:12:36,426
Miao.

199
00:12:37,025 --> 00:12:37,986
Xiao, Miao.

200
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,346
Xiao, Miao.

201
00:12:43,906 --> 00:12:44,546
Xiao.

202
00:12:45,585 --> 00:12:46,465
Mother.

203
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:48,306
By the way,

204
00:12:49,505 --> 00:12:50,705
what are you doing here today?

205
00:12:52,145 --> 00:12:53,385
Can't I come here?

206
00:12:54,906 --> 00:12:55,505
You can.

207
00:12:56,786 --> 00:12:58,505
Let's continue, Xiao.

208
00:13:02,585 --> 00:13:04,346
It's the Qixi Festival tonight.

209
00:13:05,025 --> 00:13:07,025
Do you want to hang out with me?

210
00:13:08,265 --> 00:13:08,786
What a coincidence.

211
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,065
I've got plans tonight at home.

212
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:42,065
What are you up to again?

213
00:13:43,426 --> 00:13:43,986
Miao,

214
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:45,426
didn't you say

215
00:13:45,585 --> 00:13:47,226
that we got to start over

216
00:13:47,465 --> 00:13:49,465
and make up for the three years
of lost time?

217
00:13:49,786 --> 00:13:51,666
Let's start tonight.

218
00:13:52,986 --> 00:13:54,945
Rob...

219
00:13:59,025 --> 00:14:01,145
Robbery.

220
00:14:01,306 --> 00:14:02,145
Er Zhuzi?

221
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,825
I already saw your face.

222
00:14:03,825 --> 00:14:05,065
Why didn't you cover
your face well?

223
00:14:05,065 --> 00:14:06,265
Why bother pretending
to be a robber?

224
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:09,825
Miao, doesn't a romantic encounter

225
00:14:10,145 --> 00:14:11,945
always start with a heroic scene?

226
00:14:12,306 --> 00:14:13,546
Since we've missed out the past,

227
00:14:14,265 --> 00:14:16,746
why don't we start
with the first encounter?

228
00:14:18,186 --> 00:14:19,025
But,

229
00:14:19,306 --> 00:14:21,746
a show with such an opening is

230
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:22,986
normally an awful story.

231
00:14:23,145 --> 00:14:24,265
It's extremely tawdry.

232
00:14:24,825 --> 00:14:25,786
You don't like it?

233
00:14:27,186 --> 00:14:28,465
Then, it's my fault.

234
00:14:29,145 --> 00:14:30,065
I seldom watch shows.

235
00:14:30,585 --> 00:14:31,465
I've failed to make you happy.

236
00:14:31,986 --> 00:14:33,186
Don't put it this way.

237
00:14:33,746 --> 00:14:34,906
I watched a lot of shows.

238
00:14:35,465 --> 00:14:36,906
But I've never done one before.

239
00:14:37,106 --> 00:14:37,666
Right?

240
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,746
Come. Let's begin.

241
00:14:40,465 --> 00:14:43,145
Dazhuang, hold the blade higher.

242
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:45,705
Er Zhuzi, momentum is
the most important thing

243
00:14:45,705 --> 00:14:46,945
to play a robber.

244
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:48,106
Show me the momentum.

245
00:14:49,265 --> 00:14:49,786
Okay.

246
00:14:50,226 --> 00:14:50,825
Let's begin.

247
00:14:52,945 --> 00:14:55,346
You have such fair skin.

248
00:14:55,346 --> 00:14:58,025
I can sell you to Tianxiang Parlor
for a good price.

249
00:15:01,426 --> 00:15:04,306
No one will save you
even if you cry

250
00:15:04,906 --> 00:15:05,906
for help.

251
00:15:14,585 --> 00:15:17,025
This is too fake.

252
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:21,505
(Since Miao and I already
met each other,)

253
00:15:21,986 --> 00:15:24,265
(it's time to get acquainted
with each other.)

254
00:15:25,265 --> 00:15:27,945
(Normally, a man should write
the lady several poems as gifts.)

255
00:15:31,825 --> 00:15:35,346
People always say the ocean is deep,

256
00:15:36,465 --> 00:15:39,025
but it's no deeper
than my thought of you.

257
00:15:40,546 --> 00:15:43,426
At the previous year's Lantern Festival,

258
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:47,705
there were many lights at the market.

259
00:15:49,186 --> 00:15:50,825
Were we together
at the previous year's Lantern Festival?

260
00:15:57,945 --> 00:15:59,465
Keep going.

261
00:16:20,825 --> 00:16:21,666
Is he

262
00:16:21,786 --> 00:16:23,186
courting me

263
00:16:23,746 --> 00:16:25,186
or torturing me?

264
00:16:42,186 --> 00:16:42,986
Pei Yanzhen,

265
00:16:44,705 --> 00:16:46,346
it's getting late.

266
00:16:46,825 --> 00:16:48,585
And you've embroidered
the fragrant sachet.

267
00:16:49,265 --> 00:16:51,346
Why don't we call it a day?

268
00:16:51,746 --> 00:16:53,986
Miao, there's a part
when we get along.

269
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,065
There's more?

270
00:16:56,585 --> 00:16:57,226
Give me a second.

271
00:17:05,786 --> 00:17:06,306
Miao.

272
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:10,306
Pei Yanzhen,

273
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:12,225
what are you doing out there?

274
00:17:13,306 --> 00:17:14,666
In a show, a man often pledges his love

275
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:16,586
to the lady when they're forbidden
to meet up.

276
00:17:17,066 --> 00:17:19,025
A night tryst is not etiquette

277
00:17:19,345 --> 00:17:20,546
but it's quite fun.

278
00:17:21,345 --> 00:17:22,466
Look at you.

279
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:24,306
You're a weakling.

280
00:17:24,546 --> 00:17:25,706
Everyone knows this.

281
00:17:26,186 --> 00:17:28,225
If anything happens to you
at Shen's Residence,

282
00:17:28,345 --> 00:17:29,946
I'll have to pay the physician
to check on you.

283
00:17:30,225 --> 00:17:31,306
As you're broke now,

284
00:17:31,586 --> 00:17:33,186
you'll be spending my money.

285
00:17:35,586 --> 00:17:36,586
How reckless of me.

286
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:39,066
But I heard

287
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:41,826
that you met Master Song at this place.

288
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:44,345
I've gone over the wall many times.

289
00:17:44,946 --> 00:17:46,105
But I never met you.

290
00:17:46,505 --> 00:17:47,225
If that day...

291
00:17:50,186 --> 00:17:50,786
Forget it.

292
00:17:55,225 --> 00:17:56,345
I wonder

293
00:17:56,345 --> 00:17:58,306
who wrote such a silly play for him.

294
00:17:58,586 --> 00:17:59,786
If I found out who it was,

295
00:17:59,786 --> 00:18:00,745
I'd make him regret it.

296
00:18:03,306 --> 00:18:03,906
Wait for me.

297
00:18:27,225 --> 00:18:29,105
Song Xiyuan expedited this
from Qin's Residence.

298
00:18:29,306 --> 00:18:29,826
Take a look.

299
00:18:36,745 --> 00:18:37,906
What's wrong? What happened?

300
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:41,345
Qin Zuze gathers the soldiers

301
00:18:41,345 --> 00:18:42,025
to force His Majesty to abdicate.

302
00:18:46,906 --> 00:18:47,546
But...

303
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:49,786
But the Qin family has
a powerful army.

304
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:52,505
His Majesty is Her Highness's son.

305
00:18:52,505 --> 00:18:53,025
Her Highness...

306
00:18:53,306 --> 00:18:54,345
From what I know of Her Highness,

307
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:55,745
I'm afraid

308
00:18:56,546 --> 00:18:57,586
Qi Zuze is keeping it from her.

309
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:07,786
Pei Yanzhen.

310
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:10,745
Pei Yanzhen?

311
00:19:11,345 --> 00:19:12,025
It's not only this.

312
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:15,546
Insubordination will ruin
the reputation of the Qin family.

313
00:19:16,505 --> 00:19:17,826
I think they'll think

314
00:19:17,826 --> 00:19:19,745
of a way to justify their actions.

315
00:19:20,186 --> 00:19:21,345
Like eradicating the vile officials.

316
00:19:23,345 --> 00:19:24,025
You're saying...

317
00:19:25,906 --> 00:19:26,586
They'll poison His Majesty

318
00:19:27,586 --> 00:19:28,505
and make me and the Shen family

319
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:30,426
the scapegoats.

320
00:19:32,066 --> 00:19:33,265
If this really is their plan,

321
00:19:34,025 --> 00:19:34,906
you'll die.

322
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:36,345
Do you have a way to deal with it?

323
00:19:37,745 --> 00:19:39,066
If they're going to do this,

324
00:19:39,826 --> 00:19:41,186
we'll make a clean sweep.

325
00:19:42,105 --> 00:19:42,586
By the way,

326
00:19:42,946 --> 00:19:44,586
send a verbal message to Song Xiyuan.

327
00:19:45,025 --> 00:19:46,066
Ask him to find a way

328
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:48,105
to get the comprehensive plan out
of the Qin family

329
00:19:48,586 --> 00:19:50,066
and gather all of our men
in the capital

330
00:19:50,586 --> 00:19:51,745
to keep His Majesty alive.

331
00:19:54,105 --> 00:19:54,826
Given the situation,

332
00:19:55,826 --> 00:19:56,826
I'll go to the capital with you.

333
00:19:57,225 --> 00:19:59,225
So there's someone to help you
if anything happens.

334
00:19:59,826 --> 00:20:00,906
I have to stay in Lingzhou

335
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:02,225
to gather the men

for the emergency.

337
00:20:05,826 --> 00:20:07,306
This is for Shen Miao's sake, isn't it?

338
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:08,385
You stay here

339
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,306
just to keep her safe, don't you?

340
00:20:10,306 --> 00:20:11,025
So she won't be implicated.

341
00:20:11,865 --> 00:20:12,426
I'm toast.

342
00:20:13,186 --> 00:20:14,145
I forgot about Miao.

343
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:23,145
Say it.

344
00:20:23,145 --> 00:20:23,906
He's neither at Shen's Residence,

345
00:20:24,345 --> 00:20:24,985
nor at Pei's Residence.

346
00:20:24,985 --> 00:20:25,385
Nor at the brothel.

347
00:20:25,385 --> 00:20:26,265
What are you talking about?

348
00:20:27,745 --> 00:20:29,265
He's not at Qinchu Pavilion either.

349
00:20:30,865 --> 00:20:32,786
Where is Pei Yanzhen?

350
00:20:33,105 --> 00:20:34,025
Did he ascend and become immortal?

351
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:35,625
Go find him again.

352
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:36,466
Yes.

353
00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:38,505
Let's go.

354
00:20:41,466 --> 00:20:42,826
Indeed, a man can't be trusted.

355
00:20:43,306 --> 00:20:44,426
He said he wanted to marry me.

356
00:20:44,426 --> 00:20:45,426
Yet, he went missing
in a blink of an eye.

357
00:20:45,706 --> 00:20:46,505
Just like what he did back then.

If we can do business

ship the silk of Jiangnan out,

But our country's border has been
in tumult for so long.

407
00:24:28,186 --> 00:24:31,306
It's really hard to get
the right of doing business.

00:24:33,865 --> 00:24:35,505
An old friend of mine works
at the Ministry of Rites.

Maybe he can help us with this.

00:24:43,186 --> 00:24:44,985
If we can settle this,

411
00:24:45,225 --> 00:24:46,145
it'll fulfill the desire

In my opinion,

501
00:30:28,145 --> 00:30:30,025
His Majesty was trying to tell you

502
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:31,466
that the perpetrator

503
00:30:32,546 --> 00:30:33,546
was Pei Yanzhen.

504
00:30:38,225 --> 00:30:39,505
Pei Yanzhen?

505
00:31:14,265 --> 00:31:15,826
Has His Majesty not woken up yet?

506
00:31:17,385 --> 00:31:19,066
We've tried everything

507
00:31:20,586 --> 00:31:21,426
but it's useless.

508
00:31:25,345 --> 00:31:26,145
I think

509
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:28,345
Pei Yanzhen is the son

510
00:31:28,826 --> 00:31:30,906
of the late emperor and the maid.

511
00:31:32,345 --> 00:31:35,385
He's been serving His Majesty
and harboring ill intentions.

512
00:31:35,906 --> 00:31:37,906
He has placed his forces at the palace.

513
00:31:38,505 --> 00:31:40,906
Now, he's back to his hometown.
His effort is ultimately in vain.

514
00:31:41,586 --> 00:31:42,906
That's why he tries to kill His Majesty.

515
00:31:48,546 --> 00:31:51,265
Since he's the perpetrator,

516
00:31:51,906 --> 00:31:54,186
I'm sure he'll know how to detoxify it.

517
00:31:55,265 --> 00:31:56,306
Why don't we bring him here,

518
00:31:56,306 --> 00:31:58,186
lock him up and torture him

519
00:31:58,546 --> 00:31:59,826
to make him hand the antidote out?

520
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:02,666
Okay.

521
00:32:03,385 --> 00:32:05,025
Please issue an edict, Your Highness.

522
00:32:05,186 --> 00:32:07,385
To command Qin Army to guard the palace

523
00:32:08,145 --> 00:32:09,906
to prevent Pei Yanzhen from revolting.

524
00:32:12,586 --> 00:32:14,066
Pei Yanzhen must die.

525
00:32:14,786 --> 00:32:15,666
I must save my son.

526
00:32:16,385 --> 00:32:16,906
Brother,

527
00:32:17,345 --> 00:32:19,025
you must help me this time.

528
00:32:36,826 --> 00:32:38,105
I've brought Miao over to see you.

529
00:32:43,906 --> 00:32:44,786
There's no name on the tombstone.

530
00:32:45,865 --> 00:32:46,906
May I ask

531
00:32:47,385 --> 00:32:48,306
who was buried here?

532
00:32:54,385 --> 00:32:55,225
This was

533
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:56,625
an important Madam of mine.

534
00:32:57,586 --> 00:32:58,385
She liked to be quiet.

535
00:32:59,385 --> 00:33:00,906
She didn't want
to be constrained by fame.

536
00:33:01,706 --> 00:33:03,625
And she didn't like to be interrupted.

537
00:33:04,906 --> 00:33:05,586
So,

538
00:33:06,225 --> 00:33:07,505
she left a will

539
00:33:08,225 --> 00:33:09,345
and wished to have a nameless grave.

540
00:33:10,745 --> 00:33:12,225
After so many years,

541
00:33:13,345 --> 00:33:14,745
I've forgotten her look.

542
00:33:16,906 --> 00:33:17,826
Remembering her look

543
00:33:18,186 --> 00:33:20,145
is not the only form to think of her.

544
00:33:21,145 --> 00:33:23,505
My mother died over 10 years.

545
00:33:24,186 --> 00:33:25,786
I've also forgotten
what she looked like.

546
00:33:26,265 --> 00:33:28,066
But whenever I smell the fragrance
of osmanthus flowers,

547
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:31,625
it feels like she's still by my side.

548
00:33:38,586 --> 00:33:40,265
I was weak when I was a kid.

549
00:33:41,745 --> 00:33:42,865
One time I was severely ill,

550
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,586
she brought me to the temple and prayed.

551
00:33:48,225 --> 00:33:50,385
She was willing to trade
her life for mine.

552
00:33:52,385 --> 00:33:53,345
Even so,

553
00:33:54,906 --> 00:33:55,826
I still don't

554
00:33:55,906 --> 00:33:56,906
believe in deity.

555
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:05,186
That's why I don't believe
the lines in the play

556
00:34:06,066 --> 00:34:08,345
such as "Deity can prove my love

557
00:34:08,825 --> 00:34:09,585
for you".

558
00:34:11,545 --> 00:34:13,865
This Madam is the deepest secret

559
00:34:14,785 --> 00:34:16,145
in my heart.

560
00:34:18,706 --> 00:34:19,266
Miao,

561
00:34:22,385 --> 00:34:23,906
I'd like to prove my love for you

562
00:34:24,825 --> 00:34:26,065
in front of this Madam.

563
00:34:28,385 --> 00:34:30,666
I want to hold your hand
and grow old with you

564
00:34:32,186 --> 00:34:33,026
in this life.

565
00:34:34,746 --> 00:34:35,385
Would you like that?

566

♪The long river runs shallow,
separating the two's worlds♪

567
00:34:56,105 --> 00:34:57,226
I'm Shen Miao.

568
00:34:57,865 --> 00:34:59,385
I don't have the chance to meet you,

569
00:35:00,706 --> 00:35:03,226
but I know you cared about Pei Yanzhen

570
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,385
like I do.

571
00:35:06,026 --> 00:35:06,825
From now on,

572
00:35:07,666 --> 00:35:09,545
I'll take care of Pei Yanzhen
on your behalf

573
00:35:10,666 --> 00:35:13,186
for my whole life.
I'll never abandon him.

576
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:29,026
Come.

577
00:35:34,585 --> 00:35:35,065
Miao.

578
00:35:36,145 --> 00:35:36,746
Thank you.

579
00:35:44,906 --> 00:35:45,545
Miao,

580
00:35:46,305 --> 00:35:47,625
you seldom talk about your mother.

581
00:35:48,345 --> 00:35:50,065
I wonder what kind of a person she was.

582
00:35:52,266 --> 00:35:52,906
She...

583
00:35:56,065 --> 00:35:57,385
A year before she passed away,

584
00:35:58,026 --> 00:36:00,385
she liked to stay in the garden
all day to watch

585
00:36:01,385 --> 00:36:02,746
the osmanthus trees.

586
00:36:04,266 --> 00:36:04,906
Dad said

587
00:36:05,825 --> 00:36:07,026
my grandfather died too suddenly.

588
00:36:07,906 --> 00:36:09,746
My mother was depressed.

589
00:36:09,746 --> 00:36:10,746
He asked me to accompany her more.

590
00:36:12,026 --> 00:36:13,345
But I was too young back then.

591
00:36:13,746 --> 00:36:14,545
I couldn't sit still.

592
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,666
I always went out for fun

593
00:36:16,746 --> 00:36:18,186
all day long.

594
00:36:18,906 --> 00:36:20,385
It was dark when I got back.

595
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:22,345
She was still in the garden,
staring at the trees.

596
00:36:23,065 --> 00:36:25,385
I think something was fishy
about what happened to the Lu family.

597
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:28,506
I wonder if
your mother was aware of that.

598
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:34,666
My mother said

599
00:36:35,906 --> 00:36:37,065
an ignorant one

600
00:36:37,785 --> 00:36:38,906
could be happier.

601
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:43,545
She wished I could be safe, happy

602
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:44,906
and healthy in my life.

603
00:36:53,226 --> 00:36:55,065
She even left me this scrimshaw deer.

604
00:36:58,026 --> 00:36:59,105
She said with it around,

605
00:37:00,545 --> 00:37:02,266
she's always with me.

606
00:37:10,825 --> 00:37:11,385
Look.

607
00:37:12,906 --> 00:37:14,385
With this scrimshaw deer,

608
00:37:15,105 --> 00:37:16,065
whatever happens,

609
00:37:16,906 --> 00:37:18,906
they'll always stay by our sides.

610
00:37:20,825 --> 00:37:21,305
Miao,

611
00:37:22,305 --> 00:37:23,186
this is a precious thing.

612
00:37:24,226 --> 00:37:25,385
Are you going to give it to me?

613
00:37:28,785 --> 00:37:30,186
I've devoted myself to you.

614
00:37:30,385 --> 00:37:31,385
There's nothing I can't give you.

615
00:37:44,585 --> 00:37:45,785
They are two different matters.

616
00:37:46,585 --> 00:37:47,666
In order to get you out of the prison,

617
00:37:48,026 --> 00:37:49,906
I've spent a lot of taels on bribes,

618
00:37:50,266 --> 00:37:51,746
transportation and meals.

619
00:37:52,305 --> 00:37:53,145
How will you pay me back?

620
00:37:53,385 --> 00:37:54,385
You can pay in installments.

621
00:37:57,105 --> 00:37:58,825
I'm jobless now.

622
00:37:58,825 --> 00:37:59,506
I'm not well-paid.

623
00:38:00,385 --> 00:38:00,825
Miao,

624
00:38:01,385 --> 00:38:01,906
let's

625
00:38:02,545 --> 00:38:04,706
forget about the bride's dowry.

626
00:38:05,105 --> 00:38:05,906
It won't do.

627
00:38:05,906 --> 00:38:07,226
The bride's dowry is also my money.

628
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:12,186
Dad.

629
00:38:12,545 --> 00:38:13,105
Miao.

630
00:38:13,105 --> 00:38:13,545
Dad.

631
00:38:15,145 --> 00:38:15,585
Dad.

632
00:38:16,385 --> 00:38:17,666
I've got a good news to announce.

633
00:38:17,865 --> 00:38:20,226
So do I.

634
00:38:20,385 --> 00:38:21,145
-I'll go first.
-I'll go first.

635
00:38:22,746 --> 00:38:23,746
-I'll go first.
-I'll go first.

636
00:38:25,385 --> 00:38:27,026
We have to thank Pei Yanzhen for this.

637
00:38:27,145 --> 00:38:28,906
There are always wars at the borderland.

638
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:30,385
The products
in the Western Regions are invaluable.

639
00:38:30,385 --> 00:38:31,785
But it's hard to bring them in.

640
00:38:31,785 --> 00:38:33,145
So I requested it the other day.

641
00:38:33,385 --> 00:38:34,906
Unexpectedly,
the royal court consented

642
00:38:34,906 --> 00:38:36,785
to let us do business
in the Western Regions.

643
00:38:37,545 --> 00:38:38,706
I spoke fast so I went first.

644
00:38:38,865 --> 00:38:39,625
Doesn't it mean

645
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:41,145
we can set foot
in the silk and horse trade?

646
00:38:41,746 --> 00:38:42,666
It can bring us huge profits.

647
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:43,906
Who are you sending?

648
00:38:46,385 --> 00:38:47,666
This is an important matter.

649
00:38:48,266 --> 00:38:50,545
I decide to go there by myself.
I'll be back soon.

650
00:38:51,545 --> 00:38:52,305
Well, it's your turn.

651
00:38:52,305 --> 00:38:54,145
What good news have you got?

652
00:38:57,105 --> 00:38:58,345
I'll tell you when you're back.

653
00:38:59,065 --> 00:39:00,186
I'll go ask Aunt

654
00:39:00,186 --> 00:39:01,186
to pack your luggage.

655
00:39:04,865 --> 00:39:05,825
Miss is

656
00:39:06,065 --> 00:39:07,385
acting a little weird today.

657
00:39:09,825 --> 00:39:12,186
You don't say!

658
00:39:14,545 --> 00:39:15,065
Yanzhen,

659
00:39:15,065 --> 00:39:16,105
come with me.

660
00:39:18,906 --> 00:39:20,186
Come.

661
00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:27,105
Let me show you something.

662
00:39:41,266 --> 00:39:42,105
This is

663
00:39:42,946 --> 00:39:45,385
the official seal of the leader
of the Shen family.

664
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:49,666
This official seal represents me.

665
00:39:50,385 --> 00:39:50,946
Father-in-law, you're...

666
00:39:50,946 --> 00:39:52,946
Without an explanation,
I've already guessed it.

667
00:39:53,946 --> 00:39:57,065
Your wedding is approaching.

668
00:40:00,226 --> 00:40:01,506
My late wife died early.

669
00:40:02,746 --> 00:40:03,706
I've promised her

670
00:40:04,266 --> 00:40:05,746
to take good care of Miao.

671
00:40:06,746 --> 00:40:07,946
In the past 20-odd years,

672
00:40:09,226 --> 00:40:12,186
I've valued her more than my life,

673
00:40:12,865 --> 00:40:15,226
more than all treasures in the world.

674
00:40:16,145 --> 00:40:18,906
Your previous wedding was a farce.

675
00:40:18,906 --> 00:40:20,026
Let's forget about it.

676
00:40:21,345 --> 00:40:23,385
From now on,

677
00:40:24,266 --> 00:40:26,585
if you dare hurt her feelings again,

678
00:40:27,186 --> 00:40:27,385
I'll be sure to...

679
00:40:27,385 --> 00:40:28,305
Don't worry, Father-in-law.

680
00:40:29,506 --> 00:40:31,625
I'll never fail Miao.

681
00:40:35,226 --> 00:40:36,305
Great, then.

682
00:40:37,585 --> 00:40:38,625
You brat.

683
00:40:39,746 --> 00:40:41,065
I have faith in you

684
00:40:41,666 --> 00:40:42,906
as Miao trusts you.

685
00:40:44,186 --> 00:40:44,946
When I'm gone,

686
00:40:45,865 --> 00:40:47,385
I'll entrust the Shen family

687
00:40:48,385 --> 00:40:49,906
and Miao to you.

688
00:40:53,706 --> 00:40:54,186
Noted.

689
00:40:58,426 --> 00:40:59,105
Also,

690
00:41:00,186 --> 00:41:01,186
I heard

691
00:41:01,666 --> 00:41:04,145
that you've been sleeping
in Miao's room lately.

692
00:41:04,426 --> 00:41:05,186
Father-in-law, actually, we...

693
00:41:05,186 --> 00:41:06,145
You don't need to explain.

694
00:41:06,385 --> 00:41:07,666
I understand.

695
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:11,946
Control yourself.

696
00:41:18,825 --> 00:41:20,666
The wind is strong
and the night is cold in the desert.

697
00:41:20,906 --> 00:41:21,946
The trip will be strenuous.

698
00:41:22,226 --> 00:41:23,785
You must take care of yourself.

699
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,305
All of us will be here
waiting for your return.

700
00:41:26,906 --> 00:41:27,385
Okay.

701
00:41:29,266 --> 00:41:30,666
Thank you.

702
00:41:31,186 --> 00:41:33,226
But it's summertime in Lingzhou.

703
00:41:33,466 --> 00:41:35,865
Can you not make me wear this thing?

704
00:41:36,545 --> 00:41:37,785
I stayed up all night to make this.

705
00:41:37,785 --> 00:41:38,706
Don't be ungrateful.

706
00:41:42,305 --> 00:41:43,426
Yes, noted.

707
00:41:44,026 --> 00:41:46,746
Look, it's cold that I sweat.

708
00:41:47,986 --> 00:41:50,466
Thank you, Dear.

709
00:41:51,105 --> 00:41:52,226
Just let Dad go now.

710
00:41:52,226 --> 00:41:53,706
The trip will be delayed
if he doesn't depart now.

711
00:41:53,865 --> 00:41:55,825
He might not have a place
to stay tonight.

712
00:41:56,825 --> 00:41:57,545
Miao,

713
00:41:59,385 --> 00:42:02,226
the road is covered
with our family business.

714
00:42:02,466 --> 00:42:03,666
If anything happens,

715
00:42:03,666 --> 00:42:05,345
ask someone to send me a letter.

716
00:42:05,706 --> 00:42:06,305
Also,

717
00:42:07,186 --> 00:42:08,746
keep an eye on Zai's homework.

718
00:42:13,186 --> 00:42:14,065
Pei Yanzhen,

719
00:42:14,946 --> 00:42:16,105
take good care of them.

720
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:17,105
Yes.

721
00:42:19,506 --> 00:42:20,026
Also,

722
00:42:21,865 --> 00:42:22,625
control yourself.

723
00:42:24,026 --> 00:42:25,585
Just go, Dad.

724
00:42:27,466 --> 00:42:29,466
Okay, I'll get going.

725
00:42:30,105 --> 00:42:30,545
Old Master.

726
00:42:30,545 --> 00:42:31,105
Be careful.

727
00:42:31,105 --> 00:42:31,666
Slow down.

728
00:42:33,825 --> 00:42:34,906
Take care of yourself.
