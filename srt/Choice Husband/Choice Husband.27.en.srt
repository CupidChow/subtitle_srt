Mine and yours

00:01:41,812 --> 00:01:42,651
come in a pair.

22
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,091
Why would you want to give me this?

23
00:01:47,532 --> 00:01:48,331
Today morning,

24
00:01:48,892 --> 00:01:50,291
you suffered from carsickness.

25
00:01:50,932 --> 00:01:53,452
You must've stayed indoor
for a long time.

26
00:01:53,932 --> 00:01:55,411
That's why you can't withstand
the carriage bumps.

27
00:01:55,932 --> 00:01:57,011
I'm worried you're not used to it.

28
00:01:57,452 --> 00:01:58,172
So...

29
00:01:59,091 --> 00:02:00,252
So I bought it.

30
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:03,572
This place is quite far
from the nearest town.

31
00:02:04,331 --> 00:02:06,291
Besides, the pillow is made
with exquisite workmanship

32
00:02:06,572 --> 00:02:07,331
and fine materials.

33
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:08,971
It must be expensive.

34
00:02:09,891 --> 00:02:10,411
No.

35
00:02:10,852 --> 00:02:12,132
It's not that expensive.

36
00:02:13,372 --> 00:02:14,051
From now on,

37
00:02:15,092 --> 00:02:16,331
if you want,

38
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:17,691
you can have

39
00:02:18,732 --> 00:02:19,411
all my money.

40
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:21,932
What are you talking about?

41
00:02:22,451 --> 00:02:23,852
I didn't say I want to marry you.

42
00:02:37,852 --> 00:02:38,732
Miss.

43
00:02:40,652 --> 00:02:41,572
I'll sleep here tonight.

44
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:43,292
I won't interrupt you.

45
00:02:51,132 --> 00:02:52,492
Just go.

46
00:02:55,932 --> 00:02:56,732
Get some rest.

47
00:02:59,572 --> 00:03:00,732
Be careful.

48
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,980
(Ninth Princess, Shen Miao,
Shen Xiao, Pei Yanzhen, Song Xiyuan)

49
00:03:12,652 --> 00:03:13,372
Tell me.

50
00:03:13,772 --> 00:03:14,451
What's your thought on it?

51
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:43,572
In my opinion,

52
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:45,051
it's a stupid trick.

53
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:47,611
Pretending to be blind can only elicit
sympathy for that moment.

54
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:49,611
It can't win Shen Miao over.

55
00:03:51,572 --> 00:03:52,772
I beg to differ.

56
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:53,971
I think the relationship

57
00:03:54,212 --> 00:03:55,531
between His Highness and Miss Shen is

58
00:03:55,531 --> 00:03:57,811
moving in the right direction
along the way.

59
00:03:59,132 --> 00:04:01,531
Does your comment have
any reference significance?

60
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:02,451
So far,

61
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,012
Lvying is closer to Tie Niu.

62
00:04:04,492 --> 00:04:05,852
You still want Pei Yanzhen

63
00:04:06,531 --> 00:04:09,251
who's no better than you
to emulate your actions?

64
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:09,732
Your Highness.

65
00:04:10,932 --> 00:04:12,732
What do you suggest then,
Martial Brother Zhan?

66
00:04:13,251 --> 00:04:14,891
So I'm your Martial Brother now?

67
00:04:15,531 --> 00:04:17,092
Didn't you enjoy it a lot
when you deducted

68
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,171
my wages back then?

69
00:04:19,171 --> 00:04:19,611
Well...

70
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:25,331
Didn't you want me to ask His Majesty

71
00:04:25,412 --> 00:04:26,532
to grant your marriage
with Ninth Princess?

72
00:04:28,812 --> 00:04:30,891
Please don't hesitate
to enlighten me.

73
00:04:34,851 --> 00:04:35,412
The best tactic is

74
00:04:35,652 --> 00:04:36,492
to know what she cares about.

75
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,252
Let me ask you.

76
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:40,891
What is Shen Miao most concerned
about now?

77
00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:42,291
I know.

78
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:43,611
It's Song Xiyuan.

79
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:45,772
Wrong.

80
00:04:48,492 --> 00:04:49,372
It's Shen Xiao.

81
00:04:50,932 --> 00:04:51,611
Go on.

82
00:04:51,812 --> 00:04:53,372
Compared to Song Xiyuan,

83
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:54,611
Your Highness's biggest advantage is

84
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:56,051
that you're Xiao's biological father.

85
00:04:56,372 --> 00:04:57,692
As long as you win Xiao over,

86
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,692
even if Shen Miao doesn't like you,

87
00:04:59,692 --> 00:05:01,372
she'll still have to stay by your side.

88
00:05:02,492 --> 00:05:03,252
When you enter the capital

89
00:05:03,252 --> 00:05:04,451
and Regent's Residence,

90
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:06,051
you can do whatever you want.

91
00:05:06,331 --> 00:05:07,731
Everything will be under your control.

92
00:05:12,252 --> 00:05:12,891
Martial Brother Zhan,

93
00:05:13,851 --> 00:05:15,011
it's only been a few days.

94
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,212
You've improved a lot.

95
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:20,372
Your Highness,

96
00:05:20,932 --> 00:05:23,692
the biggest problem now is to make

97
00:05:23,692 --> 00:05:25,492
Miss Shen move into the residence.

98
00:05:26,372 --> 00:05:27,171
Over time,

99
00:05:27,372 --> 00:05:28,451
I'm sure I can convince Miao.

100
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:30,372
Yes, Your Highness.

101
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,051
However,

102
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:34,252
we'll arrive in the capital soon.

103
00:05:38,611 --> 00:05:39,212
Zhao,

104
00:05:40,011 --> 00:05:40,851
I've got a plan

105
00:05:41,652 --> 00:05:43,131
but I'll need your cooperation.

106
00:05:49,412 --> 00:05:51,092
Sure, will do.

107
00:05:51,772 --> 00:05:52,972
I'll fully cooperate with you.

108
00:05:56,812 --> 00:05:57,412
No problem.

109
00:06:01,412 --> 00:06:03,532
Let me tighten your belt.

110
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,492
Okay.

111
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,532
Tie Niu, where's my horse?

112
00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:09,772
You're still acting?

113
00:06:21,532 --> 00:06:22,011
Miaomiao.

114
00:06:22,812 --> 00:06:23,291
Good morning.

115
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:24,131
- Good morning.
- Third Master.

116
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:26,051
Third Master.

117
00:06:27,812 --> 00:06:28,571
Miao, you're here too.

118
00:06:29,092 --> 00:06:29,611
Third Master,

119
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:32,252
I wonder
if you can give me a ride today.

120
00:06:34,051 --> 00:06:34,412
Why?

121
00:06:34,891 --> 00:06:36,772
Constable Zhao accidentally let go
of the horse.

122
00:06:37,571 --> 00:06:38,412
We're not able to continue
the journey.

123
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:39,731
I'm afraid it will be delayed.

124
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:42,812
May I ask what it's got

125
00:06:43,772 --> 00:06:44,611
to do with me?

126
00:06:49,252 --> 00:06:49,812
Right.

127
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:52,652
I'll just walk back to the capital.

128
00:06:53,131 --> 00:06:53,812
Go.

129
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:54,252
Fine.

130
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:56,451
I think Constable Zhao and Zhan Yue

131
00:06:56,451 --> 00:06:57,972
have been unfocused lately.

132
00:06:58,412 --> 00:06:59,571
We'll arrive in the capital soon.

133
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,171
Let's travel together.

134
00:07:02,772 --> 00:07:03,972
Thank you, Third Master.

135
00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:05,692
Miao,

136
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:06,851
you guys continue.

137
00:07:07,611 --> 00:07:08,611
I'll go inform them.

138
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,011
Pei Yanzhen,

139
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:18,692
I haven't said yes.

140
00:07:19,692 --> 00:07:20,131
Miaomiao,

141
00:07:20,252 --> 00:07:21,331
you stay here.

142
00:07:21,331 --> 00:07:22,812
I'll go check if he's telling the truth.

143
00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:43,772
Here.

144
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:45,891
Miao,

145
00:07:45,972 --> 00:07:46,532
try this.

146
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:49,451
Miaomiao.

147
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:50,372
Eat this.

148
00:07:50,372 --> 00:07:51,092
This is delicious.

149
00:07:53,851 --> 00:07:55,372
Try this, Miao.

150
00:07:55,372 --> 00:07:56,652
Eat this, Miaomiao.

151
00:07:58,051 --> 00:07:59,212
Try this, Miao.

152
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,932
This seems nice.

153
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:02,171
Miao,

154
00:08:02,171 --> 00:08:02,731
try this.

155
00:08:02,731 --> 00:08:04,051
Eat more vegetables.

156
00:08:04,611 --> 00:08:05,331
Try the bun.

157
00:08:21,212 --> 00:08:22,532
Are you done?

158
00:08:22,692 --> 00:08:23,652
I swear,

159
00:08:23,652 --> 00:08:25,051
he started it.

160
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:31,171
Third Master Song said
it's my fault,

161
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:33,371
then be it.

162
00:08:34,331 --> 00:08:35,811
Third Master Song said
it's my fault,

163
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:36,412
then be...

164
00:08:36,412 --> 00:08:37,532
Go on. I'm not going to eat.

165
00:08:37,532 --> 00:08:38,292
- We'll stop.
- Miao.

166
00:08:38,772 --> 00:08:40,172
No fights. Let's sit down and eat.

167
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:08,532
Stop.

168
00:09:09,212 --> 00:09:09,571
Stop.

169
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:16,292
Stop.

170
00:09:24,371 --> 00:09:24,972
Tie Niu,

171
00:09:25,571 --> 00:09:26,732
we should go to the right.

172
00:09:29,092 --> 00:09:29,891
No.

173
00:09:30,412 --> 00:09:31,371
This map shows

174
00:09:31,491 --> 00:09:33,011
we're supposed
to take the path to the north.

175
00:09:33,011 --> 00:09:33,491
Look.

176
00:09:33,772 --> 00:09:35,011
Isn't this the north?

177
00:09:35,331 --> 00:09:35,891
I think you've been

178
00:09:35,891 --> 00:09:37,371
living a good life these days
that you've lost

179
00:09:37,371 --> 00:09:38,371
your sense of direction.

180
00:09:38,891 --> 00:09:39,891
Just follow my lead.

181
00:09:39,891 --> 00:09:40,412
It won't go wrong.

182
00:09:40,412 --> 00:09:41,331
Let's go.

183
00:09:41,891 --> 00:09:42,772
Come on.

184
00:09:44,612 --> 00:09:45,251
The north?

185
00:09:46,092 --> 00:09:47,011
Hurry up, Silly Niu.

186
00:09:47,011 --> 00:09:47,652
Chop, chop.

187
00:09:51,251 --> 00:09:52,011
To the north.

188
00:09:52,371 --> 00:09:52,852
Keep up.

189
00:09:58,852 --> 00:09:59,852
We're toast.

190
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:01,371
We can't cross the river.

191
00:10:01,772 --> 00:10:02,092
Let's go.

192
00:10:02,092 --> 00:10:02,532
Turn around.

193
00:10:02,532 --> 00:10:03,451
Take a detour and go back.

194
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:03,732
Let's go.

195
00:10:03,732 --> 00:10:04,571
No, wait.

196
00:10:05,652 --> 00:10:07,092
If we circle back to that junction,

197
00:10:07,571 --> 00:10:09,092
it'll be about four hours away.

198
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:09,891
It's too far away.

199
00:10:09,891 --> 00:10:10,772
What do you want to do, then?

200
00:10:10,891 --> 00:10:11,772
Swim across it?

201
00:10:12,532 --> 00:10:14,451
Are you out of your mind?

202
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:17,371
What is the sound?

203
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:20,891
Official Zhao,

204
00:10:21,972 --> 00:10:22,772
you led us here.

205
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:24,331
How can you blame this on me?

206
00:10:24,571 --> 00:10:26,212
Haven't you been holding
the map all along?

207
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:27,371
Are you a fool?

208
00:10:27,371 --> 00:10:28,652
Why did you follow me
if I was going the wrong way?

209
00:10:28,652 --> 00:10:29,371
You...

210
00:10:29,732 --> 00:10:31,131
Your master must be
very mad now.

211
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,131
You simple-minded man.

212
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:32,972
- A fool.
- You...

213
00:10:32,972 --> 00:10:34,011
We're fine, Lvying.

214
00:10:35,131 --> 00:10:35,772
Lvying,

215
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:37,251
look how pretty the stone is.

216
00:10:37,251 --> 00:10:38,732
Come here, Tie Niu.

217
00:10:40,212 --> 00:10:40,891
Silly Niu.

218
00:10:41,251 --> 00:10:43,011
Look, Lvying. The stone is very pretty.

219
00:10:44,052 --> 00:10:44,532
Miaomiao,

220
00:10:45,891 --> 00:10:46,891
eat some almonds.

221
00:10:47,331 --> 00:10:48,371
Almond is cold in nature.

222
00:10:48,571 --> 00:10:49,371
She can't eat much of it.

223
00:10:54,212 --> 00:10:54,931
I have some sunflower seeds.

224
00:10:55,131 --> 00:10:55,732
Eat some.

225
00:10:55,732 --> 00:10:56,652
They are heated.

226
00:11:00,172 --> 00:11:01,732
My inner heat rises when I see you.

227
00:11:01,732 --> 00:11:02,412
Stop.

228
00:11:03,172 --> 00:11:03,891
There you go again.

229
00:11:04,491 --> 00:11:05,652
I'll go sit with Xiao
if you keep doing this.

230
00:11:05,652 --> 00:11:06,251
No.

231
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:19,251
Where's...

232
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:21,891
Where's my cane?

233
00:11:25,972 --> 00:11:28,292
Why is the lunchbox over here?

234
00:11:34,691 --> 00:11:37,131
Don't you think it's crowded?

235
00:11:37,691 --> 00:11:38,331
I think

236
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:39,532
it's better like this.

237
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:43,732
Shameless.

238
00:11:46,011 --> 00:11:46,491
You...

239
00:11:46,491 --> 00:11:48,052
Miss, we've arrived in Fuyang.

240
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:49,891
Fuyang?

241
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,131
Why are we in Fuyang?

242
00:11:52,571 --> 00:11:54,251
Isn't that further away
from the capital?

243
00:11:56,331 --> 00:11:57,371
Master Song didn't trust me.

244
00:11:57,371 --> 00:11:58,491
He insisted on letting
Tie Niu lead the way.

245
00:11:59,612 --> 00:12:00,612
Tie Niu didn't know the way

246
00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:01,931
so he made a mistake.

247
00:12:02,852 --> 00:12:03,612
It was an accident.

248
00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:04,852
He didn't mean to.

249
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:06,212
What are you talking about?

250
00:12:07,092 --> 00:12:08,052
It's my bad

251
00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:11,331
that I couldn't convince Official Song.

252
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:25,811
Sir,

253
00:12:26,052 --> 00:12:27,131
prepare some dishes for us.

254
00:12:30,131 --> 00:12:31,011
Zhan Yue.

255
00:12:31,811 --> 00:12:32,612
Your Highness,

256
00:12:32,811 --> 00:12:33,532
why are you here?

257
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:37,052
I'm the princess.

258
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:39,172
No one can hide
their whereabouts from me.

259
00:12:39,891 --> 00:12:41,251
You can't escape from me.

260
00:12:43,891 --> 00:12:44,571
Zhan,

261
00:12:44,811 --> 00:12:45,652
what's with the reaction?

262
00:12:45,972 --> 00:12:46,811
What is this about?

263
00:12:47,412 --> 00:12:48,772
What do you mean?

264
00:12:48,972 --> 00:12:50,172
That's because of Pei Yanzhen.

265
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:52,092
Fine.

266
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,292
As such,

267
00:12:53,972 --> 00:12:54,412
well,

268
00:12:54,412 --> 00:12:56,052
why didn't you reply
to the letters I wrote to you?

269
00:12:57,491 --> 00:12:58,131
What letters?

270
00:12:58,571 --> 00:12:59,852
I... I didn't know there were letters.

271
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:02,251
It's impossible.

272
00:13:02,652 --> 00:13:03,691
I clearly asked in the letter

273
00:13:03,691 --> 00:13:04,532
that if you're also...

274
00:13:04,532 --> 00:13:05,251
Your Highness,

275
00:13:05,691 --> 00:13:06,371
I'm in a hurry.

276
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:06,972
I've got to go.

277
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:09,532
Zhan Yue! Zhan Yue!

278
00:13:20,852 --> 00:13:21,491
Let's go, Xiao.

279
00:13:22,251 --> 00:13:22,852
Xiao,

280
00:13:23,331 --> 00:13:24,371
did you get a good rest?

281
00:13:25,691 --> 00:13:26,251
Let's go.

282
00:13:28,732 --> 00:13:30,772
Zhan Yue! Zhan Yue!

283
00:13:35,092 --> 00:13:36,571
Shen Miao?

284
00:13:37,852 --> 00:13:38,412
You...

285
00:13:39,532 --> 00:13:40,811
You came back to life again.

286
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:45,811
Master.

287
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:48,852
Master,

288
00:13:49,491 --> 00:13:50,491
don't get mad.

289
00:13:50,891 --> 00:13:51,852
You can't blame this on me.

290
00:13:52,212 --> 00:13:53,931
It was Zhao who led the wrong way.

291
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:56,212
You got the map.

292
00:13:56,451 --> 00:13:58,052
Why did you listen to him?

293
00:13:58,612 --> 00:13:59,931
Was he the one who paid your wages?

294
00:14:00,612 --> 00:14:02,092
You're so simple-minded.

295
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:03,412
I can tell why Lvying doesn't like you.

296
00:14:03,732 --> 00:14:05,131
Who told you that?

297
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:08,412
You can't take it out on me
after getting knocked back

298
00:14:08,732 --> 00:14:10,131
by Miss Shen.

299
00:14:10,612 --> 00:14:11,212
Besides,

300
00:14:11,691 --> 00:14:12,412
it was two days ago.

301
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:13,532
Two days ago,

302
00:14:13,532 --> 00:14:15,571
Lvying bought me a candied fruit.

303
00:14:15,931 --> 00:14:16,451
Moreover,

304
00:14:16,652 --> 00:14:17,412
she happily

305
00:14:17,412 --> 00:14:19,092
accepted the pillow I gave her.

306
00:14:19,972 --> 00:14:20,532
It was a while ago.

307
00:14:21,052 --> 00:14:21,732
She asked me

308
00:14:21,732 --> 00:14:22,891
to go and buy pastries

309
00:14:23,251 --> 00:14:25,172
with her after having
everything cleaned up.

310
00:14:28,571 --> 00:14:29,612
Just do your job.

311
00:14:32,811 --> 00:14:34,251
It ticks me off.

312
00:14:34,251 --> 00:14:35,331
Geez.

313
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,212
How dare you steal my woman!

314
00:14:53,131 --> 00:14:54,011
Since you're fine,

315
00:14:54,011 --> 00:14:55,331
why didn't you write me back?

316
00:14:56,131 --> 00:14:57,652
I've cried for months
because of you.

317
00:14:58,931 --> 00:14:59,451
Shen Miao,

318
00:14:59,852 --> 00:15:01,811
it's great to see you alive.

319
00:15:03,811 --> 00:15:05,092
I lost my memory back then.

320
00:15:05,331 --> 00:15:06,131
I've just recovered recently.

321
00:15:06,691 --> 00:15:08,811
So I'm going to the capital for you.

322
00:15:08,811 --> 00:15:09,532
You're heartless.

323
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:12,891
All of you went to Weiyang to have fun.

324
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:15,052
I was the only one
who was left behind.

325
00:15:16,412 --> 00:15:18,212
You're mad
because of Zhan Yue, aren't you?

326
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,451
How could you take it out on me?

327
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:21,412
You have no idea.

328
00:15:22,092 --> 00:15:23,691
Obviously, he likes me.

329
00:15:24,172 --> 00:15:26,412
I've been testing him
for the past two years.

330
00:15:26,852 --> 00:15:29,852
But he just can't get it
and keeps giving me the cold shoulder.

331
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:31,931
He left the capital

332
00:15:32,251 --> 00:15:33,331
without saying goodbye to me.

333
00:15:33,811 --> 00:15:36,571
I can't believe he treats me
like this today.

334
00:15:39,011 --> 00:15:40,212
I couldn't fight him.

335
00:15:41,131 --> 00:15:41,491
Or else,

336
00:15:42,052 --> 00:15:43,612
I'd make him feel my wrath.

337
00:15:45,131 --> 00:15:46,532
Great things take time.

338
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,451
Someone tends

339
00:15:48,772 --> 00:15:50,811
to take a longer time
to understand love.

340
00:15:51,131 --> 00:15:52,092
When he arrives in the capital,

341
00:15:52,092 --> 00:15:53,612
there'll be chances
for you to get along with him.

342
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,652
But you're the princess of this country.

343
00:15:57,931 --> 00:15:59,052
As you came here alone,

344
00:15:59,532 --> 00:16:01,052
what if you encounter danger?

345
00:16:01,931 --> 00:16:03,652
I didn't know there were

346
00:16:03,931 --> 00:16:05,251
so many cities outside the capital.

347
00:16:07,371 --> 00:16:09,251
I went in the wrong direction
not long after I came out.

348
00:16:10,412 --> 00:16:11,011
But,

349
00:16:11,251 --> 00:16:12,571
fortunately, you went
the wrong way.

350
00:16:13,212 --> 00:16:16,652
Otherwise, I'm afraid
we would never meet again.

351
00:16:17,451 --> 00:16:20,052
Obviously, we're blessed.

352
00:16:21,532 --> 00:16:22,931
We'll meet each other for sure.

353
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:29,451
What's going on in the capital?

354
00:16:29,931 --> 00:16:31,612
You even specifically came for Zhan Yue.

355
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:32,891
Shen Miao,

356
00:16:35,331 --> 00:16:38,172
only you can save me this time.

357
00:16:47,532 --> 00:16:48,131
It's me.

358
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:54,092
Can you act more like a blind man?

359
00:16:58,412 --> 00:16:59,331
Why are you staring at me like this?

360
00:17:00,172 --> 00:17:01,212
Do you think you're handsome?

361
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:03,491
Which one of my eyes stares at you?

362
00:17:04,851 --> 00:17:06,091
Can you stop laughing?

363
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:07,532
It terrifies me.

364
00:17:09,412 --> 00:17:09,932
Here.

365
00:17:10,971 --> 00:17:12,611
Have a sip of tea
to soothe your throat.

366
00:17:14,131 --> 00:17:15,011
Tell me

367
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:17,412
what's going on
between you and Ninth Princess.

368
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,131
I wondered why you were
more well-informed than me

369
00:17:20,131 --> 00:17:21,332
when you were in Weiyang City.

370
00:17:22,091 --> 00:17:24,292
It turns out someone
has been communicating with you.

371
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:25,412
Mind your words.

372
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:27,532
I only received her letters.

373
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:29,131
I didn't write her back.

374
00:17:29,611 --> 00:17:30,332
You don't like her?

375
00:17:33,131 --> 00:17:33,611
I...

376
00:17:35,491 --> 00:17:36,812
I'm a macho man,

377
00:17:36,812 --> 00:17:38,251
who leads a wandering life.

378
00:17:38,251 --> 00:17:39,652
There's no such thing as love.

379
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:40,731
So,

380
00:17:41,052 --> 00:17:42,011
you do like her.

381
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:44,052
Just spend your free time

382
00:17:44,052 --> 00:17:45,572
worrying about Shen Miao.

383
00:17:45,891 --> 00:17:46,772
Don't be a busybody.

384
00:17:48,971 --> 00:17:49,772
It's unexpected.

385
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,251
I thought Official Zhan was

386
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,251
an expert

387
00:17:54,652 --> 00:17:56,211
that wouldn't be attracted by women.

388
00:17:56,772 --> 00:17:58,131
I can't believe you'd end up
in such a situation.

389
00:17:58,652 --> 00:17:59,211
It's absurd.

390
00:17:59,652 --> 00:18:00,332
It's absurd.

391
00:18:05,731 --> 00:18:06,572
Let me tell you this.

392
00:18:07,131 --> 00:18:08,532
I can't see things now.

393
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:11,572
Bullying the weaklings will be
evicted from the academy.

394
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,491
Swindle is

395
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:16,371
an aggravation.

396
00:18:36,812 --> 00:18:37,611
Allied marriage?

397
00:18:38,532 --> 00:18:39,091
Yes.

398
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:40,731
I wonder where that uncivilized region

399
00:18:40,731 --> 00:18:41,851
gets the nerve

400
00:18:42,091 --> 00:18:43,052
to ask to marry me.

401
00:18:43,572 --> 00:18:43,971
I...

402
00:18:45,452 --> 00:18:46,412
I'm not going.

403
00:18:48,332 --> 00:18:49,052
Calm down.

404
00:18:49,971 --> 00:18:51,611
His Majesty has always been kind.

405
00:18:51,891 --> 00:18:53,131
And you're his only sister.

406
00:18:53,491 --> 00:18:54,971
He won't let you go no matter what.

407
00:18:56,491 --> 00:18:57,172
You don't know this.

408
00:18:59,052 --> 00:19:00,332
No one would listen

409
00:19:01,971 --> 00:19:03,491
to my brother's command
in the court now.

410
00:19:05,652 --> 00:19:08,211
Pei Yanzhen is a heartless

411
00:19:08,572 --> 00:19:09,491
and brutal person.

412
00:19:10,891 --> 00:19:11,812
Unless he agrees to it.

413
00:19:12,572 --> 00:19:13,131
Otherwise,

414
00:19:14,572 --> 00:19:15,172
my marriage is a sure thing.

415
00:19:19,412 --> 00:19:20,211
Let me ask you this.

416
00:19:21,091 --> 00:19:22,572
Do you really like Zhan Yue?

417
00:19:23,091 --> 00:19:24,332
Or you just don't want
an allied marriage?

418
00:19:26,652 --> 00:19:28,211
I truly like Zhan Yue.

419
00:19:28,692 --> 00:19:29,572
Meanwhile,

420
00:19:30,371 --> 00:19:31,491
I don't want an allied marriage.

421
00:19:31,851 --> 00:19:33,692
Well, does Zhan Yue know about this?

422
00:19:37,371 --> 00:19:38,971
I don't want him to know this.

423
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:42,412
I'm worried he'd agree

424
00:19:42,412 --> 00:19:43,731
to marry me

425
00:19:45,052 --> 00:19:46,052
out of righteousness

426
00:19:46,371 --> 00:19:47,412
to help me avoid
the allied marriage.

427
00:19:50,292 --> 00:19:51,091
If so,

428
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,812
I'd feel reluctant after marrying him.

429
00:19:57,412 --> 00:19:58,052
Shen Miao,

430
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:01,292
I just want him
to sincerely ask for my hand.

431
00:20:02,812 --> 00:20:03,891
It's easy.

432
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:05,932
In my opinion,

433
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,731
Zhan Yue does have feelings for you.

434
00:20:09,891 --> 00:20:11,572
And he's Pei Yanzhen's martial brother.

435
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,332
If Pei Yanzhen knows
that you two are in love,

436
00:20:14,652 --> 00:20:15,932
I'm sure he'll stop
the allied marriage.

437
00:20:17,812 --> 00:20:18,611
Are you for real?

438
00:20:20,211 --> 00:20:20,731
Shen Miao,

439
00:20:21,211 --> 00:20:22,412
you must help me.

440
00:20:27,731 --> 00:20:29,211
(Taoju Inn)
Let's wait for Tie Niu.

441
00:20:29,211 --> 00:20:29,731
(Taoju Inn)

442
00:20:29,731 --> 00:20:30,251
(Taoju Inn)
Sure.

443
00:20:30,251 --> 00:20:31,971
(Taoju Inn)

444
00:20:31,971 --> 00:20:32,572
Sir.

445
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,572
Miss Lvying,

446
00:20:36,091 --> 00:20:36,851
are you waiting for Tie Niu

447
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,491
to buy pastries with you?

448
00:20:40,091 --> 00:20:40,731
How did you know this?

449
00:20:41,131 --> 00:20:42,292
Of course I know it.

450
00:20:42,891 --> 00:20:44,851
It was him who asked me
to convey this to you.

451
00:20:44,851 --> 00:20:46,211
He said Third Master Song gave him
a command.

452
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:47,172
That he can't come.

453
00:20:47,971 --> 00:20:48,692
Is that true?

454
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:49,692
Yes, it is.

455
00:20:50,091 --> 00:20:50,692
Otherwise,

456
00:20:50,692 --> 00:20:52,452
why would he tell me
such an important thing?

457
00:20:55,851 --> 00:20:56,452
Do you

458
00:20:56,731 --> 00:20:58,091
want me to come with you?

459
00:20:59,052 --> 00:20:59,611
Miss Lvying,

460
00:20:59,611 --> 00:21:00,371
as you insist,

461
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:01,731
I won't reject you.

462
00:21:02,172 --> 00:21:02,891
No, thanks.

463
00:21:03,652 --> 00:21:04,851
You're a bad influence to the kid.

464
00:21:05,572 --> 00:21:06,412
Let's go, Xiao.

465
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:07,211
Hand.

466
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,450
(Taoju Inn)

467
00:21:09,452 --> 00:21:09,971
(Taoju Inn)
You're leaving?

468
00:21:09,971 --> 00:21:11,660
(Taoju Inn)

469
00:21:19,971 --> 00:21:21,971
Why did you bring me here?

470
00:21:22,452 --> 00:21:23,491
Didn't you think

471
00:21:23,851 --> 00:21:26,371
I should tell Zhan Yue
about my feelings?

472
00:21:26,812 --> 00:21:29,891
That's why I want to come here
and request

473
00:21:30,491 --> 00:21:31,412
for "The Golden Bough"

474
00:21:31,692 --> 00:21:32,332
to confess to him.

475
00:21:33,611 --> 00:21:34,812
"The Golden Bough"?

476
00:21:35,891 --> 00:21:36,891
That's great.

477
00:21:37,211 --> 00:21:38,971
The play is a story

478
00:21:38,971 --> 00:21:41,572
of a hero who met a princess
in an unpleasant event

479
00:21:41,731 --> 00:21:43,211
and they ended up getting married.

480
00:21:43,491 --> 00:21:44,211
Zhan Yue will understand

481
00:21:44,211 --> 00:21:45,491
what you mean after watching it.

482
00:21:47,412 --> 00:21:50,172
But Fuyang City is a small place.

483
00:21:50,731 --> 00:21:51,971
There's no good actor here.

484
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,371
(Melody Stage)
Perhaps

485
00:21:54,371 --> 00:21:55,172
(Melody Stage)

486
00:21:55,172 --> 00:21:55,891
this is

487
00:21:56,211 --> 00:21:58,211
my only chance to confess to someone.

488
00:22:00,091 --> 00:22:01,091
So what?

489
00:22:01,532 --> 00:22:02,491
Didn't you say

490
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:05,532
it's important to make Zhan Yue
understand my feelings?

491
00:22:06,452 --> 00:22:09,131
How could the ordinary actors
explain this?

492
00:22:10,332 --> 00:22:12,172
So...

493
00:22:12,371 --> 00:22:13,371
So?

494
00:22:15,971 --> 00:22:16,652
Tell me, Shen Miao.

495
00:22:17,091 --> 00:22:18,211
Are you my buddy?

496
00:22:18,692 --> 00:22:19,532
Of course, I am.

497
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:20,891
But...

498
00:22:20,971 --> 00:22:22,211
There's no excuse, then.

499
00:22:23,851 --> 00:22:26,091
I'm counting on you.

500
00:22:27,851 --> 00:22:28,292
Let's go.

501
00:22:36,251 --> 00:22:36,932
You lose again.

502
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:39,932
A bet is a bet.

503
00:22:40,572 --> 00:22:41,452
I'll be at your disposal.

504
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:50,091
I want to ask this
on behalf of Ninth Princess.

505
00:22:50,692 --> 00:22:53,091
What exactly do you think about her?

506
00:23:01,572 --> 00:23:02,611
You know me well.

507
00:23:02,891 --> 00:23:04,011
I'm just a boor.

508
00:23:04,891 --> 00:23:06,772
I don't even know
what my parents' names are.

509
00:23:07,772 --> 00:23:08,572
I don't deserve her.

510
00:23:09,292 --> 00:23:09,572
Zhan Yue.

511
00:23:09,572 --> 00:23:10,572
Let me finish.

512
00:23:11,332 --> 00:23:12,572
If I promise her,

513
00:23:12,572 --> 00:23:13,692
I'll certainly be responsible for her.

514
00:23:14,371 --> 00:23:15,731
But marriage is a huge matter.

515
00:23:17,211 --> 00:23:17,932
It's not that simple.

516
00:23:18,692 --> 00:23:20,851
Her life is completely different
from mine.

517
00:23:21,851 --> 00:23:23,211
We're worlds apart.

518
00:23:24,412 --> 00:23:25,211
How can we last long?

519
00:23:26,011 --> 00:23:27,452
Are you going to keep doing this?

520
00:23:30,652 --> 00:23:32,251
She liked you

521
00:23:32,731 --> 00:23:33,692
on the spur of the moment.

522
00:23:34,971 --> 00:23:37,131
I don't know if this is the same case.

523
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,211
I give her the cold shoulder

524
00:23:40,932 --> 00:23:41,491
so that she'll

525
00:23:42,052 --> 00:23:42,932
understand it in the future.

526
00:23:46,652 --> 00:23:47,251
I think

527
00:23:48,091 --> 00:23:49,052
you're blinded to the truth.

528
00:23:52,772 --> 00:23:53,652
Don't be like me.

529
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:56,971
Cherish what you have
before you lose it.

530
00:24:02,251 --> 00:24:03,491
It's me, the waiter.

531
00:24:04,052 --> 00:24:04,532
Come in.

532
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:12,412
The guest in the next room asked me
to give you this invitation card.

533
00:24:13,172 --> 00:24:15,891
Please be sure to meet her
at the theater.

534
00:24:17,091 --> 00:24:18,011
Miao invited me?

535
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:20,932
It's not for you.

536
00:24:21,332 --> 00:24:24,091
It's for the man who has a sword.

537
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:26,692
Me?

538
00:24:36,491 --> 00:24:36,971
Let's see.

539
00:24:45,532 --> 00:24:47,091
You have such a handsome face.

540
00:24:47,371 --> 00:24:48,172
After doing the make-up

541
00:24:48,251 --> 00:24:49,011
and wearing the headdress,

542
00:24:49,611 --> 00:24:51,251
you'll surely look
more like a princess than I do.

543
00:24:54,251 --> 00:24:56,731
I don't think this will work.

544
00:24:57,292 --> 00:24:58,812
It's just my hobby.

545
00:24:59,412 --> 00:25:01,091
I've never performed on stage before.

546
00:25:01,812 --> 00:25:03,772
If I screw this up...

547
00:25:04,572 --> 00:25:06,332
You're not the Shen Miao I know.

548
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,131
It's only been two years.

549
00:25:08,452 --> 00:25:10,131
You've become so timid.

550
00:25:11,211 --> 00:25:12,692
Even if I say yes,

551
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:14,532
Zhan Yue won't necessarily come.

552
00:25:15,491 --> 00:25:16,412
Don't you worry.

553
00:25:16,692 --> 00:25:18,971
I've written an invitation card
in your name.

554
00:25:19,452 --> 00:25:20,292
I'm sure he'll come.

555
00:25:21,131 --> 00:25:21,731
You...

556
00:25:21,851 --> 00:25:22,851
Well.

557
00:25:23,412 --> 00:25:25,211
What are you afraid of?

558
00:25:27,131 --> 00:25:29,971
Anyway, this is the only chance.

559
00:25:30,851 --> 00:25:31,332
Shen Miao,

560
00:25:31,932 --> 00:25:32,611
I believe in you.

561
00:25:33,371 --> 00:25:34,251
For my sake,

562
00:25:34,971 --> 00:25:35,932
you have to trust yourself.

563
00:25:39,251 --> 00:25:39,692
Sure.

564
00:25:40,491 --> 00:25:41,452
I'll give it a try.

565
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:42,851
Really?

566
00:25:42,851 --> 00:25:43,452
That's great.

567
00:25:44,452 --> 00:25:46,052
Well, then.

568
00:25:49,611 --> 00:25:51,332
You stay here and get ready.

569
00:25:51,932 --> 00:25:53,011
I'll take a look out there.

570
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:29,572
The pledge of love remains unfulfilled.

571
00:26:30,211 --> 00:26:30,772
Pei Yanzhen,

572
00:26:31,052 --> 00:26:31,971
what is this about?

573
00:26:32,371 --> 00:26:33,091
Didn't I already tell you

574
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,652
that there's nothing
between me and Shen Miao?

575
00:26:34,971 --> 00:26:36,332
You and I are from the same academy.

576
00:26:36,572 --> 00:26:37,292
We've been on the verge
of death together.

577
00:26:37,692 --> 00:26:39,011
How could I possibly doubt you?

578
00:26:39,011 --> 00:26:40,452
You're acting strange.

579
00:26:41,091 --> 00:26:42,611
That's what makes you suspicious.

580
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:48,412
Zhan Yue.

581
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:53,532
Your Highness.

582
00:26:55,091 --> 00:26:55,692
Pei Yanzhen.

583
00:26:55,812 --> 00:26:56,491
Why are you here?

584
00:27:02,652 --> 00:27:04,772
You forged
the invitation card, didn't you?

585
00:27:05,611 --> 00:27:06,812
I've cleared my name now.

586
00:27:09,371 --> 00:27:10,332
Otherwise,

587
00:27:10,652 --> 00:27:11,812
you wouldn't have come.

588
00:27:12,491 --> 00:27:14,812
There's a play dedicated to you.

589
00:27:18,052 --> 00:27:20,011
I don't like this.

590
00:27:23,091 --> 00:27:24,412
If there's nothing else,

591
00:27:24,731 --> 00:27:26,971
His Highness and I are leaving
as we have work to do.

592
00:27:30,131 --> 00:27:31,091
Zhan... Zhan Yue.

593
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:32,932
Do we have work to do?

594
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:34,052
Why didn't I know this?

595
00:27:37,611 --> 00:27:38,131
Your Highness,

596
00:27:39,011 --> 00:27:41,412
I didn't treat you like this before.

597
00:27:41,412 --> 00:27:43,332
What has it got to do with me?

598
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:48,052
I have poor eyesight.

599
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:50,812
I finally can listen to a play now.

600
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:51,772
Look at you.

601
00:27:53,611 --> 00:27:55,772
Pei Yanzhen said you're free.

602
00:27:56,052 --> 00:27:57,772
So just stay here.

603
00:28:00,692 --> 00:28:01,491
If so,

604
00:28:02,011 --> 00:28:02,891
I'll excuse...

605
00:28:04,491 --> 00:28:05,011
Take a seat.

606
00:28:07,091 --> 00:28:07,611
Sure.

607
00:28:56,052 --> 00:29:00,611
I expect nothing much

608
00:29:01,692 --> 00:29:04,772
from my husband.

609
00:29:05,812 --> 00:29:10,412
There are only three requirements.

610
00:29:11,532 --> 00:29:17,452
First off, no scholars.

611
00:29:18,452 --> 00:29:24,011
Secondly, no politicians.

612
00:29:25,611 --> 00:29:39,932
Thirdly, no unfaithful men.

613
00:29:47,532 --> 00:29:48,091
Miao?

614
00:29:50,091 --> 00:29:51,292
You can even tell this?

615
00:29:52,131 --> 00:29:53,011
Miao is a noble lady,

616
00:29:53,011 --> 00:29:53,772
not an actress.

617
00:29:54,532 --> 00:29:55,812
Your Highness, you owe me
an explanation

618
00:29:56,371 --> 00:29:57,532
about this doing of yours.

619
00:29:59,211 --> 00:30:01,251
Miaomiao likes to perform.

620
00:30:02,491 --> 00:30:03,011
Zhan Yue,

621
00:30:03,611 --> 00:30:04,532
get Miao down here.

622
00:30:05,292 --> 00:30:05,731
No.

623
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:08,172
I specifically prepare this show.

624
00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:11,851
Just pay attention to it.

625
00:30:50,131 --> 00:30:50,572
Miao.

626
00:31:10,011 --> 00:31:10,611
Pei Yanzhen.

627
00:31:11,812 --> 00:31:12,332
Miao,

628
00:31:13,091 --> 00:31:13,772
are you alright?

629
00:31:14,452 --> 00:31:14,851
Miaomiao,

630
00:31:14,851 --> 00:31:15,412
are you okay?

631
00:31:25,412 --> 00:31:25,971
I'm fine.

632
00:31:31,772 --> 00:31:32,371
Miao,

633
00:31:33,812 --> 00:31:34,652
go back with me.

634
00:31:35,091 --> 00:31:35,851
Pei Yanzhen,

635
00:31:37,172 --> 00:31:40,052
when did you regain your vision?

636
00:31:55,572 --> 00:31:56,172
I...

637
00:31:58,851 --> 00:32:00,091
Not long ago.

638
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:02,251
It was...

639
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:08,131
It happened recently.

640
00:32:08,491 --> 00:32:09,172
Recently?

641
00:32:11,011 --> 00:32:12,052
How long has it been?

642
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:20,652
You must be pleased and enjoy seeing me

643
00:32:21,452 --> 00:32:22,412
change your dressing,

644
00:32:22,412 --> 00:32:23,131
travel with you,

645
00:32:23,131 --> 00:32:24,011
and stand up

646
00:32:24,332 --> 00:32:25,692
for you like a joke,

647
00:32:25,692 --> 00:32:26,652
don't you?

648
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:29,052
You're indeed a habitual scammer

649
00:32:29,052 --> 00:32:30,052
and an expert at scheming.

650
00:32:31,572 --> 00:32:34,452
Don't you think
it's such a waste for you

651
00:32:35,772 --> 00:32:37,412
to deceive a simpleton like me?

652
00:32:37,572 --> 00:32:38,772
It's my bad lying to you.

653
00:32:39,692 --> 00:32:41,332
But I do love you wholeheartedly,

654
00:32:41,332 --> 00:32:41,532
Miao.

655
00:32:41,532 --> 00:32:43,572
I thought I'd made myself clear.

656
00:32:44,412 --> 00:32:45,652
I hate liars.

657
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:47,532
If you show your love

658
00:32:47,891 --> 00:32:49,332
in a deceptive manner,

659
00:32:49,932 --> 00:32:50,971
I hereby ask

660
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,292
Your Highness to have mercy

661
00:32:55,332 --> 00:32:57,052
and spare my life.

662
00:33:01,891 --> 00:33:02,452
Shen Miao,

663
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:04,731
it's because he cares about you.

664
00:33:04,731 --> 00:33:05,052
That's why...

665
00:33:05,052 --> 00:33:05,891
So you mean

666
00:33:05,891 --> 00:33:07,652
I should thank him, am I right?

667
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,491
Miaomiao.

668
00:33:09,932 --> 00:33:10,851
What is this play?

669
00:33:11,332 --> 00:33:12,572
It's quite interesting.

670
00:33:14,452 --> 00:33:15,692
I know right.

671
00:33:15,891 --> 00:33:17,332
He even flew around.

672
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,491
It's so exciting.

673
00:33:18,491 --> 00:33:19,891
This is not a suitable place to talk.

674
00:33:20,211 --> 00:33:20,731
Miaomiao,

675
00:33:20,731 --> 00:33:22,091
let's talk at the back, okay?

676
00:33:30,251 --> 00:33:31,011
Is it finished?

677
00:33:31,211 --> 00:33:32,371
Continue.

678
00:33:32,532 --> 00:33:33,091
Yes.

679
00:33:33,091 --> 00:33:35,052
Continue. Why did she leave?

680
00:33:35,131 --> 00:33:35,851
Yes.

681
00:33:40,211 --> 00:33:41,251
Why did they leave?

682
00:33:45,812 --> 00:33:46,412
Who did this?

683
00:33:48,412 --> 00:33:49,131
Lackey Zhao,

684
00:33:49,412 --> 00:33:50,332
did you do this?

685
00:33:50,731 --> 00:33:51,251
Tie Niu,

686
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:52,611
what are you talking about?

687
00:33:54,772 --> 00:33:55,572
Official Song,

688
00:33:55,851 --> 00:33:56,772
what's wrong?

689
00:33:57,052 --> 00:33:58,772
You locked the door, didn't you?

690
00:34:00,292 --> 00:34:00,851
Official Song,

691
00:34:01,052 --> 00:34:02,251
you've falsely accused me.

692
00:34:02,251 --> 00:34:03,371
How would I dare to lock the door?

693
00:34:03,452 --> 00:34:05,332
You and your master are
hand in glove.

694
00:34:05,332 --> 00:34:06,412
There's nothing you won't do.

695
00:34:06,971 --> 00:34:07,652
Obviously,

696
00:34:07,652 --> 00:34:09,211
Pei Yanzhen is afraid
that I'll steal his thunder.

697
00:34:09,211 --> 00:34:10,411
That's why he came out
with this dirty trick.

698
00:34:11,052 --> 00:34:11,572
Tie Niu,

699
00:34:11,852 --> 00:34:12,852
you take care of Lackey Zhao.

700
00:34:13,171 --> 00:34:13,971
I'll go to Miaomiao.

701
00:34:14,132 --> 00:34:14,332
Sure.

702
00:34:14,332 --> 00:34:14,931
Stop there.

703
00:34:15,171 --> 00:34:16,211
How dare you get in the way.

704
00:34:16,892 --> 00:34:18,372
Come over here.

705
00:34:18,971 --> 00:34:19,971
I took him down, Master.

706
00:34:20,251 --> 00:34:20,651
Run!

707
00:34:20,651 --> 00:34:21,251
Let go of me.

708
00:34:22,372 --> 00:34:23,451
Please, Master.

709
00:34:24,211 --> 00:34:25,651
Tie Niu, let go of me.

710
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,532
- Didn't you lock the door?
- Tie Niu.

711
00:34:27,651 --> 00:34:28,691
Aren't you so capable?

712
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:29,451
Don't lock my arm.

713
00:34:29,731 --> 00:34:30,211
How about this?

714
00:34:30,251 --> 00:34:31,372
Let's have a fair match

715
00:34:31,451 --> 00:34:32,451
and fight. Come on.

716
00:34:32,451 --> 00:34:33,251
I'm not afraid.

717
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:35,092
Bring it on!

718
00:34:37,971 --> 00:34:39,251
Miao, listen to me.

719
00:34:39,731 --> 00:34:40,731
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

720
00:34:42,411 --> 00:34:42,892
Miao.

721
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:45,731
You've regained your vision long ago.

722
00:34:46,052 --> 00:34:47,092
Yet, you concealed it from me.

723
00:34:47,731 --> 00:34:48,731
If it wasn't for the accident,

724
00:34:48,931 --> 00:34:50,251
how much longer
would you hide it from me?

725
00:34:50,251 --> 00:34:51,691
After I fell at the mountain,

726
00:34:51,971 --> 00:34:52,852
I started to regain my vision.

727
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,731
But Miao, I didn't mean
to keep it from you.

728
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:56,052
I just didn't want this to get out.

729
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:56,971
You were worried I'd sell you out.

730
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,132
That's not what I meant.

731
00:34:59,132 --> 00:35:00,731
Just stop making excuses.

732
00:35:04,052 --> 00:35:05,251
Along the way,

733
00:35:06,092 --> 00:35:07,251
Third Master Song has been reminding me.

734
00:35:07,532 --> 00:35:08,651
But I made the same mistake.

735
00:35:08,651 --> 00:35:10,411
I sided with you and trusted you.

736
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:11,251
And you?

737
00:35:12,092 --> 00:35:13,411
You concealed the truth, lied,

738
00:35:13,532 --> 00:35:14,532
used me and plotted against me.

739
00:35:15,011 --> 00:35:16,132
You can never change

740
00:35:16,251 --> 00:35:18,011
the behaviors I hate the most.

741
00:35:19,892 --> 00:35:20,532
What about you?

742
00:35:21,171 --> 00:35:22,251
Does Third Master Song

743
00:35:23,251 --> 00:35:24,892
always matter more to you than me?

744
00:35:25,251 --> 00:35:26,451
If I were cunning,

745
00:35:27,372 --> 00:35:28,731
would it make him a broad-minded man?

746
00:35:29,132 --> 00:35:30,372
If you met him first,

747
00:35:31,251 --> 00:35:32,731
would I even have

748
00:35:33,892 --> 00:35:35,211
a place in your heart?

749
00:35:39,691 --> 00:35:40,411
Answer me.

750
00:35:41,171 --> 00:35:41,612
You're right.

751
00:35:43,532 --> 00:35:44,731
He has never hurt me before.

752
00:35:45,612 --> 00:35:47,251
I only believe
those who treat others sincerely.

753
00:35:48,411 --> 00:35:49,491
Does the word "Might be annihilated"

754
00:35:49,491 --> 00:35:50,651
really matter that much to you?

755
00:35:51,092 --> 00:35:52,411
No matter what I do,

756
00:35:52,411 --> 00:35:53,852
you'll never get over it, won't you?

757
00:35:54,171 --> 00:35:54,852
Your Highness,

758
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:58,971
don't you think
what you said is ridiculous?

759
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,731
It was you who lied to me
again and again.

760
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:03,092
But now,

761
00:36:03,491 --> 00:36:04,892
you blame me, the victim,

762
00:36:04,892 --> 00:36:06,691
for not being broad-minded
and tolerant.

763
00:36:06,971 --> 00:36:08,011
Whatever Pei Yanzhen does,

764
00:36:08,011 --> 00:36:09,052
it's always right, isn't it?

765
00:36:09,171 --> 00:36:09,931
If you like me,

766
00:36:09,931 --> 00:36:10,612
I'll have to tolerate and accept

767
00:36:10,612 --> 00:36:11,491
everything you do.

768
00:36:11,491 --> 00:36:13,251
Otherwise, it'd be my fault.

769
00:36:13,251 --> 00:36:14,731
But you do have feelings for me.

770
00:36:21,892 --> 00:36:23,011
I did.

771
00:36:24,651 --> 00:36:25,971
But from now on,

772
00:36:27,372 --> 00:36:28,852
I'll forget about you.

773
00:36:31,612 --> 00:36:32,251
Pei Yanzhen,

774
00:36:33,132 --> 00:36:33,971
let me go

775
00:36:35,451 --> 00:36:36,612
and spare yourself.

776
00:36:41,011 --> 00:36:41,572
Miao.

777
00:36:42,731 --> 00:36:43,372
Get out of my way.

778
00:36:43,572 --> 00:36:44,171
Pei Yanzhen,

779
00:36:45,092 --> 00:36:46,572
you've tried everything

780
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:48,372
yet, you can't read one's mind.

781
00:36:49,251 --> 00:36:50,812
You've put too much pressure on her.

782
00:36:51,532 --> 00:36:52,772
Just look out for yourself.

783
00:36:53,731 --> 00:36:54,372
What about you?

784
00:36:54,892 --> 00:36:56,132
There's something
I don't want to delve into.

785
00:36:57,211 --> 00:36:58,612
It's to cut you some slack

786
00:36:58,931 --> 00:37:00,011
before Miao.

787
00:37:00,731 --> 00:37:01,451
Third Master Song,

788
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:03,451
Miao sincerely treats you like a friend.

789
00:37:03,731 --> 00:37:04,211
If you say

790
00:37:04,211 --> 00:37:06,171
everything I do is a scheme,

791
00:37:07,451 --> 00:37:08,612
what

792
00:37:09,132 --> 00:37:10,052
about your doings?

793
00:37:18,491 --> 00:37:20,132
I don't understand

794
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,011
what you're talking about.

795
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:23,211
Was it

796
00:37:25,251 --> 00:37:27,971
really an accident that Miao heard
about the comprehensive plan

797
00:37:31,491 --> 00:37:32,852
from the bird back then?

798
00:38:00,132 --> 00:38:00,812
Tie Niu,

799
00:38:01,211 --> 00:38:02,532
what are you?

800
00:38:02,532 --> 00:38:03,852
You're such a big lump.

801
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:05,451
You're no match for me.

802
00:38:06,092 --> 00:38:07,332
It's not too late to admit defeat now.

803
00:38:08,092 --> 00:38:10,332
I excel in sword and rod techniques.

804
00:38:10,612 --> 00:38:12,651
I certainly can't win you
with bare hands.

805
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:14,892
What are you doing?

806
00:38:15,772 --> 00:38:16,211
Very well.

807
00:38:18,612 --> 00:38:19,171
Tie Niu.

808
00:38:20,772 --> 00:38:21,691
This will do.

809
00:38:22,772 --> 00:38:23,251
No.

810
00:38:24,572 --> 00:38:25,332
Well, look.

811
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:27,332
Now you're unarmed.

812
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:28,332
If I win,

813
00:38:28,332 --> 00:38:29,332
it'll be unfair.

814
00:38:29,572 --> 00:38:30,171
How about this?

815
00:38:30,171 --> 00:38:30,852
Let's not do it today.

816
00:38:30,852 --> 00:38:32,451
I'll fight you
after returning to the capital.

817
00:38:32,451 --> 00:38:33,971
You talk too much.

818
00:38:34,332 --> 00:38:34,812
Just wait for it.

819
00:38:35,892 --> 00:38:36,332
No.

820
00:38:37,211 --> 00:38:37,812
What are you doing?

821
00:38:40,211 --> 00:38:40,731
You...

822
00:38:43,332 --> 00:38:44,211
Will this do?

823
00:38:45,892 --> 00:38:46,491
Tie Niu,

824
00:38:46,852 --> 00:38:47,772
I've got to say this.

825
00:38:48,251 --> 00:38:49,372
You're young.

826
00:38:49,372 --> 00:38:50,852
Why are you so scheming?

827
00:38:51,251 --> 00:38:53,011
The longer the weapon,
the stronger it is.

828
00:38:53,011 --> 00:38:54,171
Do you think I've never heard of it?

829
00:38:55,372 --> 00:38:56,332
Fine.

830
00:38:56,691 --> 00:38:57,171
Here.

831
00:38:57,532 --> 00:38:58,092
You take this.

832
00:38:59,491 --> 00:39:00,451
Will this do?

833
00:39:02,332 --> 00:39:02,812
I...

834
00:39:03,772 --> 00:39:04,211
I...

835
00:39:07,532 --> 00:39:08,332
Bring it on.

836
00:39:27,772 --> 00:39:28,292
You guys.

837
00:39:30,052 --> 00:39:30,651
Manager,

838
00:39:30,852 --> 00:39:31,491
big trouble.

839
00:39:31,651 --> 00:39:32,451
Someone is making trouble.

840
00:39:32,451 --> 00:39:33,612
Buddy.

841
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:35,211
I didn't mean to.

842
00:39:35,211 --> 00:39:35,651
Get out.

843
00:39:35,651 --> 00:39:35,971
Buddy.

844
00:39:35,971 --> 00:39:36,691
Leave now.

845
00:39:36,852 --> 00:39:38,052
You're not welcomed here.

846
00:39:38,651 --> 00:39:39,171
What are you doing?

847
00:39:39,171 --> 00:39:39,772
It's flimsy either.

848
00:39:39,892 --> 00:39:40,971
Do you like that windmill?

849
00:39:42,812 --> 00:39:43,691
I'll compensate you.

850
00:39:43,772 --> 00:39:44,532
It doesn't help.

851
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:45,772
I can build one for you.

852
00:39:46,731 --> 00:39:47,451
What's going on?

853
00:39:48,731 --> 00:39:49,691
Please tell

854
00:39:50,171 --> 00:39:51,852
your lovers what you want to say.

855
00:39:53,011 --> 00:39:54,691
We're not in that kind of relationship.

856
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:56,092
I don't care.

857
00:39:56,532 --> 00:39:58,171
I've had enough of you guys.

858
00:39:58,892 --> 00:39:59,971
Three unhappy couples.

859
00:39:59,971 --> 00:40:00,731
Men and women get

860
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,651
entangled in love.

861
00:40:02,332 --> 00:40:03,731
The present society is

862
00:40:03,731 --> 00:40:04,651
full of moral degradation.

863
00:40:04,731 --> 00:40:05,852
It's sadistic.

864
00:40:05,971 --> 00:40:06,451
It's...

865
00:40:07,731 --> 00:40:08,532
Shameless.

866
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:09,011
- Yes.
- What are you talking about?

867
00:40:09,011 --> 00:40:09,812
It's shameless.

868
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,171
You picked a fight
because of a trivial matter

869
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:13,731
like a love affair.

870
00:40:14,251 --> 00:40:15,971
And you ruined my store.

871
00:40:16,612 --> 00:40:17,852
My hands are full without you.

872
00:40:18,852 --> 00:40:19,731
This is a small store.

873
00:40:20,011 --> 00:40:21,171
It can't accept big shots like you.

874
00:40:21,731 --> 00:40:22,332
Just leave now.

875
00:40:22,332 --> 00:40:22,691
Don't do this.

876
00:40:22,691 --> 00:40:23,292
Leave right now.

877
00:40:23,292 --> 00:40:24,011
Don't do this.

878
00:40:25,052 --> 00:40:25,852
I'll pay you the money.

879
00:40:25,852 --> 00:40:26,772
We'll compensate you.

880
00:40:26,772 --> 00:40:27,731
Why are you doing this?

881
00:40:27,971 --> 00:40:28,852
Brats!

882
00:40:29,132 --> 00:40:30,491
How am I going to
explain it to my miss?

883
00:40:31,731 --> 00:40:32,171
How?

884
00:40:32,171 --> 00:40:33,372
Don't be afraid, Lvying.

885
00:40:33,372 --> 00:40:34,852
Mother is in a similar situation.

886
00:40:34,852 --> 00:40:36,211
She won't mind it.

887
00:40:38,772 --> 00:40:39,731
Look at my face.

888
00:41:05,812 --> 00:41:06,731
Actually, well...

889
00:41:08,451 --> 00:41:09,852
Just be quiet
if you don't have anything to say.

890
00:41:13,251 --> 00:41:13,772
Master,

891
00:41:14,852 --> 00:41:15,612
it's my fault

892
00:41:16,292 --> 00:41:17,852
that everyone has to be out in the wild.

893
00:41:18,171 --> 00:41:19,052
Please punish me.

894
00:41:20,731 --> 00:41:22,892
This is called "It takes two to tango".

895
00:41:23,451 --> 00:41:25,491
Someone is blocking the wheels.

896
00:41:25,852 --> 00:41:26,572
Otherwise,

897
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,332
why would we end up
in this situation now?

898
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,132
Your Highness,

899
00:41:30,332 --> 00:41:31,132
he has his tongue in his cheek

900
00:41:31,211 --> 00:41:32,011
and he's insinuating.

901
00:41:37,251 --> 00:41:39,731
Mother, I'm tired.

902
00:41:40,691 --> 00:41:41,092
Okay.

903
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,572
I'll tuck you in.

904
00:41:44,292 --> 00:41:45,251
It's getting late.

905
00:41:45,691 --> 00:41:46,691
Let's get some rest.

906
00:41:49,691 --> 00:41:50,332
Time for bed.

907
00:41:54,132 --> 00:41:54,892
Good night, Miaomiao.

908
00:41:57,292 --> 00:41:57,971
I'll check around.

909
00:42:08,691 --> 00:42:09,251

910
00:42:09,251 --> 00:42:10,011
