Miao?

00:02:14,361 --> 00:02:15,282
Let's just leave that for now.

26
00:02:15,842 --> 00:02:17,842
They are sent by Madam Xia.

27
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:18,962
You are a frail scholar.

28
00:02:18,962 --> 00:02:19,881
You might get hurt.

29
00:02:20,361 --> 00:02:22,081
I will handle these thieves.

30
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:22,641
Little brat.

31
00:02:22,962 --> 00:02:23,881
We aren't thieves.

32
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:25,762
I'm the most ferocious bandit
of Longhu Mountain.

33
00:02:25,762 --> 00:02:26,361
Boo!

34
00:02:26,721 --> 00:02:28,521
You are the weakest rat.

35
00:02:31,322 --> 00:02:31,762
Miao.

36
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:33,562
Be careful of your baby.

37
00:02:33,962 --> 00:02:34,801
Don't dawdle.

38
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:35,441
Run now.

39
00:02:36,962 --> 00:02:39,001
I can't move my legs.

40
00:02:39,922 --> 00:02:40,601
It's my fault.

41
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:42,122
I should've taught you martial arts
before we got divorced.

42
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:44,241
No, it's my fault.

43
00:02:44,241 --> 00:02:45,482
Enough chatter.

44
00:02:46,762 --> 00:02:47,682
Chop her off.

45
00:02:59,601 --> 00:03:01,441
When did my skills improve so much?

46
00:03:01,641 --> 00:03:02,081
Charge.

47
00:03:02,122 --> 00:03:02,762
Watch out, Miao.

48
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,762
Could you get me some ointment?

49
00:03:41,402 --> 00:03:42,842
My wound tears.

50
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,380
(Too lazy to turn back for a flower
because my heart only fills with you.)

51
00:04:11,322 --> 00:04:14,122
You still keep these though.

52
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:18,002
What if Her Highness finds this out?

53
00:04:18,282 --> 00:04:18,722
It will be...

54
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:21,162
Why are you taking off the robe?

55
00:04:21,682 --> 00:04:22,641
To dress the wound.

56
00:04:23,442 --> 00:04:23,882
Miao.

57
00:04:24,162 --> 00:04:25,921
Can you help me with the medicine?

58
00:04:26,122 --> 00:04:26,921
I can't move.

59
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:28,842
I'll go get the butler here.

60
00:04:28,842 --> 00:04:29,641
No.

61
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,842
It's not appropriate that others know
you are here at this hour.

62
00:04:33,122 --> 00:04:35,002
You might not mind about this.

63
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,521
But I'm the local magistrate.

64
00:04:38,122 --> 00:04:39,682
It'd better conceal your presence here.

65
00:05:05,641 --> 00:05:06,921
The injury looks serious.

66
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:10,682
The chaotic situation in the capital.

67
00:05:11,682 --> 00:05:12,361
I would rather not talk about it.

68
00:05:14,122 --> 00:05:14,921
Miao, please be gentle.

69
00:05:15,162 --> 00:05:16,002
I'm scared of the pain.

70
00:05:22,962 --> 00:05:24,921
How ill-fated I am to meet with you.

71
00:05:25,521 --> 00:05:27,122
I wish that I wasn't there
tonight.

72
00:05:29,402 --> 00:05:30,442
It's strange though.
You are merely a scholar

73
00:05:30,442 --> 00:05:31,241
without martial arts skills

74
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:32,641
and powerless.

75
00:05:33,321 --> 00:05:35,081
Why didn't you bring guards with you
going the Song's Residence?

76
00:05:38,842 --> 00:05:39,761
I appreciate your help.

77
00:05:40,761 --> 00:05:41,361
But,

78
00:05:42,402 --> 00:05:44,081
how did you know
about Fifth Master Song's plot?

79
00:05:45,682 --> 00:05:46,801
It was because of the divorce letter.

80
00:05:48,201 --> 00:05:48,682
Anyway,

81
00:05:49,442 --> 00:05:50,402
it's already too late now.

82
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:51,842
Divorce letter?

83
00:05:57,521 --> 00:05:58,282
A little bit lower.

84
00:05:58,842 --> 00:05:59,562
Yes. Right.

85
00:05:59,562 --> 00:06:00,201
Lower.

86
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:04,562
Gosh, what's with Pei Yanzhen?

87
00:06:05,442 --> 00:06:06,361
Press harder.

88
00:06:06,842 --> 00:06:07,761
Very good.

89
00:06:10,201 --> 00:06:11,722
You are amazing.

90
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:14,282
Right.

91
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:15,081
Press harder here.

92
00:06:23,761 --> 00:06:24,521
Miao.

93
00:06:25,402 --> 00:06:27,962
Does the writing look the same
as Third Master Song's?

94
00:06:31,801 --> 00:06:32,521
Pei Yanzhen.

95
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:35,481
That's impressive.

96
00:06:35,722 --> 00:06:36,722
It's not an easy technique

97
00:06:37,921 --> 00:06:39,602
to imitate his handwriting perfectly.

98
00:06:40,962 --> 00:06:41,562
You flatter me.

99
00:06:44,282 --> 00:06:46,041
Thank you so much.

100
00:06:46,442 --> 00:06:49,041
If possible,

101
00:06:49,562 --> 00:06:50,722
can you keep this to yourself?

102
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,682
I have owed Third Master Song so much.

103
00:06:54,602 --> 00:06:56,162
I don't wish
to drag him into trouble again.

104
00:06:56,562 --> 00:06:57,122
Sure.

105
00:07:01,162 --> 00:07:01,682
Miao.

106
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:03,921
If...

107
00:07:05,122 --> 00:07:06,562
If I am the father,

108
00:07:08,002 --> 00:07:09,162
can we start over?

109
00:07:13,402 --> 00:07:14,122
I can't answer you now.

110
00:07:14,882 --> 00:07:16,241
There is nothing going between
Ninth Princess and me.

111
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:18,201
It was His Majesty who wanted me
to wed her.

112
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:18,722
I had turned down...

113
00:07:18,722 --> 00:07:19,201
I know.

114
00:07:27,162 --> 00:07:28,282
I chose to marry you previously

115
00:07:29,442 --> 00:07:30,761
because I didn't want
to go to the palace.

116
00:07:32,162 --> 00:07:33,241
Likewise, it wasn't my intention

117
00:07:34,081 --> 00:07:35,201
to marry Song Xiyuan.

118
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:38,562
I hope the mistake won't happen again.

119
00:07:39,641 --> 00:07:41,682
Since I'm given to the third chance
to be single again,

120
00:07:43,842 --> 00:07:45,002
this time,

121
00:07:45,682 --> 00:07:47,201
I need to stop living for other people,

122
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,321
but for myself.

123
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:51,521
Therefore,

124
00:07:55,521 --> 00:07:56,122
I'll take a rain check

125
00:07:56,122 --> 00:07:57,122
on that.

126
00:07:57,921 --> 00:07:58,641
If you like,

127
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,162
I will always be your friend.

128
00:08:10,962 --> 00:08:12,602
Master Song, what brings you here

129
00:08:12,882 --> 00:08:13,842
in this early morning?

130
00:08:14,481 --> 00:08:17,442
I'm reporting Shen Miao
for forging the divorce letter.

131
00:08:25,602 --> 00:08:28,481
There were only women
who request a divorce.

132
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:30,201
I have never heard

133
00:08:30,402 --> 00:08:33,641
that women write divorce letter
themselves.

134
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,201
But the handwriting
on the divorce letter

135
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:37,521
is not mine.

136
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:39,081
You can look into it.

137
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:45,962
Official Pei.

138
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:49,282
You just forged an alliance with me
yesterday night.

139
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:50,761
Did you forget about it?

140
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:53,042
I'm willing to help you.

141
00:08:53,602 --> 00:08:56,001
However, all eyes of Lingzhou's people
are on this case.

142
00:08:56,962 --> 00:08:58,201
As the government official,

143
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:00,282
I can't consider only your statement.

144
00:09:02,121 --> 00:09:02,881
Pei Yanzhen.

145
00:09:03,842 --> 00:09:05,121
You broke your promise.

146
00:09:05,282 --> 00:09:06,001
You're not better than me.

147
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:07,602
Constable Zhao.

148
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:08,561
Yes.

149
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:10,802
Hand over the letters
written by Song Xiyuan.

150
00:09:10,802 --> 00:09:11,282
Yes.

151
00:09:19,761 --> 00:09:20,362
Master Song.

152
00:09:21,482 --> 00:09:22,641
Your handwriting is unique

153
00:09:23,081 --> 00:09:24,521
and I don't think others can imitate it.

154
00:09:25,722 --> 00:09:26,441
Look at it closely.

155
00:09:26,802 --> 00:09:27,761
Do you have anything to say about it?

156
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:36,962
Pei Yanzhen.

157
00:09:37,521 --> 00:09:38,561
Be honest with me.

158
00:09:38,802 --> 00:09:40,081
Is it done by you?

159
00:09:40,402 --> 00:09:41,842
I'm clueless about
what you are talking about.

160
00:09:42,321 --> 00:09:43,402
Slandering the officials

161
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:44,521
can be a serious crime.

162
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:48,521
You are shameless.

163
00:09:52,802 --> 00:09:53,362
Case

164
00:09:56,001 --> 00:09:56,521
closed.

165
00:09:57,121 --> 00:09:58,482
Stay tuned

166
00:09:58,482 --> 00:10:00,641
for more stories.

167
00:10:00,802 --> 00:10:01,881
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

168
00:10:01,881 --> 00:10:02,842
Thank you.

169
00:10:04,842 --> 00:10:05,641
Bravo!

170
00:10:09,922 --> 00:10:11,561
Storytellers and opera performers
only advise others

171
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:13,602
to choose the righteous path.

172
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:15,681
Per the rules of the world,
karma does the job

173
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:19,842
and new orders reshuffle the old world.

174
00:10:20,242 --> 00:10:21,042
It's said that

175
00:10:21,282 --> 00:10:24,081
destiny of one's marriage is
designated according to past lives.

176
00:10:24,402 --> 00:10:26,042
Previously, we talked about

177
00:10:26,402 --> 00:10:28,242
the only daughter of the Shen family
from Lingzhou

178
00:10:28,482 --> 00:10:30,162
that the baby in her tummy
is a mystery.

179
00:10:30,321 --> 00:10:33,162
This morning, Third Master Song
composed a divorce letter

180
00:10:33,482 --> 00:10:36,922
to bring the love triangle to an end.

181
00:10:37,842 --> 00:10:40,001
(Unexpectedly, Miss Shen)

182
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:41,521
(went on a blind date at Fuchun Parlor)

183
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:43,521
(and that has made waves once again.)

184
00:10:44,081 --> 00:10:45,761
Are you done?

185
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:47,482
Since you're the host of the meal,

186
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:49,402
why did you only invite Official Pei
without me?

187
00:10:49,802 --> 00:10:51,242
I'm also her ex-husband.

188
00:10:51,681 --> 00:10:53,162
I can't get it

189
00:10:53,561 --> 00:10:55,602
why I am excluded from your guest list?

190
00:10:55,881 --> 00:10:56,402
Ex-husband?

191
00:10:59,561 --> 00:11:00,282
Uncle?

192
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:01,962
Ex-husband?

193
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:03,842
Ex-husband?

194
00:11:05,441 --> 00:11:06,162
Niece?

195
00:11:07,842 --> 00:11:08,441
Master Ma.

196
00:11:08,441 --> 00:11:09,561
Please hear me out.

197
00:11:09,561 --> 00:11:11,042
This isn't what you think.

198
00:11:13,282 --> 00:11:13,722
Miao.

199
00:11:13,722 --> 00:11:14,001
Miaomiao.

200
00:11:18,802 --> 00:11:19,362
Don't move.

201
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:21,561
Miao.

202
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:22,641
Miao.

203
00:11:23,521 --> 00:11:24,081
Miaomiao.

204
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:25,962
My feelings for you are genuine.

205
00:11:26,282 --> 00:11:27,561
His is fake.

206
00:11:27,681 --> 00:11:28,162
Miao.

207
00:11:28,162 --> 00:11:28,922
Please listen to me.

208
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:29,441
Stand still.

209
00:11:30,282 --> 00:11:32,802
You have been making a scene in my place
lately

210
00:11:33,162 --> 00:11:34,242
and now you even stormed in here.

211
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,201
Aren't you sick of this?

212
00:11:35,402 --> 00:11:36,042
- No.
- No.

213
00:11:37,201 --> 00:11:37,561
You're not,

214
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:38,482
but I'm sick of you already.

215
00:11:39,441 --> 00:11:40,362
Everything is written in black and write

216
00:11:40,362 --> 00:11:41,282
in your divorce papers.

217
00:11:41,602 --> 00:11:42,441
I've compensated you
for the divorce

218
00:11:42,441 --> 00:11:43,881
and everyone has the freedom
to decide on their marriage.

219
00:11:44,282 --> 00:11:44,802
Miao.

220
00:11:45,321 --> 00:11:46,681
- I know you didn't mean it.
- We should be mature now.

221
00:11:47,121 --> 00:11:47,962
Though I'm a perfect lady
with all niceties,

222
00:11:48,282 --> 00:11:49,282
I'm not irreplaceable.

223
00:11:49,761 --> 00:11:51,121
If you grant me freedom,

224
00:11:51,282 --> 00:11:52,761
Shen family will reward you handsomely.

225
00:11:53,282 --> 00:11:55,242
But if you keep pestering me...

226
00:12:00,242 --> 00:12:02,121
Hmph! There's nothing in this world

227
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,162
that can't be settled by money.

228
00:12:03,802 --> 00:12:04,242
Miao.

229
00:12:04,242 --> 00:12:04,521
Don't go.

230
00:12:05,321 --> 00:12:07,561
Official Pei.

231
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:09,641
Official Pei.

232
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:11,162
Third Master Song.

233
00:12:16,321 --> 00:12:18,121
There are no rules stating the baby
must take the father's surname.

234
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,521
I, Shen Miao

235
00:12:19,802 --> 00:12:20,761
will raise my own child.

236
00:12:23,482 --> 00:12:23,881

- Miao. Move side.

00:13:03,201 --> 00:13:03,922
Give me some water.

Here.

255
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:06,081
Sit down.

00:13:06,482 --> 00:13:07,402
I'm out of breath.

How's the blind date of Miss Shen?

260

Don't ask.

261

Gosh, stop asking.

262
00:13:17,722 --> 00:13:18,842
If someone from
the Shen family comes by,

263
00:13:19,162 --> 00:13:19,962
tell them I'm not here.

(Where's that Matchmaker Liu?)

265
00:13:23,282 --> 00:13:24,282
Tell her I'm not around.

(Where's she?)

267
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:30,081
I have put so much trust in her.

Look what you've done.

269
00:13:32,242 --> 00:13:33,121
Show yourself now.

270
00:13:34,242 --> 00:13:35,922
Oh, Madam Shen.

271
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:37,561
It has been some time

272
00:13:37,561 --> 00:13:39,482
since you went out for Madiao game.

273
00:13:40,842 --> 00:13:41,722
Cut that out.

274
00:13:42,282 --> 00:13:43,201
Where's Matchmaker Liu?

275
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:44,482
She said she's not here.

276
00:13:46,441 --> 00:13:47,042
She's not here?

277
00:13:47,521 --> 00:13:48,521
Matchmaker Liu said

278
00:13:48,802 --> 00:13:49,962
she needed to attend

279
00:13:50,602 --> 00:13:51,482
to the family affairs.

280
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:53,521
It's fine.

281
00:13:54,282 --> 00:13:55,922
She has to return here anyway.

282
00:13:56,521 --> 00:13:57,482
I'm so curious about

283
00:13:57,602 --> 00:13:59,081
what the problem is with Miaomiao.

284
00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:00,922
Why did you get her an ugly, lewd,

285
00:14:00,922 --> 00:14:02,681
and stupid man for her blind date?

286
00:14:03,162 --> 00:14:04,042
What's wrong with you?

287
00:14:04,362 --> 00:14:04,842
Yes.

288
00:14:05,001 --> 00:14:05,761
What's wrong with you?

289
00:14:07,482 --> 00:14:08,482
Madam Shen.

290
00:14:08,602 --> 00:14:09,962
You may not know about this.

291
00:14:10,561 --> 00:14:13,081
The news that Miss Shen
has divorced twice

292
00:14:13,402 --> 00:14:15,602
is circulating all over now.

293
00:14:15,602 --> 00:14:16,081
That's right.

294
00:14:16,362 --> 00:14:18,561
No man has the guts to approach her.

295
00:14:18,922 --> 00:14:19,602
True.

296
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:21,962
Where can we get a suitable man for her?

297
00:14:23,802 --> 00:14:24,242
Is...

298
00:14:25,802 --> 00:14:26,602
Is it that difficult?

299
00:14:27,842 --> 00:14:28,321
Yes, it is.

300
00:14:28,722 --> 00:14:29,242
Yes.

301
00:14:29,482 --> 00:14:30,962
No, you failed your job instead.

302
00:14:31,402 --> 00:14:31,842
Yes.

303
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:32,842
You failed your job.

304
00:14:33,482 --> 00:14:34,121
Continue to search for suitable men.

305
00:14:34,681 --> 00:14:35,681
The fee will be doubled.

306
00:14:36,602 --> 00:14:38,121
Please don't, Madam Shen.

307
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:39,722
Please spare us.

308
00:14:40,201 --> 00:14:42,602
- True.
- Please spare us.

309
00:14:43,081 --> 00:14:44,282
Are you not satisfied with the fee?

310
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:45,602
I can give you more than you want.

311
00:14:45,602 --> 00:14:46,081
Please don't.

312
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:46,362
Take this.

313
00:14:46,362 --> 00:14:48,602
No, we can't.

314
00:14:48,962 --> 00:14:51,321
We can't afford to accept your request.

315
00:14:51,922 --> 00:14:52,761
We just can't.

316
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:54,681
- It's out of our depth.
- We're incapable of your request.

317
00:14:55,242 --> 00:14:56,201
Please give us a break.

318
00:14:56,201 --> 00:14:57,881
Please be generous with us.

319
00:14:58,081 --> 00:14:58,441
Oh, no.

320
00:14:58,441 --> 00:14:59,362
I can't find a man

321
00:14:59,362 --> 00:15:00,282
that's suitable for her.

322
00:15:00,282 --> 00:15:01,441
Zai.

323
00:15:02,242 --> 00:15:03,441
Pass the money to that person.

324
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:04,681
Don't let her run away.

325
00:15:04,842 --> 00:15:05,402
It's out of our depth.

326
00:15:05,402 --> 00:15:05,842
Chop-chop.

327
00:15:07,482 --> 00:15:08,482
Don't let her escape.

328
00:15:09,761 --> 00:15:10,922
Did you hear it?

329
00:15:28,482 --> 00:15:30,561
Gosh, Miss.

330
00:15:30,842 --> 00:15:32,482
The family is so anxious
about your marriage.

331
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:34,402
Why are you so calm
watching the performance here?

332
00:15:35,722 --> 00:15:36,881
I'm not anxious about it though.

333
00:15:37,362 --> 00:15:38,242
Naturally, I have nothing
to worry about.

334
00:15:38,761 --> 00:15:40,321
Why did you agree
to attend the blind date?

335
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,561
It's because of Pei Yanzhen
and Song Xiyuan

336
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,881
who always disturb me at the house.

337
00:15:48,641 --> 00:15:50,242
Gosh, my charming aura

338
00:15:50,842 --> 00:15:52,162
is indeed troublesome.

339
00:16:13,242 --> 00:16:13,842
Hi, Miaomiao.

340
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:15,321
Song Xiyuan.

341
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:16,162
What brings you here?

342
00:16:17,321 --> 00:16:18,561
What's wrong with the clothes on you?

343
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,282
Don't you like this?

344
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:21,201
Your favorite color is purple, right?

345
00:16:22,761 --> 00:16:24,321
I thought you are a living eggplant.

346
00:16:24,402 --> 00:16:24,881
What?

347
00:16:25,162 --> 00:16:25,881
Was that a compliment?

348
00:16:26,521 --> 00:16:27,081
Certainly.

349
00:16:27,282 --> 00:16:27,722
Gorgeous.

350
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:29,201
You look gorgeous with any clothes on.

351
00:16:30,081 --> 00:16:30,802
I knew it.

352
00:16:31,441 --> 00:16:32,521
Even though you divorced me,

353
00:16:32,842 --> 00:16:34,242
our affection can't be bound

354
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:36,681
by the superficial title.

355
00:16:37,602 --> 00:16:38,162
Tell me

356
00:16:38,922 --> 00:16:41,282
is there anything you wish to do today?

357
00:16:41,641 --> 00:16:42,802
I will accompany you today.

358
00:16:43,722 --> 00:16:44,402
There's no need.

359
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,761
No need to be so courteous, right?

360
00:16:47,842 --> 00:16:49,681
Well, indeed, I'm often tied up
with work.

361
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:51,722
But, my time is worthwhile

362
00:16:52,561 --> 00:16:54,081
if I stay with you.

363
00:16:55,162 --> 00:16:56,201
You took me wrong.

364
00:16:56,201 --> 00:16:57,641
I mean no need to accompany me.

365
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:01,162
Didn't I bar you from entering
from the front gate?

366
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:02,521
How did you manage to sneak in?

367
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:07,362
Song Xiyuan.

368
00:17:07,962 --> 00:17:09,602
You're a big name in this city.

369
00:17:09,602 --> 00:17:10,882
How could you climb the wall?

370
00:17:11,801 --> 00:17:12,722
Didn't you teach me that?

371
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:14,041
Did you forget about it?

372
00:17:15,642 --> 00:17:16,242
Third Master Song.

373
00:17:16,882 --> 00:17:18,081
I beg of you.

374
00:17:18,642 --> 00:17:19,441
The physician told me

375
00:17:19,441 --> 00:17:21,681
pregnant women aren't advisable
to experience extreme mood swings.

376
00:17:21,882 --> 00:17:23,201
Otherwise, the baby will
be born prematurely.

377
00:17:23,801 --> 00:17:24,882
Stop coming already.

378
00:17:24,882 --> 00:17:25,602
Okay?

379
00:17:27,002 --> 00:17:28,201
You've got a mood swing?

380
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,762
I knew you would like the feeling
of meeting me in secret.

381
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:32,762
You know what,

382
00:17:33,362 --> 00:17:34,722
I know more

383
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:36,081
about these tricks.

384
00:17:36,401 --> 00:17:37,242
Let me share it with you.

385
00:17:37,242 --> 00:17:38,002
- Miss.
- I...

386
00:17:39,281 --> 00:17:40,681
Miss, something bad happened.

387
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:41,722
Official Pei is here.

388
00:17:41,801 --> 00:17:42,762
Do you want to hide?

389
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,441
Why are you here, Master Song?

390
00:17:48,281 --> 00:17:49,242
Why should I hide?

391
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:50,561
I have something to talk to him.

392
00:17:51,122 --> 00:17:51,921
Wait for me here.

393
00:17:51,921 --> 00:17:52,642
I will slip off then.

394
00:17:53,401 --> 00:17:53,962
Hold on.

395
00:17:55,882 --> 00:17:57,561
How come Pei Yanzhen gets to meet you

396
00:17:57,842 --> 00:17:58,882
but I can't?

397
00:18:00,962 --> 00:18:03,281
First, he's the official here.

398
00:18:03,441 --> 00:18:05,362
Second, he's my uncle.

399
00:18:05,722 --> 00:18:06,801
I have no choice.

400
00:18:06,921 --> 00:18:07,602
- But...
- Well, enough.

401
00:18:07,602 --> 00:18:08,482
I need to go now.

402
00:18:08,842 --> 00:18:09,362
Let's go.

403
00:18:39,602 --> 00:18:40,122
Miao.

404
00:18:40,482 --> 00:18:41,161
You're here.

405
00:18:42,801 --> 00:18:44,842
Are you here for someone?

406
00:18:45,122 --> 00:18:45,801
No worries, Miao.

407
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:48,362
I don't mean to disturb you here.

408
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,281
Instead, I need you to relay
an important message

409
00:18:50,522 --> 00:18:51,482
to your father.

410
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:52,882
What's it?

411
00:18:53,921 --> 00:18:56,681
Empress Dowager is coming to Lingzhou
to pay calls.

412
00:18:57,561 --> 00:18:59,522
Both Shen and Song are invited
to welcome the arrival of Her Highness.

413
00:19:00,161 --> 00:19:01,522
This will help resolve the problem

414
00:19:01,522 --> 00:19:03,522
of the closedown of Shen's Rice Store.

415
00:19:04,482 --> 00:19:05,401
It's a great opportunity

416
00:19:05,842 --> 00:19:07,242
for your father.

417
00:19:08,722 --> 00:19:09,642
My father didn't tell me

418
00:19:09,921 --> 00:19:11,122
about the close-down.

419
00:19:11,882 --> 00:19:13,002
No wonder he carried
loads of jewelry away

420
00:19:13,002 --> 00:19:14,801
a few months ago.

421
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:16,681
What's the current situation now?

422
00:19:16,962 --> 00:19:18,482
Would my father be seized?

423
00:19:22,522 --> 00:19:23,362
You're pregnant now.

424
00:19:24,002 --> 00:19:24,762
Don't worry.

425
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:28,962
Rest assured.

426
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:30,201
As long as I'm here,

427
00:19:30,201 --> 00:19:31,642
nothing will happen to the Shen family.

428
00:19:32,201 --> 00:19:32,681
Besides,

429
00:19:32,962 --> 00:19:34,161
your father is
an experienced businessman.

430
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:36,921
Such tiny waves can't bring him down.

431
00:19:39,122 --> 00:19:39,842
You're right.

432
00:19:40,362 --> 00:19:41,921
My father used to ride out
all obstacles.

433
00:19:42,122 --> 00:19:43,242
My worries aren't necessary.

434
00:19:45,081 --> 00:19:45,642
Pei Yanzhen.

435
00:19:45,962 --> 00:19:47,041
Thank you so much

436
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,401
for coming here to tell me this.

437
00:19:48,842 --> 00:19:49,801
I will relay the message to my father.

438
00:19:52,762 --> 00:19:53,561
What are you doing here?

439
00:19:56,522 --> 00:19:57,242
Let go of her.

440
00:20:09,002 --> 00:20:10,242
Lvying is calling us for breakfast.

441
00:20:10,681 --> 00:20:11,642
Let's go.

442
00:20:33,561 --> 00:20:35,401
Pei Yanzhen, you're the official
who looks after the people.

443
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:36,441
Yet you just stand here.

444
00:20:36,642 --> 00:20:37,362
How many strokes will you be beaten

445
00:20:37,642 --> 00:20:38,642
and how far will you be exiled?

446
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,602
Such a heavy meal in the morning?

447
00:20:59,602 --> 00:21:01,482
Isn't it too much?

448
00:21:01,482 --> 00:21:02,642
It's normal for pregnant women
to have these.

449
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:03,801
Eat the dishes
while they are warm.

450
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:07,041
I think you haven't
had your breakfast yet, right?

451
00:21:07,401 --> 00:21:08,281
Let's eat together.

452
00:21:08,362 --> 00:21:09,161
Do me a favor, please.

453
00:21:10,242 --> 00:21:10,681
Well.

454
00:21:11,242 --> 00:21:12,642
First of all, try this out.

455
00:21:14,722 --> 00:21:16,681
This is the stir-fried bee pupae.

456
00:21:19,842 --> 00:21:20,561
Don't you like it?

457
00:21:20,962 --> 00:21:21,801
What about this?

458
00:21:22,401 --> 00:21:24,161
The candied sweet bee pupae.

459
00:21:26,321 --> 00:21:27,161
Or this one?

460
00:21:28,401 --> 00:21:30,081
The sauteed bee pupae.

461
00:21:30,801 --> 00:21:33,122
The point isn't about
the cooking styles.

462
00:21:33,522 --> 00:21:34,762
I just don't like bee pupae.

463
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:35,842
How could that be?

464
00:21:36,002 --> 00:21:37,722
I got stung badly by bees

465
00:21:38,081 --> 00:21:39,201
foraging for these pupae.

466
00:21:39,522 --> 00:21:40,842
My butt is still...

467
00:21:44,642 --> 00:21:45,321
Pei Yanzhen.

468
00:21:46,002 --> 00:21:47,281
You better explain this.

469
00:21:52,002 --> 00:21:52,522
Miao.

470
00:21:53,522 --> 00:21:54,201
Have a taste of this.

471
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,161
Shredded radish is not healthy.

472
00:21:59,642 --> 00:22:00,522
Try this out.

473
00:22:01,281 --> 00:22:02,482
The deep-friend bee pupae.

474
00:22:02,762 --> 00:22:04,081
It might look unappealing,

475
00:22:04,081 --> 00:22:05,321
but it is delicious.

476
00:22:05,321 --> 00:22:05,882
Try it.

477
00:22:08,681 --> 00:22:09,201
Miaomiao.

478
00:22:10,161 --> 00:22:10,722
Miaomiao.

479
00:22:11,561 --> 00:22:12,002
What's wrong?

480
00:22:13,561 --> 00:22:14,201
I'm full.

481
00:22:14,362 --> 00:22:15,002
You eat it yourself.

482
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:16,602
You haven't eaten anything yet.

483
00:22:18,482 --> 00:22:18,882
Miao.

484
00:22:18,882 --> 00:22:19,561
Are you all right?

485
00:22:20,681 --> 00:22:21,882
Is the food too oily?

486
00:22:23,762 --> 00:22:24,681
What do you like to eat?

487
00:22:26,321 --> 00:22:27,122
Stir-fried cabbage with sour sauce.

488
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:29,161
Cabbage leaves aren't good.

489
00:22:30,002 --> 00:22:30,482
Miao.

490
00:22:31,201 --> 00:22:32,281
I will make it for you.

491
00:22:36,281 --> 00:22:36,801
Pei Yanzhen.

492
00:22:38,882 --> 00:22:40,321
You devious fox.

493
00:22:41,081 --> 00:22:41,602
Miaomiao.

494
00:22:43,201 --> 00:22:45,642
He asked me to wear this color

495
00:22:46,401 --> 00:22:49,002
and prepare the bee pupae dishes.

496
00:22:49,482 --> 00:22:50,602
Yet it's him again

497
00:22:51,401 --> 00:22:52,642
fawning over you now.

498
00:22:53,281 --> 00:22:54,201
He's so despicable.

499
00:22:54,362 --> 00:22:55,161
Shame on him.

500
00:22:55,921 --> 00:22:57,321
Pei Yanzhen prefers mild taste.

501
00:22:57,321 --> 00:22:58,401
There's no way he could know
about those dishes.

502
00:22:58,401 --> 00:22:59,441
You must be kidding.

503
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:05,161
Miao likes beautiful things.

504
00:23:05,882 --> 00:23:08,161
Her favorite color is purple

505
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:09,921
and her favorite dish

506
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:11,362
is bee pupae.

507
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:12,882
You may

508
00:23:13,482 --> 00:23:14,401
have a try on it.

509
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:17,362
Are you

510
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:19,842
(Conscience)
really that kind?

511
00:23:21,642 --> 00:23:22,561
You will never know

512
00:23:23,642 --> 00:23:24,561
if you never try.

513
00:23:41,522 --> 00:23:42,201
Give me a second.

514
00:23:42,962 --> 00:23:43,842
The dish is almost ready.

515
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:48,321
How do you always recognize me

516
00:23:48,681 --> 00:23:49,882
when I'm behind you?

517
00:23:50,561 --> 00:23:52,002
I can recognize the sound
of your footsteps.

518
00:24:12,681 --> 00:24:13,281
Have a taste.

519
00:24:33,401 --> 00:24:36,962
Your sweat will fall into the plate.

520
00:24:40,561 --> 00:24:41,242
(Miao.)

521
00:24:44,122 --> 00:24:45,561
I got to go now.

522
00:24:46,321 --> 00:24:47,002
Thanks for the dish.

523
00:24:53,522 --> 00:24:54,242
Miao.

524
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,321
Did you steal this dish?

525
00:24:58,561 --> 00:24:59,561
Why are you hiding it?

526
00:25:00,722 --> 00:25:02,441
Because of that two annoying guys.

527
00:25:03,161 --> 00:25:04,482
They are doing it

528
00:25:04,882 --> 00:25:06,002
to help you take care of your baby.

529
00:25:06,561 --> 00:25:07,522
Take care of my baby?

530
00:25:07,801 --> 00:25:09,281
Are you sure?

531
00:25:09,281 --> 00:25:10,681
They give me a mood swing instead.

532
00:25:11,242 --> 00:25:12,041
I reckon

533
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:13,561
this baby is going to be scared off

534
00:25:13,561 --> 00:25:14,882
from my tummy later.

535
00:25:18,482 --> 00:25:19,041
Well.

536
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:21,041
These two guys come here so often.

537
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:22,002
I wonder who

538
00:25:22,002 --> 00:25:23,362
the baby will be like?

539
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:24,681
Gosh, no.

540
00:25:25,762 --> 00:25:27,882
I've landed myself to marry
two frail fellows.

541
00:25:27,962 --> 00:25:28,882
If the baby

542
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:31,041
takes after him who can't
lift heavy things,

543
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:33,201
binge drinking and goes to brothels,

544
00:25:33,882 --> 00:25:35,561
I will live in despair

545
00:25:35,561 --> 00:25:36,801
for rest of my life.

546
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,281
The baby can't take after Song Xiyuan

547
00:25:39,681 --> 00:25:41,921
who is a smooth talker.

548
00:25:42,801 --> 00:25:43,362
This baby

549
00:25:43,561 --> 00:25:45,002
belongs to the Shen family.

550
00:25:45,321 --> 00:25:46,242
None of their characters
will rub off on my baby.

551
00:25:46,561 --> 00:25:47,041
All right.

552
00:25:47,522 --> 00:25:48,201
The baby won't look like
either of them.

553
00:25:48,441 --> 00:25:49,002
As if!

554
00:25:52,016 --> 00:25:52,962
Aunt.

555
00:25:53,362 --> 00:25:54,362
To offer the best care
to the baby,

556
00:25:54,681 --> 00:25:56,681
let's not just stay at home.

557
00:25:57,242 --> 00:25:58,041
We can go out and get some fresh air.

558
00:25:59,561 --> 00:26:02,561
The baby is due soon.

559
00:26:02,801 --> 00:26:04,242
Let's hang out tomorrow.

560
00:26:04,801 --> 00:26:06,722
The weather is getting hot now.

561
00:26:06,722 --> 00:26:08,362
The baby is due soon.

562
00:26:08,921 --> 00:26:09,561
Now,

563
00:26:09,561 --> 00:26:10,561
the weather is getting hot.

564
00:26:10,882 --> 00:26:13,041
I'm sure that fewer people go hang out
around the lake.

565
00:26:13,561 --> 00:26:15,522
Let's visit Quan Lake.

566
00:26:15,522 --> 00:26:16,041
What do you say?

567
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:17,441
Fine, go as you wish.

568
00:26:18,242 --> 00:26:19,561
As long as you take care of yourself.

569
00:26:20,242 --> 00:26:20,722
All right.

570
00:26:20,722 --> 00:26:21,401
I know.

571
00:26:21,921 --> 00:26:22,561
I'm heading back.

572
00:26:22,561 --> 00:26:24,041
The stir-fried cabbage with sour sauce
is going to cool off.

573
00:26:26,561 --> 00:26:27,041
Lvying.

574
00:26:27,522 --> 00:26:28,522
Tell them

575
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,201
I'm tired

576
00:26:30,201 --> 00:26:31,441
and I need some rest.

577
00:26:31,801 --> 00:26:32,762
So, I'll leave them.

578
00:26:33,722 --> 00:26:34,201
Yes.

579
00:26:37,561 --> 00:26:39,201
Ah, stir-fried cabbage with sour sauce.

580
00:26:39,362 --> 00:26:40,281
The appetite for sour food

581
00:26:41,401 --> 00:26:42,441
signifies a boy.

582
00:26:45,962 --> 00:26:47,401
Feather duster.

583
00:26:48,882 --> 00:26:49,561
Have a look.

584
00:26:51,161 --> 00:26:52,762
Windmill toy.

585
00:26:56,561 --> 00:26:58,962
Come on. Take a look.

586
00:27:09,522 --> 00:27:11,921
We've visited almost every corner.

587
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:13,681
Miaomiao.

588
00:27:13,681 --> 00:27:14,561
Are you tired?

589
00:27:15,561 --> 00:27:16,201
Yes, a bit.

590
00:27:17,722 --> 00:27:19,041
Let's take a rest here.

591
00:27:19,962 --> 00:27:21,041
It's bright over here.

592
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,281
Aunt.

593
00:27:22,561 --> 00:27:23,441
Let's go over there

594
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:24,921
to sit in the shades.

595
00:27:25,522 --> 00:27:26,041
Sure.

596
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:26,522
Let's go.

597
00:27:26,522 --> 00:27:27,522
Kite.

598
00:27:28,921 --> 00:27:30,842
Kites for sale.

599
00:27:30,842 --> 00:27:31,921
Flowery cloth.

600
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:32,681
Miaomiao.

601
00:27:32,681 --> 00:27:33,842
Do you fancy anything to eat?

602
00:27:37,482 --> 00:27:38,561
Soybean pudding.

603
00:27:39,242 --> 00:27:39,801
Aunt.

604
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:42,242
Let's go to the temple for some tea.

605
00:27:42,722 --> 00:27:43,041
All right.

606
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:44,161
Soybean pudding.

607
00:28:10,962 --> 00:28:12,801
Are you all right, Miaomiao?

608
00:28:12,801 --> 00:28:13,401
Miss.

609
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:13,801
Sir.

610
00:28:13,801 --> 00:28:14,681
I'm so sorry.

611
00:28:14,681 --> 00:28:15,321
It's great that you're all right.

612
00:28:15,321 --> 00:28:16,161
Sure.

613
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:18,561
Are you all right, Miss Shen?

614
00:28:19,561 --> 00:28:20,561
Guard Zhan.

615
00:28:21,401 --> 00:28:23,002
You're skilled, Guard Zhan.

616
00:28:23,561 --> 00:28:24,722
Thank you for saving her.

617
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:26,441
Why are you here?

618
00:28:28,321 --> 00:28:29,762
I'm making rounds here.

619
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:30,762
I'm on guard duty.

620
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:31,842
No need to thank me.

621
00:28:32,401 --> 00:28:33,762
Miss Shen, you're carrying a baby.

622
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:35,321
You ought to be careful.

623
00:28:36,362 --> 00:28:37,522
(Catch the thief!)

624
00:28:38,561 --> 00:28:39,561
(Don't run, thief!)

625
00:28:42,882 --> 00:28:44,242
I didn't know

626
00:28:44,242 --> 00:28:46,242
Guard Zhan could be so skillful.

627
00:28:47,962 --> 00:28:49,201
He's agile,

628
00:28:49,321 --> 00:28:50,201
kindhearted,

629
00:28:50,561 --> 00:28:51,762
speaks only the truth

630
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:53,801
and acts justly.

631
00:28:54,161 --> 00:28:55,321
He's indeed a hero.

632
00:29:07,561 --> 00:29:10,561
Zhan Yue is the subordinate
of Official Pei.

633
00:29:10,842 --> 00:29:12,081
Are you planning to poach him?

634
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:13,561
Yes.

635
00:29:15,041 --> 00:29:17,201
Guard Zhan possesses excellent skills

636
00:29:17,842 --> 00:29:19,321
and he's honest

637
00:29:19,321 --> 00:29:20,681
unlike the scheming scholars.

638
00:29:21,522 --> 00:29:23,242
If I get to see him every day,

639
00:29:23,522 --> 00:29:25,722
watch him practice martial arts skills

640
00:29:26,441 --> 00:29:28,882
and chat with him about fun stories
in the martial arts world,

641
00:29:29,441 --> 00:29:31,921
it will be a good influence

642
00:29:31,921 --> 00:29:33,002
on the baby.

643
00:29:34,081 --> 00:29:35,161
I see, you're thinking about that.

644
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,081
It'll be great

645
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:37,882
for what you dream of.

646
00:29:38,362 --> 00:29:40,602
But I think Guard Zhan is a loyal man

647
00:29:41,161 --> 00:29:42,801
who wouldn't want to serve two masters.

648
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,602
I don't think he will accept
your request.

649
00:29:45,842 --> 00:29:46,522
If so, that justifies

650
00:29:46,522 --> 00:29:48,002
my good assessment of people.

651
00:29:48,561 --> 00:29:50,321
What if Official Pei doesn't allow this?

652
00:29:51,561 --> 00:29:53,161
It's nothing to be worried about.

653
00:29:53,762 --> 00:29:56,362
After all, Pei Yanzhen is my ex-husband

654
00:29:56,602 --> 00:29:58,041
as well as my uncle.

655
00:29:58,561 --> 00:30:00,561
I guess he will give me a pass.

656
00:30:04,921 --> 00:30:06,201
Baby brain.

657
00:30:06,882 --> 00:30:08,161
Walk slowly. Wait for me.

658
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:13,081
Candied fruit.

659
00:30:15,962 --> 00:30:17,002
Guard Zhan.

660
00:30:17,522 --> 00:30:19,401
Miss Shen would like to recruit you

661
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:20,201
as the guard.

662
00:30:24,201 --> 00:30:24,722
Guard Zhan.

663
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:26,362
What's your response?
Please say something.

664
00:30:29,081 --> 00:30:29,842
Double pay.

665
00:30:34,441 --> 00:30:34,962
Quadruple.

666
00:30:35,281 --> 00:30:35,801
What do you say?

667
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:38,882
Quadruple?

668
00:30:40,482 --> 00:30:41,161
Seriously?

669
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:49,041
Forget it.

670
00:30:50,002 --> 00:30:50,762
The five-year contract

671
00:30:50,762 --> 00:30:51,561
hasn't ended yet.

672
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:55,602
Ladies.

673
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:56,602
I shall

674
00:30:57,201 --> 00:30:57,921
take my leave.

675
00:31:03,281 --> 00:31:04,281
Five years?

676
00:31:11,321 --> 00:31:11,882
Miss.

677
00:31:11,962 --> 00:31:13,681
Let's not go near the lake.

678
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:14,801
We take the longer route.

679
00:31:18,681 --> 00:31:19,281
Miss.

680
00:31:19,801 --> 00:31:20,321
Look.

681
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:23,722
When was the fence installed?

682
00:31:26,161 --> 00:31:27,002
Don't you know about this?

683
00:31:27,441 --> 00:31:28,281
A few days ago,

684
00:31:28,401 --> 00:31:30,762
a pregnant woman almost fell.

685
00:31:31,561 --> 00:31:33,762
Thanks to
the understanding Magistrate Pei

686
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:36,561
who funded the fence installation.

687
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:38,401
He's so kind.

688
00:31:40,401 --> 00:31:41,281
Pei Yanzhen?

689
00:31:41,281 --> 00:31:42,561
I have one kite left.

690
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:46,161
I would like to give it to the baby
inside your tummy.

691
00:31:47,201 --> 00:31:49,201
Is it really okay?

692
00:31:50,482 --> 00:31:52,242
I'm cheered up at the thought of

693
00:31:52,762 --> 00:31:55,041
having a local magistrate who concerns
with the well-being of the people

694
00:31:55,762 --> 00:31:57,842
when seeing the newly installed fence.

695
00:31:58,441 --> 00:31:59,041
This...

696
00:31:59,882 --> 00:32:00,561
Just take it.

697
00:32:00,882 --> 00:32:01,681
Don't be shy.

698
00:32:03,441 --> 00:32:04,002
If so,

699
00:32:04,002 --> 00:32:05,401
thank you so much, sir.

700
00:32:36,561 --> 00:32:39,401
I thought Warrior Zhan
would give his reply today.

701
00:32:40,242 --> 00:32:41,602
How come there's no sign of him

702
00:32:41,602 --> 00:32:43,321
until now?

703
00:33:24,722 --> 00:33:25,281
Miao.

704
00:33:27,242 --> 00:33:27,681
I'm fine.

705
00:33:27,762 --> 00:33:28,561
I'm fine.

706
00:33:31,201 --> 00:33:31,921
(Did I eat too much)

707
00:33:31,921 --> 00:33:34,161
(of the stir-fried cabbage
with sour sauce recently?)

708
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:35,801
(The sourness seeps into me,)

709
00:33:35,801 --> 00:33:36,561
(disturbing my mind)

710
00:33:37,642 --> 00:33:38,321
(and thought.)

711
00:33:38,561 --> 00:33:40,242
(Gosh, I can't get rid of it.)

712
00:33:42,002 --> 00:33:42,801
(Get a grip.)

713
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:43,921
(Come on.)

714
00:33:46,842 --> 00:33:48,602
Miao, are you waiting for someone?

715
00:33:51,482 --> 00:33:52,722
You come at the right time.

716
00:33:52,882 --> 00:33:54,281
I have something to discuss with you.

717
00:34:05,681 --> 00:34:06,882
If it's about Zhan Yue,

718
00:34:07,321 --> 00:34:08,242
no need to say anymore.

719
00:34:09,522 --> 00:34:10,161
Why?

720
00:34:11,201 --> 00:34:13,841
Do you recruit him at a high price
to express your gratitude?

721
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:16,762
Not only that.

722
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:19,042
I wish to see Warrior Zhan
every day too.

723
00:34:19,322 --> 00:34:20,282
Every day?

724
00:34:20,681 --> 00:34:21,161
Yes.

725
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,282
Just to see him?

726
00:34:22,762 --> 00:34:23,242
Of course.

727
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:26,201
Good.

728
00:34:26,921 --> 00:34:27,562
Miao.

729
00:34:27,962 --> 00:34:28,762
As expected of you.

730
00:34:30,441 --> 00:34:33,042
However, I don't think you can get him.

731
00:34:34,082 --> 00:34:36,002
Zhan Yue is different from others.

732
00:34:37,401 --> 00:34:38,361
What's the difference?

733
00:34:39,482 --> 00:34:40,921
Zhan Yue and I know each other
for long

734
00:34:41,522 --> 00:34:43,042
and we are very close.

735
00:34:43,722 --> 00:34:45,482
But if you insist to recruit him,

736
00:34:45,962 --> 00:34:48,082
there's still a way to do so.

737
00:34:49,441 --> 00:34:50,121
Care to share?

738
00:34:51,161 --> 00:34:52,161
If you start to grow the desire

739
00:34:52,681 --> 00:34:56,282
to meet me every day,

740
00:34:56,722 --> 00:34:58,322
I will negotiate your request
with Zhan Yue.

741
00:35:00,802 --> 00:35:02,802
Official Pei, you have an evil heart

742
00:35:03,042 --> 00:35:04,601
behind that angel face.

743
00:35:07,082 --> 00:35:08,082
Thanks for your compliment.

744
00:35:08,601 --> 00:35:09,722
Shameless.

745
00:35:10,082 --> 00:35:10,921
You flatter me.

746
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:11,881
You!

747
00:35:13,681 --> 00:35:15,002
I just want you

748
00:35:16,802 --> 00:35:17,641
to focus

749
00:35:18,522 --> 00:35:19,361
on me,

750
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:20,802
am I wrong?

751
00:35:41,921 --> 00:35:43,522
Though I have no guts to stand out
against him, I can run off anyway.

752
00:35:43,802 --> 00:35:45,482
What a relief

753
00:35:46,002 --> 00:35:47,201
without Pei Yanzhen here.

754
00:35:47,881 --> 00:35:49,762
Luckily, you went out
early in the morning.

755
00:35:50,401 --> 00:35:50,921
Look at there.

756
00:35:52,841 --> 00:35:53,841
It's moving.

757
00:35:53,962 --> 00:35:55,762
No, it's not.

758
00:35:55,881 --> 00:35:56,722
Be patient.

759
00:35:56,722 --> 00:35:57,201
Miss.

760
00:35:57,921 --> 00:35:58,681
Got it.

761
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:01,921
She got a fish.

762
00:36:02,282 --> 00:36:02,641
Look.

763
00:36:03,641 --> 00:36:04,562
Do as usual.

764
00:36:04,841 --> 00:36:05,722
Set it free.

765
00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:06,322
Sure.

766
00:36:06,322 --> 00:36:07,002
Fish rods of the old fellows

767
00:36:07,201 --> 00:36:07,921
aren't moving though.

768
00:36:09,242 --> 00:36:10,002
Miss.

769
00:36:10,482 --> 00:36:12,441
You are a beauty with good skills

770
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,242
and a kind heart.

771
00:36:15,242 --> 00:36:16,002
You flatter me.

772
00:36:21,802 --> 00:36:22,482
Let's see.

773
00:36:24,841 --> 00:36:25,881
In this early morning,

774
00:36:26,282 --> 00:36:27,522
are you here fishing

775
00:36:27,522 --> 00:36:28,401
or feeding?

776
00:36:30,841 --> 00:36:31,841
Isn't it troublesome

777
00:36:32,201 --> 00:36:33,562
to feed fish like this?

778
00:36:36,562 --> 00:36:37,762
Not at all.

779
00:36:38,282 --> 00:36:39,161
I'm pleased to do so.

780
00:36:39,841 --> 00:36:40,401
Why?

781
00:36:40,921 --> 00:36:42,282
Judging by your tone,

782
00:36:42,762 --> 00:36:44,082
you seem to possess
excellent fishing skills.

783
00:36:44,562 --> 00:36:46,921
You can display your skills before me.

784
00:36:49,482 --> 00:36:50,361
If so,

785
00:36:50,681 --> 00:36:51,722
I will take up your challenge.

786
00:36:52,282 --> 00:36:52,841
Fine.

787
00:36:53,242 --> 00:36:55,242
I will compete with you.

788
00:37:04,401 --> 00:37:05,522
It's just a small game.

789
00:37:06,161 --> 00:37:06,841
Bring it on.

790
00:37:15,242 --> 00:37:19,562
- Long live the Empress Dowager.
- Long live the Empress Dowager.

791
00:37:23,802 --> 00:37:24,841
At ease.

792
00:37:25,441 --> 00:37:26,681
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

793
00:37:30,282 --> 00:37:31,201
(Puzhao Temple)
Song Xiyuan.

794
00:37:32,082 --> 00:37:34,522
Are you in charge of welcoming
my arrival?

795
00:37:36,361 --> 00:37:37,762
I find

796
00:37:37,962 --> 00:37:39,441
that the dock

797
00:37:40,002 --> 00:37:41,641
looks so well-furnished now.

798
00:37:43,242 --> 00:37:43,962
Your Highness.

799
00:37:44,601 --> 00:37:46,322
Shen family provided the fund

800
00:37:46,601 --> 00:37:48,242
to renovate the dock and official roads.

801
00:37:48,681 --> 00:37:49,482
Shen family should take the credit

802
00:37:49,921 --> 00:37:51,802
in this regard.

803
00:37:53,962 --> 00:37:55,681
As expected of the Shen family.

804
00:37:55,962 --> 00:37:58,002
You are loyal.

805
00:37:58,002 --> 00:37:59,482
You flatter me.

806
00:38:01,482 --> 00:38:02,522
In that case,

807
00:38:03,242 --> 00:38:05,042
I will have the Shen family

808
00:38:05,042 --> 00:38:06,921
accompany me to visit
my old residence here.

809
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:07,641
Yes.

810
00:38:12,441 --> 00:38:13,841
It has been a really long time
since I last came.

811
00:38:14,562 --> 00:38:16,201
I'm feeling ill at ease now.

812
00:38:18,282 --> 00:38:20,522
I wish His Majesty were here,

813
00:38:21,002 --> 00:38:23,201
in my thriving hometown,

814
00:38:23,722 --> 00:38:25,441
but he had to stay in the capital.

815
00:38:29,082 --> 00:38:29,841
Since it's a competition,

816
00:38:30,121 --> 00:38:30,881
it will be more fun

817
00:38:31,201 --> 00:38:32,401
to wager on something.

818
00:38:35,361 --> 00:38:36,002
Sure.

819
00:38:36,322 --> 00:38:37,201
How much is your stake?

820
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:39,242
I'm not wagering on money,

821
00:38:39,482 --> 00:38:40,282
but one answer.

822
00:38:42,962 --> 00:38:43,802
If you lose,

823
00:38:44,161 --> 00:38:45,722
answer one question from me.

824
00:38:48,361 --> 00:38:49,762
What if I win?

825
00:38:51,881 --> 00:38:52,881
If you win,

826
00:38:53,401 --> 00:38:54,482
I will go easy on you.

827
00:38:55,762 --> 00:38:57,242
Do you mean I have
to appreciate your mercy?

828
00:38:57,562 --> 00:38:58,242
No need.

829
00:38:59,002 --> 00:38:59,601
Let's start.

830
00:39:00,201 --> 00:39:00,802
Sir.

831
00:39:00,962 --> 00:39:01,962
Please be our witness.

832
00:39:02,762 --> 00:39:04,361
Sure.

833
00:39:04,802 --> 00:39:05,361
By the way,

834
00:39:05,522 --> 00:39:06,121
we have once

835
00:39:06,361 --> 00:39:08,242
been engaged.

836
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:09,161
Pardon?

837
00:39:09,482 --> 00:39:10,441
Well, let's start.

838
00:39:14,042 --> 00:39:14,681
Sir,

839
00:39:14,921 --> 00:39:15,881
may I have your fish rod?

840
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:18,042
Sure. I have confidence in you.

841
00:39:29,441 --> 00:39:31,082
Luckily, the marriage didn't work out.

842
00:39:31,441 --> 00:39:32,161
This fellow

843
00:39:32,802 --> 00:39:33,762
is obnoxious.

844
00:39:45,361 --> 00:39:47,762
I let Miao's father
take the full credit this time.

845
00:39:48,082 --> 00:39:49,322
Don't you claim the credit

846
00:39:50,242 --> 00:39:51,441
when Miaomiao asks about this.

847
00:39:52,641 --> 00:39:53,121
Rest assured.

848
00:39:54,522 --> 00:39:55,681
Please have some trust

849
00:39:55,841 --> 00:39:57,121
on me, Master Song.

850
00:40:04,522 --> 00:40:05,002
Sir.

851
00:40:15,322 --> 00:40:16,322
Didn't Empress Dowager say

852
00:40:17,441 --> 00:40:18,361
His Majesty is in the capital?

853
00:40:18,962 --> 00:40:19,522
Yes.

854
00:40:19,962 --> 00:40:21,282
She said it in front of everyone.

855
00:40:21,802 --> 00:40:22,522
Miao's father was there too.

856
00:40:23,881 --> 00:40:24,401
Oh, no!

857
00:40:25,121 --> 00:40:25,641
Zhan Yue.

858
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:26,641
Go to Shen's Residence

859
00:40:27,002 --> 00:40:28,161
to check on Miao's whereabouts.

860
00:40:58,921 --> 00:40:59,522
Got it.

861
00:41:00,681 --> 00:41:01,441
She got it.

862
00:41:01,441 --> 00:41:02,002
Miss.

863
00:41:06,361 --> 00:41:07,441
What happened?

864
00:41:09,802 --> 00:41:10,601
You pulled a trick.

865
00:41:11,641 --> 00:41:13,242
All of us standing here would've seen it

866
00:41:13,522 --> 00:41:15,762
if the young man

867
00:41:16,082 --> 00:41:16,962
had thrown a stone

868
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:18,722
at your bait.

869
00:41:19,242 --> 00:41:21,482
I feel sorry for you too.

870
00:41:22,282 --> 00:41:24,361
Maybe it was the children
from the opposite of the lake

871
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:26,522
skipping stones and
accidentally hitting your bait.

872
00:41:26,962 --> 00:41:29,201
Never mind. A woman who's bearing a baby

873
00:41:29,401 --> 00:41:30,522
is as well bearing a generous heart.

874
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:38,962
Got it.

875
00:41:40,522 --> 00:41:41,522
You are amazing.

876
00:41:41,681 --> 00:41:42,201
Yes.

877
00:41:42,762 --> 00:41:44,282
Sir, you won.

878
00:41:45,121 --> 00:41:45,841
Do you mind helping me to take it?

879
00:41:50,082 --> 00:41:51,361
You lost.

880
00:41:53,641 --> 00:41:54,201
Gentlemen,

881
00:41:54,641 --> 00:41:56,681
we have a bet to talk about now.

882
00:41:57,082 --> 00:41:58,242
Please give us some space.

883
00:42:01,002 --> 00:42:01,641
Let's go.

884
00:42:01,641 --> 00:42:02,282
Come on.

885
00:42:10,841 --> 00:42:12,681
I wonder what your question is.

886
00:42:15,322 --> 00:42:17,242
May I ask who is the father

887
00:42:17,242 --> 00:42:18,282
