00:09:18,497 --> 00:09:21,016
that I actually healed myself
a few days later.

167
00:09:21,697 --> 00:09:22,416
Is that true?

168
00:09:25,937 --> 00:09:26,697
That's why

169
00:09:27,656 --> 00:09:31,057
you must put it on.

170
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,377
Whatever danger threatens you,

171
00:09:35,057 --> 00:09:36,697
it can get you back safely

172
00:09:37,057 --> 00:09:38,057
and help you get through it.

173
00:09:41,697 --> 00:09:42,817
It is the capital.

174
00:09:43,576 --> 00:09:45,057
How could it become a danger?

175
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,057
It's like a living hell to be

176
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:51,896
with Her Highness and General Qin.

177
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,016
Pei Yanzhen,

178
00:09:56,617 --> 00:09:57,377
listen carefully.

179
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:01,177
I don't ask for a luxurious life.

180
00:10:02,377 --> 00:10:05,137
I just want you to stay by my side.

181
00:10:07,057 --> 00:10:07,937
You have to know

182
00:10:09,177 --> 00:10:10,016
that whenever it is,

183
00:10:11,057 --> 00:10:12,697
one's life is the most important thing.

184
00:10:17,497 --> 00:10:18,137
I promise you

185
00:10:20,137 --> 00:10:21,297
I'll return safely.

186
00:10:37,776 --> 00:10:39,016
Come, give it to me.

187
00:10:40,177 --> 00:10:40,656
Hold it tight.

188
00:10:43,137 --> 00:10:43,817
Slow down.

189
00:10:45,737 --> 00:10:46,336
Miao,

190
00:10:47,016 --> 00:10:48,497
this is a business trip.

191
00:10:48,896 --> 00:10:49,857
It's not that I'm moving.

192
00:10:51,297 --> 00:10:52,416
That'd be great if you were moving.

193
00:10:52,737 --> 00:10:53,656
You can bring me along with you.

194
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:58,057
The cushion can relieve back pain
due to the long journey.

195
00:10:58,776 --> 00:10:59,377
Also,

196
00:10:59,377 --> 00:11:00,377
the road is bumpy.

197
00:11:00,377 --> 00:11:02,297
Don't spend all the time reading.
It's bad for the eyes.

198
00:11:03,177 --> 00:11:04,177
As for the food,

199
00:11:04,617 --> 00:11:05,617
it's for your supper

200
00:11:05,817 --> 00:11:06,817
as you always stay up late.

201
00:11:07,177 --> 00:11:08,896
I pick them myself.

202
00:11:08,896 --> 00:11:10,857
It's all your favorite stuff
you always use.

203
00:11:11,257 --> 00:11:12,817
Don't be ungrateful.

204
00:11:15,016 --> 00:11:16,857
You're such a virtuous
and beautiful wife.

205
00:11:17,656 --> 00:11:18,377
I'm grateful

206
00:11:18,857 --> 00:11:20,377
to have you as my wife.

207
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:24,016
It doesn't sound like a compliment.

208
00:11:24,536 --> 00:11:25,257
Come, give it to me.

209
00:11:26,776 --> 00:11:27,697
It's a compliment.

210
00:11:28,857 --> 00:11:30,057
It's just because I'm ineloquent.

211
00:11:32,536 --> 00:11:33,576
After arriving in the capital,

212
00:11:34,177 --> 00:11:35,257
you must get more rest.

213
00:11:35,817 --> 00:11:36,656
Don't push yourself too hard.

214
00:11:37,617 --> 00:11:39,976
Her Highness and His Majesty are
used to eating delicacies.

215
00:11:40,297 --> 00:11:41,416
Just make something common will do.

216
00:11:41,937 --> 00:11:42,576
Also,

217
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:45,297
you promised you'll be back soon.

218
00:11:45,976 --> 00:11:48,137
You must practice
what you preach, got it?

219
00:11:53,737 --> 00:11:55,896
With this hairpin as the proof,
I'll be back soon.

220
00:11:57,096 --> 00:11:59,377
When did you buy it?
Put it on for me.

221
00:12:02,576 --> 00:12:03,617
I saw it a few days ago.

222
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:06,216
I thought it's pretty
that it'd fit you.

223
00:12:06,857 --> 00:12:07,617
So I bought it.

224
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:10,257
How is it? Do I look good?

225
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:15,697
It fits you perfectly,

226
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:17,297
like the peach blossom.

227
00:12:20,456 --> 00:12:21,297
You look gorgeous.

228
00:12:26,016 --> 00:12:26,896
With this hairpin as the proof,

229
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:28,697
you must return safely.

230
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,336
Congratulations, Father.
The prey falls for it.

231
00:12:34,656 --> 00:12:36,096
All we need is your command.

232
00:12:37,137 --> 00:12:38,656
What's the situation in Lingzhou?

233
00:12:39,497 --> 00:12:42,297
Pei Yanzhen is busy flirting
with Shen Miao.

234
00:12:42,297 --> 00:12:43,536
He's wasted.

235
00:12:44,057 --> 00:12:46,177
He just bade farewell to Shen Miao.

236
00:12:46,697 --> 00:12:48,896
He'll arrive in the capital soon.

237
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,456
Pei Yanzhen left Lingzhou.

238
00:12:53,617 --> 00:12:55,137
Shen Qian went to the Western Regions.

239
00:12:55,497 --> 00:12:58,937
This is the best chance for us
to deal with the Shen family.

240
00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:02,096
Father, you're saying...

241
00:13:02,817 --> 00:13:04,737
After the Emperor and Pei Yanzhen die,

242
00:13:05,096 --> 00:13:07,336
I'll have a strong army
and great fortune.

243
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:10,416
It'll be easy for me
to obtain the empire.

244
00:13:11,576 --> 00:13:14,257
You have to let Shen Miao live.

245
00:13:14,656 --> 00:13:17,216
So we can account for Song Xiyuan.

246
00:13:17,617 --> 00:13:19,336
You can do whatever
you want with the rest.

247
00:13:20,297 --> 00:13:22,016
But Song Xiyuan has a glib tongue.

248
00:13:22,377 --> 00:13:23,776
It's really hateful.

249
00:13:26,697 --> 00:13:29,216
I know that you don't like him.

250
00:13:29,937 --> 00:13:32,137
But we still need his help now.

251
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:33,497
When everything is settled,

252
00:13:33,776 --> 00:13:36,016
he'll be at your disposal.

253
00:13:38,497 --> 00:13:39,336
Yes, Father.

254
00:13:41,377 --> 00:13:43,497
But everything went too well.

255
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:45,377
I don't feel right about it.

256
00:13:46,497 --> 00:13:48,377
You should make a run
to Lingzhou.

257
00:13:48,776 --> 00:13:49,416
And I

258
00:13:49,536 --> 00:13:50,737
have to enter the palace.

259
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:59,257
(With this hairpin as the proof,
I'll be back soon.)

260
00:14:11,576 --> 00:14:13,016
Miaomiao doesn't want me anymore.

261
00:14:13,377 --> 00:14:14,737
Miaomiao.

262
00:14:19,096 --> 00:14:19,697
Miss.

263
00:14:22,057 --> 00:14:23,216
Miss, does your foot hurt again?

264
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,697
I'm fine. It's all because of it.

265
00:14:26,377 --> 00:14:27,937
It has the same personality
with Third Master Song.

266
00:14:29,617 --> 00:14:30,737
This aggrieved look of it is

267
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:32,576
indeed a lot like Third Master Song.

268
00:14:46,617 --> 00:14:47,216
Xiao Fu,

269
00:14:47,937 --> 00:14:49,857
with the fuss
that Vice General Qin has made,

270
00:14:49,857 --> 00:14:50,656
where is she going?

271
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:51,817
Third Master,

272
00:14:51,976 --> 00:14:53,137
I'm just a janitor.

273
00:14:53,257 --> 00:14:54,497
How would I dare to spy on them?

274
00:14:54,617 --> 00:14:56,576
But I heard them talking
about something

275
00:14:57,257 --> 00:14:58,937
like Lingzhou
or the Shen family.

276
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:10,497
Come in, Mother.

277
00:15:25,697 --> 00:15:26,776
A little boy like you

278
00:15:27,336 --> 00:15:29,216
shouldn't waste your time on this.

279
00:15:30,776 --> 00:15:32,737
It's a sunny day
and the breeze is warm.

280
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:35,177
Let's go fly kites.

281
00:15:40,737 --> 00:15:43,336
Mother, your foot is injured.

282
00:15:43,536 --> 00:15:46,776
Don't run around
and cause trouble to me.

283
00:15:47,617 --> 00:15:50,737
Mother, Great-uncle is proficient
in Chinese Classics,

284
00:15:50,737 --> 00:15:51,857
and he worked as an official.

285
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:56,177
From now on, you have
to clean up your act

286
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,776
and study hard.

287
00:15:58,336 --> 00:16:02,137
So you can have
a harmonious life with Great-uncle.

288
00:16:09,737 --> 00:16:12,617
Do not be afraid

289
00:16:13,336 --> 00:16:17,096
of going against

290
00:16:17,497 --> 00:16:19,257
the old leading officials.

291
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:20,656
What does this mean?

292
00:16:24,857 --> 00:16:27,177
Mother, Great-uncle said

293
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:30,096
this proverb means not to be afraid

294
00:16:30,177 --> 00:16:33,016
of defying the wishes
of the old leading officials.

295
00:16:33,536 --> 00:16:35,257
It's adapted from...

296
00:16:43,257 --> 00:16:45,896
It's not enough
just to clean up your act.

297
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:49,697
You must study hard like Sun Jing
and Su Qin in ancient times.

298
00:16:50,737 --> 00:16:51,216
Well,

299
00:16:51,536 --> 00:16:53,776
even Pei Yanzhen didn't study hard
like them.

300
00:16:54,857 --> 00:16:56,377
What a traitorous son.

301
00:16:56,896 --> 00:16:58,137
What did he say before he left?

302
00:16:58,257 --> 00:16:59,257
What did he tell you?

303
00:16:59,776 --> 00:17:02,336
He said you got to be filial
and take care of me.

304
00:17:03,536 --> 00:17:04,017
I don't care.

305
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:05,777
I want to go out for fun today.

306
00:17:05,777 --> 00:17:06,456
You have to accompany me.

307
00:17:11,617 --> 00:17:12,096
You...

308
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:16,456
Brat!

309
00:17:16,657 --> 00:17:18,017
Is this how you treat your mother?

310
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,530
(Dream River Residence)

311
00:17:33,976 --> 00:17:34,696
Pei Yanzhen,

312
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:37,497
is this how you raise Xiao?

313
00:17:38,456 --> 00:17:39,497
When you come back,

314
00:17:39,497 --> 00:17:41,017
I'll settle this with you.

315
00:17:41,777 --> 00:17:42,336
Miss.

316
00:17:46,096 --> 00:17:47,096
Your foot hasn't recovered yet.

317
00:17:47,096 --> 00:17:47,976
Don't wander around.

318
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:48,936
Never mind.

319
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,777
What do you need to see me about?

320
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:52,657
There are two servants
from Pei family.

321
00:17:53,017 --> 00:17:55,696
They said the elders of the Pei family
haven't seen Master Xiao for so long.

322
00:17:55,897 --> 00:17:57,257
They want to pick him up
for a short stay.

323
00:17:57,537 --> 00:17:58,537
What do you think, Miss?

324
00:18:04,537 --> 00:18:05,257
Hold your hand out.

325
00:18:08,497 --> 00:18:09,417
Here, have some fish.

326
00:18:09,537 --> 00:18:10,336
Come, be nice.

327
00:18:10,336 --> 00:18:10,777
Here.

328
00:18:10,777 --> 00:18:11,497
Come, here.

329
00:18:11,976 --> 00:18:13,017
Eat some.

330
00:18:13,657 --> 00:18:16,096
Mother, I want my mother.

331
00:18:20,537 --> 00:18:21,537
This brat.

332
00:18:21,936 --> 00:18:22,857
You'll only appreciate

333
00:18:22,857 --> 00:18:24,897
your mother when you lose her.

334
00:18:26,017 --> 00:18:27,417
What did you say, Miss?

335
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:28,497
Do you allow him to go or not?

336
00:18:28,777 --> 00:18:29,377
Yes.

337
00:18:29,657 --> 00:18:30,377
Why not?

338
00:18:31,456 --> 00:18:32,497
The elders of the Pei family

339
00:18:32,497 --> 00:18:34,537
are kind of like Xiao's grandparents.

340
00:18:35,176 --> 00:18:36,777
Pei Yanzhen went to the capital.

341
00:18:37,137 --> 00:18:38,857
With Xiao around,

342
00:18:39,257 --> 00:18:40,777
I'm sure both of them will be excited.

343
00:18:41,176 --> 00:18:42,537
Just go pack his stuff.

344
00:18:42,857 --> 00:18:43,257
Noted.

345
00:18:44,216 --> 00:18:44,696
By the way,

346
00:18:45,017 --> 00:18:45,777
my leg is not yet healed

347
00:18:45,777 --> 00:18:47,017
after so many days.

348
00:18:47,017 --> 00:18:47,816
It'd be troublesome

349
00:18:47,816 --> 00:18:49,737
if I couldn't make it to the show
at the theater next month.

350
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:51,537
Go get me another physician.

351
00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:52,617
Noted.

352
00:19:14,857 --> 00:19:15,377
What's wrong?

353
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:17,777
Qin Miuzhen is leading the troop
to Lingzhou,

354
00:19:18,216 --> 00:19:19,017
going after the Shen family.

355
00:19:19,777 --> 00:19:20,897
You bring the army back
to Lingzhou

356
00:19:21,456 --> 00:19:22,017
to protect Miao.

357
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:25,336
But 2000 soldiers of the Qin family are
stationed at the palace.

358
00:19:25,617 --> 00:19:27,777
There are countless assassins
from Empress Dowager's faction.

359
00:19:28,137 --> 00:19:29,576
It's risky for you to take this trip.

360
00:19:29,897 --> 00:19:30,857
Now, you even want to send me back.

361
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,296
Isn't this suicidal?

362
00:19:32,897 --> 00:19:34,617
Don't worry. I have my own way.

363
00:19:35,576 --> 00:19:36,257
Way?

364
00:19:37,497 --> 00:19:38,336
What way do you have?

365
00:19:38,897 --> 00:19:40,657
Why must you offer yourself up to die?

366
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:44,017
If I fail,

367
00:19:44,696 --> 00:19:46,176
you can return to the martial arts world
and live freely.

368
00:19:46,497 --> 00:19:47,336
Isn't it better?

369
00:19:49,137 --> 00:19:50,056
Based on the current situation,

370
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:53,017
death is inevitable.

371
00:19:53,296 --> 00:19:54,737
I might as well kill you now.

372
00:19:55,137 --> 00:19:56,176
Isn't this what you wish for?

373
00:19:56,456 --> 00:19:57,936
What makes you think
you can kill me?

374
00:19:59,296 --> 00:20:00,816
Did you forget the bet
we had upon the completion

375
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:02,296
of my training?

376
00:20:04,857 --> 00:20:05,976
It was the root of all evil.

377
00:20:06,657 --> 00:20:07,456
Of course I remember.

378
00:20:31,657 --> 00:20:33,497
They say you're
the best disciple of the academy.

379
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:34,456
I don't buy it.

380
00:20:35,897 --> 00:20:37,137
I dare you to have
a showdown with me.

381
00:20:37,777 --> 00:20:38,377
You're childish.

382
00:20:38,936 --> 00:20:39,976
Do you underestimate me

383
00:20:39,976 --> 00:20:41,096
and think I'm not good enough
to fight you?

384
00:20:42,377 --> 00:20:43,176
I dare you to make a bet with me.

385
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,296
What's the bet on?

386
00:20:44,816 --> 00:20:45,617
If I lose,

387
00:20:45,696 --> 00:20:46,777
I'll announce it to the academy

388
00:20:46,777 --> 00:20:48,257
that I'm your underling.

389
00:20:48,737 --> 00:20:50,257
The same goes for you.
What do you think?

390
00:20:50,897 --> 00:20:51,657
It's not necessary.

391
00:20:52,617 --> 00:20:53,296
If you lose,

392
00:20:53,816 --> 00:20:55,096
you'll leave the mountain
and protect me for three years.

393
00:20:55,617 --> 00:20:56,017
Three years?

394
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:57,777
It's too long.

395
00:20:58,137 --> 00:20:58,657
Five years.

396
00:21:00,737 --> 00:21:02,897
You're arrogant. I won't lose.

397
00:22:33,897 --> 00:22:34,456
Five years.

398
00:22:36,816 --> 00:22:37,497
I'm toast.

399
00:22:40,816 --> 00:22:41,897
It's only a month left

400
00:22:43,216 --> 00:22:44,257
for the five-year engagement.

401
00:22:45,456 --> 00:22:47,657
I'd like to ask you for one last favor.

402
00:22:48,857 --> 00:22:49,537
Protect Miao.

403
00:22:50,617 --> 00:22:52,657
They're your wife and kid.
Protect them yourself.

404
00:22:53,176 --> 00:22:54,257
I only promised

405
00:22:54,257 --> 00:22:55,336
to keep you safe.

406
00:22:55,696 --> 00:22:56,737
If you dare die in the capital,

407
00:22:58,017 --> 00:22:59,336
I'll leave right away.

408
00:23:01,576 --> 00:23:02,696
In the past five years,

409
00:23:03,336 --> 00:23:04,216
I've taken advantage of the bet

410
00:23:05,056 --> 00:23:06,976
to pick on you and deduct your wages.

411
00:23:07,537 --> 00:23:08,137
What now?

412
00:23:08,657 --> 00:23:09,377
As it comes to this point,

413
00:23:09,857 --> 00:23:11,216
are you concerned about me?

414
00:23:12,576 --> 00:23:13,737
You're ridiculous.

415
00:23:15,296 --> 00:23:16,296
I'm concerned about you?

416
00:23:17,017 --> 00:23:19,096
I just don't want to take care
of those two burdens.

417
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:20,576
I tell you what.

418
00:23:21,096 --> 00:23:22,176
They're your wife and kid.

419
00:23:22,176 --> 00:23:23,377
Come back alive
and protect them yourself.

420
00:23:24,056 --> 00:23:24,737
Furthermore,

421
00:23:24,976 --> 00:23:25,737
if you die,

422
00:23:26,096 --> 00:23:27,497
I'll immediately tell Shen Miao

423
00:23:28,056 --> 00:23:29,497
that you've never loved her

424
00:23:29,497 --> 00:23:30,857
and everything is a scheme.

425
00:23:31,257 --> 00:23:32,137
And I'll let her take Xiao away

426
00:23:32,137 --> 00:23:33,296
and remarry

427
00:23:33,296 --> 00:23:34,176
Third Master Song.

428
00:23:34,696 --> 00:23:35,696
To make you turn

429
00:23:35,976 --> 00:23:36,897
in your grave.

430
00:23:45,897 --> 00:23:46,816
If it's the case,

431
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,696
it might be a good thing.

432
00:23:49,617 --> 00:23:50,336
What are you talking about?

433
00:23:52,936 --> 00:23:54,576
Everything is unpredictable
on this trip.

434
00:23:56,576 --> 00:23:57,936
If I fail,

435
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:02,456
Xiao and the Shen family will be killed

436
00:24:03,017 --> 00:24:04,456
by the Qin family because of me.

437
00:24:06,017 --> 00:24:06,617
By then,

438
00:24:07,456 --> 00:24:08,976
I need you to do me a favor.

439
00:24:10,096 --> 00:24:10,857
I can't understand.

440
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:11,897
I won't help you.

441
00:24:12,696 --> 00:24:14,336
Before the dust settles,

442
00:24:16,777 --> 00:24:18,176
no matter what happens,

443
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:20,696
please don't tell Miao the truth.

444
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:23,897
If...

445
00:24:26,017 --> 00:24:27,576
If I die in the capital,

446
00:24:29,056 --> 00:24:30,737
you must try everything you could

447
00:24:31,056 --> 00:24:33,816
to deny any connection
between the Shen family and me.

448
00:24:35,257 --> 00:24:38,056
Then, take Miao and Xiao to Song Xiyuan.

449
00:24:38,456 --> 00:24:39,417
Pei Yanzhen, are you out of your mind?

450
00:24:39,696 --> 00:24:41,816
This is the only surefire way.

451
00:24:42,497 --> 00:24:43,017
By then,

452
00:24:43,336 --> 00:24:45,657
Song Xiyuan will ask to marry Miao
in front of Qin Zuze.

453
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:50,056
This can at least protect
the Shen family.

454
00:24:52,777 --> 00:24:53,537
Martial Brother Zhan,

455
00:24:54,617 --> 00:24:56,816
thank you for everything.

456
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,296
You must

457
00:25:01,137 --> 00:25:02,296
promise me this.

I promise you.

461
00:25:14,897 --> 00:25:18,096
I've been living with hatred
for the first half of my life.

462
00:25:19,777 --> 00:25:22,456
I married Miao for a sinister purpose.

463
00:25:23,737 --> 00:25:24,897
This is my last stand.

464
00:25:26,617 --> 00:25:27,657
I'll try hard to stay alive.

465
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:31,737
So I can live openly in the future.

466
00:25:34,137 --> 00:25:34,857
You must succeed

467
00:25:37,497 --> 00:25:38,216

00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:07,377
take care.

Physician, please.

479
00:26:41,257 --> 00:26:42,897
Miss, the physician is here.

480
00:26:43,216 --> 00:26:43,737
Miss.

481
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:48,377
Lvying,

482
00:26:49,897 --> 00:26:51,257
can this physician handle it?

483
00:26:51,257 --> 00:26:52,456
Our family physician

484
00:26:52,456 --> 00:26:53,816
is not around today.

485
00:26:53,936 --> 00:26:54,537
And ever since

486
00:26:54,537 --> 00:26:55,696
the argument of your pregnancy,

487
00:26:55,897 --> 00:26:56,857
none of the physicians

in Lingzhou

489
00:26:57,497 --> 00:26:58,657
is willing to accept our requests.

490
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:00,336
We managed to find one from out of town.

491
00:27:00,737 --> 00:27:01,617
Just give it a try.

492
00:27:03,936 --> 00:27:04,417
Physician.

493
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:05,537
We're ready.

494
00:27:06,497 --> 00:27:07,176
Okay.

495
00:27:07,897 --> 00:27:08,377
Please.

496
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:10,216
Please, Miss.

497
00:27:20,336 --> 00:27:21,056
I'm done.

498
00:27:21,497 --> 00:27:22,497
That soon?

499
00:27:22,497 --> 00:27:23,176
Yes.

500
00:27:27,176 --> 00:27:28,137
Well, Physician,

501
00:27:28,456 --> 00:27:29,296
my bird is

502
00:27:29,296 --> 00:27:30,857
usually chatty.

503
00:27:31,096 --> 00:27:32,377
But somehow, it doesn't

504
00:27:33,296 --> 00:27:34,216
speak much today

505
00:27:34,336 --> 00:27:35,497
as if it can't make a sound.

506
00:27:35,497 --> 00:27:36,936
Why don't you check on it as well?

507
00:27:37,296 --> 00:27:38,936
Miss, he's a physician.

508
00:27:39,537 --> 00:27:41,017
Never mind, no trouble at all.

509
00:27:44,056 --> 00:27:45,176
What a weird tone.

510
00:27:49,976 --> 00:27:52,257
It's no big deal. It loses its voice.

511
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:53,737
It loses its virginity?

512
00:27:54,056 --> 00:27:54,857
No.

513
00:27:55,017 --> 00:27:56,377
Miss, there's no

514
00:27:56,377 --> 00:27:57,897
other bird at our place.

515
00:27:57,897 --> 00:27:59,137
How could it lose its virginity?

516
00:27:59,696 --> 00:28:00,657
No.

517
00:28:00,657 --> 00:28:02,257
We always say people die
in defense of their honor.

518
00:28:02,456 --> 00:28:03,336
Today, this parrot mourns

519
00:28:03,336 --> 00:28:05,216
its lost chastity with silence.

520
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:06,296
What a decent bird.

521
00:28:06,576 --> 00:28:07,737
It's my bad for not watching it,

522
00:28:07,737 --> 00:28:08,897
giving the wild bird a chance
to fly in here

523
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:10,617
and cause such a tragic event.

524
00:28:10,617 --> 00:28:11,456
It's my fault.

525
00:28:11,537 --> 00:28:12,576
It's my bad, Miss.

526
00:28:12,576 --> 00:28:13,777
No, this is my fault.

527
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:14,976
It's my bad.

528
00:28:15,497 --> 00:28:18,576
It loses its voice not its virginity.

529
00:28:19,737 --> 00:28:21,096
- It's its virginity.
- It's its virginity.

530
00:28:21,737 --> 00:28:24,257
It's its voice.

531
00:28:24,257 --> 00:28:26,056
Its speaking voice.

532
00:28:26,816 --> 00:28:29,456
It's its body.

533
00:28:30,657 --> 00:28:31,857
It's a male bird.

534
00:28:32,456 --> 00:28:33,056
Voice.

535
00:28:35,176 --> 00:28:35,816
It's a male bird.

536
00:28:35,816 --> 00:28:37,096
Its speaking voice.

537
00:28:37,096 --> 00:28:38,017
It loses its voice.

538
00:28:39,576 --> 00:28:40,777
Did you feed it

539
00:28:40,777 --> 00:28:42,976
with something spicy?

540
00:28:43,456 --> 00:28:44,296
Its throat is swollen.

541
00:28:44,737 --> 00:28:45,857
I'll prescribe a refreshing medication

542
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:46,696
for you guys.

543
00:28:46,696 --> 00:28:47,657
Decoct it and feed it to the bird.

544
00:28:47,657 --> 00:28:48,857
It should be fine.

545
00:28:48,857 --> 00:28:50,417
Thank you, Physician.

546
00:28:50,417 --> 00:28:51,617
This way, Physician.

547
00:28:52,216 --> 00:28:52,936
Okay.

548
00:28:59,336 --> 00:29:01,096
So it loses its voice.

549
00:29:04,816 --> 00:29:05,336
Physician,

550
00:29:05,737 --> 00:29:07,737
when will Miss's foot recover?

551
00:29:08,176 --> 00:29:09,537
Her wound is treated in time.

552
00:29:09,777 --> 00:29:10,777
But due to the hot weather,

553
00:29:11,257 --> 00:29:12,257
it needs some time to cure

554
00:29:12,257 --> 00:29:13,257
the inflamed wound.

555
00:29:13,897 --> 00:29:14,976
I'll write you a prescription.

556
00:29:15,777 --> 00:29:18,576
Decoct it. It'll be healed
in about three days.

557
00:29:19,617 --> 00:29:20,096
Thank you.

558
00:29:20,096 --> 00:29:21,056
Thanks, Physician.

559
00:29:22,617 --> 00:29:25,857
Miss, people always say
children bring prosperity.

560
00:29:26,336 --> 00:29:27,897
Contraceptive medicine is bad
for health.

561
00:29:27,897 --> 00:29:28,816
It harms the liver and kidneys.

562
00:29:28,816 --> 00:29:29,657
You can't take much of it.

563
00:29:30,617 --> 00:29:32,696
What? What did he say?

564
00:29:36,976 --> 00:29:38,857
I'm asking

565
00:29:39,897 --> 00:29:43,576
if you've taken contraceptive medicine.

566
00:29:44,537 --> 00:29:46,816
It is bad for the body.
It'll harm the liver and kidneys.

567
00:29:47,096 --> 00:29:48,576
If you keep taking it,

568
00:29:48,696 --> 00:29:50,576
your life will be endangered.

569
00:29:51,176 --> 00:29:51,976
What are you talking about?

570
00:29:51,976 --> 00:29:52,936
What contraceptive medicine?

571
00:29:53,176 --> 00:29:54,456
She has never taken any of that.

572
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,296
A healer must be benevolent.

573
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:57,137
Though you're not happy,

574
00:29:57,377 --> 00:29:58,777
you can't fake

575
00:29:58,777 --> 00:30:00,296
your pulse.

576
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:02,377
This friendly advice is

577
00:30:02,497 --> 00:30:03,777
for your own good.

578
00:30:03,777 --> 00:30:05,257
How dare you talk nonsense

579
00:30:05,857 --> 00:30:06,777
and frame Miss.

580
00:30:07,296 --> 00:30:07,696
Get out!

581
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,137
This is all I can say.

582
00:30:09,137 --> 00:30:09,696
Accept it or not,

583
00:30:09,696 --> 00:30:11,497
it's up to you, Miss.

584
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:12,576
You...

585
00:30:13,017 --> 00:30:13,696
You...

586
00:30:14,216 --> 00:30:15,657
It's gibberish.

587
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:16,537
What a mediocre physician.

588
00:30:24,176 --> 00:30:26,096
Miss, I've got rid of
that mediocre physician.

589
00:30:26,096 --> 00:30:27,296
Don't think too much.

590
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:28,456
When our family physician

591
00:30:28,456 --> 00:30:29,696
returns and diagnoses it,

592
00:30:30,017 --> 00:30:31,576
I'll be sure to sue that physician.

593
00:30:42,497 --> 00:30:43,176
Miss,

594
00:30:43,576 --> 00:30:44,576
are you still worried

595
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:45,696
about what the physician said
this morning?

596
00:30:50,456 --> 00:30:51,696
I don't understand.

597
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,897
When have I taken
contraceptive medicine?

598
00:30:56,417 --> 00:30:58,857
Miss, don't listen to his nonsense.

599
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,377
He might be a con man.

600
00:31:01,056 --> 00:31:02,777
You and Master finally get
back together now.

601
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,257
Maybe you'll have

602
00:31:04,377 --> 00:31:06,617
several more kids in a few years.

603
00:31:09,017 --> 00:31:11,096
Is there any news from Pei Yanzhen?

604
00:31:12,857 --> 00:31:13,617
No.

605
00:31:15,857 --> 00:31:17,576
Forget it. You may leave.

606
00:31:19,617 --> 00:31:20,096
Okay.

607
00:31:30,336 --> 00:31:32,497
I think of Miao every day
but she's nowhere to be seen.

608
00:31:32,936 --> 00:31:34,216
Miaomiao doesn't want me.

609
00:31:34,617 --> 00:31:35,936
I'm sad because of Miao.

610
00:31:36,336 --> 00:31:38,096
I won't feel remorseful to waste away.

611
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,617
Can you be quiet?

612
00:31:40,777 --> 00:31:42,936
I think of Miao every day
but she's nowhere to be seen.

613
00:31:43,377 --> 00:31:44,657
Miaomiao doesn't want me.

614
00:31:45,056 --> 00:31:46,377
I'm sad because of Miao.

615
00:31:46,777 --> 00:31:48,537
I won't feel remorseful to waste away.

616
00:31:54,816 --> 00:31:56,537
You're indeed
the bird Song Xiyuan gave me.

617
00:31:57,096 --> 00:31:58,216
You're just like him.

618
00:31:59,216 --> 00:32:00,576
I wouldn't have treated you
if I knew this.

619
00:32:01,537 --> 00:32:04,497
It's a wonderful plan.
With Song Xiyuan's help,

620
00:32:04,576 --> 00:32:05,696
we can catch them off guard.

621
00:32:06,976 --> 00:32:08,096
What story is this?

622
00:32:08,537 --> 00:32:09,377
Why is Song Xiyuan involved?

623
00:32:09,897 --> 00:32:13,056
The Shen family has 161 stores

624
00:32:13,696 --> 00:32:16,056
and 18 river routes.

625
00:32:16,576 --> 00:32:19,576
The number is the same
with what we have.

626
00:32:19,576 --> 00:32:20,336
Word for word.

The Shen family

No way.

How could it be him?

642
00:32:54,576 --> 00:32:55,576
It's impossible.

643
00:32:56,096 --> 00:32:59,576
Miss, did you take
the contraceptive medicine?

644
00:33:00,096 --> 00:33:02,096
It's bad for the body.
It'll harm the liver and kidneys.

645
00:33:02,497 --> 00:33:04,216
If you keep taking it,

646

of having kids with me.

663
00:34:22,536 --> 00:34:24,056
- With Song Xiyuan's help,
- Song Xiyuan?

664
00:34:24,056 --> 00:34:24,897
we can catch them off guard.

665
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:25,697
And Song Xiyuan?

666
00:34:30,776 --> 00:34:31,457
(Old Master Shen,)

667
00:34:32,816 --> 00:34:34,217
(Miss Shen and I)

668
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:36,296
(hit it off.)

669
00:34:36,776 --> 00:34:38,296
And I fall in love with her.

670
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:49,697
I'm here

671
00:34:49,697 --> 00:34:50,857
for a purpose.

672
00:34:51,296 --> 00:34:54,137
It's to ask you for Miao's hand.

673
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:06,897
They colluded to ask to marry me

674
00:35:07,857 --> 00:35:09,256
and put on this show.

675
00:35:13,056 --> 00:35:16,417
Your eyes look familiar to me.

676
00:35:17,056 --> 00:35:17,897
How is your leg?

677
00:35:20,296 --> 00:35:22,137
There are calluses on your left hand.

678
00:35:22,377 --> 00:35:24,296
It seems like you're used to using
a sword with your left hand.

679
00:35:24,657 --> 00:35:26,016
I've never seen someone like this.

680
00:35:26,536 --> 00:35:27,657
This is odd.

681
00:35:28,096 --> 00:35:29,096
He practices martial arts.

682
00:35:29,417 --> 00:35:31,776
Xiao, this is your birthday gift.

683
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:33,776
He gave me the token.

684
00:35:34,417 --> 00:35:35,617
He rejected the proposal
before everyone.

685
00:35:36,096 --> 00:35:37,816
And he set me up and made me rescue him.

686
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:41,377
Do you want to save Yanzhen?

687
00:35:42,536 --> 00:35:44,056
I've got the Immunity Token
the Grand Emperor bestowed.

688
00:35:44,377 --> 00:35:46,736
Qin Miuzhen, even the order
of the Empress Dowager is no match

689
00:35:46,736 --> 00:35:48,177
for the edict from the Grand Emperor.

690
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:49,697
It's impossible.

691
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,897
No way. It's impossible.

692
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:55,417
(At this point,)

693
00:35:55,897 --> 00:35:57,137
(you have no talent or virtue.)

694
00:35:57,776 --> 00:35:59,336
(All you have is that invaluable title)

695
00:35:59,336 --> 00:36:01,177
(of the young lady of the Shen family.)

696
00:36:01,417 --> 00:36:03,617
Do you really think you're prettier
than the gold and silver

697
00:36:03,897 --> 00:36:05,897
that you can make me fall for you?

698
00:36:06,536 --> 00:36:07,697
No way. It's impossible!

699
00:36:12,697 --> 00:36:14,576
Miao, you're smart.

700
00:36:15,217 --> 00:36:17,576
Why would you still lie to yourself
at a moment like this?

701
00:36:18,377 --> 00:36:19,336
If I really love you,

702
00:36:19,816 --> 00:36:21,056
why would I feed you with
the contraceptive soup?

703
00:36:22,296 --> 00:36:23,296
If I really love you,

704
00:36:23,897 --> 00:36:25,256
why would I hide my martial arts skill?

705
00:36:25,897 --> 00:36:26,897
If I really love you,

706
00:36:27,256 --> 00:36:30,056
why would I watch you marry Song Xiyuan?

707
00:36:30,056 --> 00:36:31,697
With the token I gave you,

708
00:36:33,177 --> 00:36:35,096
do you really think I love you?

709
00:36:35,897 --> 00:36:37,816
I disappeared for three years
without any news.

710
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:39,417
If it wasn't for the Qin family,

711
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:41,897
I would've long forgotten about you.

712
00:36:41,897 --> 00:36:42,857
I don't believe it.

713
00:36:43,776 --> 00:36:45,217
You said you liked me.

714
00:36:45,897 --> 00:36:48,056
You said that yourself in the prison.

715
00:36:48,897 --> 00:36:49,736
And the shadow puppets.

716
00:36:50,137 --> 00:36:51,417
And those shadow puppets you gave me.

717
00:36:52,256 --> 00:36:53,217
You're true to me.

718
00:36:53,217 --> 00:36:54,056
You said that.

719
00:36:54,657 --> 00:36:55,536
Silly Miao,

720
00:36:56,177 --> 00:36:58,776
sometimes, I think you're really cute.

721
00:36:59,336 --> 00:37:01,617
No, it's not true, Yanzhen.

722
00:37:02,576 --> 00:37:03,897
All of this is fake, right?

723
00:37:04,417 --> 00:37:05,377
When you return,

724
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:07,657
I'll know that everything is fake.

725
00:37:07,897 --> 00:37:08,536
Right?

726
00:37:08,617 --> 00:37:10,576
I'll annihilate the Shen family
when I return.

727
00:37:10,897 --> 00:37:12,736
Maybe I'll let you live.

728
00:37:14,377 --> 00:37:16,336
People of the Shen family
and the fortune of the Lu family,

729
00:37:16,736 --> 00:37:18,177
I won't forgo either one.

730
00:37:18,697 --> 00:37:19,457
You're lying.

731
00:37:20,576 --> 00:37:21,897
You're lying about everything.

732
00:37:21,897 --> 00:37:23,657
Go away, Pei Yanzhen!

733
00:37:24,736 --> 00:37:26,937
(I risk my life to collude with you.)

734
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:30,296
(The 161 stores the Shen family owns)

735
00:37:30,776 --> 00:37:34,457
(and their 18 river routes that ship
the silk to the six provinces...)

736
00:37:34,937 --> 00:37:35,977
(It all belongs to you.)

737
00:37:37,857 --> 00:37:40,296
(I wonder
what you'll do to the Shen family)

738
00:37:40,816 --> 00:37:42,256
(when everything is done.)

739
00:37:42,736 --> 00:37:43,657
(The Shen family)

740
00:37:44,776 --> 00:37:46,137
(will be annihilated.)

741
00:37:46,137 --> 00:37:52,857
(Will be annihilated.)

742
00:37:57,816 --> 00:37:58,296
Miss!

743
00:37:59,137 --> 00:38:01,296
Miss!

744
00:38:01,736 --> 00:38:02,377
Miss!

745
00:38:02,377 --> 00:38:03,417
Wake up!

746
00:38:03,576 --> 00:38:04,776
What's wrong, Miss?

747
00:38:04,857 --> 00:38:05,897
There's a fire, Miss.

748
00:38:06,457 --> 00:38:07,776
Miss!

749
00:38:08,617 --> 00:38:09,336
Miss!

750
00:38:09,657 --> 00:38:11,576
What's wrong with you, Miss?

751
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,697
By the order of General Qin,

752
00:38:21,816 --> 00:38:23,177
we came to deliver the tea leaves.

753
00:38:45,217 --> 00:38:46,897
Sir, you're finally here.

754
00:38:47,177 --> 00:38:48,137
The imperial physicians said

755
00:38:48,457 --> 00:38:50,296
His Majesty is helpless.

756
00:38:55,056 --> 00:38:57,016
How dare you stop General Qin?

757
00:38:58,217 --> 00:39:00,457
Her Highness said
His Majesty needs to rest

758
00:39:00,457 --> 00:39:01,576
as he's not feeling well.

759
00:39:01,816 --> 00:39:03,296
No one is allowed to disturb him.

760
00:39:03,576 --> 00:39:05,137
Please understand, Official Qin.

761
00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:08,336
I've got a military plan
to report to His Majesty.

762
00:39:08,816 --> 00:39:11,256
Who will take the responsibility
for the hold-up?

763
00:39:11,897 --> 00:39:14,576
Her Highness said
she'll take the responsibility

764
00:39:14,736 --> 00:39:17,457
of all the public affairs
during His Majesty's rest period.

765
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:18,816
Well...

766
00:39:18,897 --> 00:39:19,617
How dare you!

767
00:39:20,897 --> 00:39:21,816
Eunuch Xiuye,

768
00:39:22,256 --> 00:39:24,776
you insist on keeping me
from visiting His Majesty.

769
00:39:25,417 --> 00:39:26,096
Is there

770
00:39:26,536 --> 00:39:27,897
something going on?

771
00:39:28,697 --> 00:39:30,256
How would I dare to lie to you?

772
00:39:30,256 --> 00:39:31,697
I'm just here to watch over

773
00:39:31,697 --> 00:39:33,816
His Majesty as Her Highness's command.

774
00:39:35,296 --> 00:39:38,256
Then, I must get in there.

775
00:39:38,657 --> 00:39:39,217
General.

776
00:39:43,377 --> 00:39:43,897
Move aside!

777
00:39:44,617 --> 00:39:45,137
Wait.

778
00:39:47,576 --> 00:39:48,177
Official Qin,

779
00:39:48,776 --> 00:39:49,816
at this juncture,

780
00:39:50,056 --> 00:39:51,617
we shouldn't cause any problems.

781
00:39:54,056 --> 00:39:56,536
If I didn't get to see it myself,

782
00:39:57,256 --> 00:39:59,576
I would think that something was strange

783
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,336
about His Majesty's illness.

784
00:40:02,256 --> 00:40:03,697
Why don't you let me do this?

785
00:40:03,897 --> 00:40:05,897
So it won't disrupt the plan
even if Her Highness asks

786
00:40:06,256 --> 00:40:07,417
about this break-in.

787
00:40:15,336 --> 00:40:16,296
I'm Commoner Song Xiyuan.

788
00:40:16,417 --> 00:40:18,056
I ask to see Your Majesty.

789
00:40:23,776 --> 00:40:24,776
I, Song Xiyuan

790
00:40:25,096 --> 00:40:26,096
have something to report.

791
00:40:45,617 --> 00:40:47,897
General, it's not that I want
to make things difficult for you.

792
00:40:48,137 --> 00:40:49,736
But His Majesty has fainted for days.

793
00:40:49,736 --> 00:40:51,016
There's no sign of recovery.

794
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:53,776
I'm afraid it'll cause a tumult
if this gets out

795
00:40:53,977 --> 00:40:55,016
so I hide it.

796
00:40:55,377 --> 00:40:56,977
Please understand.

797
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:01,776
I'm His Majesty's uncle.

798
00:41:02,336 --> 00:41:04,217
I made a fuss as I was worried.

799
00:41:05,576 --> 00:41:07,897
All of you may stand down.

800
00:41:08,457 --> 00:41:09,697
I'll watch over His Majesty.

801
00:41:10,296 --> 00:41:10,897
Yes.

802
00:41:35,977 --> 00:41:37,977
Miao.

803
00:41:40,617 --> 00:41:41,496
You're awake, Miao.

804
00:41:46,857 --> 00:41:47,377
Easy.

805
00:41:47,657 --> 00:41:48,336
Aunt,

806
00:41:48,697 --> 00:41:50,217
go get Dad's official seal over.

807
00:41:50,697 --> 00:41:51,736
Don't worry about this.

808
00:41:51,977 --> 00:41:52,857
Just get some rest.

809
00:41:53,056 --> 00:41:54,056
Your dad has

810
00:41:54,056 --> 00:41:55,617
already had everything arranged.

811
00:41:56,137 --> 00:41:58,177
And he has entrusted
the official seal to Yanzhen.

812
00:41:58,977 --> 00:41:59,776
Pei Yanzhen?

813
00:42:01,736 --> 00:42:03,977
This is the official seal
of the leader of the Shen family.

814
00:42:04,217 --> 00:42:06,377
This official seal represents me.

815
00:42:07,217 --> 00:42:08,857
I'll entrust the Shen family

816
00:42:12,177 --> 00:42:13,816
and Miao to you.

817
00:42:15,657 --> 00:42:16,056
This is bad.

818
00:42:16,776 --> 00:42:17,256
Housekeeper,

819
00:42:17,457 --> 00:42:18,736
tell the stores of the Shen family

820
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:19,536
to immediately seal the account.

821
00:42:19,776 --> 00:42:20,776
No one is allowed to draw

822
00:42:20,776 --> 00:42:21,736
the fund besides me and Dad.

823
00:42:22,177 --> 00:42:22,496
Why...

824
00:42:22,496 --> 00:42:23,137
Just do it.

825
00:42:23,137 --> 00:42:24,377
I have my own reason. Just go.

826
00:42:26,217 --> 00:42:27,256

You haven't told me

00:42:28,736 --> 00:42:30,377
why the room would be on fire.

829
00:42:30,617 --> 00:42:31,937
Luckily, Lvying noticed it in time.

830
00:42:33,457 --> 00:42:34,697
There are two servants
from Pei family.

831
00:42:34,897 --> 00:42:37,417
They said the elders of the Pei family
haven't seen Master Xiao for so long.

832
00:42:37,617 --> 00:42:39,056
They want to pick him up
for a short stay.

833
00:42:39,137 --> 00:42:40,256
I'll explain to you later.

834
00:42:40,736 --> 00:42:42,296
Lvying, get a carriage over

835
00:42:42,296 --> 00:42:43,736
and go to Pei's Residence with me
to pick Xiao up.

836
00:42:44,256 --> 00:42:44,697
