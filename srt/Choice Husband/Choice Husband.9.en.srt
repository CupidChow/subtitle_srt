Both of you should stop fighting.

Since you can't come to a conclusion,

22
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,680
it's not right for me
to stay at Song's Residence.

Miao.

Of course,

25
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,040
it's worse for me
to stay at Pei's Residence.

26
00:01:48,839 --> 00:01:49,960
I'm going back to Shen's Residence.

Sir!

28
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:06,960
Miao.

29
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,679
Listen to me.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Official Pei must be joking.

31
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,199
It wasn't a joke.

32
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,520
This baby is a sign
that our fate hasn't ended yet.

33
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,199
We can start all over again.

34
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,720
Where were you

35
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:23,800
before you came to find me?

36
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,479
You knew about it?

37
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,080
I was in the capital,
asking His Majesty to issue an edict

38
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,520
so I can...

39
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:31,360
Enough.

40
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:33,920
Official Pei.

41
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,000
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.

42
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,880
If this baby isn't yours,

43
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,599
it's fine.

44
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,679
If this baby is yours,

45
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,360
it's none of your business.

46
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:44,800
I will be responsible of the baby.

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,520
I promised your father

48
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,280
and you.

49
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,039
No need.

50
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,039
The Shen family and I

51
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,399
don't need you
to take this responsibility.

52
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:51,959
Farewell.

53
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,039
Miao.

54
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,720
Let go.

55
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,280
Miao.

56
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:55,959
Let go!

57
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:15,440
Pei Yanzhen.

58
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:16,759
Your wound.

59
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,599
You rushed back through the night
from the capital to Lingzhou.

60
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:20,880
Your wound has opened up again.

61
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,559
If you still want to live,

62
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,039
you should go back to rest.

63
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:25,280
It's fine.

64
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:30,861
Don't let Song Xiyuan find out.

65
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:32,199
Hold me.

66
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,720
Let's go.

67
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:40,280
Let's go!

68
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,759
Young Master.

69
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,641
Are we not going to chase after Madam?

70
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,959
If we don't get rid of Pei Yanzhen,

71
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,360
chasing after her
won't solve the problem.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,599
Mother.

73
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,319
How can you do this?

74
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,240
The royal guards

75
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,399
attempted assassination

76
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:15,759
on a court official at the Royal Post.

77
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:17,960
If the news of this goes out,

78
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,840
what will happen to my reputation?

79
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,199
He tried to alienate the two of us

80
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:25,759
without lifting a finger.

81
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,920
Pei Yanzhen is really something.

82
00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:34,999
That's not what I meant.

83
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,199
Why don't you think about it?

84
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,199
If Pei Yanzhen

85
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,879
is really innocent,

86
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,400
why did he keep martial arts experts
by his side?

87
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,400
A dozen of royal guards went there

88
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,640
and none of them came back alive.

89
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
Can't you see

90
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,439
his intention?

91
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,039
Mother.

92
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,439
Last year, there were two floods.

93
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,360
There were many issues.

94
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,120
Uncle asked for a huge amount of money

95
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,840
from me for three straight months.

96
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,479
If you want to do something nice,

97
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,599
you can restrict the Qin family.

98
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,279
Why do you care about

99
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,599
Pei Yanzhen's background?

100
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,800
Sorry, Mother.

101
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,759
I was speaking out of turn.

102
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,360
I know

103
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,599
you haven't been satisfied with your
uncle's control over the royal court.

104
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,279
But think about it.

105
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:37,240
Without him,

106
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,840
how could you sit on this throne?

107
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,640
I also know about

108
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,279
the empty treasury.

109
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:51,400
I called you here today

110
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,560
for this exact issue.

111
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:57,920
Someone.

112
00:05:58,039 --> 00:05:59,319
Summon him here.

113
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,439
I am Song Xiyuan.

114
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,840
Greetings, Your Majesty.

115
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,199
Greetings, Your Highness.

116
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,759
Song Xiyuan?

117
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:19,039
Are you the owner
of Song's Trading Company

118
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,439
and Shen's new husband?

119
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,920
It is me.

120
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:24,560
Son.

121
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:27,479
Song Xiyuan is very loyal.

122
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,120
He has donated

123
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,479
a year of his company's profit.

124
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,560
Take a look.

125
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,120
This is the list.

126
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,279
I am lucky

127
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,640
to serve Your Majesty.

128
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,279
Song Xiyuan.

129
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,680
I heard there was something interesting
in your family recently.

130
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:46,879
It's just a family issue.

131
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,080
You shouldn't be concerned,
Your Highness.

132
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,759
What a coincidence.

133
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,319
The palace has an imperial physician
who excels in gynecology.

134
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,560
Why don't I ask him
to go back to Lingzhou with you

135
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,840
and take a look at your wife?

136
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:02,920
Perhaps the truth will come to light.

137
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,560
In that case,

138
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,159
you have my thanks, Your Highness.

139
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,400
Don't worry.

140
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:10,319
I am standing on your side after all.

141
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,599
Are you serious?

142
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,640
Of course.

143
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:22,960
Lvying.

144
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,640
The grapes are sweet.

145
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,640
Bring me two more bunches.

146
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:25,279
Yes.

147
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,800
Eating grapes is good
for the baby's skin.

148
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,879
But who is the father?

149
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,080
Even the famous Lingzhou physicians

150
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,680
and Shen Residence's private physicians

151
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,039
have no idea.

152
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:38,759
How would I know?

153
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:39,560
But I think

154
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,960
we shouldn't concern about this.

155
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,640
Let's think about it
when the Pei and Song families

156
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,360
stop fighting.

157
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:44,960
No way.

158
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,439
This is an offspring
of the Shen family after all.

159
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:48,879
Miao.

160
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:50,640
I'm here.

161
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,759
If Song Xiyuan is willing,

162
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:53,879
you'll spend your life with him.

163
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,439
If he isn't,

164
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,439
divorce him and come home.

165
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,120
What?

166
00:07:58,599 --> 00:07:59,439
I'm telling both of you.

167
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,360
You can joke about anything

168
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:01,640
but a divorce.

169
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,719
Do you want Miaomiao
to become an old single lady?

170
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,039
Why not?

171
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,039
I thought about it.

172
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,240
I have no hope
of becoming a leech at home.

173
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,520
I can't rely on you two

174
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,479
so I can only rely on myself.

175
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:12,520
Father.

176
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,759
Didn't you say

177
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,800
the silk store lacks a manager?

178
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,560
Do you think I'm suitable?

179
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,360
Not at all.

180
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,479
Miaomiao.

181
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:21,199
You are pregnant

182
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,479
and will soon become a mother.

183
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,400
From tomorrow onwards,

184
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,360
you shouldn't go anywhere.

185
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,599
Just stay here and nurture your fetus.

186
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,840
Isn't that a torture for me?

187
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:31,400
I might as well
stay in Song's Residence.

188
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,599
Why did I return to Shen's Residence?

189
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:34,920
It is dangerous to give birth.

190
00:08:35,237 --> 00:08:37,120
You need to be well-prepared
from now on.

191
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,200
That's right.

192
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,039
When the baby is born,

193
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,039
we can count the days

194
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,039
and know who the father is.

195
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:47,800
You'll become a mother soon.

196
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,560
Stop running around.

197
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,479
Stay here.

198
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,000
Father, say something.

199
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,200
I can't help you.

200
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,399
I've never given birth before.

201
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,200
You know nothing.

202
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,240
Let me tell you.

203
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:01,839
Listen to your aunt

204
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,599
regarding the back of the residence.

205
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:04,760
Father, I...

206
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:05,920
Father!

207
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,000
Miaomiao.

208
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:10,279
Be good.

209
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:13,120
Aunt.

210
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,000
No, Your Highness!

211
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,000
You can't enter!

212
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,959
Move!

213
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,360
How dare you stop me.

214
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,279
Yanzhen.

215
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,039
How are you?

216
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:38,360
Your Highness.

217
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,599
Official Pei is injured
and just had new medicine applied.

218
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:41,360
He is resting.

219
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,159
Please don't disturb him.

220
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,320
Why did he get injured?

221
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,959
Didn't he go to the palace
to ask Brother to grant him a marriage?

222
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,440
Did Brother beat him up?

223
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:51,479
Grant a marriage?

224
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,279
Your Highness, you've misunderstood.

225
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:53,920
Official Pei was...

226
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,200
What happened to him?

227
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,440
Who are you?

228
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,440
Looking at your outfit,

229
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,760
you must be a low-ranked guard.

230
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,440
I want to ask you

231
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:04,560
how you protected him

232
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,240
and got him injured.

233
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:07,519
Me, a low-ranked guard?

234
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:09,839
How dare you.

235
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:12,920
How dare you address yourself as "me"?

236
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,479
Go and get yourself punished.

237
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:18,959
Guard.

238
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,320
Leave immediately.

239
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:28,800
Pei Yanzhen.

240
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,760
I can't help you anymore.

241
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,200
It's every man for himself.

242
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,240
Yanzhen.

243
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
Yanzhen.

244
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,920
What are you doing?

245
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,760
Yanzhen,

246
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,320
you're awake?

247
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:53,200
Zhan Yue.

248
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:54,560
Zhan Yue!

249
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,800
Are you talking about
the low-ranked guard?

250
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,360
I chased him away.

251
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:00,519
What?

252
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,760
How did you come inside?

253
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,240
Yanzhen.

254
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,159
We are going to be married.

255
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:10,240
You can tell me anything.

256
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:11,479
Married?

257
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,311
Didn't you go to the capital

258
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,399
to become my husband?

259
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,240
Didn't you get injured

260
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:20,279
because Brother and Mother beat you up

261
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:21,599
as they would miss me?

262
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,560
Yanzhen.

263
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,599
You are hurt

264
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:28,000
and still need to rest.

265
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:29,959
I've let Your Highness down.

266
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:31,240
I went to the capital

267
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,440
to ask His Majesty
to take back his edict.

268
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:35,519
I have never

269
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:38,039
had any feelings for Your Highness
since the beginning.

270
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,639
Is it because of Shen Miao?

271
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,079
I knew it.

272
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:44,639
I knew that's the case.

273
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,920
She is still clinging to you.

274
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,000
Your Highness.

275
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,560
This has nothing to do with Shen Miao.

276
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,479
Don't cause trouble
for Shen Miao anymore.

277
00:11:50,681 --> 00:11:52,079
Wasn't it enough
at the bamboo forest last time?

278
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,719
Fine.

279
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,800
Pei Yanzhen.

280
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,639
You will regret this sooner or later.

281
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,599
Seriously.

282
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,200
A heartbroken lady

283
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,560
is scarier than a martial arts expert.

284
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:12,320
Zhan Yue.

285
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,599
Prepare a carriage for me.

286
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:17,120
You're still going out

287
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,880
in this condition?

288
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,599
Her Highness is reckless.

289
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,800
I'm afraid
she will cause trouble for Miao.

290
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:32,399
Son.

291
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:34,760
Who do you think
is the father of the baby?

292
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,200
Mother.

293
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:38,639
I am not a physician.

294
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,719
I can't determine that.

295
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,599
However, Shen Miao

296
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:42,800
lacks virtue.

297
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,760
She involved two reputable families

298
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,440
in Lingzhou in a farce

299
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,039
on her own.

300
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,200
She should be punished.

301
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,440
Indeed.

302
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,560
But have you
forgotten about the Lu family?

303
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,599
The baby that Shen Miao bears

304
00:12:57,599 --> 00:12:59,839
is the successor of
the Shen and Lu families.

305
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,880
Don't you think

306
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,440
Pei Yanzhen's intention

307
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,560
is more than the marriage itself?

308
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,039
If that is the case,

309
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,959
isn't Song Xiyuan's donation
at the palace

310
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,800
a despicable act?

311
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,519
His marriage with Shen Miao

312
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,320
is also for his own benefit.

313
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,839
Well,

314
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:23,959
why don't we have a wager?

315
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,560
Let's see what
Imperial Physician Xiao says.

316
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:30,000
If the baby belongs to the Song family,

317
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,200
Song Xiyuan's wealth and intelligence

318
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,680
can match Pei Yanzhen,

319
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,320
and he will become your loyal retainer.

320
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,560
What if Pei Yanzhen is the father?

321
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,440
Invite Shen Miao and her baby

322
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,880
into the palace
and take good care of them.

323
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,279
Grant Pei Yanzhen
a high position and salary

324
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,760
to become your right-hand man.

325
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,920
I agree with Mother's suggestion.

326
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,440
Great timing.

327
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,800
We are talking...

328
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,200
We are discussing Miao's baby.

329
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,200
Are you talking about

330
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:17,440
my baby with Miao?

331
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,000
Don't get so cocky.

332
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,479
His Majesty has issued an edict

333
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,240
to get Imperial Physician Xiao

334
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,760
to determine whether the baby
belongs to the Song family

335
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,880
or some messed-up families.

336
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,079
There will be a result today.

337
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,200
Who is it? Are you blind?

338
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,000
Sorry.

339
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,839
Shen Miao?

340
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:03,599
Your Highness?

341
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,320
You...

342
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,639
You are a noble lady.

343
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,120
You...

344
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,279
Softer.

345
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:09,719
Don't attract my aunt.

346
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:12,360
Stop acting close.

347
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,800
I am the princess.

348
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,519
Help me up.

349
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,479
Fine.

350
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:21,719
Be careful.

351
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,240
Your Highness.

352
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,479
Why did you come to my house?

353
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,880
I do want to ask you

354
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,880
what's going on
between you and Pei Yanzhen.

355
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,519
Two men

356
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,399
were intimate with you?

357
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,159
Your Highness.

358
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:55,800
You can't say that.

359
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,200
There was a sequence.

360
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:58,079
I don't care.

361
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,839
The baby must not be Pei Yanzhen's.

362
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,320
Otherwise,

363
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,079
I won't forgive you.

364
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,360
Don't worry.

365
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,240
Both of you are getting married soon.

366
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:10,680
I won't cause you trouble.

367
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,320
What's wrong?

368
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,240
It's all your fault.

369
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,240
Yanzhen is not willing to marry me.

370
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:29,920
He went to the capital
to reject the marriage.

371
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:35,639
Shen Miao.

372
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,200
You are a vixen! The Helen of Troy!

373
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,039
Fine.

374
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:40,839
I'm a vixen.

375
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:42,200
I'm the Helen of Troy.

376
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,760
Stop crying.

377
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,399
Stop crying.

378
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:46,800
Later, everyone might...

379
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:49,560
Don't pretend to care for me.

380
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,479
Trying to get close to me?

381
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:55,279
It's not over yet between us!

382
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:56,760
Fine.

383
00:16:58,719 --> 00:16:59,279
Shen Miao.

384
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,440
Where are you going?

385
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:01,360
Shopping.

386
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:03,440
I'm going too.

387
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:07,279
You might seduce Yanzhen

388
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:09,320
when I'm not around.

389
00:17:10,639 --> 00:17:11,480
Lead the way.

390
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,159
Old Master Shen.

391
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,560
-Shen Miao is...
-Imperial Physician Xiao.

392
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,920
It seems like you are a tea lover.

393
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,239
Why did you only take one sip?

394
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:41,999
This is eight-year-old
Maojian Tea from Xinyang.

395
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,159
Take another sip.

396
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:44,680
You can only

397
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,159
taste its flavor when it's hot.

398
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,200
Try it.

399
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,960
See if it's rich and fragrant.

400
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,840
Sure.

401
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,560
How is it?

402
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,320
Good.

403
00:17:58,399 --> 00:17:59,080
Is it nice?

404
00:17:59,239 --> 00:18:00,440
I'll give you a refill.

405
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:05,560
What have you done?

406
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,359
Why didn't anyone welcome me

407
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,560
when I was here?

408
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,399
Your Highness.

409
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,200
I am the lady of the Shen family.

410
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,519
These stores belong to my family.

411
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:14,080
It is different when I shop here.

412
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,720
Show off.

413
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:16,480
Come.

414

(Shen's Accessories Store)

422
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,440
This?

423
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,359
This looks nice.

424
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:32,800
Yes.

425
00:18:33,639 --> 00:18:34,279

Here?

432
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,320
Use all these fabrics to make clothes

433
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:50,159
for Her Highness.

434

Really?

435

It feels nice today.

436
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,039
I'll look for you again
when I find some new fabrics

Sure.

439

I'm going to organize a banquet
when spring comes.

440

I'll ask Brother to find some good chefs

441
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,440
and cook up a feast.

442
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:08,159
I'll widen your horizon as a bumpkin.

443

Sure.

444

ignore His Majesty's order.

The number of pregnant women I've seen

is more than
the number of meals you had.

Do you think determining your pregnancy

490

is a challenge for me?

491

Three months?

Is it a baby of
the Pei family or the Song family?

-Really?
-Really?

508
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:24,879
Tie Niu.

509
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:26,320
Are we celebrating a festival?

510
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:29,399
I don't think so.

511
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:33,039
Everyone is gathered in the house.

512
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,080
Other people

513
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,399
might think my late father

514
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:36,680
gave me another brother.

515
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:38,119
Third Master Song.

516
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,279
Stop smiling like it's a joke.

517
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:41,639
Let me ask you.

518
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:44,080
What's going on
with that illegitimate child

519
00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:45,639
in Shen Miao's stomach?

520
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,359
Allow me to remind you.

521
00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:49,239
Miaomiao is

522
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:51,639
the wife I married legally.

523
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,320
The term "illegitimate child"

524
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,720
is more suited for my fourth brother.

525
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:57,759
You...

526
00:22:57,759 --> 00:22:58,800
Enough, Sister.

527
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,119
Speak less.

528
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:01,879
I'm sure Third Master doesn't feel good

529
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:04,480
with all the rumors in the city.

530
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:06,879
We watched you grow up.

531
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:08,960
We only care about you.

532
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:12,080
With the rumors going on
around Lingzhou City,

533
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,080
the Song family cannot accept

534
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,560
the baby inside Shen's stomach.

535
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,600
Right now,

536
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:19,159
you should get a divorce

537
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:21,720
to protect the Song family's reputation.

538
00:23:24,639 --> 00:23:25,560
You are right.

539
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:28,999
Chase Miaomiao and her baby
out of this family

540
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:31,320
and stop the Shen family's aid.

541
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,720
Next, find a new messed-up wife

542
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:36,039
to cause chaos in our home.

543
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,800
That is the best solution.

544
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,480
What are you talking about?

545
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,440
I'm talking about
the Song family's story.

546
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,080
To be clear,

547
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,279
aren't the two of you
fighting to become the house master?

548
00:23:45,639 --> 00:23:46,440
If you are capable,

549
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,840
snatch the position from me.

550
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,359
What nonsense are you saying?

551
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,960
Your father left the family business
in your hands before he passed away

552
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:54,639
to protect us and our sons.

553
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,840
We'll let it go
when you cause trouble usually.

554
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:58,560
With this incident now,

555
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:00,399
how do you want us to face other people?

556
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:01,639
Can you face your late father?

557
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,080
If you can,

558
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,639
get my late father
to talk to me in person.

559
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:06,999
Aunts,

560
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,519
I'm busy so I'll be taking my leave.

561
00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:10,759
Stop right there!

562
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:13,999
What?

563
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:17,639
Imperial Physician Xiao said
she has been pregnant for three months?

564
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,279
(I ordered him to say four months.)

565
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,039
(How?)

566
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:26,639
Son.

567
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,960
Did you instruct
Imperial Physician Xiao behind my back?

568
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,639
Didn't you instruct him behind my back

569
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,119
to give the baby to the Song family?

570
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:39,879
I was...

571
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:44,519
Where is Imperial Physician Xiao?

572
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,039
I want to ask him

573
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:48,759
what's going on.

574
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,359
Your Highness.

575
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,960
After the diagnosis,

576
00:24:53,239 --> 00:24:55,840
Imperial Physician Xiao went missing.

577
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:57,039
I'm sure

578
00:24:57,159 --> 00:24:59,680
he was afraid of getting punished
by Your Highness and Your Majesty

579
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,960
so he escaped.

580
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:05,200
How absurd.

581
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:06,560
This...

582
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:08,720
This is all

583
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,560
Shen Miao's fault after all.

584
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,720
The morals of Lingzhou City

585
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,800
are getting worse.

586
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:18,960
Son.

587
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,480
Look at our plans.

588
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,359
It is ruined by Shen Miao.

589
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,119
If we don't get rid of her,

590
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:28,159
we can't make good use
of Song Xiyuan and Pei Yanzhen.

591
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,239
Mother.

592
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,519
You can't do that.

593
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:32,639
I promised Yanzhen.

594
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:33,999
Besides,

595
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:36,320
didn't you want to use Song Xiyuan too?

596
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:42,359
I was only saying.

597
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,560
The Shen family's fortune

598
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,879
is useful as well.

599
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,300
(Shen's Rice Shop)

600
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,560
Excuse me!

601
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:03,999
Excuse me.

602
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:12,359
Sir, we are quite close.

603
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,920
Why are you free to come here today?

604
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:18,519
Stop acting close to us,
Old Master Shen.

605
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,560
Let me tell you honestly.

606
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:21,359
Her Highness

607
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:22,999
ate some new rice
offered by the Shen family.

608
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,680
In less than five minutes,

609
00:26:25,879 --> 00:26:27,519
Her Highness was vomiting
and had diarrhea.

610
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,600
She felt unwell.

611
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:31,159
His Majesty immediately ordered
Shen's Rice Shop to be seized.

612
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,200
If Her Highness is fine,
nothing will happen.

613
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,279
If something happens,

614
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,239
the Shen family will be in deep trouble.

615
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,879
This is injustice!

616
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,039
The Shen family

617
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,200
has been running an honest business.

618
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,879
There won't be any mistakes.

619
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,239
Please inform His Majesty.

620
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,159
Tell him the Shen family is willing
to cooperate in your investigation.

621
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,320
Please ask His Majesty to believe us.

622
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:57,159
I'm sure you know clearly

623
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,600
what the Shen family did.

624
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,720
If you want Her Highness to recover,

625
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,359
you must treat the illness in her heart.

626
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,800
Old Master Shen,

627
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:06,519
what do you think?

628
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,320
Yes.

629
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,560
Old Master. This...

630
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,519
Don't tell Miao about this.

631
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,480
Yes.

632
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,039
Shen's Rice Shop has been seized?

633
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,039
It's true.

634
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,440
It was the Empress Dowager's order.

635
00:27:36,879 --> 00:27:37,440
What do you think

636
00:27:37,999 --> 00:27:39,320
is the intention behind her action?

637
00:27:39,639 --> 00:27:40,759
Lingzhou City has

638
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,680
some rumors about Miao.

639
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,560
I'm afraid Her highness thinks it will
affect the royal family's reputation

640
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:47,200
so she gave them some punishment.

641
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,119
Since it's nothing major,

642
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:50,440
it'll be fine

643
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,159
after a while

644
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:52,359
when the dust settles.

645
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,560
Regardless of her plot,

646
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,239
Miao should not be put in danger.

647
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:58,600
Zhan Yue.

648
00:27:58,879 --> 00:27:59,840
Bring Constable Zhao

649
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,519
and the rest
to protect the Shen family's business.

650
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:03,119
Report to me if anything happens.

651
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:03,920
Fine.

652
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,359
You should take care of yourself.

653
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:06,560
After the assassination,

654
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,080
Empress Dowager must be
suspecting that you know martial arts.

655
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,279
You should stay home and rest.

656
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:11,200
Don't do anything reckless.

657
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:12,560
Don't worry.

658
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,680
I know what to do.

659
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:18,800
Miaomiao.

660
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:19,920
What's wrong?

661
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,320
I rushed over

662
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,279
when I heard the news.

663
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,960
I thought

664
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,999
Yanzhen came to trouble you again.

665
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,320
You scared me.

666
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,399
What's wrong?

667
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,600
Do you miss the Song family?

668
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,119
Song Xiyuan.

669
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,800
Let's get a divorce.

670
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,080
Did my aunts say something to you?

671
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,560
Or Yanzhen?

672
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,119
These are not important.

673
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,600
Third Master Song.

674
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,560
I know you treat me well.

675
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:59,200
You treat the baby well too.

676
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,960
After thinking about it carefully,

677
00:29:02,879 --> 00:29:04,279
I think the marriage

678
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:05,039
is unfair to you.

679
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:08,320
Especially now.

680
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,879
Everyone is talking about
me and Pei Yanzhen.

681
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:14,720
This is bad for you

682
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,720
and the Song family...

683
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,600
Do you think

684
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,560
I am someone who cares
about these things?

685
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:20,999
Of course, not.

686
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,960
I don't want to harm you

687
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:24,600
because I see you as my friend.

688
00:29:28,239 --> 00:29:29,239
They say

689
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,879
a woman thinks a lot

690
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,720
when being pregnant.

691
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:34,680
Since you read many books,

692
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:36,320
it's even easier for you to overthink.

693
00:29:36,879 --> 00:29:37,440
All right.

694
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:40,039
Just stay in Shen's Residence.

695
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:41,840
I will visit you every day.

696
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:43,840
Third Master Song.

697
00:29:45,639 --> 00:29:47,200
You promised me before we get married.

698
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,920
You have to agree

699
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,840
whenever I want a divorce.

700
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,960
(Divorce Letter)
I am serious.

701
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,999
I even wrote the divorce letter.

702
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,159
Stamp your seal.

703
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,399
What if I go back on my words?

704
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:08,560
What?

705
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,560
What if I go back on my words?

706
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:11,960
Miaomiao.

707
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,519
You said back then

708
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,800
that we are both merchants.

709
00:30:15,239 --> 00:30:17,879
We only care about benefits.

710
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,920
Now that you are pregnant
with my daughter,

711
00:30:20,639 --> 00:30:21,800
this is different

712
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,960
from our initial deal.

713
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,399
If I let you go,

714
00:30:24,639 --> 00:30:26,159
who would compensate me a daughter?

715
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,600
What if...

716
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:33,159
What if Pei Yanzhen is the father?

717
00:30:34,639 --> 00:30:35,639
That's impossible.

718
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:37,359
There's no divorce at all.

719
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:38,680
I will go back on my words.

720
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:40,600
Merchants are all dishonest.

721
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:42,159
I will not let you go.

722
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:44,759
I suggest you give up.

723
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:46,440
Our marriage is a lie.

724
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,560
It's not a lie.

725
00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:49,840
It's a lie if I profit from it.

726
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,519
I married you because I did it for you.

727
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,159
How am I at fault?

728
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,960
Wait.

729
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,440
This is...

730
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:15,920
Why are you all standing there?

731
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,220
(Dream River Residence)

732
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:23,879
Father.

733
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,639
Why did you bring out
a lot of jewelry?

734
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:27,320
It's nothing.

735
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,840
You don't have to worry
in terms of business.

736
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:30,600
But...

737
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,359
That's right.

738
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,399
I'm going out for a few days.

739
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:37,039
Take good care of yourself at home.

740
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:38,999
Don't go out.

741
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:39,920
Understand?

742
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,519
Father.

743
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,879
If something happens in the family,

744
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,359
you must tell me.

745
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,960
I understand. I'm leaving.

746
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:55,879
Lvying.

747
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,320
Do you think

748
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,519
something's not right?

749
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:03,080
I had a quick look.

750
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:04,720
The jewelry

751
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,320
is worth tens of thousands of taels.

752
00:32:06,879 --> 00:32:09,200
What kind of business
requires so much money?

753
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,840
Do you think
there's trouble in the family?

754
00:32:15,511 --> 00:32:16,200
Anyway,

755
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:18,320
I have to

756
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,119
get the divorce soon

757
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:20,279
at a time like this.

758
00:32:20,879 --> 00:32:22,279
I shouldn't trouble anyone anymore.

759
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,399
Miss.

760
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,480
Is it necessary to dress like this?

761
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,560
Warriors do this
when they go out at night.

762
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,239
We sneaked here

763
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:41,239
to steal Song Xiyuan's stamp.

764
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,359
What will we do if other people find us?

765
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,600
You are the wife of the Song family.

766
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,080
Why don't we use the front gate?

767
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:48,800
Have you seen any warriors

768
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,920
who use the front gate?

769
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,080
Anyway,

770
00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:52,560
you must work with me today.

771
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,800
Don't make any mistakes.

772
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:54,920
But...

773
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,480
No buts.

774
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,399
We'll talk inside.

775
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:00,960
Young Master.

776
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,039
Official Pei is here.

777
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:07,519
What is the purpose of your visit,

778
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:08,800
Official Pei?

779
00:33:10,999 --> 00:33:12,800
Master Song is a businessman.

780
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,960
I'm sure you heard about
what happened to the Shen family.

781
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,519
I want to ask you

782
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,960
about the grudge
you have against Miaomiao

783
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:22,519
to the point of harming her like this.

784
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,080
What do you mean?

785
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,080
I'll be frank.

786
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,159
I've reached an agreement
with the Empress Dowager.

787
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:30,359
If you

788
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,239
don't trouble
my relationship with Miaomiao,

789
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:34,159
she will not
trouble the Shen family.

790
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:36,159
Although I don't know how Official Pei

791
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:37,639
offended the Empress Dowager,

792
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:39,639
I suggest you stay away from Miaomiao

793
00:33:40,239 --> 00:33:41,759
for her safety.

794
00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:44,999
Third Master, do you think

795
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,039
you can trust
the Empress Dowager's words?

796
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,880
(Conscience)

797
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,480
I don't care why you approach

798
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:53,080
the Shen family.

799
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:55,320
However, Miao is innocent.

800
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:57,600
No matter how we fight,

801
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,119
we should not involve her.

802
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,039
What a coincidence.

803
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,920
That's what I am thinking too.

804
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,840
What do you suggest, Official Pei?

805
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,599
The situation is like a game of chess.

806
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,799
It is always changing.

807
00:34:11,319 --> 00:34:13,200
I don't want a scary enemy

808
00:34:13,319 --> 00:34:14,520
like you.

809
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:16,720
Since we are both doing this for Miao,

810
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,839
why don't we work together?

811
00:34:19,319 --> 00:34:19,839
Work together?

812
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,920
How?

813
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,480
Are you going to split the baby

814
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,559
in half?

815
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,440
Let's not talk about the baby for now.

816
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,240
I wonder if you

817
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,599
are interested
in the position of court purveyor?

818
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,520
Do you have an idea?

819
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,040
I work for His Majesty.

820
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,119
The Empress Dowager has been
grasping power for a long time.

821
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,639
His Majesty has not been
feeling satisfied with it.

822
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,760
If you are willing to switch sides,

823
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,720
His Majesty will naturally grant you
the position of court purveyor.

824
00:34:58,159 --> 00:34:59,319
I'm sure you know

825
00:34:59,319 --> 00:35:01,440
there's no free lunch in this world.

826
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,040
Tell me, Pei Yanzhen.

827
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,559
Besides Miaomiao,

828
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,839
what are your conditions?

829
00:35:07,471 --> 00:35:10,150
When the Song's Trading Company
opens a shop in the capital,

830
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,760
I want you to be my ears.

831
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,559
Official Pei, do you trust me so much

832
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,000
and think I'm willing
to listen to your orders?

833
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,440
Rather than trusting you,

834
00:35:22,799 --> 00:35:23,760
I trust

835
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,639
your character
as a merchant who prioritizes benefits.

836
00:35:26,399 --> 00:35:27,240
In the royal court,

837
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,920
I'm the only person
who can give you what you want.

838
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:40,280
The night is long.

839
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:41,079
I still have

840
00:35:41,399 --> 00:35:43,079
many things to discuss with you,

841
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,159
Official Pei.

842
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:17,040
Zhao.

843
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,040
You are closest to Official Pei.

844
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,159
Do you think
the baby in Madam Song's stomach

845
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,839
belongs to our Master?

846
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,639
All of you are too naive.

847
00:36:28,879 --> 00:36:30,839
Official Pei

848
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:33,200
is incredible.

849
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:34,639
Do you think Third Master Song

850
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:36,040
can compare to him?

851
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,599
Not at all.

852
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:38,040
So,

853
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:41,000
there's no doubt about that.

854
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,559
No doubt.

855
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:43,040
Let's go.

856
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,559
Is that her?

857
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,599
It is.

858
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:06,760
Turns out

859
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,480
she is interested in me.

860
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:34,079
Third Master Song.

861
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:35,920
I'm doing this for your own good.

862
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:37,799
Since I can't find the stamp,

863
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,520
I have no choice

864
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,720
but to forge a divorce letter from you.

865
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,639
Don't blame me.

866
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:48,159
Third Brother.

867
00:37:51,799 --> 00:37:52,440
Third Brother.

868
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:54,799
Are you inside?

869
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:19,960
What are you doing?

870
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:22,480
Mother?

871
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:24,159
Why are you here?

872
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,680
I see light in his room

873
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,280
so I want to borrow some money.

874
00:38:30,799 --> 00:38:32,440
Are you going to the brothel again?

875
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:33,559
No.

876
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,440
I'm expanding the business

877
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,319
and having some fun with my friends.

878
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,319
Mother.

879
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,200
Didn't you say Official Pei is here?

880
00:38:41,996 --> 00:38:43,559
If I go there now,

881
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:45,639
do you think I can be acquainted?

882
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,520
Don't worry.

883
00:38:47,799 --> 00:38:49,319
I'm planning for you.

884
00:38:51,799 --> 00:38:54,000
I hired a group of men

885
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,159
to assassinate him
when he leaves the residence.

886
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,041
Then, you will help him.

887
00:38:58,559 --> 00:38:59,760
Official Pei

888
00:38:59,799 --> 00:39:01,960
will have to repay you
for saving his life.

889
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,440
Mother,

890
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,159
Official Pei is very intelligent.

891
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:08,799
If he finds out
about the assassination...

892
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,680
I'm not doing it.

893
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:12,599
Don't worry.

894
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,799
He is fighting

895
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,079
with your Third Brother
because of Shen Miao.

896
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:18,920
Who do you think

897
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:20,639
ordered the assassination?

898
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,760
In that case,

899
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,680
the position of
the leader of the Song family

900
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,799
will be ours.

901
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:30,799
Enough. Go.

902
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,000
Mother, what a wise move.

903
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,799
If I leave like this,

904
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,040
I probably won't
finish the divorce letter.

905
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,799
But Pei Yanzhen...

906
00:39:57,559 --> 00:39:58,720
I feel happy

907
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,960
to be your friend, Official Pei.

908
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:01,799
Please forgive me

909
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,639
if I offended you in the past.

910
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,079
Master Song, not at all.

911
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,960
It is an honor for me

912
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:08,280
to have a friend like you.

913
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:09,760
Then,

914
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:11,760
I'll be waiting for your good news,
Official Pei.

915
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:12,960
Don't worry, Master Song.

916
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:14,480
If you can let me know

917
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,079
the Empress Dowager's news in time,

918
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,799
I won't let you down.

919
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,720
Definitely.

920
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:21,799
Please.

921
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,720
Official Pei, take care.

922
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:38,960
Young Master.

923
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:40,518
Tonight,

924
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:42,119
someone entered your study.

925
00:40:43,799 --> 00:40:45,920
I'm sure it's Fifth Brother
and his mother.

926
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:46,760
Forget it.

927
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,520
They won't cause trouble for long.

928
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:51,280
Young Master,

929
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:52,639
why are you so sure

930
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,799
that Official Pei

931
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,960
can help you get
the position of court purveyor?

932
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:58,960
Tie Niu.

933
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:00,680
Look at me.

934
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,319
Do you think I look like a fool?

935
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:07,200
Why are you still working with him?

936
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:08,799
If I don't do that,

937
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,720
how can I

938
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,200
wrap him around my fingers?

939
00:41:11,799 --> 00:41:14,079
Pei Yanzhen is still too inexperienced

940
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:15,799
to be my match.

941
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:18,240
Young Master.

942
00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:20,159
Isn't that lying?

943
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:20,639
No.

944
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:22,359
I'm doing it to Yanzhen.

945
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:23,480
It doesn't count as lying.

946
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:58,839
Are you all right?

947
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,280
What are you doing?

948
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,799
Tie him up.

949
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:19,399
We'll bring him back for our reward.

950
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,559
Who are you?

951
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:22,839
How dare you assassinate me.

952
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:24,760
Attack him!
