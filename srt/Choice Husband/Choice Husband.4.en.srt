77
00:04:11,263 --> 00:04:15,623
that you asked me for a divorce before?

78
00:04:16,102 --> 00:04:16,582
Don't...

79
00:04:16,582 --> 00:04:17,262

80

81

83

You abandoned

84
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,023
and betrayed him.

85
00:04:21,023 --> 00:04:21,982
What a notorious woman.

86
00:04:21,982 --> 00:04:23,743
You're such a disgrace
to Lingzhou City.

87
00:04:24,102 --> 00:04:25,663
We can't let her off just like this.

88
00:04:25,822 --> 00:04:26,463
Hit her!

89
00:04:26,463 --> 00:04:27,023
Go!

90
00:04:27,343 --> 00:04:27,783
Hit her!

91
00:04:28,582 --> 00:04:29,142
I won't divorce him.

92
00:04:29,142 --> 00:04:29,862
I won't.

93
00:04:29,862 --> 00:04:31,023

94

97
00:04:33,422 --> 00:04:34,063

100
00:04:36,422 --> 00:04:36,943
Do it!

101
00:04:37,262 --> 00:04:38,422
Do it!

102
00:05:31,223 --> 00:05:31,822
Hey,

103
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,102
don't take this the wrong way.

104
00:05:34,582 --> 00:05:35,743
It was an accident last night.

105
00:05:36,223 --> 00:05:37,542
I'm not what you think I am.

106
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:39,223
An accident?

107
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:41,743
A misunderstanding?

108
00:05:42,063 --> 00:05:42,582
Yes.

109
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:08,783
This is too straightforward.

110
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:09,903
Let's try it another way.

111

you finally came back.

118
00:06:56,463 --> 00:06:57,183
What's the matter?

119
00:06:58,822 --> 00:06:59,702
It's for you.

120
00:07:02,343 --> 00:07:03,223
What is this?

121
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:05,343
Contraceptive herbs.

122
00:07:07,023 --> 00:07:08,582
As we've been friends for years,

123
00:07:08,582 --> 00:07:10,463
that's why I understand you so well.

124
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:11,023
What now?

125
00:07:11,262 --> 00:07:11,943
Is this one

126
00:07:11,943 --> 00:07:13,422
of your plans to win Shen Miao's heart?

127
00:07:15,422 --> 00:07:16,343
Who asked you to prepare this?

128
00:07:18,663 --> 00:07:19,582
I woke up early

129
00:07:19,582 --> 00:07:20,582
to prepare this for you.

130
00:07:20,582 --> 00:07:21,463
To tie up a loose end.

131

But you

132
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:23,422
don't appreciate it.

133
00:07:24,183 --> 00:07:25,463
What kind of attitude is this?

134
00:07:28,262 --> 00:07:28,783
I...

135
00:07:30,582 --> 00:07:32,262
Do you really fall for Shen Miao?

136

Shen Miao and I...

137

What happened last night

138
00:07:38,343 --> 00:07:39,343
was a misunderstanding.

139
00:07:39,582 --> 00:07:40,582

Jing De,

172

don't you think it's hilarious?

173
00:09:24,303 --> 00:09:25,502
To me,

174
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,742
we've already won this war.

175
00:09:30,463 --> 00:09:31,622
But now,

176
00:09:32,582 --> 00:09:34,582
if anyone tries to turn things around

177
00:09:34,582 --> 00:09:35,983
and change the situation,

178
00:09:38,103 --> 00:09:39,463
I'll rather kill the wrong person

179
00:09:39,983 --> 00:09:41,983
than giving him this chance.

180
00:09:49,942 --> 00:09:50,822
What is this?

181
00:09:51,062 --> 00:09:52,303
Is this a ginseng or a snow lotus?

182
00:09:54,622 --> 00:09:55,702
It smells nice and sweet.

183
00:09:55,903 --> 00:09:56,822
You can't finish it.

184
00:09:56,822 --> 00:09:57,543
Let me try it for you.

185
00:09:58,262 --> 00:09:58,742
No.

186
00:10:04,142 --> 00:10:05,343
We already slept together

187
00:10:07,463 --> 00:10:08,423
yesterday.

188
00:10:08,783 --> 00:10:09,983
You still won't share

189
00:10:09,983 --> 00:10:11,303
this bowl of soup with me?

190
00:10:11,983 --> 00:10:12,983
I must drink it today.

191
00:10:16,622 --> 00:10:17,142
Wait.

192

let me ask you.

195
00:10:24,463 --> 00:10:26,103
If someone has been lying and using you,

196
00:10:26,103 --> 00:10:26,863
what will you do?

197
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:29,663
If it's the case,

198
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:30,702
it must be a bad person.

199
00:10:31,142 --> 00:10:32,502
I won't see him anymore.

200
00:10:32,742 --> 00:10:33,783
What if you see each other every day

201
00:10:33,783 --> 00:10:34,663
that you're inseparable?

202
00:10:35,942 --> 00:10:36,702
It's not hard.

203
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,062
Just ignore him

204
00:10:38,062 --> 00:10:39,622
and don't take it to heart.

205
00:10:45,663 --> 00:10:46,303
What's wrong?

206
00:10:46,903 --> 00:10:48,903
Did you encounter some sort of problem?

207
00:10:50,543 --> 00:10:51,103
Nothing.

208

209

argued with his wife.

Let me ask you.

Official Pei, let me ask you.

286
00:15:38,182 --> 00:15:39,822
You stayed overnight
at the brothel a few days ago.

287
00:15:40,182 --> 00:15:41,863
You're supposed to be on duty today

288
00:15:42,223 --> 00:15:43,502
but you're late.

289
00:15:43,502 --> 00:15:44,223
Why is that?

290
00:15:44,463 --> 00:15:45,303
This is outrageous.

291
00:15:45,742 --> 00:15:48,182
How did you know
where I stayed overnight?

292
00:15:50,903 --> 00:15:52,262
Well, I...

293
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,822
Well,

294
00:15:53,822 --> 00:15:54,742
it's because

295
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:57,223
everyone in the city knows about this.

296
00:15:59,182 --> 00:16:00,023
I forgot

297
00:16:00,423 --> 00:16:02,343
that it was you
who invited me over that night.

298
00:16:02,343 --> 00:16:03,062
I wonder

299
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,303
why you didn't show up.

300
00:16:04,622 --> 00:16:07,023
Were you trying to set me up?

301
00:16:07,343 --> 00:16:09,622
But the plan went wrong

302
00:16:10,062 --> 00:16:12,463
so you changed it.

303

Remember this.

306
00:16:18,983 --> 00:16:21,023
You're just a low-rank magistrate.

307
00:16:21,142 --> 00:16:22,062
You only achieve

308
00:16:22,223 --> 00:16:24,742
a small achievement
in disaster relief.

309
00:16:25,983 --> 00:16:27,103
Yet, you're insolent about it.

310
00:16:27,543 --> 00:16:30,942
Did you forget who's your superior?

311
00:16:31,262 --> 00:16:32,343
By the rules of etiquette,

312
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:35,182
the Magistrate is the superior
of the county official.

313
00:16:35,622 --> 00:16:36,622
But don't you forget,

314
00:16:36,983 --> 00:16:38,103
by laws,

315
00:16:38,103 --> 00:16:39,103
the corrupted

316
00:16:39,502 --> 00:16:41,783
can't hold the position of magistrate.

317
00:16:42,223 --> 00:16:42,822
Nonsense.

318
00:16:44,182 --> 00:16:45,343
How dare you!

319
00:16:45,983 --> 00:16:46,622
Stop!

00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,062
Pei is your subordinate,

324
00:16:54,343 --> 00:16:55,343
but there are laws.

325
00:16:55,702 --> 00:16:56,863
If he does slack off,

326
00:16:56,863 --> 00:16:58,423
just punish him
in accordance with the rules.

327
00:16:58,423 --> 00:16:59,863
How could you hit him like this?

328

You can't be wilding out in there.

331

So you know my surname is Shen.

332
00:17:06,982 --> 00:17:08,102
Then, don't you forget

333

that Official Pei is
the son-in-law of the Shen family.

a memorial and sends it
to the palace with the tribute,

337
00:17:20,183 --> 00:17:21,462

338
00:17:22,102 --> 00:17:23,342
the emperor will do?

339
00:17:30,862 --> 00:17:31,502
Pei,

340
00:17:32,262 --> 00:17:33,023
just you wait.

341
00:17:33,423 --> 00:17:34,342
You wait and see!

342
00:17:37,742 --> 00:17:38,382
Official Jia,

343
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:39,622
you just leave like this?

344
00:17:39,622 --> 00:17:40,982
Get lost!

345
00:17:41,183 --> 00:17:42,943
I was going to make you a pot of tea.

346
00:17:43,023 --> 00:17:43,703
Official Jia,

347
00:17:43,903 --> 00:17:44,543
see you.

348
00:17:44,823 --> 00:17:45,303
Dear,

349
00:17:45,943 --> 00:17:46,622
are you alright?

350
00:17:46,943 --> 00:17:47,742
Did you get hurt?

351
00:17:47,823 --> 00:17:49,382
Why didn't you avoid his attack?

352
00:17:50,342 --> 00:17:50,783
I...

353
00:17:53,102 --> 00:17:53,742
He's fine.

354
00:18:03,622 --> 00:18:04,423
Why are you here?

355
00:18:05,222 --> 00:18:05,783
Why?

356
00:18:06,063 --> 00:18:07,342
You were nowhere to be seen.

357
00:18:07,543 --> 00:18:08,742
Can't I come and find you?

358
00:18:09,303 --> 00:18:10,462
If I came here late,

359
00:18:10,462 --> 00:18:11,063
that Jia

360
00:18:11,063 --> 00:18:12,462
would've bullied you.

361
00:18:12,742 --> 00:18:14,063
Forget it, let's not talk about him.

362
00:18:15,142 --> 00:18:15,622
Dear,

363
00:18:16,903 --> 00:18:17,943
come home with me.

364
00:18:18,262 --> 00:18:19,222
I've got something for you.

365
00:18:20,063 --> 00:18:21,823
I should comply with your request.

366
00:18:22,423 --> 00:18:23,183
It's just

367
00:18:23,742 --> 00:18:24,823
I've got a lot of work

368
00:18:26,462 --> 00:18:28,423
to do in the county yamen.

369
00:18:29,382 --> 00:18:29,982
Official,

370
00:18:30,303 --> 00:18:32,342
feel free to go home with Mrs. Pei.

371
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,063
We'll take care of the affairs.

372
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:36,342
Yes, we're here.

373
00:18:40,023 --> 00:18:40,583
Let's go.

374
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:45,183
Stand in position.

375
00:18:47,622 --> 00:18:49,783
Goodbye, Mrs. Pei.

376
00:18:52,502 --> 00:18:53,943
You don't have to come back.

377
00:19:03,222 --> 00:19:03,903
Look.

378
00:19:04,183 --> 00:19:05,663
Official Pei is good

379
00:19:05,663 --> 00:19:07,222
at being a dignified kept man.

380
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,102
Indeed, indeed.

381
00:19:12,742 --> 00:19:15,102
There are many public affairs
to handle today.

382
00:19:15,382 --> 00:19:16,982
But Official Pei is not around.

383
00:19:18,063 --> 00:19:18,663
Let's take the day off.

384
00:19:19,462 --> 00:19:20,142
Sure, let's go.

385
00:19:29,783 --> 00:19:31,262
I see why you ask me to get changed.

386
00:19:31,342 --> 00:19:32,823
So this is what you mentioned?

387
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:35,303
I've thought about it.

388
00:19:35,622 --> 00:19:37,423
You work in the official circles.

389
00:19:37,423 --> 00:19:38,663
You'll inevitably encounter
some bad guys.

390
00:19:38,943 --> 00:19:39,622
And I

391
00:19:39,622 --> 00:19:41,502
can't stay by your side and protect you

392
00:19:41,502 --> 00:19:42,262
all the time.

393
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:43,222
Therefore,

394
00:19:43,663 --> 00:19:44,622
you have to learn martial arts.

395
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,183
Learn martial arts?

396
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:50,102
- Well, it's...
- It's a good idea, isn't it?

397
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:53,583
Your foundation is poor

398
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:54,663
and you get a late start,

399
00:19:54,663 --> 00:19:55,423
but it's alright.

400
00:19:55,663 --> 00:19:56,543
A great teacher produces
skilled students.

401
00:19:56,622 --> 00:19:57,543
If you work hard,

402
00:19:57,543 --> 00:19:58,783
everything is possible.

403
00:19:59,142 --> 00:19:59,742
Let's begin.

404
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,303
Come here.

405
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,142
As the saying goes,
the longer, the stronger.

406
00:20:20,543 --> 00:20:23,023
You'll be invincible with this spear.

407
00:20:24,303 --> 00:20:25,742
But this spear is too long,

408
00:20:26,543 --> 00:20:28,142
how am I supposed to bring it with me?

409
00:20:29,783 --> 00:20:30,303
Right.

410
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,262
This will do.

411
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,462
A sword is suitable
for a humble gentleman.

412
00:20:43,063 --> 00:20:43,663
It fits you.

413
00:20:51,663 --> 00:20:52,462
Pei Yanzhen!

414
00:20:56,663 --> 00:20:57,622
You can't do it like this.

415
00:20:57,622 --> 00:20:58,183
Watch me.

416
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:58,903
Move aside.

417
00:21:01,142 --> 00:21:01,742
Look.

418
00:21:12,423 --> 00:21:13,663
That's impressive, Miao.

419
00:21:13,943 --> 00:21:14,583
Just you wait.

420
00:21:14,783 --> 00:21:16,102
There's another big trick.

421
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:58,703
I...

422
00:21:59,462 --> 00:22:00,903
Am I that good?

423
00:22:01,943 --> 00:22:02,583
Sword qi.

424
00:22:03,142 --> 00:22:05,382
So this is the legendary sword qi.

425
00:22:08,023 --> 00:22:09,342
This is a spear.

426
00:22:11,142 --> 00:22:12,183
You're right.

427
00:22:13,423 --> 00:22:14,303
Let's continue.

428
00:22:14,303 --> 00:22:14,903
Never mind.

429
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:16,783
I've got work to do,

430
00:22:17,142 --> 00:22:18,023
I'm going back to yamen.

431
00:22:18,862 --> 00:22:19,342
Pei...

432
00:22:19,543 --> 00:22:20,102
Pei...

433
00:22:39,823 --> 00:22:40,583
Guard the door.

434
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:41,543
Don't let anyone come in.

435
00:22:41,783 --> 00:22:42,222
Yes.

436
00:23:10,502 --> 00:23:12,063
You try to threaten me?

437
00:23:12,862 --> 00:23:15,063
You need to see
if you have the ability to do it.

438
00:23:40,943 --> 00:23:42,142
The national treasury is empty now.

439
00:23:42,663 --> 00:23:44,303
There's no money for us
to repair the dam.

440
00:23:45,142 --> 00:23:45,943
A low-rank magistrate

441
00:23:46,783 --> 00:23:48,303
actually embezzled
ten thousand taels.

442
00:23:48,823 --> 00:23:49,663
Yet, none of the officials

443
00:23:49,982 --> 00:23:51,023
knew about it.

444
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:52,583
Where is the Ministry of Personnel?

445
00:23:55,222 --> 00:23:56,183
Calm down, Your Majesty.

446
00:23:56,382 --> 00:23:56,903
I...

447
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:58,303
It was a weak oversight of mine.

448
00:23:58,583 --> 00:23:59,502
I deserve to die.

449
00:23:59,502 --> 00:24:00,543
A weak oversight?

450
00:24:01,183 --> 00:24:02,382
If it was the case,

451
00:24:02,862 --> 00:24:04,382
you wouldn't deserve to die.

452
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:06,462
It's clearly written in the book.

453
00:24:06,823 --> 00:24:09,183
That how, when
and where Magistrate Jia bribed

454
00:24:10,142 --> 00:24:12,663
the leading officials,
everything is right there.

455
00:24:13,102 --> 00:24:13,943
You still deny it!

456
00:24:15,222 --> 00:24:16,423
Well, this...

457
00:24:16,543 --> 00:24:17,102
Someone!

458
00:24:17,943 --> 00:24:19,342
Send this fraudster

459
00:24:19,622 --> 00:24:20,703
to prison.

460
00:24:21,703 --> 00:24:22,342
Mercy, Your Majesty!

461
00:24:22,663 --> 00:24:23,903
Mercy, Your Majesty!

462
00:24:24,342 --> 00:24:25,742
Mercy, Your Majesty!

463
00:24:26,183 --> 00:24:29,183
We deserve to die.

464
00:24:29,622 --> 00:24:32,423
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

465
00:24:38,622 --> 00:24:40,783
His Majesty is not feeling well today.

466
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:42,502
Anything to report?

467
00:24:42,742 --> 00:24:43,823
If not, dismiss.

468
00:24:47,023 --> 00:24:48,063
Your Majesty,

469
00:24:48,703 --> 00:24:50,742
the citizens in Lingzhou City said

470
00:24:51,183 --> 00:24:55,063
that Official Pei Yanzhen
and his wife, Shen,

471
00:24:55,303 --> 00:24:57,303
have done a lot of good deeds
in Lingzhou City.

472
00:24:57,502 --> 00:24:58,622
They restored the granary

473
00:24:59,063 --> 00:25:00,102
through food-for-work programs

474
00:25:00,382 --> 00:25:01,663
for the benefit of the people.

475
00:25:02,102 --> 00:25:04,943
They kindly ask the imperial court
to promote Pei Yanzhen.

476
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:16,663
Pei is the scholar of our dynasty

477
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:18,982
and the main meritorious person
in this bribery case.

478
00:25:19,703 --> 00:25:20,382
Dear Officials,

479
00:25:20,943 --> 00:25:21,943
what do you think

480
00:25:22,823 --> 00:25:24,142
about this promotion?

481
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:26,943
Your Majesty,

482
00:25:27,342 --> 00:25:28,262
the Shen family

483
00:25:28,262 --> 00:25:29,823
has made a lot of achievements.

484
00:25:30,303 --> 00:25:32,382
Since this is the request
of the citizens,

485
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:34,543
let's do as they wish.

486
00:25:34,943 --> 00:25:36,222
And like you said,

487
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:39,063
Pei Yanzhen is a talented scholar.

488
00:25:39,262 --> 00:25:40,423
Whether to promote him,

489
00:25:40,543 --> 00:25:42,102
it's your decision, Your Majesty.

490
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,703
It's your decision, Your Majesty.

491
00:25:49,943 --> 00:25:51,742
Since there's no objection,

492
00:25:52,423 --> 00:25:53,342
let's promote

493
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:57,502
Pei Yanzhen as Magistrate
of Lingzhou City as the people wish.

494
00:25:59,543 --> 00:26:01,183
Boatman, when did the goods arrive?

495
00:26:01,502 --> 00:26:02,303
Is it fresh?

496
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:05,183
Official Pei,

497
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:06,423
congratulations on your promotion.

498
00:26:06,862 --> 00:26:07,982
You're now the Magistrate.

499
00:26:08,262 --> 00:26:09,183
The corrupted official is evicted.

500
00:26:09,183 --> 00:26:10,183
With Official Pei around,

501
00:26:10,183 --> 00:26:11,862
we people are blessed.

502
00:26:12,183 --> 00:26:12,742
Yes.

503
00:26:12,823 --> 00:26:13,622
You've flattered me.

504
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:16,703
Be it the county official
or the magistrate,

505
00:26:17,023 --> 00:26:18,622
I won't change my initial objective.

506
00:26:23,703 --> 00:26:24,943
Official Pei is a nice person.

507
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:25,742
With him around,

508
00:26:25,742 --> 00:26:26,943
we're reassured.

509
00:26:26,943 --> 00:26:28,903
Indeed, he's a good official.

510
00:26:29,142 --> 00:26:29,502
Yes.

511
00:26:29,703 --> 00:26:30,303
Boatman,

512
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:31,183
set sail.

513
00:26:33,023 --> 00:26:33,583
Master Wu,

514
00:26:33,903 --> 00:26:36,023
the business in Lingzhou City
has been keeping up lately.

515
00:26:37,142 --> 00:26:38,183
Indeed.

516
00:26:38,502 --> 00:26:39,862
But it's far behind the Shen family.

517
00:26:41,823 --> 00:26:43,382
You're resourceful.

518
00:26:43,663 --> 00:26:44,703
Besides rising through the ranks,

519
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:46,462
you even drag
the Ministry of Personnel down,

520
00:26:46,903 --> 00:26:49,063
I hereby congratulate you.

521
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:51,222
But this is just the beginning.

522
00:26:51,982 --> 00:26:53,943
It's premature to celebrate it now.

523
00:26:55,703 --> 00:26:58,102
You agitate the official circles
in Lingzhou City alone.

524
00:26:58,382 --> 00:27:00,742
You're in Lingzhou City but control
everything that's miles away.

525
00:27:00,742 --> 00:27:02,142
You don't have to be so humble.

526
00:27:02,943 --> 00:27:03,663
But,

527
00:27:03,903 --> 00:27:05,462
why are you so enthusiastic

528
00:27:05,823 --> 00:27:07,183
about taking a boat all of a sudden?

529
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:09,183
I...

530
00:27:11,742 --> 00:27:12,982
I just don't want to stay at home.

531
00:27:15,142 --> 00:27:17,183
Are you afraid of seeing Shen Miao?

532
00:27:20,862 --> 00:27:22,742
Shen Miao helps you
get promoted this time.

533
00:27:23,303 --> 00:27:24,142
But Empress Dowager

534
00:27:24,903 --> 00:27:26,462
will surely get suspicious of you.

535
00:27:27,023 --> 00:27:28,023
You should be worried.

536
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:32,423
Hope that she only takes it out on me.

537
00:27:34,102 --> 00:27:34,663
Zhan Yue,

538
00:27:35,502 --> 00:27:36,583
I dragged Miao into this mess

539
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:38,943
for my own interests.

540
00:27:40,183 --> 00:27:40,823
Is it wrong

541
00:27:42,262 --> 00:27:43,063
for me to do this?

542
00:27:43,543 --> 00:27:44,982
I don't get to decide that.

543
00:27:46,262 --> 00:27:47,183
But a few days ago,

544
00:27:47,303 --> 00:27:48,783
you nearly gave yourself away
before Shen Miao.

545
00:27:49,703 --> 00:27:50,462
I have to remind you.

546
00:27:51,222 --> 00:27:52,262
The trouble is approaching,

547
00:27:52,663 --> 00:27:53,783
you can't be confused.

548
00:28:11,303 --> 00:28:11,862
Mother,

549
00:28:12,423 --> 00:28:15,063
there are many documents
that I need to read today.

550
00:28:15,823 --> 00:28:16,462
I think...

551
00:28:16,462 --> 00:28:16,982
What now?

552
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,063
Are you not willing
to accompany an old woman like me?

553
00:28:21,342 --> 00:28:22,023
I dare not.

554
00:28:24,862 --> 00:28:26,543
Come out and take a walk more often.

555
00:28:26,943 --> 00:28:29,862
It's bad for your health
if you always stay in the study room.

556
00:28:30,703 --> 00:28:31,262
Noted.

557
00:28:35,783 --> 00:28:36,342
Mother,

558
00:28:36,862 --> 00:28:38,462
the peony flowers have bloomed.

559
00:28:42,943 --> 00:28:43,742
Jingde,

560
00:28:44,342 --> 00:28:46,102
uproot the tallest flower

561
00:28:46,102 --> 00:28:47,982
over there for me.

562
00:28:48,382 --> 00:28:48,903
Yes.

563
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:50,663
Mother,

564
00:28:51,222 --> 00:28:52,262
that's the most gorgeous one.

565
00:28:53,303 --> 00:28:54,102
Why would you uproot it?

566
00:28:56,102 --> 00:28:58,183
It indeed outshines the others.

567
00:28:58,943 --> 00:29:00,703
But to the flowers around it,

568
00:29:00,943 --> 00:29:02,183
it's out of line.

569
00:29:02,982 --> 00:29:03,943
It's not only the flower,

570
00:29:04,423 --> 00:29:05,742
the same goes for the people.

571
00:29:07,502 --> 00:29:09,183
It's the pillars that support

572
00:29:09,423 --> 00:29:10,583
the house.

573
00:29:11,063 --> 00:29:12,222
But those that pop out are

574
00:29:12,222 --> 00:29:13,543
trying to show off.

575
00:29:14,703 --> 00:29:16,543
And he's got the support
of the Shen family.

576
00:29:17,102 --> 00:29:19,303
He'll rise sooner or later.

577
00:29:20,982 --> 00:29:22,183
Do you understand, son?

578
00:29:27,342 --> 00:29:28,742
Next,

579
00:29:29,342 --> 00:29:31,303
no matter what happens
in Lingzhou City,

580
00:29:32,423 --> 00:29:33,943
you're not allowed to meddle in it.

581
00:29:36,703 --> 00:29:37,262
Noted.

582
00:29:51,142 --> 00:29:52,183
Yanzhen?

583
00:29:57,862 --> 00:29:58,462
Pei Yanzhen.

584
00:29:59,903 --> 00:30:00,502
Look.

585
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,720
(Pei's Rice Shop)

586
00:30:05,982 --> 00:30:07,342
I don't know if you're moved.

587
00:30:08,543 --> 00:30:09,183
But along the way,

588
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:10,063
with such a heavy investment,

589
00:30:10,502 --> 00:30:11,663
I'm moved for real.

590
00:30:14,502 --> 00:30:15,543
Shadow puppets.

591
00:30:15,543 --> 00:30:16,742
The latest shadow puppets.

592
00:30:16,742 --> 00:30:18,063
A scholar and a beauty.

593
00:30:18,063 --> 00:30:19,262
Come and take a look.

594
00:30:20,783 --> 00:30:21,423
Official Pei,

595
00:30:21,742 --> 00:30:22,903
what a pleasant surprise.

596
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:24,622
See if there's anything you like.

597
00:30:24,742 --> 00:30:25,663
You can have it for free.

598
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:30,943
Mister,

599
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:32,982
this is the material used
to make shadow puppets.

600
00:30:33,462 --> 00:30:34,183
Official Pei,

601
00:30:34,183 --> 00:30:35,342
what an excellent choice.

602
00:30:35,622 --> 00:30:38,063
This is made
with the finest donkey skin.

603
00:30:38,262 --> 00:30:40,142
This is the only one
in the entire Lingzhou City.

604
00:30:41,023 --> 00:30:42,222
Can you sell it to me?

605
00:30:42,862 --> 00:30:44,703
Just take it if you like.

606
00:30:44,982 --> 00:30:46,903
How would I dare to take your money?

607
00:30:47,543 --> 00:30:48,982
This is a gift for my wife.

608
00:30:48,982 --> 00:30:49,823
I certainly have to pay for it.

609
00:30:51,063 --> 00:30:51,622
Sure.

610
00:30:51,823 --> 00:30:52,862
I'll pack it for you.

611
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:54,703
Official Pei,

612
00:30:54,703 --> 00:30:55,342
here you go.

613
00:30:56,142 --> 00:30:56,862
Thank you, Official Pei.

614
00:30:59,023 --> 00:30:59,663
Goodbye.

615
00:31:03,342 --> 00:31:04,303
Shadow puppet.

616
00:31:05,222 --> 00:31:05,583
What are you doing?

617
00:31:11,382 --> 00:31:12,183
Miao is the benefactor

618
00:31:12,183 --> 00:31:13,303
of this promotion.

619
00:31:13,742 --> 00:31:15,703
I should thank her as a courtesy.

620
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:18,262
I always run errands for you.

621
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,063
You should make a pair for me first.

622
00:31:20,703 --> 00:31:21,943
Didn't you have monthly wages?

623
00:31:22,342 --> 00:31:24,222
Just buy it yourself if you want.

624
00:31:28,063 --> 00:31:28,703
Official Pei.

625
00:31:39,543 --> 00:31:40,222
Aunt,

626
00:31:40,903 --> 00:31:42,943
why do you invite me over
to watch the show?

627
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:44,903
Of course it's to congratulate you.

628
00:31:46,462 --> 00:31:47,583
Weren't you always worried

629
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:49,303
that you'd feel sorry for him

630
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:51,023
if you divorced him?

631
00:31:51,262 --> 00:31:52,982
Now that the transfer order
of Magistrate is issued.

632
00:31:53,262 --> 00:31:54,382
He has risen through three ranks.

633
00:31:54,382 --> 00:31:55,583
That's so lucky of him.

634
00:31:56,063 --> 00:31:57,462
You can divorce him at ease now.

635
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:02,502
Miaomiao, are you not happy?

636
00:32:05,063 --> 00:32:05,943
I'm happy.

637
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:07,423
I'm super excited.

638
00:32:08,023 --> 00:32:09,063
I can finally divorce him.

639
00:32:09,502 --> 00:32:11,222
I can finally realize
my dream of becoming

640
00:32:11,423 --> 00:32:12,903
a heroine who wanders around the world.

641
00:32:13,543 --> 00:32:14,583
I want this more than anything else.

642
00:32:14,943 --> 00:32:15,943
Great, then.

643
00:32:29,023 --> 00:32:30,543
Wife.

644
00:32:30,543 --> 00:32:32,102
Husband.

645
00:32:32,102 --> 00:32:36,222
We were separated

646
00:32:36,423 --> 00:32:39,742
on our wedding day.

647
00:32:39,903 --> 00:32:40,783
Husband,

648
00:32:40,783 --> 00:32:43,423
are you alright?

649
00:32:43,423 --> 00:32:44,862
Miss, Miss!

650
00:32:45,823 --> 00:32:50,142
Luckily, someone came to rescue me.

651
00:32:50,382 --> 00:32:52,703
But who was it

652
00:32:53,063 --> 00:32:57,382
that kidnapped you on the wedding day?

653
00:32:57,663 --> 00:33:03,262
My poor husband.

654
00:33:04,703 --> 00:33:05,862
Official,

655
00:33:06,023 --> 00:33:08,102
Miss was very upset

656
00:33:08,303 --> 00:33:10,102
to part with you.

657
00:33:10,382 --> 00:33:13,142
It has spread across Lingzhou City.

658
00:33:13,142 --> 00:33:15,342
The rich young lady married
the county official.

659
00:33:15,622 --> 00:33:19,903
And her husband was abducted
on their wedding day.

660
00:33:19,903 --> 00:33:20,543
Miss.

661
00:33:21,183 --> 00:33:23,142
The rich young lady married
the county official.

662
00:33:23,303 --> 00:33:24,423
And her husband was abducted
on their wedding day.

663
00:33:24,742 --> 00:33:26,423
Isn't this the story
about you and Master?

664
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:29,183
Stop!

665
00:33:30,823 --> 00:33:31,903
How dare you

666
00:33:32,423 --> 00:33:34,742
do a show
about the Shen family and Official Pei?

667
00:33:35,423 --> 00:33:36,303
Please calm down, Madam.

668
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:38,663
This show is created
by the imperial troupe.

669
00:33:38,903 --> 00:33:40,622
I didn't know this is about Miss Shen.

670
00:33:42,423 --> 00:33:43,183
Aunt,

671
00:33:43,663 --> 00:33:44,423
don't be mad.

672
00:33:45,063 --> 00:33:46,423
This is not surprising.

673
00:33:46,423 --> 00:33:47,583
Our family is big and well-off.

674
00:33:47,823 --> 00:33:48,783
And I'm young and pretty.

675
00:33:48,783 --> 00:33:50,903
It's not surprising to be put on a show.

676
00:33:53,063 --> 00:33:53,903
Let me ask you.

677
00:33:54,262 --> 00:33:56,382
What's the latter part of the story?

678
00:33:56,903 --> 00:34:00,183
Is it that we're a match in heaven,

679
00:34:00,303 --> 00:34:01,303
a well-matched couple,

680
00:34:01,423 --> 00:34:02,423
and we're meant for each other?

681
00:34:04,222 --> 00:34:04,903
You may leave.

682
00:34:06,423 --> 00:34:07,183
Miss, Madam,

683
00:34:07,423 --> 00:34:08,742
Pei's clan leader is here.

684
00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:10,422
Old Master asks you two to come over.

685
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:18,303
Miao.

686
00:34:18,422 --> 00:34:19,023
Lvying.

687
00:34:21,662 --> 00:34:22,422
Yanzhen,

688
00:34:23,343 --> 00:34:24,422
what's going on?

689
00:34:24,742 --> 00:34:26,383
What is all this fuss about?

690
00:34:26,422 --> 00:34:27,383
Calm down, Father-in-law.

691
00:34:27,422 --> 00:34:28,583
Maybe it's because I've got promoted,

692
00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:30,303
so the clan leader brings men over
to celebrate it.

693
00:34:31,422 --> 00:34:33,702
But it doesn't look like
they're here to celebrate.

694
00:34:34,023 --> 00:34:35,422
It's more like
they're here to raise hell.

695
00:34:35,662 --> 00:34:36,422
Right.

696
00:34:37,023 --> 00:34:37,662
Don't panic.

697
00:34:38,623 --> 00:34:39,422
We'll see.

698
00:34:44,143 --> 00:34:46,143
You this shameless brat!

699
00:34:46,343 --> 00:34:47,303
You deserve a beating!

700
00:34:47,303 --> 00:34:47,783
What are you doing?

701
00:34:47,783 --> 00:34:48,303
Clan leader,

702
00:34:48,662 --> 00:34:49,422
what is this about?

703
00:34:51,262 --> 00:34:53,143
It's a misfortune.

704
00:34:54,543 --> 00:34:55,143
Yanzhen,

705
00:34:55,902 --> 00:34:58,662
(Pei's Clan Leader)
you must divorce your wife today.

706
00:35:01,502 --> 00:35:02,103
Well...

707
00:35:05,383 --> 00:35:06,422
What do you mean by that?

708
00:35:07,222 --> 00:35:08,303
Miao and I are a match

709
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:08,902
made in heaven.

710
00:35:08,902 --> 00:35:09,702
Why would I divorce her?

711
00:35:11,262 --> 00:35:12,303
Come.

712
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,143
See for yourself.

713
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:16,583
This is a disgrace to the clan.

714
00:35:16,902 --> 00:35:18,063
You've shamed

715
00:35:18,063 --> 00:35:20,623
the Pei family.

716
00:35:22,222 --> 00:35:22,902
Dear,

717
00:35:23,383 --> 00:35:25,783
you Pei family is indeed
a literary family.

718
00:35:25,902 --> 00:35:27,143
(Pei Yanzhen  Pei Qisheng)
The bloodlines are fruitful.

719
00:35:29,902 --> 00:35:30,783
You've flattered me.

720
00:35:31,902 --> 00:35:34,103
You and I will have many kids as well.

721
00:35:36,383 --> 00:35:36,902
My foot.

722
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:39,023
Shen,

723
00:35:39,222 --> 00:35:40,262
take a good look at this.

724
00:35:41,103 --> 00:35:43,863
What is the relationship
between you and Yanzhen?

725
00:35:48,623 --> 00:35:50,143
(Shen Zai  Shen Miao)
Shen from Pei family.

726
00:35:50,662 --> 00:35:52,023
Aren't we husband and wife?

727
00:35:53,303 --> 00:35:55,422
He's your mother's grandfather's

728
00:35:55,422 --> 00:35:57,343
distant cousin's brother-in-law's

729
00:35:57,343 --> 00:35:58,783
concubine's niece-in-law's

730
00:35:58,783 --> 00:36:00,863
sister-in-law's distant nephew.

731
00:36:02,222 --> 00:36:03,902
Shen Miao's grandfather's

732
00:36:03,902 --> 00:36:06,422
distant cousin's brother-in-law's
concubine's

733
00:36:06,422 --> 00:36:09,422
niece-in-law's sister-in-law's
distant nephew.

734
00:36:09,902 --> 00:36:13,543
So Aunt Shen Miao is Uncle Pei Yanzhen's...

735
00:36:14,662 --> 00:36:16,742
Very distant niece.

736
00:36:17,902 --> 00:36:18,543
How is it?

737
00:36:18,902 --> 00:36:19,623
Am I amazing?

738
00:36:19,623 --> 00:36:20,783
You're so smart.

739
00:36:20,902 --> 00:36:22,742
It's my pleasure to marry you.

740
00:36:25,702 --> 00:36:27,422
You're trying to drive me to my grave.

741
00:36:27,702 --> 00:36:28,623
A niece

742
00:36:28,623 --> 00:36:29,823
married her uncle.

743
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:30,902
You dishonor the ancestors.

744
00:36:30,902 --> 00:36:32,103
It's a disgrace to the family.

745
00:36:32,262 --> 00:36:35,103
It's ridiculous!

746
00:36:35,783 --> 00:36:38,383
You must get a divorce today.

747
00:36:38,383 --> 00:36:39,823
It's not negotiable!

748
00:36:45,422 --> 00:36:46,303
What if I refuse?

749
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:49,262
The people out there made it

750
00:36:49,783 --> 00:36:50,902
sound so awful.

751
00:36:51,343 --> 00:36:52,742
The pillar of the Pei family has

752
00:36:52,742 --> 00:36:53,783
been discredited.

753
00:36:54,063 --> 00:36:55,422
We, Pei family, have been a noble

754
00:36:55,783 --> 00:36:56,543
and renowned family

755
00:36:56,543 --> 00:36:57,783
in Lingzhou City for generations.

756
00:36:58,343 --> 00:36:59,783
Our ancestors

757
00:36:59,902 --> 00:37:01,383
and Pei family are

758
00:37:01,662 --> 00:37:03,343
embarrassed by you brat.

759
00:37:04,583 --> 00:37:06,662
Pei family?

760
00:37:07,543 --> 00:37:09,303
Clan leader, you always talk
about Pei family.

761
00:37:09,623 --> 00:37:10,902
But what is the clan for?

762
00:37:11,143 --> 00:37:12,023
What is the clan leader for?

763
00:37:12,422 --> 00:37:13,623
The clan was founded

764
00:37:14,103 --> 00:37:16,222
to protect the safety
of the clan members.

765
00:37:16,543 --> 00:37:19,702
But now, it's become a cage
that believes in rumors.

766
00:37:20,702 --> 00:37:22,662
It's meaningless and pedantic.

767
00:37:23,383 --> 00:37:26,222
If you insist on your decision,

768
00:37:27,103 --> 00:37:30,023
I'll remove my name from the genealogy
on my own free will

769
00:37:31,902 --> 00:37:33,103
to protect my marriage.

770
00:37:34,343 --> 00:37:34,982
You...

771
00:37:35,262 --> 00:37:37,063
It's nonsense!

772
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:39,422
Yanzhen,

773
00:37:40,182 --> 00:37:41,662
you need to figure it out.

774
00:37:42,103 --> 00:37:44,182
If you give up
on being one of Pei family,

775
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:46,222
you'll be powerless

776
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,182
in the official circles.

777
00:38:01,343 --> 00:38:02,103
So what?

778
00:38:03,143 --> 00:38:03,742
Geez.

779
00:38:13,063 --> 00:38:15,023
Did Pei Yanzhen really say that?

780
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:17,103
There are many

781
00:38:17,783 --> 00:38:19,662
of your people in the Pei family's clan.

782
00:38:20,103 --> 00:38:22,262
I think they dare not tell lies.

783
00:38:24,262 --> 00:38:25,543
This is surprising.

784
00:38:26,182 --> 00:38:29,662
I thought Pei Yanzhen married Shen Miao

785
00:38:29,902 --> 00:38:31,783
for the fortune of the Shen family

786
00:38:31,783 --> 00:38:33,543
so they can help him in his career.

787
00:38:35,343 --> 00:38:36,902
But think about it,

788
00:38:37,823 --> 00:38:40,182
what kind of a scholar

789
00:38:40,383 --> 00:38:42,383
who has studied hard

790
00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:43,143
would give up

791
00:38:43,143 --> 00:38:45,182
on his promising career just for a woman

792
00:38:45,742 --> 00:38:48,023
whom he married several months ago?

793
00:38:50,182 --> 00:38:51,103
I have no idea.

794
00:38:53,502 --> 00:38:55,262
What if Official Pei is

795
00:38:56,343 --> 00:38:58,383
just seeking for his true love?

796
00:38:58,863 --> 00:38:59,343
No.

797
00:39:01,262 --> 00:39:03,303
I'm sure he has another intention.

798
00:39:04,462 --> 00:39:06,783
He might be seeking for something bigger

799
00:39:06,783 --> 00:39:09,783
than the position of magistrate
and Shen family's fortune.

800
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:11,583
Jingde,

801
00:39:12,982 --> 00:39:15,462
Pei Yanzhen's birthday is in a few days.

802
00:39:16,143 --> 00:39:18,823
Bestow some birthday gifts on him
in my name.

803
00:39:19,543 --> 00:39:21,303
Go to Pei's Old Residence and ask

804
00:39:21,863 --> 00:39:24,063
if someone was born in Pei family

805
00:39:24,182 --> 00:39:27,662
at the Dragon Boat Festival
20 years ago.

806
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:29,103
Noted.

807
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:31,623
But, Empress Dowager,

808
00:39:32,742 --> 00:39:34,942
what if Official Pei isn't...

809
00:39:35,262 --> 00:39:36,783
The problem must be uprooted.

810
00:39:37,462 --> 00:39:39,502
Otherwise, it'll rise again.

811
00:39:49,982 --> 00:39:51,383
Didn't you say
you don't want to get a divorce?

812
00:39:51,902 --> 00:39:52,823
What are you thinking?

813
00:39:53,823 --> 00:39:55,383
Pei family's elders are
difficult men to deal with.

814
00:39:55,623 --> 00:39:57,623
They will make a scene again
in these several days.

815
00:39:58,383 --> 00:39:59,783
I don't want to frighten you.

816
00:40:00,543 --> 00:40:02,702
So I ask someone to pack your stuff.

817
00:40:03,343 --> 00:40:05,143
You may take shelter
in Shen's Residence for a few days.

818
00:40:06,502 --> 00:40:07,063
No.

819
00:40:08,502 --> 00:40:10,623
You even said you'd resign.

820
00:40:11,383 --> 00:40:12,462
I won't be so heartless

821
00:40:12,462 --> 00:40:13,262
and leave you here alone.

822
00:40:14,343 --> 00:40:15,103
I tell you what.

823
00:40:15,303 --> 00:40:16,182
Don't try to convince me.

824
00:40:16,502 --> 00:40:17,583
I can't abandon

825
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:18,583
my peer.

826
00:40:20,982 --> 00:40:21,982
Do you hear me?

827
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,560
♪A pair of lovebirds are flying
under the roof in the drizzling rain♪

828

♪Whose secrets have drifted
to the chamber?♪

829
00:40:38,902 --> 00:40:40,023
Where did you find this?

830

♪The night when the moon shines,
I'll have a drink with you♪

831
00:40:43,982 --> 00:40:46,182
The craftsmanship is very poor.

832
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,623
This is the latest model.

833
00:40:50,422 --> 00:40:51,182
I made it myself.

834
00:40:51,863 --> 00:40:52,783
It's poorly made.

835
00:40:53,343 --> 00:40:54,103
I'm sorry about that.

836
00:40:57,662 --> 00:40:58,143
I...

837
00:40:58,143 --> 00:40:58,702
