an admirer of Miss Shen.

166
00:06:02,248 --> 00:06:03,288
He will marry no one else
except for her.

167
00:06:04,088 --> 00:06:05,489
He would rather lose all his wealth

168
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:08,288
than give up on her.

169
00:06:09,528 --> 00:06:10,049
Therefore...

170
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:11,489
He's not the only one
who thinks like that.

171
00:06:11,489 --> 00:06:13,329
The Song family will pay

172
00:06:13,929 --> 00:06:17,169
those who're willing to leave now
with gold.

173
00:06:19,049 --> 00:06:19,968
Gold?

174
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:21,688
Really?

175
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:22,528
Let's go.

176
00:06:23,128 --> 00:06:23,568
Take it.

177
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:25,688
This one is for you.

178
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:26,929
Here. For you.

179
00:06:27,408 --> 00:06:27,848
I'm getting one too.

180
00:06:27,848 --> 00:06:28,209
Here.

181
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:29,649
Leave after you get your share.

182
00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:30,408
How did it go?

183
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:33,088
Miao.

184
00:06:33,288 --> 00:06:33,968
Come here.

185
00:06:34,088 --> 00:06:35,128
I need to introduce someone to you.

186
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:38,528
He's the owner of the Yuanshan Company.

187
00:06:38,929 --> 00:06:39,968
He's Third Master Song.

188
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:41,449
A bright young man.

189
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:42,929
Why are you here again?

190
00:06:43,368 --> 00:06:44,449
I'm humbled, Master Shen.

191
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:46,329
It seems like

192
00:06:46,568 --> 00:06:48,009
Miaomiao hasn't forgotten me yet.

193
00:06:48,288 --> 00:06:49,449
I'm so glad to hear that.

194
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:51,128
It's been a few days since we last met.

195
00:06:51,568 --> 00:06:53,009
How are you doing, Miss?

196
00:06:53,688 --> 00:06:54,248
I'm fine.

197
00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:55,649
I'm doing better than fine.

198
00:06:57,408 --> 00:06:59,288
Have you met before?

199
00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:00,449
Yes, we have.

200
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:02,889
It was the Dragon Boat Festival.
While we were watching the archery game,

201
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:04,368
Miss Shen fell into the water.

202
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:06,688
I happened to be there to witness it,

203
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:07,769
and I saved her from drowning.

204
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:10,848
How did you fall into the water

205
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:12,408
when you were watching the archery game?

206
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:14,288
You were too careless.

207
00:07:17,808 --> 00:07:19,288
Thanks for saving her.

208
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:20,248
Miao.

209
00:07:20,769 --> 00:07:21,688
Say your thank to Third Master Song.

210
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:29,889
Thank you, Third Master Song.

211
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:31,169
You're welcome, Miss Shen.

212
00:07:31,489 --> 00:07:32,568
I've been a good martial artist.

213
00:07:32,568 --> 00:07:34,329
Of course, I should help the weak.

214
00:07:37,049 --> 00:07:37,688
Master Shen.

215
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:39,649
I'm here

216
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:40,929
with an intention.

217
00:07:41,408 --> 00:07:42,248
I would like to

218
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,088
propose a marriage.

219
00:07:45,408 --> 00:07:46,088
What?

220
00:07:47,489 --> 00:07:48,088
Master Song.

221
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:49,649
Can we speak in private?

222
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:53,049
Master Song, you're a businessman.

223
00:07:53,688 --> 00:07:55,049
I'm sure you know

224
00:07:55,568 --> 00:07:58,528
what are the popular items
in the capital in the past few months.

225
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,649
Indeed, I own a few shops
in the capital.

226
00:08:02,408 --> 00:08:05,209
I guess clothing and jewelry
have been really popular,

227
00:08:05,408 --> 00:08:06,568
while the rouge and powder
have been the most expensive items.

228
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:08,808
You're right.

229
00:08:09,568 --> 00:08:10,649
There'll be a selection
for the Crown Prince's concubines

230
00:08:10,808 --> 00:08:12,169
three months later.

231
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:13,088
Those who get picked
will join the harem.

232
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:15,209
Many noble families have brought
their daughters

233
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:18,009
who've reached the marriageable age
to the capital for the selection.

234
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:19,968
That's why the price
of these items have increased.

235
00:08:21,528 --> 00:08:23,128
Miaomiao, you're indeed

236
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:24,288
a fine and smart lady.

237
00:08:24,688 --> 00:08:28,049
But what does it have to do
with our marriage?

238
00:08:28,568 --> 00:08:30,009
If you want to marry me,

239
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:32,889
then you can't ignore the royal affair.

240
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:33,409
Miaomiao.

241
00:08:34,449 --> 00:08:36,089
Does it mean that you'll marry me?

242
00:08:37,128 --> 00:08:37,568
No.

243
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:38,928
I'm not marrying you.

244
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:41,209
We're going to work together.

245
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:42,168
Work?

246
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:46,089
Will you really marry me

247
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:47,769
if my last name isn't Shen?

248
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,889
Master Song?

249
00:08:58,128 --> 00:08:58,849
Logically speaking,

250
00:08:59,128 --> 00:08:59,928
I just went through a divorce
not long ago.

251
00:09:00,568 --> 00:09:02,248
My father shouldn't be in such a hurry

252
00:09:02,248 --> 00:09:03,409
to marry me off.

253
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:04,529
Unless...

254
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:07,048
Unless the Crown Prince is taking

255
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:09,329
the selection as an opportunity
to get me into the harem.

256
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:11,568
Master Song.

257
00:09:11,928 --> 00:09:13,649
Will you still marry me

258
00:09:13,969 --> 00:09:15,168
if that'll make you
the royal family's rival?

259
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,089
(Ninth Princess's Residence)

260
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:23,209
Thanks for your time.

261
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:24,568
I like the rouge you got for me

262
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:26,168
very much.

263
00:09:26,168 --> 00:09:27,329
I'll see you tomorrow.

264
00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:28,128
Wait a minute, Your Highness.

265
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:31,728
There's something I need
to come clean with Your Highness.

266
00:09:32,728 --> 00:09:34,649
I don't know
what Your Highness sees in me.

267
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:36,009
Why are you treating me so well?

268
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:37,048
Love

269
00:09:37,128 --> 00:09:38,449
has to be mutual.

270
00:09:38,969 --> 00:09:40,649
I don't have any romantic feelings
for Your Highness.

271
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:42,449
Even if Your Highness spends time
with me every day,

272
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:43,449
it won't change my mind too.

273
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:44,089
It'll always be the same,

274
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:44,649
whether it's today, tomorrow,

275
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:45,529
or any time in the future.

276
00:09:49,928 --> 00:09:50,449
Why?

277
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:51,289
I said it before.

278
00:09:51,568 --> 00:09:52,769
Shen Miao is my wife.

279
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:56,089
But you have divorced Shen Miao.

280
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:57,769
I can always ask her to marry me again.

281
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:05,209
Who do you think you are, Pei Yanzhen?

282
00:10:05,849 --> 00:10:07,728
My brother has sent his men to Lingzhou.

283
00:10:08,048 --> 00:10:10,289
I guess they have already paid
the Shen's residence a visit by now.

284
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,449
He wishes

285
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:13,048
to marry Shen Miao, the divorcee,

286
00:10:13,688 --> 00:10:14,849
and make her the concubine.

287
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,849
He's the most powerful man
in the country,

288
00:10:18,128 --> 00:10:19,449
only second to the Emperor.

289
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:23,649
Do you really think
Shen Miao won't fall for him?

290
00:10:24,048 --> 00:10:24,728
What did you just say?

291
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,048
(To Pei Yanzhen)

292
00:10:30,048 --> 00:10:32,128
My brother wanted me
to hand this to you.

293
00:10:32,128 --> 00:10:34,289
He said you would understand
what's going on after reading it.

294
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,420
(To Pei Yanzhen)

295
00:10:41,928 --> 00:10:43,529
Miaomiao, you're such an adorable lady.

296
00:10:43,808 --> 00:10:45,289
Of course, I'm willing to take the risk.

297
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:46,329
But

298
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:47,608
an alliance should promise

299
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:50,248
a win-win situation between you and me.

300
00:10:50,568 --> 00:10:51,688
The only thing I want

301
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:53,808
is to win your heart.

302
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:57,089
Do you think I'll get what I want?

303
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:01,449
Master Song,

304
00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:03,289
if you're really just a player,

305
00:11:03,688 --> 00:11:06,048
they won't make you
the head of the Song family.

306
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:07,248
You can put on this act

307
00:11:07,409 --> 00:11:09,009
when you're with outsiders.

308
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:11,209
But it won't work for me.

309
00:11:14,248 --> 00:11:16,488
Miaomiao, your words hurt.

310
00:11:16,808 --> 00:11:18,329
You're the only person

311
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,649
I care about.

312
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:21,928
Let's get down to business.

313
00:11:23,969 --> 00:11:26,608
The Song family started
as the Mobei Cavalry.

314
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:29,089
Your ancestors made
meritorious contributions to the country

315
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,608
and built a strong foundation
in the royal court for your family.

316
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:34,649
It has become a very powerful family
in the Central Plaines.

317
00:11:35,488 --> 00:11:37,128
Now, the royal court is planning
to build ports along the coast.

318
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:39,769
I'm willing to share
the Shen family's business in Jiangnan

319
00:11:39,928 --> 00:11:41,649
with the Song family.

320
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:48,368
Your business in Jiangnan?

321
00:11:48,368 --> 00:11:50,048
That's a huge amount.

322
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:51,529
Why...

323
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:53,248
If you want to be my husband,

324
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:56,168
there's a chance
you might offend the royal family.

325
00:11:56,889 --> 00:11:59,048
I've always been
a fair and upright person.

326
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:00,808
Of course,
I'll pay you what you deserve.

327
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:02,769
Take it as my dowry.

328
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:06,168
Dowry?

329
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:07,409
Do you want more?

330
00:12:09,608 --> 00:12:12,808
Are we practicing
matrilocal residence then?

331
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:17,209
The Shen family has enough
male descendants.

332
00:12:17,688 --> 00:12:18,329
We don't need an extra man.

333
00:12:20,048 --> 00:12:20,488
However,

334
00:12:21,128 --> 00:12:22,409
there are terms too

335
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,688
if you want to accept the money.

336
00:12:25,808 --> 00:12:26,688
Please enlighten me.

337
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:28,409
Firstly,

338
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:31,089
the Shen family is

339
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:33,009
a respectable family in Lingzhou.

340
00:12:33,248 --> 00:12:35,128
You will need to stay loyal to me
after we get married.

341
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:37,089
You can't spend the night out anymore.

342
00:12:37,168 --> 00:12:38,568
Otherwise, my father will lose face

343
00:12:38,568 --> 00:12:39,649
and he'll also worry about me.

344
00:12:41,368 --> 00:12:41,928
Sure.

345
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:43,168
Secondly,

346
00:12:43,969 --> 00:12:45,368
we're a pair of fake couples,

347
00:12:45,368 --> 00:12:46,128
but we can be real friends.

348
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:49,889
Although I am pretty, gentle, and kind,

349
00:12:50,248 --> 00:12:52,248
you should never fall for me.

350
00:12:53,969 --> 00:12:54,529
Thirdly,

351
00:12:56,488 --> 00:12:59,089
honesty is the most important thing
in a business.

352
00:12:59,608 --> 00:13:00,928
From now on,

353
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:03,688
stop saying those flattering words

354
00:13:03,969 --> 00:13:05,608
and putting on an act in front of me.

355
00:13:06,048 --> 00:13:07,529
It's more important
to be honest with each other.

356
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:09,048
But most importantly,

357
00:13:09,728 --> 00:13:11,608
if I want to get a divorce,
whenever it is,

358
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:13,128
you must agree to it.

359
00:13:14,248 --> 00:13:14,928
If you agree with all the terms,

360
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:16,248
then I'll prepare a marriage contract.

361
00:13:16,688 --> 00:13:17,449
Everything will be written
black and white

362
00:13:17,568 --> 00:13:18,928
to avoid any disputes in the future.

363
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:23,728
What are you laughing at?

364
00:13:23,728 --> 00:13:24,529
Am I laughing?

365
00:13:25,449 --> 00:13:27,248
Since Miaomiao is being
so open and honest,

366
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:28,849
I'll speak my mind too.

367
00:13:29,368 --> 00:13:30,849
It's indeed my agenda

368
00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:32,649
is to marry a member of the Shen family.

369
00:13:33,368 --> 00:13:34,928
I agree to all the terms

370
00:13:36,168 --> 00:13:37,048
you mentioned just now.

371
00:13:38,368 --> 00:13:39,529
Let's prepare the marriage contract.

372
00:13:46,928 --> 00:13:47,889
Miaomiao.

373
00:13:49,168 --> 00:13:51,248
You're much more interesting

374
00:13:52,488 --> 00:13:53,608
than I expected.

375
00:13:55,048 --> 00:13:55,688
Pei Yanzhen.

376
00:13:55,889 --> 00:13:56,808
Have you thought it through?

377
00:13:57,289 --> 00:13:58,849
You're defying the royal court

378
00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:00,089
if you try to stop the wedding.

379
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,209
The royal family
destroyed your marriage.

380
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:03,728
Indirectly,

381
00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:06,089
they're confirming your identity.

382
00:14:09,688 --> 00:14:10,568
If it wasn't for me,

383
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:12,529
Miao wouldn't have gotten involved
in this saga.

384
00:14:13,128 --> 00:14:14,089
I've already let her down once.

385
00:14:14,568 --> 00:14:15,649
I can't repeat my mistake.

386
00:14:22,808 --> 00:14:24,128
I had been waiting

387
00:14:24,128 --> 00:14:25,529
for this day to come

388
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:27,009
since the day I first saw Miaomiao.

389
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:28,649
Now that my dream has come true.

390
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:30,289
Isn't it great?

391
00:14:31,608 --> 00:14:32,449
Master San.

392
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:36,608
I'm warning you.

393
00:14:37,289 --> 00:14:38,928
Don't try to fool around.

394
00:14:43,728 --> 00:14:45,209
I heard Miaomiao just now.

395
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:48,728
The most important thing
for businessmen is their integrity.

396
00:14:48,969 --> 00:14:49,808
I look forward to working with you.

397
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:55,728
(Shen's Residence)
My dear wife.

398
00:14:56,608 --> 00:14:57,808
I'll get going.

399
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:03,969
Young Master.

400
00:15:04,168 --> 00:15:04,728
How did it go?

401
00:15:05,168 --> 00:15:05,849
Did you get what you want?

402
00:15:06,168 --> 00:15:07,449
What is that supposed to mean?

403
00:15:07,808 --> 00:15:09,969
What happened
is my proposal was accepted.

404
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:11,488
Tie Niu.

405
00:15:11,488 --> 00:15:12,688
Go back and tell the housekeeper

406
00:15:12,688 --> 00:15:13,409
to prepare the betrothal gifts.

407
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:14,368
We're getting married in a few days.

408
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:15,488
Sure.

409
00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:16,649
That's impressive.

410
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:18,368
Careful, Young Master.

411
00:15:43,168 --> 00:15:43,769
Who's there?

412
00:15:44,688 --> 00:15:45,289
Miao.

413
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:47,128
Miao.

414
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:48,329
Father?

415
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:50,608
I'm coming.

416
00:16:00,969 --> 00:16:01,568
Father.

417
00:16:02,568 --> 00:16:04,649
Why are you here late at night?

418
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:07,289
Your mother appeared in my dream.

419
00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:08,769
She was criticizing me.

420
00:16:23,688 --> 00:16:24,889
Miao.

421
00:16:25,048 --> 00:16:26,608
I gave you my word

422
00:16:27,808 --> 00:16:29,089
and said that you could marry

423
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:31,529
a man you like.

424
00:16:33,168 --> 00:16:34,209
But this time...

425
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:41,329
It's all right.

426
00:16:42,449 --> 00:16:42,928
Father.

427
00:16:43,608 --> 00:16:44,248
Think about it.

428
00:16:44,928 --> 00:16:45,889
Song San

429
00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:47,409
is a bright young man.

430
00:16:47,928 --> 00:16:49,688
He's as good-looking as Pei Yanzhen.

431
00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:53,449
Most importantly,
we're compatible with each other.

432
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:56,769
I ran into such a great opportunity
not long after my divorce.

433
00:16:57,368 --> 00:16:59,048
I'm more than grateful.

434
00:16:59,688 --> 00:17:01,329
Don't worry about me.

435
00:17:02,048 --> 00:17:02,808
Miao.

436
00:17:03,608 --> 00:17:05,689
Do you still remember
your grandparents' home?

437
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:06,809
Of course, I do.

438
00:17:07,448 --> 00:17:09,689
Mother was from the Lu family.

439
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,608
The Lu family was a wealthy businessman
from the former dynasty.

440
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:14,208
They're a bigger and wealthier family

441
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:16,169
compared to the Shen family.

442
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:21,569
But there's an old story
you haven't heard about yet.

443
00:17:22,448 --> 00:17:23,929
You're all grown up now

444
00:17:24,889 --> 00:17:26,208
and it's time to tell you what happened.

445
00:17:29,368 --> 00:17:30,289
What happened?

446
00:17:30,889 --> 00:17:32,128
It's said that the Lu family

447
00:17:33,448 --> 00:17:36,529
interfered with royal affairs.

448
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,328
They broke the rules
and the family was weed out.

449
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:40,409
They left a huge fortune behind

450
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:41,569
and it was hidden in a secret place.

451
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:43,569
Rumor has it

452
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:45,088
that your mother knew

453
00:17:47,448 --> 00:17:48,848
where the treasure was hidden.

454
00:17:50,448 --> 00:17:52,009
Then, my mother passed away because...

455
00:17:55,689 --> 00:17:58,328
Your mother was a sensitive person.

456
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,088
After the tragedy happened
to the Lu family,

457
00:18:01,608 --> 00:18:03,009
she fell into depression.

458
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:06,529
She was troubled by the rumors
spread among the people,

459
00:18:07,368 --> 00:18:08,689
and couldn't see it through.

460
00:18:09,448 --> 00:18:10,889
She died an untimely death.

461
00:18:11,689 --> 00:18:12,809
I did my best in the past years

462
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:16,049
to keep you away from the royal court.

463
00:18:16,448 --> 00:18:17,848
That's exactly why

464
00:18:20,689 --> 00:18:21,929
the only thing I wish for

465
00:18:23,409 --> 00:18:26,169
is your safety and well-being.

466
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:28,649
I hope
that you'll never get bothered by it.

467
00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:38,769
Don't worry, Father.

468
00:18:39,448 --> 00:18:40,368
Mother and I are different.

469
00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:44,208
The Shen family will never suffer
what the Lu family went through.

470
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:49,448
I certainly hope so.

471
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:56,208
I'm sorry you have to go through this.

472
00:19:45,689 --> 00:19:47,368
You finished all this wine on your own.

473
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:49,529
Pei Yanzhen.

474
00:19:50,328 --> 00:19:52,208
You're not a drinker, right?

475
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:53,689
Getting drunk

476
00:19:54,328 --> 00:19:55,569
can make you forget everything.

477
00:19:57,049 --> 00:19:57,929
Have you forgotten anything yet?

478
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:09,368
You're doing this because
Shen Miao has had a change of heart.

479
00:20:10,689 --> 00:20:12,448
Although the Song family
runs businesses,

480
00:20:13,368 --> 00:20:14,368
they're not good people.

481
00:20:15,569 --> 00:20:16,368
Song Xiyuan

482
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:17,929
isn't the right guy for her.

483
00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:20,889
Enough.

484
00:20:22,448 --> 00:20:23,208
Stop thinking about Shen Miao

485
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,608
and start taking care of yourself.

486
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:25,769
Turning down the Ninth Princess

487
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:27,529
will only risk exposing
your true identity.

488
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:29,128
If the Empress Dowager issues a decree,

489
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:30,929
no matter how smart you think you are,

490
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,049
you won't be able to run away from this.

491
00:20:51,848 --> 00:20:53,248
I won't allow either of the two weddings

492
00:20:54,889 --> 00:20:56,088
to happen.

493
00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:07,128
Miaomiao.

494
00:21:09,689 --> 00:21:10,608
Time to wake up, Miaomiao.

495
00:21:10,889 --> 00:21:11,488
Miaomiao.

496
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:12,809
Wake up now.

497
00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:13,409
Miaomiao.

498
00:21:14,328 --> 00:21:14,848
Hurry up.

499
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:15,448
Wake up now.

500
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:17,248
Wake up now.

501
00:21:17,248 --> 00:21:17,889
Hurry up.

502
00:21:17,889 --> 00:21:19,809
I'm leaving home in a few days.

503
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:21,769
Why can't you let me sleep in?

504
00:21:21,769 --> 00:21:23,208
Be a good girl, Miaomiao.

505
00:21:23,728 --> 00:21:24,728
You can't sleep in today.

506
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:25,448
You know what.

507
00:21:25,448 --> 00:21:27,448
There's an eminent monk, who's good at
fortune-telling, at the Great Buddha Temple.

508
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:29,608
He will pick an auspicious date
for your wedding.

509
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:31,328
The queue will be too long
if you don't wake up now.

510
00:21:31,328 --> 00:21:32,208
Get up now.

511
00:21:32,368 --> 00:21:32,689
Wait...

512
00:21:32,689 --> 00:21:34,128
Get up now.

513
00:22:02,569 --> 00:22:04,088
Take a look at this.

514
00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:09,848
I told you I didn't want to come here,

515
00:22:10,689 --> 00:22:11,328
but you dragged me out nonetheless.

516
00:22:12,328 --> 00:22:13,608
I'm so tired now.

517
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:15,728
Hang in there.

518
00:22:22,848 --> 00:22:24,328
There is food, drinks,

519
00:22:24,649 --> 00:22:26,049
amulet, talisman, and everything else

520
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:27,809
in the Great Buddha Temple.

521
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:31,088
It's almost as good as
the Shen family's store.

522
00:22:31,368 --> 00:22:32,529
Enough of that nonsense.

523
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:36,088
Master Wangyun is giving out
100 queue numbers today.

524
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,128
First come, first serve.

525
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:38,049
Miaomiao.

526
00:22:38,049 --> 00:22:38,569
Stay here.

527
00:22:38,569 --> 00:22:39,529
Don't go anywhere.

528
00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:41,009
I'll get you a number now.

529
00:22:41,889 --> 00:22:42,649
Aunt.

530
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:44,689
Can't you give me some water first?

531
00:22:46,409 --> 00:22:47,289
I'm so thirsty.

532
00:23:09,968 --> 00:23:10,488
Miss.

533
00:23:11,088 --> 00:23:12,208
This peach blossom talisman

534
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:15,409
is blessed by Shen Miao's
good fortune in love.

535
00:23:15,649 --> 00:23:16,689
It's very effective.

536
00:23:17,088 --> 00:23:17,728
Take a look at this.

537
00:23:22,248 --> 00:23:24,728
Master, are you from
the Great Buddha Temple?

538
00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:27,169
I'm humbled,

539
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:29,848
but I'm from
the Fengming Mountain Temple.

540
00:23:30,248 --> 00:23:32,968
Our temple has been
rather quiet recently.

541
00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:35,328
I'm here to earn some money.

542
00:23:37,248 --> 00:23:39,569
I didn't expect your industry
to be suffering as well.

543
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:42,488
We're all the children of the country.

544
00:23:44,328 --> 00:23:46,569
Fate brought us together.

545
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:49,289
Why don't you check out

546
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:54,968
these limited paper dolls?

547
00:23:55,529 --> 00:23:57,128
It's very effective if you use it
to boost your love life.

548
00:23:59,529 --> 00:24:02,728
I'm only telling you this
because fate brought us together.

549
00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:06,328
I won't reveal this to just anyone.

550
00:24:06,968 --> 00:24:09,169
If there's a man you're interested in,

551
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,009
all you have to do is to write
his birthdate at the back of the cutout

552
00:24:12,569 --> 00:24:14,409
Then, burn joss sticks
and do the ritual every day and night.

553
00:24:14,728 --> 00:24:15,569
In less than a month,

554
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:16,608
you'll be able to find a gentleman

555
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:19,968
as good as Official Pei.

556
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,088
Official Pei is now
in charge of Lingzhou.

557
00:24:25,448 --> 00:24:27,608
He hates any superstitious practice
the most.

558
00:24:27,889 --> 00:24:30,128
He's very strict when it comes
to the investigation of witchcraft.

559
00:24:30,448 --> 00:24:31,488
Why do you...

560
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,448
Does it really work?

561
00:24:49,728 --> 00:24:51,248
It has been three years
since we last met.

562
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,448
There's a drastic change
in your style of playing.

563
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:58,009
You were really aggressive
and determined to win the game.

564
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,569
I see some changes today.

565
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:02,689
Master Pei.

566
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:04,368
You are distracted.

567
00:25:05,328 --> 00:25:06,689
I reckon you didn't come here

568
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:08,728
for a chess game, right?

569
00:25:11,848 --> 00:25:12,968
Master, since you have seen
right through me,

570
00:25:14,088 --> 00:25:15,128
I will not beat around the bush anymore.

571
00:25:16,608 --> 00:25:17,569
Something is bothering me,

572
00:25:18,368 --> 00:25:19,488
and I hope that
I can get your opinion on it.

573
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:23,208
You are trapped in obsession.

574
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:25,569
You're only bothered because
you couldn't lay your hand on it.

575
00:25:26,569 --> 00:25:28,728
Since you're not one of the mortals,

576
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:30,289
I'm not the right person

577
00:25:31,009 --> 00:25:32,128
to help you with your issue.

578
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:36,968
Master is telling you

579
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:38,809
that you should do what you need to do.

580
00:25:39,448 --> 00:25:40,929
You obviously care about her a lot.

581
00:25:41,848 --> 00:25:43,368
Yet, you're acting
all indifferent and aloof.

582
00:25:47,248 --> 00:25:49,448
May I ask where Master Wangyun is now?

583
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:51,929
My master is reading the scripture.

584
00:25:54,689 --> 00:25:55,649
Why is Song Xiyuan here?

585
00:25:59,889 --> 00:26:00,649
Does it really work?

586
00:26:01,488 --> 00:26:02,769
Of course.

587
00:26:03,049 --> 00:26:04,409
I haven't introduced myself yet.

588
00:26:04,848 --> 00:26:07,169
I'm from the Fengming Mountain Temple.

589
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:10,368
I'm the apprentice of Master Zhang,
the 18th master of the Longhu Mountain.

590
00:26:10,608 --> 00:26:11,968
I always speak the truth.

591
00:26:12,689 --> 00:26:14,728
If you buy these human cutouts,

592
00:26:15,128 --> 00:26:16,728
you'll easily win the heart
of your dream man.

593
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:17,769
You might even be able

594
00:26:17,769 --> 00:26:18,649
to win

595
00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:20,529
Official Pei over.

596
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:21,769
If you think that's not enough,

597
00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:22,769
it can also make

598
00:26:22,889 --> 00:26:24,569
Song Xiyuan, the owner
of the Yuanshan Company,

599
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,529
fall for you.

600
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:28,088
Which one is Pei Yanzhen?

601
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:28,809
I want him.

602
00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:29,289
How much is it?

603
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,409
Since fate brought us together,

604
00:26:32,728 --> 00:26:33,689
I'll cut down the price for you.

605
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:35,448
I'll sell it for two silvers.

606
00:26:35,448 --> 00:26:35,929
Sure.

607
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:38,889
Two silvers?

608
00:26:39,128 --> 00:26:39,728
Two silvers are enough

609
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:41,529
for a normal family
to buy one year's worth of supplies.

610
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:43,128
Are the cutouts made of gold?

611
00:26:43,128 --> 00:26:43,968
Why is it so expensive?

612
00:26:44,368 --> 00:26:46,009
Young lady, you can't say that.

613
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:48,689
A good marriage
is more precious than gold, right?

614
00:26:50,488 --> 00:26:51,049
Young lady.

615
00:26:51,328 --> 00:26:53,289
I see some bad luck
in between your brows.

616
00:26:53,569 --> 00:26:55,809
I'm sure you just got
abandoned by a man.

617
00:26:56,208 --> 00:26:57,128
If you're not buying,

618
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:59,328
stop standing in my way.

619
00:27:00,248 --> 00:27:01,009
Go away.

620
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:01,848
How annoying.

621
00:27:02,049 --> 00:27:03,169
I can buy whatever I want.

622
00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:03,929
You can't stop me.

623
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,848
Other than talisman
for a good love life,

624
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:07,889
do you have anything...

625
00:27:07,889 --> 00:27:08,889
It's really hard to be kind.

626
00:27:09,009 --> 00:27:09,889
Any of these I can use to curse a man?

627
00:27:09,968 --> 00:27:10,809
Of course.

628
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:12,169
Of course, I have one.

629
00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:22,448
It depends on what kind of curses
you wish to cast.

630
00:27:25,569 --> 00:27:28,009
I want to curse a lady
whose last name is Shen.

631
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:30,608
I want her to get spots on her face,

632
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:31,448
and sores on her feet.

633
00:27:31,448 --> 00:27:32,248
I want her to become bald

634
00:27:32,248 --> 00:27:33,169
and fat.

635
00:27:33,169 --> 00:27:34,889
It'll be best
if she stays single forever.

636
00:27:35,368 --> 00:27:36,208
Sure.

637
00:27:36,368 --> 00:27:36,848
Miss.

638
00:27:37,488 --> 00:27:38,728
Do you have to be this mean?

639
00:27:39,689 --> 00:27:41,088
It has nothing to do with you.

640
00:27:41,529 --> 00:27:42,848
If you're so free
to poke your nose in my business,

641
00:27:43,088 --> 00:27:44,769
why don't you spend that time
taking care of your skin?

642
00:27:44,968 --> 00:27:46,488
If you did that earlier,
you wouldn't have gotten abandoned.

643
00:27:47,529 --> 00:27:48,608
I can marry Pei Yanzhen
if I buy this, right?

644
00:27:49,409 --> 00:27:50,848
I want both cutouts.

645
00:27:51,769 --> 00:27:52,088
This...

646
00:27:54,728 --> 00:27:55,409
How dare you

647
00:27:55,409 --> 00:27:56,889
covet Yanzhen?

648
00:27:57,569 --> 00:27:58,328
How much are you paying?

649
00:27:58,488 --> 00:27:59,208
I...

650
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,169
I'll triple the offer.

651
00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:04,009
Three times?

652
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:05,649
I can pay 10 times more.

653
00:28:05,649 --> 00:28:06,569
Ten times?

654
00:28:07,529 --> 00:28:08,368
I'll pay 20 times more.

655
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:09,569
- 20 times?
- Sure.

656
00:28:09,569 --> 00:28:11,009
I'll pay 30 times more than that.
It's mine now.

657
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:11,608
Not just that one.

658
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:12,328
I want these too.

659
00:28:12,328 --> 00:28:14,368
I want everything.

660
00:28:14,889 --> 00:28:15,968
What an audacious commoner?

661
00:28:16,248 --> 00:28:17,208
How dare you go against me?

662
00:28:18,128 --> 00:28:19,728
First come, first serve.

663
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:20,929
If you're not happy with the rules,

664
00:28:21,169 --> 00:28:22,169
you should leave.

665
00:28:23,128 --> 00:28:24,529
You're in Lingzhou now.

666
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:26,488
You should think about it
before you start making a fuss.

667
00:28:31,448 --> 00:28:32,248
I have long heard

668
00:28:32,248 --> 00:28:34,769
that Master Wangyun is very good
at predicting one's romantic future.

669
00:28:35,488 --> 00:28:36,289
I'm Song San.

670
00:28:36,929 --> 00:28:39,689
I'm here, hoping that Master can help me

671
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:42,608
read my future wife's fortune.

672
00:28:44,248 --> 00:28:45,169
Look at him.

673
00:28:45,608 --> 00:28:46,848
Look at how intimate he sounds.

674
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:49,009
My future wife.

675
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,728
How can you stand this?

676
00:28:53,289 --> 00:28:54,009
Even if you can,

677
00:28:54,009 --> 00:28:55,248
I can't.

678
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:05,728
This is no good, Young Master.

679
00:29:06,529 --> 00:29:07,649
This is a bad sign.

680
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,980
(Whatever will be, will be.
One needs not to force it.)

681
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,801
(If you forcefully grind a rock
and make it into a mirror,)

682
00:29:11,802 --> 00:29:12,420
(you'll realize your effort is all in vain.)

683
00:29:12,848 --> 00:29:13,649
Why is this happening?

684
00:29:15,248 --> 00:29:15,848
Master.

685
00:29:16,649 --> 00:29:17,529
Can you please explain this?

686
00:29:22,009 --> 00:29:22,569
Master.

687
00:29:24,169 --> 00:29:24,929
If he insists on having you
reading their fortune,

688
00:29:25,448 --> 00:29:27,208
you can give him these fortune sticks.

689
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,009
Sir, what is this supposed to mean?

690
00:29:32,608 --> 00:29:33,289
Don't worry, Master.

691
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:35,448
Song San and I are acquaintances.

692
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:38,128
These sticks carry their own meaning.

693
00:29:41,689 --> 00:29:43,929
Whatever will be, will be.

694
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:46,968
One needs not force it.

695
00:29:47,968 --> 00:29:50,088
If you forcefully grind a rock
and make it into a mirror,

696
00:29:50,649 --> 00:29:53,248
you'll realize
your effort is all in vain.

697
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:56,929
Master Song.

698
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,689
It seems like you're forcing

699
00:29:59,689 --> 00:30:00,728
the marriage.

700
00:30:01,848 --> 00:30:02,728
You should just let it go.

701
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:04,848
There's no point in forcing it.

702
00:30:11,328 --> 00:30:12,049
Pei Yanzhen.

703
00:30:12,529 --> 00:30:14,208
How did you make him
get the fortune stick with a bad sign?

704
00:30:18,128 --> 00:30:19,328
I simply picked out
all the good ones

705
00:30:19,328 --> 00:30:20,848
and the average ones.

706
00:30:21,128 --> 00:30:22,009
He can pick all he wants,

707
00:30:22,368 --> 00:30:23,769
but he'll never get
a result he's happy with.

708
00:30:25,529 --> 00:30:26,208
Pei Yanzhen.

709
00:30:26,608 --> 00:30:27,929
You're really mean.

710
00:30:32,929 --> 00:30:33,409
Young Master.

711
00:30:34,289 --> 00:30:35,248
What should we do now?

712
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:37,848
Master.

713
00:30:38,769 --> 00:30:40,689
Can I ask you another question?

714
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:43,649
What other questions do you have?

715
00:30:45,728 --> 00:30:47,529
I want to know what's going to happen

716
00:30:47,728 --> 00:30:49,009
to the romantic relationship
between Pei Yanzhen and Miaomiao.

717
00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:01,728
The path is dark

718
00:31:01,968 --> 00:31:03,728
and the future is unknown.

719
00:31:04,169 --> 00:31:06,529
The wall of the city
is going to collapse.

720
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:08,848
Even God can't help it.

721
00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:11,208
Young Master.

722
00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:14,009
This is the worst sign.

723
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:15,088
The one we got was better than this.

724
00:31:18,728 --> 00:31:20,088
It doesn't matter

725
00:31:20,529 --> 00:31:21,569
as long as I'm doing better
than Pei Yanzhen.

726
00:31:22,248 --> 00:31:22,929
Thank you, Master.

727
00:31:23,569 --> 00:31:26,088
You're indeed the best fortune-teller.

728
00:31:26,889 --> 00:31:27,488
Pei Yanzhen.

729
00:31:28,569 --> 00:31:29,689
Look what you did to yourself.

730
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:30,968
When you do too much evil,

731
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:32,968
you'll end up destroying yourself.

732
00:31:42,728 --> 00:31:43,769
Miaomiao.

733
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:44,889
Where did you go?

734
00:31:45,128 --> 00:31:46,169
You need to stop acting like a kid.

735
00:31:47,169 --> 00:31:47,968
What's the matter?

736
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,368
We checked.

737
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:50,929
You're not compatible with Song Xiyuan.

738
00:31:50,929 --> 00:31:51,968
You shouldn't marry him.

739
00:31:51,968 --> 00:31:53,328
If you insist on marrying him,

740
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,248
you'll lead a tragic life.

741
00:31:55,929 --> 00:31:56,529
Are you sure?

742
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:01,728
That's great!

743
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:03,689
I worry that he might get enchanted
by my beautiful face

744
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:05,409
and fall head over heels for me.

745
00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:06,608
I don't want him to repeat
the Pei family's mistake.

746
00:32:06,608 --> 00:32:07,608
I don't want to make him sad.

747
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,009
Since we're not compatible
with each other,

748
00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:10,289
that's great news.

749
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:11,368
There's no way

750
00:32:11,368 --> 00:32:12,608
I can find marriage as good as this.

751
00:32:12,608 --> 00:32:13,049
Aunt.

752
00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:14,328
Let's prepare for the wedding now.

753
00:32:14,569 --> 00:32:15,088
Let's go.

754
00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:18,649
Aunt.

755
00:32:18,929 --> 00:32:21,208
Let's go back and figure out
how to plan my wedding.

756
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:21,968
Then, you'll become

757
00:32:21,968 --> 00:32:24,049
the king of the game.

758
00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:24,728
The king of the game?

759
00:32:24,728 --> 00:32:25,248
The king of the game.

760
00:32:25,248 --> 00:32:25,608
Sure.

761
00:32:25,608 --> 00:32:26,328
The king of the game.

762
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:40,409
Why is it raw?

763
00:32:41,248 --> 00:32:42,368
It should be raw.

764
00:32:42,689 --> 00:32:43,608
It'll bless you

765
00:32:43,608 --> 00:32:45,049
with many children.

766
00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:47,529
Then, you'll bring good luck
to the Song family.

767
00:32:48,169 --> 00:32:49,049
Do they take me as a sow?

768
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:49,569
New bride.

769
00:32:49,929 --> 00:32:51,529
I'm Song San's uncle's daughter's

770
00:32:51,529 --> 00:32:53,128
uncle's aunt.

771
00:32:53,328 --> 00:32:54,929
I watched him grow up.

772
00:32:54,929 --> 00:32:56,649
I wish you a happy future together.

773
00:32:56,889 --> 00:32:57,848
Happy marriage.

774
00:32:58,809 --> 00:32:59,848
Thank you.

775
00:32:59,848 --> 00:33:01,848
Happy marriage.

776
00:33:04,569 --> 00:33:05,289
This is the gift money.

777
00:33:06,649 --> 00:33:07,368
Thank you.

778
00:33:07,488 --> 00:33:08,608
Thank you, young lady.

779
00:33:09,728 --> 00:33:10,488
Calm down.

780
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,848
You'll all get your share.

781
00:33:15,848 --> 00:33:16,889
You'll all get your share.

782
00:33:17,368 --> 00:33:18,248
Here.

783
00:33:20,368 --> 00:33:20,968
Be careful.

784
00:33:26,488 --> 00:33:27,328
Why didn't you tell me

785
00:33:27,328 --> 00:33:29,289
that the Song family
is such a huge family?

786
00:33:29,769 --> 00:33:31,009
I had no idea either.

787
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:32,289
Others get money

788
00:33:32,488 --> 00:33:33,649
from their wedding.

789
00:33:33,968 --> 00:33:36,409
Why are you giving out money instead?

790
00:33:39,889 --> 00:33:42,009
I should've added another term
on our marriage contract.

791
00:33:48,848 --> 00:33:49,328
(Song's Residence)
Open the door!

792
00:33:50,409 --> 00:33:50,889
Open the door!

793
00:33:54,009 --> 00:33:54,769
Open the door!

794
00:33:56,769 --> 00:33:57,248
This...

795
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:57,848
We're from the yamen
and we're running an investigation.

796
00:33:58,289 --> 00:33:59,088
Where is Song Xiyuan?

797
00:34:00,409 --> 00:34:01,409
Official Pei, you're here.

798
00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:03,529
I'll inform them.

799
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:04,409
It's all right.

800
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:07,728
We're here to arrest Master Song.

801
00:34:08,569 --> 00:34:09,089
This...

802
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:12,089
The magistrate of Wenque County
has embezzled the government funds

803
00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:12,849
and received

804
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:14,369
a total amount
of 80,000 taels of bribe illegally.

805
00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:15,289
The news reached the emperor

806
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:16,248
and His Majesty was infuriated.

807
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:18,888
His Majesty has ordered the yamen
to investigate this case.

808
00:34:19,529 --> 00:34:21,769
Since there are many businessmen
who are involved in this,

809
00:34:22,009 --> 00:34:24,289
we would like to ask Master Song

810
00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:26,728
to come with us to have a talk
in the yamen.

811
00:34:27,688 --> 00:34:28,289
Sir.

812
00:34:28,688 --> 00:34:30,049
I'm not trying
to hinder the investigation.

813
00:34:30,648 --> 00:34:33,089
But it's our Young Master's wedding day.

814
00:34:33,329 --> 00:34:34,648
He's not at home now.

815
00:34:35,849 --> 00:34:36,888
It's not time yet.

816
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,728
Master Song San cares
about his wife a lot.

817
00:34:39,248 --> 00:34:41,408
He has changed the venue of the wedding
to Shen's Residence.

818
00:34:42,049 --> 00:34:43,408
If you leave now,

819
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:45,408
you might arrive just in time
to catch the wedding banquet.

820
00:34:45,408 --> 00:34:45,888
You...

821
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,009
Thank you.

822
00:34:58,408 --> 00:34:58,928
Stop!

823
00:34:59,928 --> 00:35:00,448
Young Master.

824
00:35:08,688 --> 00:35:09,648
The head of the Song family

825
00:35:09,648 --> 00:35:10,688
She's the only daughter
of the Shen family.

826
00:35:10,688 --> 00:35:11,968
It's no surprise
they're being so generous.

827
00:35:12,609 --> 00:35:14,688
The gold and silver are real.

828
00:35:14,928 --> 00:35:15,488
(Shen's Residence)
Tie Niu.

829
00:35:16,049 --> 00:35:16,769
Tell me.

830
00:35:17,408 --> 00:35:20,049
How do I look today?

831
00:35:22,168 --> 00:35:22,688
Young Master.

832
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:24,049
I don't think

833
00:35:24,569 --> 00:35:26,089
you look good in red.

834
00:35:26,369 --> 00:35:27,009
Why not?

835
00:35:27,569 --> 00:35:28,648
Don't you think

836
00:35:28,888 --> 00:35:30,448
I look extra handsome

837
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,688
in this red gown?

838
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:34,168
I think

839
00:35:34,688 --> 00:35:36,208
you look...

840
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:37,569
Yes.

841
00:35:38,009 --> 00:35:40,448
You look like the rooster
in our backyard.

842
00:35:55,648 --> 00:35:56,329
Father-in-law.

843
00:35:56,809 --> 00:35:57,809
We'll be a family

844
00:35:58,129 --> 00:35:59,648
after this ceremony is completed.

845
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,849
Of course.

846
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:07,369
You decided to hold the wedding
in Shen's residence.

847
00:36:07,609 --> 00:36:09,809
Won't you get criticized
by the Song family?

848
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:12,369
It's my honor

849
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:13,609
to be able to marry Miaomiao.

850
00:36:14,168 --> 00:36:16,529
The venue of the wedding
doesn't matter at all.

851
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:19,329
Besides, all the men out there
are coveting Miaomiao.

852
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:22,569
Of course, I have to watch out.

853
00:36:23,609 --> 00:36:24,329
You're right.

854
00:36:25,968 --> 00:36:26,488
Young Master.

855
00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:28,009
What's the matter?

856
00:36:28,609 --> 00:36:30,089
You predicted it correctly.

857
00:36:30,369 --> 00:36:31,809
I received news from our residence.

858
00:36:32,208 --> 00:36:34,089
The men from yamen were there
to interrupt the wedding.

859
00:36:36,129 --> 00:36:37,529
I knew Pei Yanzhen

860
00:36:37,569 --> 00:36:39,248
wouldn't let her go so easily.

861
00:36:39,529 --> 00:36:40,448
But what he didn't expect

862
00:36:40,688 --> 00:36:42,849
is that I'm one step ahead of him.

863
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:45,009
I'm organizing the wedding
in Shen's residence.

864
00:36:45,129 --> 00:36:46,448
Let's see if he dares show up here.

865
00:36:47,688 --> 00:36:48,448
Watch out, Young Master.

866
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:53,329
Why did the roof break all of a sudden?

867
00:36:53,688 --> 00:36:54,208
Hurry up.

868
00:36:54,448 --> 00:36:55,569
Fix it now.

869
00:36:55,569 --> 00:36:55,968
Tie Niu.

870
00:36:55,968 --> 00:36:56,648
Send someone to fix the roof now.

871
00:36:56,968 --> 00:36:57,488
Yes.

872
00:36:58,488 --> 00:36:59,208
- Don't worry, Father-in-law.
- Hurry up.

873
00:36:59,208 --> 00:36:59,688
Get someone here to fix it.

874
00:36:59,688 --> 00:37:00,569
This is too much of a coincidence.

875
00:37:00,569 --> 00:37:02,089
I'm sure this is someone's doing.

876
00:37:04,968 --> 00:37:05,728
Come here.

877
00:37:05,728 --> 00:37:06,369
Come here.

878
00:37:06,369 --> 00:37:07,129
Hurry up.

879
00:37:07,129 --> 00:37:08,129
Fix the ladder.

880
00:37:08,129 --> 00:37:09,089
- Sure.
- Come here.

881
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:11,329
Hold the ladder.

882
00:37:11,488 --> 00:37:12,009
All right.

883
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:13,208
Slow down.

884
00:37:13,849 --> 00:37:14,168
Be careful.

885
00:37:14,168 --> 00:37:14,688
Get up there.

886
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:16,849
Slowly.

887
00:37:17,648 --> 00:37:18,369
Hold tight.

888
00:37:18,448 --> 00:37:18,928
All good.

889
00:37:24,448 --> 00:37:25,089
What's going on?

890
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:31,968
Why am I, a good martial artist,

891
00:37:32,569 --> 00:37:34,888
wasting my talent on
such a trivial job?

892
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:38,529
Is it really happening because
they're not compatible with each other?

893
00:37:43,408 --> 00:37:44,168
Father-in-law.

894
00:37:44,648 --> 00:37:46,809
It's almost the auspicious hour.

895
00:37:47,289 --> 00:37:48,769
Let's not waste any more time.

896
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:51,049
Should we send someone
to bring my wife here?

897
00:37:51,408 --> 00:37:52,448
Let's complete the ceremony first.

898
00:37:52,888 --> 00:37:53,369
What do you think?

899
00:37:57,009 --> 00:37:57,968
That's a good idea.

900
00:37:59,009 --> 00:37:59,488
Tie Niu.

901
00:37:59,688 --> 00:38:00,448
Please bring Madam here.

902
00:38:01,089 --> 00:38:01,569
Yes.

903
00:38:01,928 --> 00:38:02,488
Wait a minute.

904
00:38:12,009 --> 00:38:13,849
Congratulations on the marriage
between the Shen and Song families.

905
00:38:14,648 --> 00:38:15,648
I'm sorry I'm late.

906
00:38:19,849 --> 00:38:20,208
You...

907
00:38:25,688 --> 00:38:26,248
Father.

908
00:38:26,488 --> 00:38:27,648
Don't you know who he is?

909
00:38:27,968 --> 00:38:29,329
He's my ex-brother-in-law.

910
00:38:30,529 --> 00:38:31,049
Zai.

911
00:38:31,728 --> 00:38:33,488
A brother-in-law is a brother-in-law.

912
00:38:36,688 --> 00:38:37,329
Yanzhen.

913
00:38:38,248 --> 00:38:39,529
What brings you here?

914
00:38:40,248 --> 00:38:41,448
Miao and I were husband and wife.

915
00:38:41,849 --> 00:38:43,049
Of course, I'm here
to send my blessings.

916
00:38:44,728 --> 00:38:45,329
Sure.

917
00:38:45,728 --> 00:38:46,769
You're a guest after all.

918
00:38:47,248 --> 00:38:49,569
Besides, you're my wife's uncle.

919
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:52,248
We should receive you
with good hospitality.

920
00:39:11,648 --> 00:39:12,529
Take care.

921
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:13,688
We'll get going.

922
00:39:14,089 --> 00:39:14,529
We'll get going.

923
00:39:14,529 --> 00:39:15,129
Take care.

924
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:21,809
Miss.

925
00:39:22,408 --> 00:39:23,648
The wedding is not done yet.

926
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,648
You shouldn't be doing this.

927
00:39:25,009 --> 00:39:26,208
It's not my first wedding anyway.

928
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,408
There's no need
to be so particular about it.

929
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:28,569
The wedding ceremony

930
00:39:28,569 --> 00:39:29,648
is just a show.

931
00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:30,488
Moreover,

932
00:39:30,488 --> 00:39:31,728
Third Master Song knows
exactly what's going on.

933
00:39:31,928 --> 00:39:33,089
He won't mind.

934
00:39:33,208 --> 00:39:34,448
You haven't completed the ceremony yet.

935
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:35,968
I'm going to wear my face veil anyway.

936
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:37,009
Only both of us know what's happening.

937
00:39:37,009 --> 00:39:37,888
No one else will find out about this.

938
00:39:39,448 --> 00:39:40,049
Miss.

939
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:41,888
Miss.

940
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:45,529
Miss.

941
00:39:45,728 --> 00:39:46,648
There's a commotion in the hall.

942
00:39:47,728 --> 00:39:49,208
Is there another man
who wants to marry me?

943
00:39:49,688 --> 00:39:50,968
Based on my previous experience,

944
00:39:50,968 --> 00:39:52,168
all you need to do is protect the groom.

945
00:39:52,248 --> 00:39:52,968
No.

946
00:39:52,968 --> 00:39:55,129
Official Pei... He's here.

947
00:40:01,809 --> 00:40:02,648
According to the rules,

948
00:40:03,009 --> 00:40:04,849
the newlywed couple
has to complete the tea ceremony.

949
00:40:06,849 --> 00:40:09,408
Third Master Song would like to
pay my respect to Uncle.

950
00:40:10,009 --> 00:40:11,849
Please take good care of me
in the future.

951
00:40:12,648 --> 00:40:15,168
Since Master Song
regards me as your uncle,

952
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:18,928
this is some gift money for you.

953
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:25,849
You look especially good
in this red gown.

954
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:26,849
You look

955
00:40:27,529 --> 00:40:28,488
like a rooster in the mountain.

956
00:40:30,688 --> 00:40:33,049
It seems like someone's jealous.

957
00:40:33,609 --> 00:40:34,408
Thank you.

958
00:40:35,208 --> 00:40:35,728
Miss.

959
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:38,248
He's supposed to be the guest
and you should be the host.

960
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:40,849
Why are we peeking?

961
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:41,928
What do you know?

962
00:40:42,248 --> 00:40:43,888
I'm the reason they're doing this.

963
00:40:43,888 --> 00:40:46,129
I don't mind
if they can talk peacefully,

964
00:40:46,408 --> 00:40:47,888
but if they really start a fight
because of me,

965
00:40:47,888 --> 00:40:49,168
things will turn really ugly.

966
00:40:49,369 --> 00:40:52,049
I heard that Master Song
is a very playful man.

967
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:53,089
You enjoy making friends
with different ladies.

968
00:40:53,728 --> 00:40:56,728
I wonder if you'll change
after you get married.

969
00:40:57,248 --> 00:40:58,688
It's all in the past.

970
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:01,289
Miaomiao and I are in love
with each other now.

971
00:41:01,849 --> 00:41:03,208
No one can stop us.

972
00:41:03,888 --> 00:41:05,648
Even if someone as pretty and elegant

973
00:41:05,648 --> 00:41:06,928
as the princess appears,

974
00:41:07,329 --> 00:41:09,688
I will always stay loyal to her.

975
00:41:11,688 --> 00:41:12,648
Well said.

976
00:41:12,648 --> 00:41:14,089
Master Song is very eloquent.

977
00:41:14,888 --> 00:41:15,809
What if

978
00:41:16,488 --> 00:41:19,248
you're actually hiding something
from the Shen family

979
00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:21,009
and have a secret agenda?

980
00:41:32,248 --> 00:41:33,168
Official Pei, please mind your words.

981
00:41:33,888 --> 00:41:34,849
It's my wedding day,

982
00:41:35,248 --> 00:41:36,609
and you shouldn't make
such a joke on a day like this.

983
00:41:38,408 --> 00:41:38,888
Move aside.

984
00:41:40,089 --> 00:41:40,529
Move aside.

985
00:41:43,569 --> 00:41:44,129
Young Master.

986
00:41:45,168 --> 00:41:45,728
All of you.

987
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:47,009
Surround him.

988
00:41:47,009 --> 00:41:48,009
Don't you dare touch my Young Master!

989
00:41:49,648 --> 00:41:50,408
Official Pei.

990
00:41:50,769 --> 00:41:52,289
Why are you doing this?

991
00:41:54,248 --> 00:41:55,448
I'm just doing my job.

992
00:41:56,168 --> 00:41:57,648
Master Song is involved
in a criminal case.

993
00:41:58,049 --> 00:42:00,168
He has to come back
to yamen with me now.

994
00:42:02,049 --> 00:42:03,928
Pei Yanzhen, you're abusing your power
for your personal interest.

995
00:42:04,248 --> 00:42:06,369
It seems like I've underestimated you.

996
00:42:07,168 --> 00:42:07,809
I'm flattered.

997
00:42:08,329 --> 00:42:09,529
I barely won.

998
00:42:10,888 --> 00:42:11,609
Master Song.

999
00:42:12,369 --> 00:42:12,968
Please come with me.

1000
00:42:14,609 --> 00:42:15,168
Miss.

1001
00:42:15,609 --> 00:42:17,488
Isn't this your favorite scene?

1002
00:42:17,809 --> 00:42:18,849
Suppose they really get involved
in a physical fight.

1003
00:42:19,089 --> 00:42:19,569
Miss,

1004
00:42:19,928 --> 00:42:20,488
whose side will you take?

1005
00:42:20,769 --> 00:42:21,488
Why do you even bother asking?

1006
00:42:21,648 --> 00:42:22,529
No doubt it's Pei Yanzhen.

1007
00:42:23,408 --> 00:42:24,129
Why?

1008
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,129
Master Song is your husband.

1009
00:42:26,648 --> 00:42:28,049
You're being too biased.

1010
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:32,049
Pei Yanzhen knows nothing
about martial arts,

1011
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,129
and he is a government official.

1012
00:42:33,529 --> 00:42:34,089
If Third Master Song

1013
00:42:34,089 --> 00:42:35,688
really injures him,

1014
00:42:35,688 --> 00:42:36,609
then he'll be in deep trouble.

1015
00:42:38,688 --> 00:42:40,129
It's all for Third Master Song's sake.

1016
00:42:42,129 --> 00:42:42,648
Tie Niu.

1017
00:42:43,688 --> 00:42:44,448
Stop them.

1018
00:42:46,049 --> 00:42:46,529
Master Song.

1019
00:42:46,529 --> 00:42:47,529
Are you going to run away now?

1020
00:42:51,648 --> 00:42:52,168
Miaomiao.

1021
00:42:52,168 --> 00:42:52,849
You're here.

1022
00:42:53,168 --> 00:42:53,688
Come with me.

1023
00:42:54,529 --> 00:42:54,809
Miss.

1024
00:42:54,809 --> 00:42:55,248
Wait.

1025
00:42:55,248 --> 00:42:55,769
No.

1026
00:42:56,248 --> 00:42:57,049
