Did you say that?

171
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:33,919
Yes.

172
00:08:34,359 --> 00:08:35,119
The Song family.

173
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,880
Isn't it the Shen family?

174
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:37,840
Zai.

175
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:38,679
Zai.

176
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,679
I never asked you this.

177
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,400
When you were captured,

178
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,080
do you still remember

179
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,880
where you were locked up?

180
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:46,520
Captured?

181
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,719
Xiyuan took me on a trip.

182
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:49,919
After staying for a few days,

183
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,479
I met you, Mother and Father.

184
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:55,760
It wasn't Pei Yanzhen?

185
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,359
It wasn't him.

186
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:03,119
Zai.

187
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:05,520
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

188
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:07,520
Why didn't you tell me earlier, Zai?

189
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:08,599
Sister.

190
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,280
I don't know anything.

191
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,599
I thought

192
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,880
Xiyuan discussed it with you.

193
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,479
Sister.

194
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:18,000
You didn't ask me as well.

195
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:24,679
I'm sure he wants you
to stay in Regent's Residence

196
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,840
because he wants to get rid
of the Shen family.

197
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,200
The only way is to distract Zhan Yue

198
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,239
and meet Pei Yanzhen outside the city.

199
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,080
By then,

200
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,719
the assassins and I will ambush there

201
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,840
and threaten him with his life.

202
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,559
I'm sure we can find Shen Zai.

203
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,000
From the moment

204
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
you decided to lay a hand
on the Song family,

205
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,880
(The Grand Hall)
you and I were

206
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,359
destined to raise arms
against each other.

207
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:00,359
Miaomiao.

208
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:03,000
Where is Zai?

209
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:04,880
Don't worry.

210
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,880
He will be here after eating.

211

(Turns out it was
Song Xiyuan who lied to me.)

212

Uncle.

213
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:24,760
Mother asked us not to mention it

214
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,239
because she doesn't want you to worry.

215
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,119
Why did you make her cry?

216
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:31,760
Sister, I...

There's something

224
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,719
that we should talk about.

225
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:17,039
Once it is done,

Why did you fly here?

I'll take you back to Miaomiao.

Once it is done,

233

the Song family

236
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:49,479
might be annihilated.

237

The Shen family
might be annihilated.

The Shen family

242

might be annihilated.

243
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,799
Good.

The Shen family

245
00:12:14,726 --> 00:12:16,287
might be annihilated.

The bird might be smart

252
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,400
but it still isn't human.

253
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,159
It would never learn something
after hearing it once.

254
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,440
You had so many chances

255
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,840
of touching Xiao's scrimshaw deer
along the way.

256
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,880
But I only doubted Pei Yanzhen.

257
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,400
You were cautious

258
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,000
in your schemes

259
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,559
so you won't make any mistakes.

260
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,200
You even made a ruse.

261

Song Xiyuan.

262
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,520
Do I really know you

263
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,280
for all these years?

264
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,119
If Pei Yanzhen wasn't so cruel

265
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,080
and tried to annihilate the Song family,

266
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,599
why would I give up

267
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,719
being a normal businessman

268
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:12,719
and scheme

269
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,799
to fight for
the position of Prime Minister?

270
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,479
You are so shameless!

271
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,119
Do you need to involve my whole family

272
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:22,880
for your own selfishness?

273
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:26,679
Do you think you can still be safe

274
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:28,599
when you are with Pei Yanzhen?

275
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,640
Since you left the Song family
after writing the divorce letter,

276
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:36,679
I had been working with Pei Yanzhen.

277
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,479
I was his subordinate

278
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
to help him get the throne.

279
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,679
Until that day, by accident

280
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:44,799
I heard his conversation with Zhan Yue.

281
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:46,719
That was when I realized

282
00:14:47,479 --> 00:14:49,359
Pei Yanzhen and the Empress Dowager

283
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,799
will not allow the Song family to grow.

284
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,159
Pei Yanzhen might not

285
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:57,359
have said anything
that hurts the Shen family,

286
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,760
but his heart

287
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,599
will always tell him
that rich businessmen

288
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:05,479
like the Song and Shen family
are the ones who have to be sacrificed.

289
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:08,320
Pei Yanzhen simply promised me.

290
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,119
He said when it's done,

291
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,799
all the Shen family's trade routes

292
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,520
will belong to the Song family.

293
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:17,080
In truth,

294
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:20,039
he will never touch the Shen family.

295
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:23,080
Only the Song family will be sacrificed.

296
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:26,679
I did it to protect the Song family.

297
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,159
I was backed into the corner

298
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:31,080
and planned everything.

299
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,440
That's why you sowed discord between us

300
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,919
so I misunderstood him.

301
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,030
I always thought

302
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:45,080
everything happened
because of Pei Yanzhen.

303
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:49,440
But I didn't expect you
to be behind everything.

304
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:52,320
When did it start?

305
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:58,679
Was it from the time
when the scrimshaw deer was exchanged?

306
00:16:00,479 --> 00:16:01,880
From the time
when you took Shen Zai away

307
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,280
to wrong Pei Yanzhen?

308
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:06,679
From the time
when you faked your assassination?

309
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:09,880
From the time you gave me the bird

310
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:12,960
or even earlier?

311
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:18,760
Miaomiao.

312
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:21,440
You are smart indeed.

313
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:24,719
I didn't want to deceive you.

314
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:27,000
But if you were in my position,

315
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:28,719
you would have done the same.

316
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,640
You schemed too much.

317
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,479
I'm not smart at all.

318
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:45,359
If I'm not stupid,

319
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,039
I wouldn't have

320
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:51,239
been fooled

321
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:53,719
by a bird

322
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:55,640
until I'm confused about the truth.

323
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,200
You are wrong.

324
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,960
My schemes are not flawless.

325
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,799
If you see clearly,

326
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:05,520
you will notice all the flaws.

327
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:08,719
Whether it's me or Pei Yanzhen,

328
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,560
you have never fully trusted
either of us.

329
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,160
When something goes wrong,

330
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,079
you will side with the other person

331
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,680
and doubt one of us.

332
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,560
The selfish person

333
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,359
is actually you.

334
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,719
Aren't you afraid

335
00:17:36,199 --> 00:17:37,880
there'd be any accidents?

336
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:40,239
Everything has both

337
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:43,000
good and bad sides.

338
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,719
As long as I can be with you,

339
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:48,719
the bad things

340
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,520
won't be necessarily bad.

341
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,239
I'm not competent.

342
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:56,000
I don't have any skills.

343
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:58,119
All I have is the entire country.

344
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:00,920
If I could have the honor
to gain your love,

345
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,439
I'll let go of everything

346
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,280
and give you the country as the dowry.

347
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,119
The country as the dowry.

348
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,439
That was why he didn't say anything

349
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:26,560
at the temple

350
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,439
because he knew the truth.

351
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:40,719
He knew both of us were setting him up.

352
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,160
He even knew I lied to him

353
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,160
and doubted him,

354
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,239
but he's willing to walk into the trap.

355
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:54,319
Miaomiao.

356
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:55,160
Song Xiyuan.

357
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:57,680
This is the difference
between you and him.

358
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,040
In your eyes,

359
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:03,719
you want both the country and love.

360
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:06,800
But Pei Yanzhen

361
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,040
is willing
to give up the country for love.

362
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,079
No.

363
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,280
Unfortunately,

♪Who sends the love letter

365
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:22,800

371
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,800

Come and take a look.

378
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,319
Take a look.

379
00:20:19,741 --> 00:20:20,640
Why has he returned?

380
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,319
Yes.

381
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,479
Isn't that Pei Yanzhen,
the Lord of Zhongzhou?

382
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,119
Why has he returned to Lingzhou?

383
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,400
By His Majesty's edict,

384
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,959
marriage is granted
to the Lord of Zhongzhou.

385
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:57,239
The rest of you, leave at once!

386
00:20:58,119 --> 00:20:59,040
Marriage?

387
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,119
With whom?

388
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,040
He has really returned?

389
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,520
Yes.

390
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,640
I saw it clearly.

391
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,959
It's the former Official Pei,

392
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:10,280
the current Lord of Zhongzhou.

393
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:11,959
Is he

394
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:14,199
doing well?

395
00:21:15,199 --> 00:21:17,280
He was granted a marriage
by His Majesty.

396
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,319
How can he be doing well?

397
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:20,439
What?

398
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,160
The imperial edict

399
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,959
is obviously Song Xiyuan's plan

400
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:26,719
to break off both of you.

401
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:28,800
Why are you
still thinking about marriage?

402
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:30,839
Can you think normally?

403
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,199
Pei Yanzhen's decline from Regent

404
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:35,680
is partly the Shen family's fault.

405
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:38,199
Do you think he will forgive us
now that he has returned?

406
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,880
What a surprise.

407
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:44,680
I thought I was wrong about Pei Yanzhen.

408
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,000
Turns out
I was wrong about Song Xiyuan as well.

409
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:51,359
Why don't we hide for a while?

410
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:52,959
Miss Shen.

411
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,400
Miss Shen.

412
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:58,319
Constable Zhao, you...

413
00:21:59,119 --> 00:21:59,719
Miss Shen.

414
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:01,359
His Highness sends a message.

415
00:22:02,199 --> 00:22:02,880
Let him speak.

416
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:05,880
Miss Shen.

417
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:08,160
There will be an auspicious event
in our residence soon.

418
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,760
His Highness misses his son.

419
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,959
Please send him there
so they can be reunited.

420
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,719
What's wrong?

421
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:21,520
What's wrong?

422
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,400
Come with me.

423
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,640
This is serious.

424
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,280
It hurts.

425
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:33,800
Lvying.

426
00:22:34,199 --> 00:22:34,920
My ear.

427
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,239
It hurts. It's going to fall off.

428
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:38,719
What do you want?

429
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:40,959
Even if your master remarries,

430
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,400
why are you making Miss sad?

431
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:42,680
No.

432
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,599
Did you do it on purpose?

433
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:44,319
No, Lvying.

434
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:46,839
My master and Miss Shen
love and fight each other.

435
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,359
I'm just a messenger.

436
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:50,359
There's no use in blaming me.

437
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,040
Lvying.

438
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,719
It has been a long time
since we saw each other.

439
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:57,959
Let's not mention him.

440
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,760
Actually, I come
to Shen's Residence today

441
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,319
to propose.

442
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:04,160
Official Zhao.

443
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,160
Official Zhao.

444
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:07,479
I'm afraid

445
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,319
you are too late.

446
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,479
Hold on, Tie Niu.

447
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,319
Is there a grudge between us?

448
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,760
I haven't visited for so long

449
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,040
but you come on the day of my visit.

450
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:16,119
No.

451
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:17,800
I was already here

452
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:19,760
before you.

453
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,359
You...

454
00:23:28,479 --> 00:23:28,839
Yes.

455
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:30,479
- Both of you...
- That's right.

456
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,239
We are already engaged.

457
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,160
Tie Niu. You are so despicable.

458
00:23:41,439 --> 00:23:42,760
You are so shameless.

459
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,839
Lvying.

460
00:23:44,199 --> 00:23:45,319
Stop touching.

461
00:23:45,479 --> 00:23:46,079
Lvying.

462
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:47,359
What about me?

463
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:51,400
How would I know?

464
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:52,239
No, Lvying.

465
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:53,359
- Lvying!
- Lvying!

466
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,439
Aren't we...

467
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,319
Engaged.

468
00:23:58,239 --> 00:23:58,719
Engaged?

469
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:00,959
It hurts!

470
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,199
Lackey Zhao.

471
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:03,439
I'll kill you!

472
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,719
Go away.

473
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,560
Open the door.

474
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,359
Hurry!

475
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:08,839
It's an auspicious event!

476
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,400
Hurry up!

477
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:11,359
Open the door!

478
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,839
Where is His Highness?
We are looking for him.

479
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:15,560
Come.

480
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,040
Hurry.

481
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:17,199
- Move quickly.
- Move quickly.

482
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,800
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

483
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:29,920
Mother.

484
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:30,839
I don't understand

485
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:31,800
why you are covering yourself

486
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,839
to meet Great-uncle.

487
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,719
Xiao, be nice.

488
00:24:36,199 --> 00:24:37,199
After entering,

489
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:38,520
you should stop calling me Mother.

490
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,560
Remember.

491
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,280
Don't reveal my identity.

492
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:41,760
Understand?

493
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,599
Why?

494
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:44,439
Are you shy?

495
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,079
Why should I be shy?

496
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,439
Just listen to me.

497
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:52,160
Look. There are so many people.

498
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,520
As the saying goes,

499
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,599
the country has its laws

500
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,719
and a family has its rules.

501
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,801
His Highness is going to
marry Her Highness.

502
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,439
And there are two concubines.

503
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,800
Listen well.

504
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,280
Don't hide your abilities.

505
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:06,239
If you miss out
on the Lord of Zhongzhou,

506
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,439
you will never find

507
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,760
such a great husband

508
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,280
in Lingzhou ever again.

509
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,199
Right?

510
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:12,119
- Exactly.
- Indeed.

511
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:14,280
Adjust that string.

512
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:16,479
I chose my husband back then

513
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:17,959
and he is finding a wife now.

514
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:18,599
He is

515
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:19,439
getting three instead of one.

516
00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:21,640
Darn you, Pei Yanzhen.

517
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,079
You're quite something.

518
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:27,599
Miss, there's no need to worry.

519
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,719
Young Master will be taken care of

520
00:25:28,719 --> 00:25:29,920
by His Highness.

521
00:25:30,199 --> 00:25:30,959
However, His Highness

522
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:32,640
is busy preparing for his wedding.

523
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,599
The courtyard is used to choose
the concubines.

524
00:25:34,719 --> 00:25:36,119
Please stay here

525
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,000
and not run around.

526
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:38,040
This way, please.

527
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:04,479
All right. Stand up.

528
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:07,560
Come. Hurry up.

529
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:14,959
You may begin.

530
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,599
I thought you were in a bad situation

531
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,280
but this event is on
a greater scale than mine.

532
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,400
When Official Pei

533
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,520
was still the Magistrate,

534
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,040
he was the greatest young man
in Lingzhou.

535
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:40,239
Although he is
in a slightly bad situation right now...

536
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,680
He is still the lord.

537
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:45,520
He is just as impressive as before.

538
00:26:47,547 --> 00:26:48,927
As the saying goes,

539
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,239
a remarried guy is good.

540
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:52,680
All of you have to perform well

541
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,079
and get the first place.

542
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,079
What are you doing here?

543
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,479
The exam has started.

544
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,280
I'm not...

545
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:00,719
Go.

546
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,079
I...

547
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:06,920
Come. Quickly.

548
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,640
Sit down.

549
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,680
All right.

550
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,719
You may begin.

551
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:15,880
His Highness said

552
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:17,800
a woman should manage the house well.

553
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:20,000
Making good calculations
means having a clear heart.

554
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:38,599
His Highness

555
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:40,119
loves to eat osmanthus cake.

556
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,160
Everyone,

557
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,920
show your best cooking skills.

558
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:47,000
(He used to say
he only eats the osmanthus cake I made.)

559
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,640
(Seems like he has changed.)

560
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,920
(Don't you hate sweet food?)

561
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:53,719
(Fine.)

562
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,800
(I'll make it so sweet.)

563
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,400
(You will be feeling sick
from sweetness.)

564
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:14,959
Keep this.

565
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,680
Sure.

566
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:17,880
Miss.

567
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,119
It's you.

568
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,199
You can stay.

569
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:23,040
I don't mind if we are competing
in cooking or calculations.

570
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:26,000
Why do we need to compete in
such boorish events for the selection?

571
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:27,800
His Highness appreciates martial arts.

572
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:28,800
Those who enter Pei's Residence

573
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,079
should have a common interest
with His Highness.

574
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,280
That's right.

575
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:35,000
If you have a weak body,

576
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,959
you should forfeit immediately.

577
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:38,680
His Highness is handsome and talented.

578
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:41,680
His concubine
should help bear his children.

579
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:01,599
Wonderful. It's you.

580
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:02,400
Stay here.

581
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:04,400
Inform His Highness.

582
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,839
She is incredible.

583
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,719
Yes.

584
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,760
Who is she?

585
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,000
She lifts it with one hand.

586
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,160
Why is she so strong?

587
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,959
Exactly.

588
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,520
Is she really a girl?

589
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:19,239
That's impossible.

590
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,439
What's going on?

591
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,599
How did she do it?

592
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,000
I couldn't lift it.

593
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,119
My hands were sore.

594
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:25,560
It was really heavy.

595
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,400
Is she really so strong?

596
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,100
(Pei Residence)

597
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:32,239
Keep up.

598
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,079
It is a blessing to be chosen

599
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,800
by His Highness.

600
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,959
Perform well tonight.

601
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,560
Don't let me down.

602
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:43,760
Perform?

603
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,800
What are we doing?

604
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,119
You need to strike first

605
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,479
before Her Highness is here.

606
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,800
Don't you know that?

607
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:52,439
Do you need me to teach you?

608
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:55,199
When did Pei Yanzhen...

609
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,400
When did His Highness
become someone like that?

610
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:01,640
You strike when the iron is hot.

611
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,599
What's done cannot be undone.

612
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:04,119
What do you...

613
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,280
Why do you

614
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,520
sound so familiar?

615
00:30:11,719 --> 00:30:13,439
I don't usually sound like this.

616
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,079
Perhaps I've caught a cold.

617
00:30:17,719 --> 00:30:19,119
I should avoid seeing His Highness

618
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:19,880
just in case...

619
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,160
This is a good opportunity.

620
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,800
Don't waste it.

621
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,520
Go inside.

622
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,319
Otherwise, you'll be late.

623
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:26,719
Hurry. Come.

624
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:27,280
Hurry.

625
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:28,119
You.

626
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,280
Perform well.

627
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,199
Understand?

628
00:30:30,199 --> 00:30:31,160
Go.

629
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:45,880
Your Highness.

630
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:46,880
Here you go.

631
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,920
I know a little dancing.

632
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:55,000
Can Your Highness
allow me to dance a song for you?

633
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:58,959
(This move is only useful
to Third Master Song.)

634
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,280
(Pei Yanzhen will not agree to it.)

635
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,479
Sure.

636
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:19,880
Can I

637
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:21,719
first have a toast with you?

638
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,040
That's not good.

639
00:32:44,719 --> 00:32:46,000
Why are you still standing here?

640
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,160
His Highness is waiting for you.

641
00:32:47,719 --> 00:32:49,319
Her Highness
hasn't married His Highness yet.

642
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:50,520
Doing that

643
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:52,359
isn't right.

644
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,439
What's wrong with that?

645
00:32:53,767 --> 00:32:55,167
When the imperial court
granted the marriage,

646
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:56,520
it was said
that good things come in pairs.

647
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,640
So His Highness
can have more than one concubine.

648
00:32:59,239 --> 00:33:01,079
His Highness favors you.

649
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:02,079
You should go.

650
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:06,839
She is so lucky.

651
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,800
She is favored by His Highness
as soon as she arrives.

652
00:33:23,199 --> 00:33:24,959
(I said to only take a glance at him.)

653
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,920
(Now that I've seen him,)

654
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,520
(it's time for me to leave.)

655
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,000
(Besides,)

656
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:31,479
(whom he marries)

657
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:32,680
(is none of my business.)

658
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:41,800
(No.)

659
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:43,719
(I've never been)

660
00:33:43,719 --> 00:33:45,119
(this angry in my life.)

661
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:46,839
(We used to be a married couple.)

662
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:48,319
(I can't see him)

663
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:50,119
(turning into such a vulgar person.)

664
00:33:50,439 --> 00:33:51,640
(I'm doing this for his own good.)

665
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,000
Pei Yanzhen!

666
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,280
Miao.

667
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:16,199
You are finally here.

668
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:19,520
How...

669
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,800
How do you know it's me?

670
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,919
How would I get you

671
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,280
to come inside if I didn't do that?

672
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,280
You did everything on purpose?

673
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,520
From the moment I stepped inside...

674
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,919
From the moment
