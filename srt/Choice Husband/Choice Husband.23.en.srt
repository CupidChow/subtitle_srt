Back in the day, you and I...

This is a popular myth

00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,004
that is widespread in Weiyang.

27
00:02:04,523 --> 00:02:05,884
It is about the love entanglement

28
00:02:06,284 --> 00:02:07,803
between a gorgeous Grape Fairy,

29
00:02:07,803 --> 00:02:10,604
the God of Fire and the God of Night
in antediluvian period.

30
00:02:10,884 --> 00:02:11,884
It's quite interesting.

31
00:02:13,163 --> 00:02:16,283
But the ending varies greatly.

32
00:02:17,163 --> 00:02:19,044
It's different in every script.

33
00:02:19,443 --> 00:02:20,563
We don't know which is right.

34
00:02:21,163 --> 00:02:22,443
What endings does it have?

35
00:02:23,604 --> 00:02:24,523
It's said that

36
00:02:25,124 --> 00:02:27,764
after using the Grape Fairy,
the God of Night killed

37
00:02:28,003 --> 00:02:29,124
the God of Fire

38
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:30,083
and became the Supreme God.

39
00:02:30,604 --> 00:02:32,923
The six realms were under his control
and he was alone forever.

40
00:02:33,124 --> 00:02:35,283
He was far away from the Grape Fairy

41
00:02:35,404 --> 00:02:36,244
and can't see her again.

42
00:02:36,803 --> 00:02:37,684
And it's also said that

43
00:02:38,044 --> 00:02:40,244
after being used by the God of Night,
the Grape Fairy

44
00:02:40,443 --> 00:02:41,723
killed herself.

45
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:43,044
The God of Fire died for her.

46
00:02:43,244 --> 00:02:44,044
The God of Night ascended the throne.

47
00:02:44,643 --> 00:02:45,563
But the God of Night

48
00:02:45,723 --> 00:02:46,404
can never

49
00:02:46,404 --> 00:02:47,484
accept

50
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:49,604
another girl besides the Grape Fairy

51
00:02:50,124 --> 00:02:51,884
and he had been alone ever since.

52
00:02:52,324 --> 00:02:54,003
Why must the two persons in love

53
00:02:54,003 --> 00:02:56,523
hurt one another in the end?

54
00:02:59,003 --> 00:03:00,044
You're too young

55
00:03:00,404 --> 00:03:02,604
to be so sentimental.

56
00:03:04,723 --> 00:03:05,244
Kiddo,

57
00:03:05,923 --> 00:03:06,923
let me ask you this.

58
00:03:07,324 --> 00:03:10,404
Why do you keep calling me Mom?

59
00:03:11,163 --> 00:03:12,003
Do we know

60
00:03:12,404 --> 00:03:13,124
each other?

61
00:03:16,204 --> 00:03:16,844
Sister,

62
00:03:17,204 --> 00:03:18,684
do you really forget about me

63
00:03:18,684 --> 00:03:20,324
and Great-uncle?

64
00:03:21,044 --> 00:03:21,923
Great-uncle?

65
00:03:22,563 --> 00:03:24,003
How would I know your Great-uncle?

66
00:03:24,283 --> 00:03:25,363
Is your Great-uncle famous?

67
00:03:25,964 --> 00:03:28,523
Great-uncle is Regent.

68
00:03:28,723 --> 00:03:29,523
Regent?

69
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,523
You're saying the Regent who's blind?

70
00:03:33,163 --> 00:03:34,764
He's your mother's uncle?

71
00:03:35,803 --> 00:03:36,523
It's not right.

72
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:38,723
Brother told me the other day

73
00:03:38,923 --> 00:03:41,244
that Regent's wife was his niece.

74
00:03:41,844 --> 00:03:43,723
You're the son of his niece.

75
00:03:43,964 --> 00:03:45,764
Doesn't it make you the son of Regent?

76
00:03:48,363 --> 00:03:50,643
The lives of the grandees
are too messy.

77
00:03:50,643 --> 00:03:51,363
Gosh.

78
00:03:52,163 --> 00:03:52,643
But,

79
00:03:53,324 --> 00:03:55,044
is he really your dad?

80
00:03:55,044 --> 00:03:55,884
If he's your dad,

81
00:03:55,884 --> 00:03:57,363
why would you call him Great-uncle?

82
00:03:58,643 --> 00:03:59,324
I...

83
00:04:00,163 --> 00:04:02,003
My mom died because of him.

84
00:04:02,244 --> 00:04:04,443
I... I don't want to call him Dad.

85
00:04:05,324 --> 00:04:07,044
Do you really not remember us?

86
00:04:07,923 --> 00:04:09,124
Why would you be in my memory?

87
00:04:11,124 --> 00:04:11,723
Even a kid

88
00:04:12,163 --> 00:04:14,083
like you is aware of the blood feud

89
00:04:14,484 --> 00:04:16,243
of the Xu family in Weiyang?

90
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:18,644
I dare not forget about it.

91
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:21,524
I'm screwed.

92

Song

93
00:04:23,123 --> 00:04:25,003
told me to stay away from Regent.

94
00:04:25,003 --> 00:04:25,563
Now...

95
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:30,604

Our guards tracked him along the way.

101
00:04:52,804 --> 00:04:53,764
He did come to the theater.

102
00:04:54,924 --> 00:04:56,804
There are many people
in Weiyang City against you.

103
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:59,123
And the theater is quite a mixed bag.

00:08:43,844 --> 00:08:44,724
I got lost

171
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:45,724
when I tried to find Mom.

172
00:08:45,844 --> 00:08:47,844
It was this lady who took me in.

173
00:08:49,443 --> 00:08:50,123
Lady?

174
00:08:54,764 --> 00:08:57,043
Miss, why didn't you say it?

175
00:09:14,003 --> 00:09:15,123
(Because)

176
00:09:15,683 --> 00:09:17,563
(I'm a mute.)

177
00:09:39,964 --> 00:09:40,563
I'm sorry.

178
00:09:50,603 --> 00:09:51,084
Xiao,

179
00:09:52,123 --> 00:09:52,964
have you had lunch?

180
00:09:55,164 --> 00:09:57,084
She is taking me to lunch.

181
00:09:58,003 --> 00:09:58,764
Thank you

182
00:09:58,964 --> 00:09:59,844
for taking care of Xiao.

183
00:10:00,443 --> 00:10:02,164
You'll be rewarded handsomely.

184
00:10:05,683 --> 00:10:06,243
Xiao,

185
00:10:07,603 --> 00:10:09,243
why did you come to the theater?

186
00:10:09,243 --> 00:10:10,043
You made me worry.

187
00:10:12,563 --> 00:10:14,284
Mom liked to watch shows.

188
00:10:17,443 --> 00:10:19,443
(It seems like his wife
who died young)

189
00:10:19,803 --> 00:10:22,043
(got the same hobby as mine.)

190
00:10:22,884 --> 00:10:23,724
So what?

191
00:10:25,644 --> 00:10:26,324
Your mom

192
00:10:28,284 --> 00:10:29,404
refused to come back.

193
00:10:29,923 --> 00:10:31,803
It was you who made her do this.

194
00:10:33,644 --> 00:10:34,404
Yes,

195
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:35,923
it was my fault.

196
00:10:38,043 --> 00:10:38,603
Xiao,

197
00:10:39,923 --> 00:10:40,764
go back with me.

198
00:10:49,084 --> 00:10:49,844
Great-uncle,

199
00:10:50,764 --> 00:10:52,043
I have a request.

200
00:10:52,363 --> 00:10:52,964
What is it?

201
00:10:53,363 --> 00:10:55,084
I... I don't want to go back.

202
00:10:55,084 --> 00:10:56,603
I want to stay at the theatrical troupe

203
00:10:56,603 --> 00:10:57,243
to learn.

204
00:10:58,164 --> 00:10:58,764
No way.

205
00:10:59,803 --> 00:11:01,363
There are many kinds
of people in the troupe.

206
00:11:01,363 --> 00:11:01,923
It's a mixed bag.

207
00:11:01,923 --> 00:11:03,084
You shouldn't stay here.

208
00:11:03,483 --> 00:11:03,884
But,

209
00:11:03,884 --> 00:11:05,243
isn't the troupe made

210
00:11:05,243 --> 00:11:07,363
to keep the parentless orphans like me?

211
00:11:07,603 --> 00:11:08,363
Shen Xiao,

212
00:11:08,884 --> 00:11:09,524
do not talk nonsense.

213
00:11:10,324 --> 00:11:11,123
You can say you have no father,

214
00:11:11,123 --> 00:11:12,443
but you can't say you have no mother.

215
00:11:13,443 --> 00:11:14,084
Get up.

216
00:11:33,164 --> 00:11:35,084
(He likes to watch shows.)

217
00:11:35,644 --> 00:11:37,243
(It's to reminisce
about his deceased mother.)

218
00:11:37,923 --> 00:11:39,164
(If you stop him,)

219
00:11:39,443 --> 00:11:41,683
(it'll only make him run away
from home again.)

220
00:11:45,884 --> 00:11:46,764
You're right, Miss.

221
00:11:47,683 --> 00:11:48,563
I'll agree with it.

222
00:11:51,204 --> 00:11:52,644
You agree, Great-uncle!

223
00:11:53,043 --> 00:11:54,964
I can stay by your side, Sister.

224
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,243
(It's karma.)

225
00:12:01,204 --> 00:12:02,003
Miss, about the show

226
00:12:02,524 --> 00:12:03,363
just now,

227
00:12:03,363 --> 00:12:05,043
what is considered a good ending?

228
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:19,404
(It's just a myth.)

229
00:12:20,164 --> 00:12:22,644
(The ending can't be decided
by the mortals like us.)

230
00:12:24,324 --> 00:12:26,363
(It's just a story.)

231
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,003
Why didn't they write a good ending

232
00:12:30,964 --> 00:12:31,724
for the mortals

233
00:12:32,483 --> 00:12:33,204
as a keepsake?

234
00:12:34,363 --> 00:12:35,844
Why must it be a sad ending?

235
00:12:36,563 --> 00:12:39,204
It'll only make the mortals upset.

236
00:12:47,123 --> 00:12:48,404
(As such,)

237
00:12:49,043 --> 00:12:50,284
(you could've paid)

238
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:51,884
(the troupe)

239
00:12:52,243 --> 00:12:55,164
(to write a good ending.)

240
00:12:56,603 --> 00:12:58,243
You seem to know a lot about the shows.

241
00:12:59,923 --> 00:13:00,644
Why don't

242
00:13:01,443 --> 00:13:03,724
you come to my residence and teach Xiao?

243
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,043
Fate brings us together.

244
00:13:07,764 --> 00:13:08,443
Consider

245
00:13:08,884 --> 00:13:09,844
this hairpin as the deposit.

246
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:11,764
Tomorrow noon,

247
00:13:12,404 --> 00:13:13,404
I'll see you at my place.

248
00:13:14,563 --> 00:13:15,043
Xiao,

249
00:13:15,764 --> 00:13:16,363
let's go.

250
00:13:18,644 --> 00:13:19,363
I'll wait for you.

251
00:13:40,724 --> 00:13:42,003
Why does this silver hairpin

252
00:13:43,164 --> 00:13:44,724
look so familiar?

253
00:13:48,003 --> 00:13:49,363
Regent

254
00:13:49,764 --> 00:13:51,563
has obtained the entire world.

255
00:13:52,724 --> 00:13:55,884
Why would he care so much
about the folktale?

256
00:14:04,483 --> 00:14:04,964
Sheng,

257
00:14:05,764 --> 00:14:06,443
are you asleep?

258
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:12,363
Come in.

259
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:23,844
What were you up to today?

260
00:14:24,324 --> 00:14:25,123
Nothing.

261
00:14:25,524 --> 00:14:26,084
I was...

262
00:14:27,483 --> 00:14:28,164
Just doing the accounts.

263
00:14:28,164 --> 00:14:28,923
I didn't go out.

264
00:14:30,724 --> 00:14:32,644
Why did Master Qin

265
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:35,603
from the theater say
our bird went there?

266
00:14:36,164 --> 00:14:37,284
Did you have anything to do with this?

267
00:14:41,483 --> 00:14:43,803
It's a long story.

268
00:14:46,524 --> 00:14:47,043
Sheng.

269
00:14:50,524 --> 00:14:51,524
I've told you

270
00:14:52,003 --> 00:14:53,603
many times about this.

271
00:14:53,683 --> 00:14:55,123
But you didn't listen.

272
00:14:55,803 --> 00:14:57,644
If Regent finds out about your identity,

273
00:14:58,084 --> 00:14:59,964
your life will be endangered.

274
00:15:00,404 --> 00:15:01,164
As such,

275
00:15:02,164 --> 00:15:04,123
why did you insist on going out?

276
00:15:04,964 --> 00:15:05,644
He's asking you

277
00:15:05,923 --> 00:15:07,483
why you insisted on going out.

278
00:15:09,123 --> 00:15:11,084
Regent is like a monster.

279
00:15:11,084 --> 00:15:13,243
He's a cold-blooded demon.

280
00:15:13,243 --> 00:15:14,483
Stop acting like a child.

281
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:16,764
But I don't think

282
00:15:16,764 --> 00:15:18,164
he's as bad as you say.

283
00:15:20,084 --> 00:15:21,363
You met him today?

284
00:15:23,844 --> 00:15:25,964
I ran into the Prince.

285
00:15:26,524 --> 00:15:28,443
He's cute

286
00:15:29,324 --> 00:15:30,803
and he likes to watch shows too.

287
00:15:31,844 --> 00:15:33,243
When I saw him,

288
00:15:33,884 --> 00:15:35,603
I felt a sense of familiarity with him.

289
00:15:36,764 --> 00:15:39,003
So I had fun with him for a while.

290
00:15:39,524 --> 00:15:41,243
Then, did he ask you anything?

291
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,884
Why are you so nervous?

292
00:15:45,084 --> 00:15:46,123
Answer me, Sheng.

293
00:15:48,683 --> 00:15:49,363
Nothing.

294
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:51,524
He's the Regent.

295
00:15:51,844 --> 00:15:52,844
I'm just a commoner.

296
00:15:53,443 --> 00:15:54,524
What can he ask me?

297
00:16:22,404 --> 00:16:22,923
Sheng,

298
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:26,964
I've got to make a run
to the capital these several days.

299
00:16:27,884 --> 00:16:29,363
I'll leave the guards here

300
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,603
to protect you.

301
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:32,563
But you must promise me

302
00:16:33,404 --> 00:16:35,404
not to interact with Pei Yanzhen

303
00:16:35,404 --> 00:16:36,443
again.

304
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:39,844
But,

305
00:16:41,363 --> 00:16:42,443
I have a feeling

306
00:16:42,923 --> 00:16:44,443
that he's related to my lost memory.

307
00:16:44,923 --> 00:16:45,603
Xu Sheng,

308
00:16:47,363 --> 00:16:49,443
why are you so eager to remember
what you've forgotten?

309
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:50,803
Besides,

310
00:16:50,803 --> 00:16:52,164
I've told you what you wanted to know.

311
00:16:53,243 --> 00:16:54,563
In the past two years,

312
00:16:54,884 --> 00:16:55,884
how did I accompany you

313
00:16:56,043 --> 00:16:57,043
and treat you?

314
00:16:57,764 --> 00:16:59,123
You don't even trust me?

315
00:17:01,003 --> 00:17:02,563
But he...

316
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,164
Sheng,

317
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,564
when I return,

318
00:17:06,323 --> 00:17:07,644
I'll take you away from Weiyang.

319
00:17:08,564 --> 00:17:09,924
Then, we'll wander around the world

320
00:17:10,164 --> 00:17:11,804
and stay away from these disputes.

321
00:17:12,684 --> 00:17:13,164
Okay?

322
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,730
(Pei's Residence)

323
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:46,123
The imperial physician said

324
00:17:46,764 --> 00:17:48,363
it was caused
by the unremoved poison.

325
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,603
I've sent someone to ask around.

326
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,164
The monk will be back
the day after tomorrow.

327
00:17:52,444 --> 00:17:53,764
We'll go for the treatment by then.

328
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:54,924
Do you want

329
00:17:55,123 --> 00:17:55,924
to stay blind forever?

330
00:17:56,684 --> 00:17:57,243
No rush.

331
00:17:58,363 --> 00:17:59,284
I have something to do tomorrow.

332
00:18:00,404 --> 00:18:01,404
Sit down and have a drink with me.

333
00:18:10,684 --> 00:18:11,444
You don't understand.

334
00:18:14,044 --> 00:18:14,684
Today, I...

335
00:18:16,564 --> 00:18:17,603
I met her today.

336
00:18:19,123 --> 00:18:20,044
But she didn't seem

337
00:18:20,884 --> 00:18:21,684
to remember me.

338
00:18:22,444 --> 00:18:23,164
Shen Miao?

339
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,644

Can you recognize her?

I don't have to see her.

343
00:18:34,284 --> 00:18:35,924
From the moment I held her hand,

344
00:18:36,843 --> 00:18:37,524
I knew

345
00:18:39,003 --> 00:18:39,684
it must be her.

What are you going to do?

351
00:19:07,764 --> 00:19:09,083
If it's really Shen Miao,

352
00:19:10,203 --> 00:19:11,203
I'll distract Song Xiyuan.

353
00:19:11,603 --> 00:19:13,083
And we'll take the chance
to take her away.

No.

Do nothing.

356

I don't want her to forget,

357
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,164
but I'm worried she'll remember me.

to keep an eye on you.

You're not allowed to leave.

Why are you everywhere?

Here's the answer.

Before Young Master left,

372
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,564
he specifically drew a map.

373

It indicates every possible way
you'll use to escape.

We've memorized every one of them.

Very well.

The respectable Regent is doing laundry?

You don't know this.

385

A high-ranked official

386

should not live like a parasite.

This is how one establishes oneself.

how annoying you were back then.

Miss Lvying is the only one
I care for.

That's why she forgot about the past.

433

She didn't mean to do this.

But why didn't we get her a physician?

Because it might be better

for her to forget about it.

437

as Mom forgot about me.

00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:20,804
You can see
that she has a narrow escape.

510
00:31:21,603 --> 00:31:22,363
Do you want her

511
00:31:22,363 --> 00:31:24,444
to live with pain and hatred again?

512
00:31:32,804 --> 00:31:34,284
I have to inform Xiao.

513
00:31:58,644 --> 00:31:59,164
Never mind.

514
00:32:04,044 --> 00:32:04,963
Since I went blind,

515
00:32:05,684 --> 00:32:06,404
I always bumped into something.

516
00:32:08,524 --> 00:32:09,483
If you help me like this,

517
00:32:10,284 --> 00:32:11,924
I won't be able to memorize
the landscape.

(I beg to differ.)

(Everyone)

520

(should be kind to those who need help.)

521
00:32:28,723 --> 00:32:30,804
(Just rest assured and hold my hand.)

522
00:32:37,963 --> 00:32:39,564
What are you looking at?

523
00:32:47,323 --> 00:32:48,804
(You're much different)

524
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:50,243
(from what I heard about you.)

525
00:32:50,884 --> 00:32:52,884
Well, what have you heard about me?

526
00:32:57,243 --> 00:32:59,603
(You're decisive)

527
00:33:00,123 --> 00:33:01,723
(and brutal.)

528

(The evilest villain in court.)

529
00:33:15,404 --> 00:33:18,603
(But there are calluses on your palm.)

530
00:33:19,404 --> 00:33:22,044
(I guess it's caused
by the perennial sword practice.)

531
00:33:28,003 --> 00:33:30,284
(You're elegant and polite.)

532
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:32,884
(You're also good at managing
the state affairs.)

(You have both brain and brawn.)

(You should be a hero.)

535
00:33:40,404 --> 00:33:41,723
Is this really what you think of me?

536
00:33:45,804 --> 00:33:50,123
(I don't lie.)

537
00:33:52,123 --> 00:33:52,963
To be honest with you,

538
00:33:53,764 --> 00:33:56,284
I thought you were not coming today.

539
00:34:00,003 --> 00:34:03,083
(I was strictly watched by my brother.)

540
00:34:03,843 --> 00:34:07,284
(It was hard for me to come here.)

541
00:34:07,564 --> 00:34:08,123
You're saying...

542
00:34:10,843 --> 00:34:12,123
What is Song Xiyuan to you?

543
00:34:25,603 --> 00:34:27,123
(I'm Pei Yanzhen.)

544
00:34:28,004 --> 00:34:29,724
(Greetings to Miss Shen.)

545

You actually want to kill me

553
00:35:03,843 --> 00:35:05,043
with the hairpin I gave you.

554
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:06,884
I should've killed you earlier.

(Their every attack)

556

Get a physician over.

Hurry up!

593
00:36:41,444 --> 00:36:41,884
Noted.

Your Highness.

Physician,

598
00:37:11,603 --> 00:37:12,684
how is my wife doing?

599
00:37:14,323 --> 00:37:16,484
She was fatally injured back then.

600
00:37:17,164 --> 00:37:18,404
The blood stagnated in the chest.

601
00:37:19,123 --> 00:37:20,404
With Heaven's blessing,

602
00:37:20,684 --> 00:37:21,724
she survived.

603
00:37:21,964 --> 00:37:23,684
But her poor blood circulation

604
00:37:24,164 --> 00:37:25,763
might implicate the memory.

605
00:37:25,884 --> 00:37:26,763
You're right.

606
00:37:27,684 --> 00:37:29,603
But why did she pass out?

607
00:37:31,164 --> 00:37:32,724
If I'm not wrong,

608
00:37:33,244 --> 00:37:35,323
something must've stimulated her.

609
00:37:35,724 --> 00:37:37,204
It has removed the blood stasis.

610
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:39,363
She's unconscious now.

611
00:37:39,763 --> 00:37:41,644
But it might be a blessing in disguise.

612
00:37:42,204 --> 00:37:43,964
She might be able to regain her memory.

613
00:37:45,603 --> 00:37:46,684
If it's the case,

614
00:37:46,684 --> 00:37:48,563
Mother will be able to recognize me.

615
00:37:48,803 --> 00:37:49,803
Is there a way

616
00:37:50,603 --> 00:37:52,123
to make her forget about the past?

617
00:37:53,164 --> 00:37:53,644
Well...

618
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:54,843
Great-uncle,

619
00:37:55,164 --> 00:37:56,884
you got Mother injured.

620
00:37:56,964 --> 00:37:58,204
Now, are you trying to keep

621
00:37:58,444 --> 00:38:01,924
me and Mother apart
just to cover your sin?

622
00:38:02,283 --> 00:38:02,884
Xiao,

623
00:38:03,244 --> 00:38:03,924
do not talk nonsense.

624
00:38:05,123 --> 00:38:05,603
Let's go.

625
00:38:06,363 --> 00:38:07,283
Let go of me!

626
00:38:07,283 --> 00:38:08,204
- Let go of me!
- Be gentle, Zhan Yue.

627
00:38:08,283 --> 00:38:09,644
I want my mother.

628
00:38:09,644 --> 00:38:10,803
Just think of me as a selfish person.

629
00:38:11,684 --> 00:38:12,603
Please go on, Physician.

630
00:38:13,843 --> 00:38:15,123
There's a way.

631
00:38:15,363 --> 00:38:17,244
But due to her esteemed health,

632
00:38:17,444 --> 00:38:19,164
I need to change the prescription.

633
00:38:19,884 --> 00:38:20,763
I know a little about medicine.

634
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,083
Let's go to the study room

635
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:23,843
and discuss it.

636
00:38:24,724 --> 00:38:25,164
Noted.

637
00:38:29,484 --> 00:38:29,964
Please.

638
00:39:06,484 --> 00:39:07,204
Miss,

639
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,323
it'd be great if you come back.

640
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:18,563
I miss you so much.

641
00:39:43,644 --> 00:39:44,484
His Highness said

642
00:39:46,444 --> 00:39:48,123
this is for your own good.

643
00:39:50,684 --> 00:39:51,484
Miss,

644
00:39:54,444 --> 00:39:55,924
just forget everything about this.

645
00:40:10,884 --> 00:40:11,924
You're awake, Miss.

646
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:17,083
Miss.

647
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:21,644
So you still remember I'm your master.

648
00:40:22,363 --> 00:40:23,004
Miss,

649
00:40:24,164 --> 00:40:25,363
it's not what you think.

650
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:26,603
His Highness said

651
00:40:26,964 --> 00:40:27,964
if you forget about the past,

652
00:40:28,123 --> 00:40:29,083
it'll put you out

653
00:40:29,444 --> 00:40:31,123
of your misery,
and you can live a happy life.

654
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:34,404
Is Pei Yanzhen doing this
for my own good

655
00:40:35,363 --> 00:40:36,884
or is it to exonerate him?

656
00:40:39,523 --> 00:40:40,204
Miss,

657
00:40:41,843 --> 00:40:43,123
I resent His Highness.

658
00:40:44,043 --> 00:40:46,724
But I've observed His Highness
for the past two years.

659
00:40:47,603 --> 00:40:48,924
- Maybe there's...
- Enough!

660
00:40:51,363 --> 00:40:52,123
I don't want

661
00:40:52,123 --> 00:40:53,724
to hear a word about Pei Yanzhen.

662
00:40:56,244 --> 00:40:57,684
If you take his side,

663
00:40:58,123 --> 00:40:59,123
get out now.

664
00:40:59,843 --> 00:41:01,004
Tell him that I'm awake.

665
00:41:01,484 --> 00:41:02,283
Do whatever

666
00:41:03,404 --> 00:41:04,484
he wants to me.

667
00:41:10,884 --> 00:41:11,724
Miss.

668
00:41:13,323 --> 00:41:13,843
Miss,

669
00:41:13,843 --> 00:41:14,964
I'm Lvying.

670
00:41:17,244 --> 00:41:19,043
Why would I rat you out?

671
00:41:23,123 --> 00:41:23,644
Okay.

672
00:41:24,964 --> 00:41:26,004
If you really care

673
00:41:26,004 --> 00:41:27,283
about our relationship,

674
00:41:29,043 --> 00:41:30,004
you must

675
00:41:31,843 --> 00:41:32,964
help me this time.

676
00:41:34,484 --> 00:41:35,484
Go ahead, Miss.

677
