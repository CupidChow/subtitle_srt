from Wuyi Mountain

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,810
to welcome you back today.

32
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,600
I spent a lot of money

33
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,370
and effort to get it
from the Fujian Province.

34
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,680
This tea has a unique taste to it.

35
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,920
You are fortunate enough to try it.

Come.

Did some tea merchants
trick us for money again?

43
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,370
Everyone in Lingzhou City knows
that your father is obsessed with tea.

44
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,610
They won't feel satisfied
until they trick him

45
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,560
for some money.

46
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,370
Let's go and enjoy our flowers
while they drink their tea.

Miao.

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,400
How do you feel now that
you have been married for a few days?

50
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,090
I can't say if it's good or bad.

51
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,040
But so far, he has kept
his promises to me before the wedding.

52
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,330
We eat our three meals together
every day.

53
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,370
And he's managing the relationship

54
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,890
between me and my in-laws very well.

55
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,530
If that's really the case,

56
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,730
then, it's great.

57
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:56,890
Aunt.

58
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,370
What do you mean?

59
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,840
After coming back
from your residence a few days ago,

60
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,010
your father told me

61
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,450
that you can't proceed
with the divorce yet.

62
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,170
The royal court is going
to send their censor here

63
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,090
to investigate
the Huaihe Reservoir case.

64
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,560
If the censor finds out

65
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,970
that this is a fake marriage,

66
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,610
I think our Shen family

67
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,640
will be annihilated.

68
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,250
What do you think?

69
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,890
How's the taste?

70
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,090
It's fragrant, refreshing

71
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,610
and with a sweet and rich aftertaste.

72
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,330
It's good tea.

73
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,090
But it's scalding.

74
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,530
I know it.

75
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,730
You are a person with good taste.

76
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,400
By the way,

77
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,400
you told me that you wanted
to borrow some money in your letter.

78
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,640
Why do you need the money?

79
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:10,680
Do you know

80
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,370
about the refugees

81
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,920
of the flood in Jianghuai?

82
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,650
I've heard a little bit about it.

83
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,770
My superior doesn't allow me
to get involved in it.

84
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,490
But I think

85
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:23,560
that this is about life and death.

86
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:24,520
We have to save them.

87
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,210
However,
without Official Jia's permission,

88
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,400
no one in the county yamen

89
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,730
is willing to donate
the money to help the refugees.

90
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,930
I have no choice
but to ask for your help.

91
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,240
We are a family.

92
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,650
It's good for you to have this mindset.

93
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,520
It's just some money.

94
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,010
You don't have to borrow it from me.

95
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,280
How about we do this?

96
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,080
The Shen family will set up
a booth to give out porridge

97
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,770
to help the refugees.

98
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,400
Thank you so much for your help.

99
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,560
Let's drink the tea.

100
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,450
Come.

101
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,050
Let's drink together.

102
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,610
Good tea is like this.

103
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,120
It tastes a little bit bitter
when you drink it.

104
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,330
But it has a sweet aftertaste.

105
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,240
A sweet aftertaste.

106
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,010
Drink it.

107
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,330
Why do you

108
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,010
look so happy?

109
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,240
Do I?

110
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,240
Are you not going
to end this marriage now?

111
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,610
That's not true.

112
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,280
You don't have to lie to me.

113
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,240
I already know from the start

114
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,730
that Official Pei is a great man

115
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,680
who will capture your heart.

116
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,400
But your father didn't believe me.

117
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,170
See?

118
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,890
In the end, I'm right.

119
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,050
Aunt.

120
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,360
From what I remember, you are the one

121
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,680
who was against
this marriage in the first place.

122
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,840
Impossible.

123
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,890
You must have remembered it wrongly.

124
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,560
Miaomiao, let me ask you.

125
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,730
What do you think about the Shen family?

126
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,050
How do you think

127
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,400
your father treats me
and you other aunts?

128
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,680
Of course he treats all of you well.

129
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,930
Just now, I heard them laughing.

130
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,800
I'm sure my aunts

131
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,170
are playing mahjong as usual

132
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,490
while talking about
buying new cloths and dresses.

133
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,050
Your father only thinks
about making more money.

134
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,960
He's very insensible.

135
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,960
I have to guide him all the time.

136
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,450
But I think Official Pei

137
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,280
is different.

138
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,610
You should try cherishing him.

139
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,170
Let me tell you.

140
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,450
Finding a right man

141
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,330
is like winning mahjong.

142
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,280
For example, you get a "three of dots".

143
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,800
You think that it's too common.

144
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:52,770
So, you discard it

145
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,890
to make a pure one-suit combination.

146
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:54,800
But you'll

147
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,930
end up letting others win

148
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,240
without getting the one that you want.

149
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,360
It'll be a great loss.

150
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,800
In your opinion,

151
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,890
what should I do

152
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,930
if I want to win

153
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,930
without losing anything?

154
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,170
You have to treat
the "three of dots" better.

155
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,330
As they say,

156
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,170
one should return
as good as one receives.

157
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,330
After a round of the game,

158
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,450
there are two of the "three of dots".

159
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,210
So, don't get rid

160
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,080
of this "three of dots" so quickly.

161
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,450
Hold it within your grasp first.

162
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,680
Worse comes to worst,
you can still use it to win.

163
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,560
That makes sense.

164
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,520
Looks like

165
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,050
I need to treat him better.

166
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:41,930
You've asked the Shen family

167
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:42,890
to rescue those flood victims.

168
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,280
I never thought

169
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,050
that you could be so clever.

170
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,240
When have I ever acted rashly?

171
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,770
It's just that Magistrate Jia
is keep a close eye on me

172
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,840
and he's my superior.

173
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,080
So, I can't help them directly.

174
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,730
Now, I've killed two birds
with one stone.

175
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:55,890
Not only I don't have to expose myself,

176
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,210
the Shen family also
has a good reputation now.

177
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,330
Isn't that great?

178
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:05,680
Not bad.

179
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:06,840
Anyway, I'll be staying

180
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,840
in the Shen's Residence
with Shen Miao for a few days.

181
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,930
Keep an eye on Magistrate Jia.

182
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,450
Don't let him cause any trouble.

183
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,400
Don't worry.

184
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,840
Leave that to me.

185
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,930
You should worry about yourself.

186
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,890
Don't forget that it's fake

187
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,680
and fall into this honey trap.

188
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,560
You are here.

189
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,850
Why do you have these books here?

190
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,800
Buying books was once my father's

191
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,480
hobby.

192
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,480
But he doesn't read them.

193
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,360
He just wants to look like
he's well-educated.

194
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,450
These books will just

195
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,530
rot here.

196
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,920
And we've received a lot
from you lately.

197
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,160
After thinking about it,

198
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,800
it's better to give them to you.

199
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,410
There are many valuable books here
that have only one existing copy.

200
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,650
This is too much.

201
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,010
Are you treating me so well

202
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,450
just because you want

203
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,290
to repay me?

204
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,600
What else?

205
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,040
Why else will I do this?

206
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,600
Don't misunderstand.

207
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,890
I'm from a family of merchants.

208
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,210
We care about mutual interest

209
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,410
and clearing our debts.

210
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,850
If you treat me so nicely,

211
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,970
it'll make me think
that I'm not doing good enough.

212
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:53,600
Well.

213
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,330
If that's the case,

214
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,530
promise me something.

215
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:01,770
I'm all ears.

216
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,210
Is this your request?

217
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,480
Don't misunderstand.

218
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,480
It's not that I don't want
to sleep with you.

219
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:23,970
It's just

220
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,360
that I...

221
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,330
I'm not feeling well recently.

222
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:33,770
Yes.

223
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:34,530
I'm not feeling well.

224
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:37,770
But don't worry.

225
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,530
That bed is for you.

226
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:40,920
It'll be cold at night.

227
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,850
I can't let a scholar like you

228
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,770
suffer in the cold.

229
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,890
Since you are not feeling well,

230
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,770
I can just sleep in the study room.

231
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,650
No.

232
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,890
There are many people in my family.

233
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,290
And they like to gossip.

234
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,650
If my father finds out

235
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,330
that we are not sleeping together,

236
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,040
he'll worry.

237
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,410
If you think that this is inappropriate,

238
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,160
I can sleep there.

239
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,770
If you are feeling unwell,

240
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:31,770
you should sleep on the bed.

241
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,210
Don't worry.

242
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,120
I won't do anything to you.

This is a great plan.

Not only you can save the refugees,

you also don't have

Killing two birds with one stone.

285
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,560
The Empress Dowager
lives in the capital.

286
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,530
But she's keeping
a close eye on the Lingzhou City.

287
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,450
If I'm not cautious enough,

288
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,240
she'll be paying attention
to me for nothing.

289
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,920
Do you think that the Empress Dowager
knows about your family background?

290
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,650
She has always been paranoid.

291
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:52,770
And she likes power play.

292
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,360
Back then, I had already
offended her by rejecting

293
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,770
the marriage arrangement
with the princess.

294
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,680
I think she's just feeling me out
right now.

295
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,210
If she was a man,

296
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,800
she would be a dominant one.

297
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:04,720
By the way,

298
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,320
how are you with Shen Miao?

299
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,480
She hasn't trusted me completely yet.

300
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,410
I don't understand.

301
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,770
Although the Shen family is rich,

302
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:12,320
do you

303
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,200
have to be so patient and
spend so much effort on them?

304
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,080
Shen Miao's mother

305
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,290
was the only child
of the previously wealthiest Lu family.

306
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,440
When the entire Lu family
was killed for their crime,

307
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,240
she was the only one who survived.

308
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,890
It is rumoured

309
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,440
that the Lu family
is as wealthy as an entire nation.

310
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,360
Besides the assets that were confiscated
by the national treasury,

311
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,530
they have a treasure of great worth

312
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,570
that is still in hiding.

313
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,360

I'll buy two for you.

Tanghulu.

317
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,480
How much for a candied fruit?

318
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,170
It's five wen for one skewer.

319
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,010
Here. Take it.

320
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:52,840
Here you go.

Candied fruit.

323
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,010
Eat it.

You little thief!

You can't get away from me!

Don't run, stop right there.

Wait for me.

Stop right there!

Stop right there.

Give me back my candied fruit.

Do you hear me?

352
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,600
Have you stolen from others again?

Miss.

355
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,690
We are the refugees
who fled here from a disaster.

356
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,480
We are not bad people.

I beg you.

Don't do this. Get up.

362

Get up now.

363
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,720
Just now, you talked
about fleeing from a disaster.

What happened?

365
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,010
Did something happen
on the outskirts of Lingzhou City?

Yes.

Yes.

You already know?

Don't listen to his nonsense.

Your husband told him.

384
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,200
In my opinion,

385
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,410
Official Pei

386
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,170
is a very kind man.

387

Even if his superior is against it,

388
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,840
he refuses to give up on them.

389

I knew it.

390
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,410
He's not someone

391
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,240
as despicable as Official Jia.

392

By the way,

393
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,200
what are you going to do
to help these refugees?

394
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,480
What else can I do?

395
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,770
I can just set up a food booth

396
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,480
to feed them.

397
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,200
If that's the case,

398
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,770
we'll take all the credit.

399
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,600
Besides, even if we can save them now,

400
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,480
we still can't solve the issue

401
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,410
of their livelihood in the future.

402
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,440
It's just money, right?

403

Just do as you wish.

Yes. What happened to her leg?

What is it?

I ran into a refugee on the street today

427
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,170
and twisted my ankle.

428

Didn't you see that?

429

Where did you run into that refugee?

430
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:43,810
Is that the point?

431
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:44,960
What's the point then?

432
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,050
Forget it.

433
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,770
Can you move it?

434
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,120
You didn't injure your bones.

435
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,930
Just the tendons.

436
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,010
I'll go and tell your father

437
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,410
that we'll have to stay here
for a while longer.

438
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,650
We'll see how it goes
after the physician

439
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,480
checks on you tomorrow.

440
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,010
I don't think that's a good idea.

441
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,200
It's against the norm.

442

When have you ever followed the norm?

443
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,530
Since your leg is hurt,

444
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,600
stop moving around.

just say it.

You don't have to do it.

the Shen family to back him up.

497
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,810
And now,

498
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,440
he's doing as he pleases
in Lingzhou City.

499
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,010
I won't let him get away with it!

500
00:25:58,570 --> 00:25:59,410
Calm down, Official.

501
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,570
I have an idea.

502
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:05,050
If we can make the Shen family
file a divorce with Pei Yanzhen,

503
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,600
it'll be easier to get rid of him then.

504
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,050
What a fine meal we have today.

505
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:19,530
Dear.

506
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:20,960
I want to eat the fish.

507
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:22,200
Okay.

508
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,120
Have you completed the task
at the county yamen?

509
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,050
According to the housekeeper,

510
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,960
he had done everything
according to your instructions.

511
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,440
And it went especially well.

512
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,840
Now, every refugee
is praising Master Pei.

513
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,720
Shouldn't he be happy then?

514
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,570
Why do I feel like
he's acting strangely?

515
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,050
I don't know.

516
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,240
Maybe he's too happy.

517
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:07,530
Here's your fish.

518
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:15,290
Dear.

519
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:18,360
Do you have something to say to me?

520
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:19,200
No.

521
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,840
Are you too exhausted lately?

522
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:25,930
You've slimmed down a lot.

523
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,840
How about you take a few days off?

524
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,320
Take a rest at home.

525
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,240
Then, we can spend
some time together too.

526
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,690
I don't have an appetite today.

527
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,570
You should continue without me.

528
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,320
Am I that scary?

529
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:49,770
What's wrong?

530
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,720
Miss.

531
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,200
Miss.

532
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:54,440
Eat the fish.

533
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,240
My son.

534
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,440
Is there any news
from Lingzhou City lately?

535
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,930
We haven't received
any reports in the court.

536
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,120
Mother.

537
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:16,290
The officials in Jianghuai

538
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,650
have always been

539
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,930
divided and corrupted.

540
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:21,770
Why do you care so much about the city?

541
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,720
A few days ago,

542
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:27,360
I heard about an interesting

543
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,930
nursery rhyme.

544
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:30,650
Jingde.

545
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,290
Tell His Majesty about it.

546
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,410
Yes, Empress Dowager.

547
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,440
Lingzhou,

548
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,320
Lingzhou.

549
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,570
A great place it is.

550
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,960
The Dragon King blows
apart the reservoir in anger.

551
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,930
And it's up to the King of Shen
to destroy the demon.

552
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,240
Well said.

553
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,010
My son.

554
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,240
It's not wrong for the officials
and merchants to work together.

555
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,200
But if the people

556
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,720
have no regard for the imperial court,

557
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,770
how can you sit on the throne

558
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,120
without any worries?

559
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,480
Rather than asking me
why I care so much about the city,

560
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:09,600
you should think

561
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,530
about what Pei Yanzhen is plotting.

562
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:13,810
What else will he do

563
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:17,080
in Lingzhou City?

564
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,440
If you want to eat, eat the best part.

565
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,290
Be careful of your hands.

566
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,120
Official Pei!

567
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,930
Official Pei.

568
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,170
Magistrate Jia has sent someone

569
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,200
to invite you
to Tianxiang Parlour tonight.

570
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,080
In my opinion,

571
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,840
it's obviously a trap.

572
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,720
Are we going to accept the invitation?

573
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,320
Since he has invited us,

574
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,240
of course we have to go.

575
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:07,650
Okay.

576
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:08,810
I'll go back and get changed now.

577
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,530
Yes.

578
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,440
If there's a fight today,

579
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,530
I can help you make a good impression.

580
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,770
- Yes.
- Wait.

581
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,690
Did I say that I'll be bringing you?

582
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,810
Official Pei.

583
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,170
We are talking about Tianxiang Parlour.

584
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,360
Tianxiang Parlour.

585
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,530
I am your right-hand man.

586
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,650
Of course I have to go.

587
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,360
If I remember correctly,

588
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,690
you've helped a lot

589
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:27,890
in spreading the rumour, right?

590
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,650
It's nothing.

591
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:34,890
You better learn how to speak

592
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:36,530
more carefully in the future,
Constable Zhao.

593
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:38,840
I...

594
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:40,960
Okay.

595
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:44,480
Looks like I have
to make another rumour.

596
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,650
This doesn't make sense.

597
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,890
I followed your instructions to a tee.

598
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,320
Miss.

599
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:05,440
Give up.

600
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,770
Everyone has their own strength.

601
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,770
You don't have the talent

602
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,720
when it comes to cooking.

603
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:10,720
Just accept it.

604
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,010
But Pei Yanzhen always cooks for me.

605
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:14,570
Now that he's in a bad mood,

606
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,200
it's my chance to repay him, right?

607
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,530
It's just black sesame
rice balls, right?

608
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,320
It's not that hard to make them.

609
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,050
Let's do it again.

610
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:20,890
Get me a bowl of clean water.

611
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:21,480
I'll get the fire started.

612
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:23,930
I don't believe that I can't do it.

613
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,810
Miaomiao!

614
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:41,690
Here, give it to me.

615
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:42,240
Okay.

616
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:46,480
Official Pei.

617
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,080
The village is going
to be complete soon.

618
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,010
Let me thank you on behalf

619
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,240
of these refugees.

620
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:53,530
You are too kind.

621
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:54,840
You are the one who built the village.

622
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,290
And it's my wife
who has come up with this idea.

623
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,360
Your wife?

624
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:59,530
Your wife is so magnanimous.

625
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,200
You must be tired
after working the whole day.

626
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,050
Ask them to rest up earlier.

627
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:05,290
Thank you, Official Pei.

628
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,530
You've worked hard too, Official Pei.

629
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,600
Official Pei and his wife
are so loving together.

630
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:16,890
I'm envious.

631
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,170
Same here.

632
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,530
Be careful. It's hot.

633
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:30,840
How is it?

634
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,200
Do you like the taste?

635
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,320
The sesame is fragrant and sweet.

636
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:37,480
But there are too few of them.

637
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:40,890
It's difficult at first,

638
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:42,050
but it'll get easier.

639
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:44,650
There aren't many
that made it out okay this time.

640
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,320
It'll be better next time.

641
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:50,960
Be careful!

642
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,240
Official Pei, are you okay?

643
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:02,320
Are you hurt?

644
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,010
I'm not hurt.

645
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:03,720
Are you okay?

646
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,050
Are you okay?

647
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,170
Just a little bit hurt.

648
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,360
Just a little bit?

649
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:12,050
Why did you protect me?

650
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,690
Pei Yanzhen.

651
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,690
You are just a scholar.

652
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:14,840
You are not a warrior.

653
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,960
Do you think

654
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,770
you are as strong

655
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:17,530
as me?

656
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:19,930
Are you okay, Official Pei?

657
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,930
I lost my grip

658
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,080
and accidentally hurt you and your wife.

659
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,050
Please punish us.

660
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,010
Please punish us.

661
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,120
It's okay.

662
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,320
All of you should rest earlier.

00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,360
Dear.

664
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,360
Why are you so careless?

665
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,010
I'm fine.

666
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:42,720
Let's go now.

667
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,720
Are we going to the medical centre?

668
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:47,810
Miao.

669
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,720
You should go home first.

670
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,170
I need to go out today.

671
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,810
The magistrate
has invited me to join him.

672
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,080
I can't say no.

673
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:58,320
But your shoulder...

674
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,690
I'm fine.

675
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,930
You have to be careful.

676
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:04,320
Come back earlier.

Young Master Yang, why are you so late?

679
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,640
Come back again, Young Master.

680
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:14,720
Don't forget about me.

681
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,200
I won't.

682
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,640
Official Pei, this way, please.

683
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:52,640
Official Pei.

684
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:55,570
Magistrate Jia is not here yet
due to some issues in his residence.

685
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,640
Please listen to some music first

Thank you.

Is it Miss Shen?

Put me down.

693
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,010
I'm a runner who works for Official Pei.

694
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,090
I think Official Pei is not doing well
in Tianxiang Parlour.

695
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:56,480
Please go and check on him.

696
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,770
What do you mean by he's not doing well?

697
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:59,200
Why is he at Tianxiang Parlour?

698
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,010
I don't know.

699

Pei Yanzhen!

700
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:08,640
How dare you.

701
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,050
How can do this behind my back?

702
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,130
I'll beat you to death!

703
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,720
I'll beat you to death.

704
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,050
Let's go to Tianxiang Parlour now.

705
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,160
You can't do that.

706
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:19,050
It's so late now.

707
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:21,720
Besides, how can you go to a place
like Tianxiang Parlour?

708
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,720
Why can't I?

709

He's at Tianxiang Parlour
despite his wound.

710
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,290
I have to check on him.

711
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:25,920
Let's go.

712

Miss, no!

you can't do that!

Official Pei.

716
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,200
I'm done with my songs now.

717

Do you want to listen to other songs?

718
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:54,480
Let me play them for you.

719

Official Pei.

You are hurting me.

721

Your playing is so bad

722
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:00,570
that I can't bear to listen to it.

723
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:01,920
Get out.

724
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:13,810
How is it?

725
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:14,960
Is the love potion working?

726
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,290
It is.

727
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:17,290

I'm not his cup of tea.

You useless woman.

If we fail,

we are doomed.

Luckily I was there this time.

Or else, you would have been
taken advantage of.

But how can a magistrate like him

768

use this kind of dirty trick?

What are you looking at?

770
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:36,480
How did you escape
from the influence of the love potion?

771
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:45,850
With acupuncture

772
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:46,770
to cut off all my five senses.

773

You still have a lot to learn.

Why is your face so red then?

You are obviously affected.

There's something
in this world called rouge.

Don't you know about it, Warrior Zhan?

Cut the nonsense.

How is it going with Constable Zhao?

780

has written their letter of complaint
based on your instructions.

782
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:08,010
After we get the evidence
on Magistrate Jia's crime,

783
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,570
we can hand it over to His Majesty.

As for the evidence,

785

as long as he doesn't get
what he wants tonight,

00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,770
the truth will be revealed eventually.

787
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:17,770
But before this,

788
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,200
I had underestimated Official Jia.

789
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:23,240
I think he's not the only one
who you had underestimated.

790
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,240
The same goes for your wife.

00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,010
- Miss.
- She's here with her personal maid.

793
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:34,010
She's indeed incredible.

795
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:38,680
Finally, I've found you.

Where's Miss Shen?

797
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,090
She's here too?

798
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:43,810
You asked your runner
to bring her here, right?

799
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,010
This is bad.

800
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,200
Miss.

801
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,640
Are you inside, Miss?

802
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:00,440
Why isn't she so quiet?

803
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,680
Is she in trouble?

804
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,370
Miao!

805
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:12,240
Miss!

806
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:16,770
Let him be the hero

who saves the beauty.

808
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,370
But I...

809
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,480
No but.

810
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,480
This is between a husband and a wife.

811
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,400
- Do you want to stand between them?
- I...

812
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:27,850
Let's go.

813
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:29,920
Don't push me. What are you doing?

814
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,530

Who is it?

Miao.

817
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:40,680
Wake up.

818
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,610
Wake up.

Miao.

820

This place is covered
in the smoke of a love potion.

We can't stay here.

822

825
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:02,640
If you don't like me,

00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,920
why do you treat me so well?

827
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,480
You are the one who falls for me first.

828
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:11,850
Why are you giving me
the cold shoulder now?

829
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,480
I'm not a fool.

830
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,480
