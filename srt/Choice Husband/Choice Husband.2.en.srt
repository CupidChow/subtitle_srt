19
00:01:37,878 --> 00:01:38,598
Miss.

20
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,958
You have married into Pei's family.

21
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:40,878
You should behave yourself well.

22
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,598
How come no one told me

23
00:01:45,518 --> 00:01:48,198
Pei Yanzhen is such a gorgeous chap?

24
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:49,518
Miss.

25
00:01:49,598 --> 00:01:51,039
Did you get shocked

26
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,518
until your heart and eyes turned blind?

27
00:01:53,878 --> 00:01:55,198
I'm serious about this.

28
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,719
Previously, it was said

29
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,479
that Pei Yanzhen is an ailing man.

30
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:00,838
After meeting him today,

31
00:02:01,238 --> 00:02:02,318
I found him a mild-mannered

32
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,439
and suave gentleman.

33
00:02:03,638 --> 00:02:05,079
If the imperial examination were
to grade one's appearance.

34
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,039
he's no doubt the top.

35
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:08,719
Didn't you say

36
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:10,239
that he's merely a scholar with
an appealing facade but nothing inside?

37
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,038
Even scholars can be classified
into different ranks.

38
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:14,918
If Pei Yanzhen

39
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:17,239
merely possessed the face
of a third-tier rank,

40
00:02:17,398 --> 00:02:18,719
I would just ignore him.

41
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,478
If his face were at the second tier,

42
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,999
I would consider granting him a chance.

43
00:02:22,758 --> 00:02:24,918
If it were the third place,

44
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,558
I can have a meal with him.

45
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:28,198
If it were second place,

46
00:02:28,558 --> 00:02:30,079
we can have a shot or two, maybe.

47
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:34,118
What about Master whose face
ranked at the top?

48
00:02:35,198 --> 00:02:37,198
Needless to say,
I will do whatever I want.

49
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:38,278
Miss.

50
00:02:38,398 --> 00:02:39,918
Where is your line?

51
00:02:40,278 --> 00:02:41,638
Of course, I do have.

52
00:02:41,838 --> 00:02:42,519
It's just

53
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,638
that the line is kind of low
compared to others.

54
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,038
Besides,

55
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:48,439
he threatened my dad
to take me as his wife.

56
00:02:48,678 --> 00:02:49,799
This is unforgivable.

57
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:54,198
But, it's fine to feast my eyes
with his beauty tonight, isn't it?

58
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:56,118
Tell me

59
00:02:56,478 --> 00:02:57,838
what tonight is.

60
00:02:58,038 --> 00:02:58,678
Tonight?

61
00:02:58,838 --> 00:02:59,678
Tonight is

62
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:01,278
the 8th day of the 6th month.

63
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,278
No, it's my wedding night.

64
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:05,519
Are you going to...

65
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:06,918
You're overthinking.

66
00:03:07,638 --> 00:03:08,719
I have my principles.

67
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,198
I will only appreciate his beauty

68
00:03:10,638 --> 00:03:11,599
sitting tight.

69
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,678
Why...why do you come back here?

70
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:38,239
Isn't this my study?

71
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,879
Today your wedding night.

72
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:46,159
Why are you here

73
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:46,999
instead of spending the night
with the bride?

74
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,239
I'm curious about

75
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,519
why Shen Miao left home.

76
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,278
Well, it's easy.

77
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,159
She doesn't like you

78
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:54,999
and refuses to marry you.

79
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:56,079
Why didn't you stop her then?

80
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:58,758
Official Pei,

81
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,719
I'm only in charge of
running some errands,

82
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,999
do you expect me to deal
with your privacy too?

83
00:04:10,758 --> 00:04:11,879
Where are you going?

84
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:12,719
To spend the night with the bride.

85
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,919
This is the best way
to make Shen Miao stay.

86
00:04:21,398 --> 00:04:22,759
What a beast.

87
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,100
(Nv'erhong liquor)

88
00:04:28,118 --> 00:04:28,719
(Nv'erhong liquor)
Miss.

89
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,558
Is this the method you came out with?

90
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:32,999
After Pei Yanzhen comes,

91
00:04:33,278 --> 00:04:34,439
I will pour him the liquor.

92
00:04:34,678 --> 00:04:35,759
If he gets drunk tonight,

93
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:37,199
nothing will happen then.

94
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,518
But, according to the plot of the story,

95
00:04:40,838 --> 00:04:43,639
the one who tries to tank up others
will always get tanked up instead.

96
00:04:43,838 --> 00:04:44,558
This is not going to happen.

97
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:45,879
Do you know who my father is?

98
00:04:46,278 --> 00:04:48,078
He's the great drinker

99
00:04:48,278 --> 00:04:50,358
surviving the Lingzhou's
business feasts until now.

100
00:04:50,838 --> 00:04:52,358
Even though I don't take
much after him on this,

101
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:53,879
it's just a piece of cake

102
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:54,919
to defeat a frail scholar in drinking.

103
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:05,639
This Nv'erhong liquor from my dowry

104
00:05:06,078 --> 00:05:07,039
is indeed pure and aromatic.

105
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:09,838
I'm sure he will get addicted to this
after the first sip.

106
00:05:14,558 --> 00:05:15,358
He's here, Miss.

107
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:18,118
Sit down.

108
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:19,238
Sit properly.

109
00:05:22,118 --> 00:05:23,719
Put the veil on.

110
00:05:24,838 --> 00:05:25,639
It's done.

111
00:05:30,358 --> 00:05:30,958
Master.

112
00:05:45,518 --> 00:05:46,558
Why are you still up?

113
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,479
Tonight is our wedding night.

114
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,518
I'm sorry to startle you.

115
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:52,358
I would like to apologise to you.

116
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,199
Please unveil, Master.

117
00:06:00,358 --> 00:06:02,238
May you have the best wishes.

118
00:06:27,118 --> 00:06:27,759
Master.

119
00:06:28,238 --> 00:06:30,078
Please take the liquor.

120
00:06:40,798 --> 00:06:41,599
Husband.

121
00:06:42,558 --> 00:06:44,639
I haven't eaten anything yet.

122
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:49,518
I wonder if you can join me for dinner?

123
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:50,678
Sure.

124
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:55,678
Hold on.

125
00:06:57,719 --> 00:06:58,398
Wife.

126
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,238
Since it's our wedding night,

127
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:02,479
isn't it inappropriate
to have a maidservant here?

128
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:06,278
You're right.

129
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:07,919
You're discreet.

130
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,398
Lvying.

131
00:07:09,558 --> 00:07:10,678
You may leave the room.

132
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:12,278
Miss.

133
00:07:12,518 --> 00:07:13,838
What if you need my help?

134
00:07:14,078 --> 00:07:15,358
What if you're in danger?

135
00:07:17,118 --> 00:07:18,719
Staying in the same room
with my husband,

136
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,319
why would I be in danger?

137
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,358
You're right.

138
00:07:43,398 --> 00:07:44,518
The first shot,

139
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,639
to the blessed fate of us

140
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,159
bonding with each other maritally.

141
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:55,999
Thank you.

142
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:06,759
The second shot,

143
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,838
may we be honest with each other,

144
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:10,199
and live harmoniously

145
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:11,358
from henceforth and forever.

146
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:17,278
Certainly.

147
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,159
The third shot...

148
00:08:32,439 --> 00:08:33,399
The third shot

149
00:08:33,718 --> 00:08:34,798
is a punishment for you.

150
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:35,999
Today is a big day

151
00:08:36,238 --> 00:08:38,199
in my life.

152
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,399
However, my husband
was abducted halfway.

153
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:42,999
You made me worry.

154
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,118
Worry?

155
00:08:45,118 --> 00:08:45,918
Yes.

156
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,038
I was so worried about you.

157
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,718
That's why I brought Lvying

158
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:50,879
to seek you on the streets.

159
00:08:51,238 --> 00:08:54,279
Why did you bring along
your dowry as well?

160
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,999
To ransom you from the bad guys.

161
00:08:58,598 --> 00:08:59,199
Why?

162
00:08:59,598 --> 00:09:02,759
Don't you believe in me?

163
00:09:03,798 --> 00:09:05,158
Are you not curious about

164
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,118
the Ninth Princess?

165
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:12,158
Back then, I met Ninth Princess

166
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,879
in the presence of His Majesty.

167
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:17,079
And Her Highness developed
some feelings for me.

168
00:09:17,678 --> 00:09:18,959
However, due to my vulnerable health,

169
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,718
I went to Lingzhou to attend to my duty.

170
00:09:22,118 --> 00:09:23,678
Therefore, nothing has happened to us.

171
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,319
It's late at night.

172
00:09:31,678 --> 00:09:32,718
Keep your voice low.

173
00:09:32,718 --> 00:09:33,519
Don't make any noise.

174
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,158
Gosh, keep your voice low.

175
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:36,959
How dare you!

176
00:09:37,558 --> 00:09:38,478
Why are you sneaking around here

177
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:39,519
this late at night?

178
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:39,959
Wait.

179
00:09:40,238 --> 00:09:41,718
I'm not sneaking around.

180
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:44,478
You little brat,

181
00:09:44,478 --> 00:09:45,478
why are you standing by the window?

182
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:46,399
I...

183
00:09:46,558 --> 00:09:47,478
You are eavesdropping on them too.

184
00:09:47,478 --> 00:09:48,199
Shut your mouth.

185
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,319
Lewd fellow.

186
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,079
Unruly brat.

187
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,038
I...

188
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,079
Let's leave.

189
00:09:58,038 --> 00:09:58,678
But,

190
00:09:59,158 --> 00:10:00,759
speaking of which,

191
00:10:01,158 --> 00:10:03,759
since Ninth Princess managed
to find you here,

192
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,839
how did you get rid of her?

193
00:10:07,798 --> 00:10:08,678
I will answer

194
00:10:09,478 --> 00:10:11,639
every question you pose.

195
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,399
On this wedding night,

196
00:10:13,598 --> 00:10:15,079
wouldn't it be better

197
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,598
if you join me for the liquor?

198
00:10:34,358 --> 00:10:35,319
Are you satisfied now?

199
00:10:35,798 --> 00:10:36,639
Can you tell me now?

200
00:10:41,038 --> 00:10:41,839
How's it?

201
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:43,358
Have you thought it through?

202
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,718
Do you want to marry me

203
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:48,839
or to get buried together with the rest?

204
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:54,598
Your Highness, you're of nobility.

205
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:57,598
I can't stop you from doing anything

206
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:58,959
and I don't want to.

207
00:10:59,678 --> 00:11:00,959
However, you forced me to marry you.

208
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:03,839
I don't think I will obey you.

209
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:05,038
Pei Yanzhen.

210
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:09,199
For you,

211
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,798
I refused to listen
to my brother and mother.

212
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:14,918
Many people point their fingers at me

213
00:11:14,918 --> 00:11:15,839
and I just couldn't care less
about them.

214
00:11:16,478 --> 00:11:17,598
I have done so much for you.

215
00:11:18,358 --> 00:11:19,199
Can Shen Miao do this?

216
00:11:20,478 --> 00:11:21,478
Can other women do this for you?

217
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,038
Maybe no one can sacrifice
so much for me

218
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:25,038
and I don't need this either.

219
00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:26,399
Who tells you

220
00:11:26,918 --> 00:11:29,358
that your overzealous sacrifice
will be responded with an answer?

221
00:11:33,038 --> 00:11:33,839
Pei Yanzhen.

222
00:11:34,478 --> 00:11:35,839
I'm young and beautiful

223
00:11:36,358 --> 00:11:37,839
and from the royal family.

224
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:40,759
Yet you turn me down cruelly
even if I come to you.

225
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:42,558
Pei Yanzhen.

226
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:44,598
Are you a man?

227
00:11:45,918 --> 00:11:46,839
Of course, I'm not.

228
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,319
What?

229
00:11:49,598 --> 00:11:51,439
One year ago, I turned down our marriage

230
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:52,718
and left the capital.

231
00:11:53,038 --> 00:11:54,279
Have you ever considered
the reason behind it?

232
00:11:57,439 --> 00:11:59,118
Wasn't that your body weak?

233
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:00,079
Why couldn't a man have a wife

234
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,639
if he had a common sickness?

235
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,839
I have no idea.

236
00:12:04,918 --> 00:12:05,439
Well.

237
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,918
I will confess to you

238
00:12:08,798 --> 00:12:10,079
that my flaw

239
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,079
is that I was weak since I was young

240
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,759
and I suffer
from an unmentionable disease.

241
00:12:16,558 --> 00:12:17,839
Even if I marry a woman,

242
00:12:19,358 --> 00:12:20,158
I will

243
00:12:20,798 --> 00:12:21,798
let her down.

244
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:34,079
Huh?

245
00:12:34,358 --> 00:12:35,478
Did Her Highness buy it?

246
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:37,918
Why do you care so much about this?

247
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:38,839
Of course, I do.

248
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:39,798
It's because...

249
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:46,038
Because I'm worried
about your health problem.

250
00:12:47,598 --> 00:12:48,639
I see.

251
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:52,478
Something's wrong.

252
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,358
There are so many guards
around Her Highness,

253
00:12:56,118 --> 00:12:57,959
how come you came out in one piece?

254
00:12:58,718 --> 00:12:59,478
Wife.

255
00:13:00,118 --> 00:13:00,959
One shot

256
00:13:01,478 --> 00:13:02,399
for one question in return.

257
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,558
(Something's wrong.)

258
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,319
(I feel like he's feeding me
the liquor.)

259
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,999
(Let me show you
who's the best drinker.)

260
00:13:33,598 --> 00:13:34,519
Look carefully.

261
00:14:31,118 --> 00:14:32,038
I will get you some more liquor.

262
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:34,999
Stop right there.

263
00:14:36,358 --> 00:14:37,319
Where are you going?

264
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,279
Oh, Pei.

265
00:14:41,598 --> 00:14:42,918
Have you

266
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:44,759
reached your limit?

267
00:14:46,238 --> 00:14:47,199
Surely, you jest.

268
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,238
Are you not convinced?

269
00:14:50,118 --> 00:14:51,678
Drink it if you're not.

270
00:14:55,798 --> 00:14:58,918
How come I feel so giddy?

271
00:15:03,558 --> 00:15:04,279
Look.

272
00:15:04,478 --> 00:15:05,879
You still need my help in the end.

273
00:15:06,118 --> 00:15:07,199
Why did you hurt her?

274
00:15:07,999 --> 00:15:08,718
What else should I do then?

275
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:09,879
You have drunk a lot tonight

276
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:10,718
and you haven't got her yet.

277
00:15:13,798 --> 00:15:14,399
Fine.

278
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:15,718
I'm off.

279
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:50,558
I want some more.

280
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,558
I want some more.

281
00:15:58,158 --> 00:15:58,759
Miss.

282
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:00,399
Miss.

283
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,279
Oh gosh.

284
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,439
What are you yelling in the morning?

285
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:05,759
I fail to keep you in check.

286
00:16:05,918 --> 00:16:07,558
And you...

287
00:16:08,478 --> 00:16:09,279
What?

288
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:18,839
This...

289
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:32,399
Pei Yanzhen.

290
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:33,718
Pei Yanzhen.

291
00:16:35,718 --> 00:16:36,399
How was it?

292
00:16:41,678 --> 00:16:42,598
Pei Yanzhen.

293
00:16:50,918 --> 00:16:52,238
I see.

294
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,839
I knew you were pretending.

295
00:16:54,238 --> 00:16:55,038
Does it concern you?

296
00:16:57,118 --> 00:16:58,718
No, it's not.

297
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,079
But your wife is kind of funny.

298
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:02,639
She failed to tank you up,

299
00:17:03,118 --> 00:17:04,958
and she got backfired by you thinking
that you slept together yesterday night.

300
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:08,039
How pitiful of her to marry
a black-hearted fox like you

301
00:17:08,238 --> 00:17:09,838
who will sell her off later.

302
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:10,639
No.

303
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,039
No?

304
00:17:12,879 --> 00:17:14,198
I won't sell her off.

305
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:16,838
Pei Yanzhen.

306
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:18,598
Do you have a crush on her?

307
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,238
Our marriage

308
00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:23,799
is because I need someone to help
with my pressing need.

309
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:25,598
However, I have promised Shen Qian

310
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,478
and I should take care of her well.

311
00:17:28,838 --> 00:17:30,118
Our priority now

312
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:32,879
is to make her give up on the desire
to leave here.

313
00:17:47,118 --> 00:17:48,118
Yes, it should be.

314
00:17:51,198 --> 00:17:53,639
Argh, look what I've done.

315
00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:54,838
Miss.

316
00:17:54,838 --> 00:17:55,639
I'm to blame.

317
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,039
I could've foreseen this tragedy.

318
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:59,198
Still, you've lost your virginity.

319
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:00,879
What do you mean my virginity?

320
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,279
It's Pei Yanzhen's.

321
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:04,838
Gosh, Lvying.

322
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:06,519
Why didn't you halt me?

323
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:09,399
We've promised

324
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:10,118
to simply marry a man

325
00:18:10,118 --> 00:18:11,118
to avoid the marriage decided
by His Majesty

326
00:18:11,238 --> 00:18:11,838
and get a divorce after that.

327
00:18:11,838 --> 00:18:12,559
Look at the mess.

328
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:13,999
Why do you blame me for that?

329
00:18:13,999 --> 00:18:15,639
It was you who insisted...

330
00:18:15,718 --> 00:18:17,958
Enough said.

331
00:18:21,078 --> 00:18:22,198
Well, I will pay him

332
00:18:22,598 --> 00:18:24,478
several stores as the compensation

333
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:25,799
after we divorce.

334
00:18:26,118 --> 00:18:27,799
Aunt, do you think it's a good idea?

335
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:28,718
Good idea, my foot.

336
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:29,919
Look at yourself.

337
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,039
Sitting indecently,

338
00:18:31,358 --> 00:18:32,838
talking unruly.

339
00:18:33,438 --> 00:18:35,078
You are now in Pei's Residence.

340
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,438
You should act appropriately.

341
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:40,358
Did you reveal your nature
yesterday night?

342
00:18:40,478 --> 00:18:41,279
Fret not.

343
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:42,598
I behave well even if I'm drunk.

344
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:45,078
He wouldn't find my dark side.

345
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:46,358
You were drunk?

346
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:52,759
Well, I need to figure out a way

347
00:18:53,478 --> 00:18:55,838
to irritate him

348
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:57,559
and make him want to divorce me.

349
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,720
(Imperial Palace)

350
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:04,559
(Wende Hall)
This is ridiculous.

351
00:19:04,838 --> 00:19:06,198
Do you love Pei Yanzhen so much

352
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:07,799
that you even deployed the imperial army

353
00:19:07,838 --> 00:19:08,598
to abduct him in Lingzhou

354
00:19:08,838 --> 00:19:10,838
without cherishing your dignity.

355
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:16,799
Mother.

356
00:19:17,118 --> 00:19:17,999
Jiu is still young

357
00:19:18,478 --> 00:19:19,519
and she has no idea
what's at stake here.

358
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:21,478
Simply giving her an earful will do.

359
00:19:21,838 --> 00:19:22,598
Don't scare her.

360
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:27,039
She doesn't scare me at all.

361
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:28,478
You are bold.

362
00:19:28,838 --> 00:19:29,999
Why didn't you

363
00:19:30,238 --> 00:19:31,358
stay in Lingzhou?

364
00:19:32,358 --> 00:19:33,718
I intended to stay.

365
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:35,679
Little did I know

366
00:19:36,078 --> 00:19:39,198
that Pei is crippled just like Jinghe.

367
00:19:40,358 --> 00:19:41,358
And you hide this truth

368
00:19:41,358 --> 00:19:42,438
from me.

369
00:19:43,198 --> 00:19:45,679
Mother, you only care about Brother.

370
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,039
You never consider me.

371
00:19:49,118 --> 00:19:49,838
Stand right there.

372
00:19:50,438 --> 00:19:51,358
Careful, Your Highness.

373
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,559
Get out of here.

374
00:19:53,118 --> 00:19:53,958
Yes.

375
00:19:58,519 --> 00:19:59,198
Mother,

376
00:19:59,718 --> 00:20:00,598
please calm down.

377
00:20:01,438 --> 00:20:02,358
I reckon...

378
00:20:04,198 --> 00:20:05,559
It has nothing to do with you.

379
00:20:07,478 --> 00:20:10,118
Jiu is too naive

380
00:20:10,358 --> 00:20:11,919
to handle Pei Yanzhen.

381
00:20:15,598 --> 00:20:16,519
By the way,

382
00:20:17,318 --> 00:20:19,999
what do you say about this?

383
00:20:21,358 --> 00:20:23,718
Do you mean the Huaihe Reservoir

384
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:25,358
or Pei Yanzhen?

385
00:20:26,838 --> 00:20:30,118
Your uncle will take care of
Huaihe Reservoir.

386
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:36,118
In my opinion,

387
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:37,559
it is merely

388
00:20:37,838 --> 00:20:38,718
a groundless rumour.

389
00:20:39,118 --> 00:20:40,238
Pei Yanzhen is a talented official.

390
00:20:40,838 --> 00:20:42,598
If we put him in an important position
and handle him carefully,

391
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,679
he will definitely
be the pillar of the nation.

392
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:46,919
We shall observe him for now,

393
00:20:47,838 --> 00:20:49,279
if he launches any acts,

394
00:20:49,718 --> 00:20:51,799
we will deal with it accordingly.

395
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,759
You're insightful.

396
00:21:01,838 --> 00:21:03,999
Finally, you're learning.

397
00:21:08,118 --> 00:21:10,838
However, this rumour
can't come from nowhere.

398
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,478
Plus, it's true that a royal descendant
went missing.

399
00:21:15,078 --> 00:21:16,598
We ought to get to the bottom of this

400
00:21:17,838 --> 00:21:20,438
to secure your position.

401
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,478
Don't hesitate.

402
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:27,759
Understood, Mother.

403
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:40,399
Yanzhen.

404
00:21:41,238 --> 00:21:42,838
Regarding the Huaihe Reservoir,

405
00:21:43,198 --> 00:21:44,198
(Magistrate Jia)
what do you say?

406
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:46,919
Empress Dowager appointed
her blood brother,

407
00:21:47,078 --> 00:21:48,078
Lord Qin Zuze

408
00:21:48,358 --> 00:21:49,559
to supervise the restoration
of the reservoir.

409
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:52,159
We, the officials from the prefecture
along the river

410
00:21:52,399 --> 00:21:53,399
should assist him in our power.

411
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:58,318
Well, it's easy to say this,

412
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,519
however, it's a challenging task
to work on.

413
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:01,639
Let me ask you this.

414
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:02,838
The collapsed reservoir

415
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,279
was only repaired two years before.

416
00:22:04,639 --> 00:22:06,279
How come it collapsed so soon?

417
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,198
What do you trying to say?

418
00:22:10,198 --> 00:22:11,198
Yanzhen.

419
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,238
I know you determine
to make some achievements.

420
00:22:16,478 --> 00:22:18,039
However, when associating
with the imperial court,

421
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:19,438
sometimes, one must

422
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:22,598
turn a blind eye.

423
00:22:23,399 --> 00:22:24,919
Many things that happened in Jianghuai

424
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:29,198
are actually known full well
by everyone.

425
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:32,999
If that's the case,

426
00:22:33,438 --> 00:22:35,879
I would like to share
the burden with you, Magistrate Jia.

427
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:40,438
You're young and talented, Yanzhen.

428
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,039
I'm sure you will be promoted
in no time.

429
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:45,478
Master.

430
00:22:46,118 --> 00:22:46,718
Master.

431
00:22:46,718 --> 00:22:47,399
Something bad has happened.

432
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:47,879
Madam...

433
00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:48,759
Magistrate Jia is here.

434
00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:49,838
How dare you interrupt us!

435
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:50,559
Get out.

436
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:51,358
Yes.

437
00:22:55,399 --> 00:22:56,438
It's late already.

438
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:58,118
Since you have something to deal with,

439
00:22:58,318 --> 00:22:59,438
I shall take my leave.

440
00:23:00,238 --> 00:23:01,519
Let me see you off.

441
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:01,879
Sure.

442
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:02,519
This way, please.

443
00:23:08,238 --> 00:23:08,838
Lvying.

444
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:09,879
Who's next?

445
00:23:10,118 --> 00:23:10,919
Fang Dazhu.

446
00:23:11,718 --> 00:23:12,478
Next.

447
00:23:12,478 --> 00:23:13,159
Fang Dazhu.

448
00:23:16,118 --> 00:23:17,399
Madam, I'm Fang Dazhu.

449
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,879
Your face is fairly tolerable.

450
00:23:20,639 --> 00:23:21,879
But your name is doggy.

451
00:23:21,879 --> 00:23:22,559
It sounds kind of unpleasant.

452
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:23,478
You're expelled.

453
00:23:24,078 --> 00:23:24,559
Madam.

454
00:23:24,718 --> 00:23:26,799
I have been serving Master for years.

455
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:27,679
How could you expel me

456
00:23:27,838 --> 00:23:28,838
because of such a trivial matter?

457
00:23:30,318 --> 00:23:30,999
Lvying.

458
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:32,078
Yes.

459
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,078
Miss said,

460
00:23:34,318 --> 00:23:35,118
a pure beau

461
00:23:35,318 --> 00:23:36,838
sees no ugly things,

462
00:23:37,118 --> 00:23:38,679
speaks no harsh words

463
00:23:38,838 --> 00:23:39,879
and hears no unpleasant sound.

464
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,198
Since you're working here,

465
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:43,399
your name is called by Miss

466
00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:44,759
and she has to hear your name too.

467
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:45,718
And over time,

468
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,318
Miss's beauty will be sullied.

469
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,279
Can't I just change my name?

470
00:23:49,598 --> 00:23:50,159
Shut up.

471
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,879
Madam has complete control
of this residence.

472
00:23:57,318 --> 00:23:58,679
Since Madam wants to expel you,

473
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,159
there is no room for negotiation.

474
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:01,679
Get out of here now.

475
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:02,438
Yes.

476
00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:08,318
- Husband.
- Wife.

477
00:24:08,318 --> 00:24:08,958
Say no more.

478
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:10,838
I know it was a sudden decision.

479
00:24:11,318 --> 00:24:13,279
Because the servants in my house
are all beautiful

480
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,318
and I have been used to it
since I was little.

481
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:17,279
I guess you can't accept this.

482
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:18,438
In that case,

483
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:19,559
please...

484
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,958
Please accept my apology.

485
00:24:23,438 --> 00:24:24,438
I'm at fault.

486
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:26,478
I didn't pay much attention
while recruiting the servants.

487
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:27,999
You suffered because of my fault.

488
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,399
Please tell me
what kind of servants you need.

489
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:32,078
I will task Constable Zhao
to purchase the servant.

490
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:33,718
I won't meddle with your decision.

491
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:37,639
Wife.

492
00:24:38,438 --> 00:24:39,478
Is there any problem?

493
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:54,679
Miss.

494
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:55,759
What should we do now?

495
00:24:56,238 --> 00:24:57,639
Almost half of the servants
in the residence are expelled.

496
00:24:58,118 --> 00:24:59,838
Are we going to borrow some
from Shen's Residence?

497
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:01,039
He asked me to buy some.

498
00:25:01,198 --> 00:25:02,198
I will do as he said then.

499
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:03,718
Lvying.

500
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:05,718
Recruit new servants.

501
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:07,318
With a handsome face.

502
00:25:08,438 --> 00:25:09,478
Let's see how long Pei Yanzhen

503
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:10,799
will put up with this.

504
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:14,919
Miss asked you...

505
00:25:15,238 --> 00:25:15,919
Later...

506
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:17,838
It's itchy.

507
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:18,718
Well.

508
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:20,118
Talk to this ear, please.

509
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:21,198
I said...

510
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:22,358
You!

511
00:25:23,718 --> 00:25:24,679
Miss asked you

512
00:25:25,198 --> 00:25:27,399
to pick some handsome men

513
00:25:27,598 --> 00:25:28,879
from Moon Embrace Brothel.

514
00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:30,478
This is ridiculous.

515
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,879
Moon Embrace Brothel

516
00:25:33,438 --> 00:25:35,519
isn't a decent place.

517
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:36,639
The men inside there

518
00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:37,799
aren't decent too.

519
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:39,559
Did someone bewitch Madam?

520
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:41,559
Just do what you're told.

521
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,159
No, I can't.

522
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:44,958
I'm loyal to Master

523
00:25:44,958 --> 00:25:46,318
and nothing can shake me.

524
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,399
Isn't it that I'm helping Madam to cheat

525
00:25:47,598 --> 00:25:49,159
if I do so?

526
00:25:49,718 --> 00:25:50,519
Miss Lvying.

527
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:51,318
Heed my advice,

528
00:25:51,318 --> 00:25:52,438
perish this thought.

529
00:25:52,438 --> 00:25:53,919
- I...
- I can't believe

530
00:25:54,198 --> 00:25:55,838
such an indecent thought

531
00:25:55,838 --> 00:25:57,159
will come from a young lady.

532
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:59,358
What in the world?
What's with the people?

533
00:25:59,478 --> 00:26:00,118
Gosh.

534
00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:02,318
You!

535
00:26:02,438 --> 00:26:03,159
Hush.

536
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:03,838
I...

537
00:26:04,639 --> 00:26:05,478
Miss.

538
00:26:05,838 --> 00:26:06,759
Miss.

539
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,580
(Too lazy to turn back when passing
through a full-bloom flower bed.)

540
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,340
(My heart only fills
with serenity and you.)

541
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:23,279
Why do you ask for me?

542
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:26,639
I'm afraid there's bad is impending
in Lingzhou.

543
00:26:27,198 --> 00:26:28,238
Do keep an eye on everything here.

544
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:29,679
What do you say so?

545
00:26:31,598 --> 00:26:34,718
Magistrate Jia has been embezzling funds
for reservoir repair for years.

546
00:26:35,598 --> 00:26:36,679
The Imperial Court would

547
00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:39,159
scrutinise the collapsed reservoir.

548
00:26:40,078 --> 00:26:42,478
I guess Magistrate Jia
will cover his tracks

549
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:45,318
and we will stand toe to toe soon.

550
00:26:45,598 --> 00:26:47,039
I want to make sure
that everything is in my control

551
00:26:47,478 --> 00:26:49,118
by gathering more evidence against him.

552
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:50,598
I will go work on it.

553
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:51,358
Hold on.

554
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:55,598
Deliver this drawing to Madam
when you have time.

555
00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:00,559
Pei Yanzhen.

556
00:27:01,438 --> 00:27:03,879
You are fixing the opera stage
and drawing recently.

557
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:04,919
What exactly are you up to?

558
00:27:06,718 --> 00:27:07,919
I just want to make her stay

559
00:27:08,198 --> 00:27:09,718
and be Madam Pei obediently.

560
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,478
Hurry up. Keep up.

561
00:27:14,478 --> 00:27:15,358
- Hurry up. - Those at the back.

562
00:27:15,358 --> 00:27:15,958
Faster.

563
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:16,639
Walk faster.

564
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:17,879
- Please don't beat the child.
- Come on.

565
00:27:17,879 --> 00:27:19,598
- Come on.
- Please don't beat the child.

566
00:27:19,598 --> 00:27:20,399
Watch them well.

567
00:27:20,718 --> 00:27:21,958
Hurry up. Keep up the line.

568
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:23,919
Don't shilly-shally.

569
00:27:24,438 --> 00:27:25,318
Hurry up. Don't dawdle.

570
00:27:25,318 --> 00:27:25,799
Keep up.

571
00:27:26,358 --> 00:27:27,438
Can you walk quickly?

572
00:27:28,318 --> 00:27:29,039
Keep up the line.

573
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:29,598
Stand up straight.

574
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:30,759
No one is left behind, right?

575
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:32,318
- No.
- No.

576
00:27:33,438 --> 00:27:34,519
Mark my words,

577
00:27:35,118 --> 00:27:36,039
Sir said

578
00:27:36,478 --> 00:27:37,478
you are going to stay here

579
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:39,559
the coming month.

580
00:27:40,078 --> 00:27:42,318
If anyone dares to break
into Lingzhou City,

581
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:44,238
your heads will roll.

582
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:45,519
Sir.

583
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,438
Sir.

584
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,399
We are all refugees coming to the city
to seek shelter

585
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,039
and we have no food with us.

586
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:54,919
I beg of you, sir.

587
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,639
Please spare some food for the boy.

588
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:02,438
- We're starving already.
- Starved?

589
00:28:02,718 --> 00:28:03,279
What about you?

590
00:28:05,639 --> 00:28:06,759
Why should I care?

591
00:28:08,718 --> 00:28:09,879
The collapsed reservoir

592
00:28:10,078 --> 00:28:10,999
has taken a toll on Jianghuai.

593
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:13,238
I can't even feed myself,

594
00:28:13,639 --> 00:28:14,639
who cares about you?

595
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,078
You better behave

596
00:28:17,358 --> 00:28:18,559
and stay still here.

597
00:28:19,478 --> 00:28:21,279
- Sir, please.
- Let's go.

598
00:28:22,198 --> 00:28:23,399
Sir.

599
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,159
Sir, please.

600
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,399
Sir.

601
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:42,559
Seriously?

602
00:28:45,318 --> 00:28:46,799
I have tailed those yamen runners
some time.

603
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:48,039
They mentioned about

604
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:49,318
the number of refugees from Jianghuai
is staggering.

605
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,519
The current moment is chaotic.

606
00:28:51,718 --> 00:28:52,999
Majestrate Jia fears a riot breaks up

607
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:55,078
and he halted those refugees
outside the city.

608
00:28:57,358 --> 00:28:58,879
How foolish of him.

609
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:00,759
Hasn't the thought crossed his mind

610
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:02,718
that a real riot would break up

611
00:29:02,879 --> 00:29:04,999
when the refugees outside the city
are starving to death?

612
00:29:06,358 --> 00:29:08,118
Do you really plan
to encounter Majestrate Jia head on

613
00:29:08,118 --> 00:29:09,598
to rescue the refugee?

614
00:29:09,879 --> 00:29:10,679
Yes.

615
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,118
Pei Yanzhen.

616
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:14,799
I know you care about the people

617
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:15,999
and are determined
to rescue those in need.

618
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:17,598
But what if your action invokes
suspicions of those in the capital?

619
00:29:17,598 --> 00:29:19,159
Even if you're ready to encounter this,

620
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:20,559
you should consider it
for the sake of Shen Miao.

621
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:28,159
What stink?

622
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:30,399
Did your latrine fall apart, huh?

623
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:40,559
No.

624
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,799
Get some more rotten eggs
and stinky tofu

625
00:29:42,999 --> 00:29:43,759
from the kitchen.

626
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:44,879
This stink isn't enough.

627
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:46,999
Are you sure?

628
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:48,919
Master really likes his study.

629
00:29:49,198 --> 00:29:50,999
You're going to exasperate him.

630
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:52,799
He refuses to divorce me.

631
00:29:53,198 --> 00:29:54,759
We shall see how long he can stand this.

632
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:00,919
Lvying.

633
00:30:01,198 --> 00:30:02,919
Does it stink?

634
00:30:04,358 --> 00:30:05,358
Yes.

635
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:10,118
I think so.

636
00:30:11,639 --> 00:30:12,318
But

637
00:30:12,598 --> 00:30:14,279
my husband spoils me so much.

638
00:30:14,718 --> 00:30:16,519
I have no choice though.

639
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:17,919
He said

640
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,559
I should regard this place as my home.

641
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:20,679
I can do anything I want.

642
00:30:21,118 --> 00:30:22,838
How could I let down

643
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:24,399
his deep affection for me?

644
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:25,919
(Am I right, Lvying?)

645
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,279
(Yes.)

646
00:30:30,318 --> 00:30:30,919
Look.

647
00:30:31,478 --> 00:30:32,399
Do you really want me to consider

648
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:33,879
for a woman like her?

649
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:36,759
Madam is indeed exceptional.

650
00:30:40,478 --> 00:30:41,478
Yet you still can tolerate her.

651
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:43,198
Enough.

652
00:30:43,718 --> 00:30:44,919
Enough gossip.

653
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:45,759
Go back and get a rest.

654
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,478
I can't tolerate this, anyway.

655
00:30:59,238 --> 00:31:01,838
Too lazy to turn back when
passing through a full-bloom flower bed.

656
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:06,438
My heart only fills
with serenity and you.

657
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:07,879
Miss.

658
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:09,519
This is a love poem.

659
00:31:11,198 --> 00:31:12,438
Does he fall for me

660
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:13,879
just in a few days?

661
00:31:16,838 --> 00:31:17,399
Lvying.

662
00:31:17,639 --> 00:31:18,958
Get me the record list of my dowry.

663
00:31:27,958 --> 00:31:28,639
Here you go.

664
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:31,639
Since his virginity is lost for me,

665
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:32,639
I should share half of my dowry

666
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:33,519
with him.

667
00:31:34,078 --> 00:31:34,958
But he proposed to me at first

668
00:31:35,118 --> 00:31:35,958
which is an intolerable act,

669
00:31:36,598 --> 00:31:37,598
I will deduct twenty per cent
from his share.

670
00:31:38,999 --> 00:31:39,598
Miss.

671
00:31:39,718 --> 00:31:40,598
What are you doing?

672
00:31:41,078 --> 00:31:42,879
I'm using realistic money
to bring me back to reality.

673
00:31:47,958 --> 00:31:48,759
Wife.

674
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:51,318
Hurry up.

675
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:57,358
Husband.

676
00:31:57,718 --> 00:31:59,799
What do you ask for me at this hour?

677
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,198
Do you like my drawing?

678
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:08,238
Not bad.

679
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,879
I don't know much
about drawing and poems.

680
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:12,438
I know.

681
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:15,559
So, I have prepared another present.

682
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:18,799
Another present?

683
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:21,679
(Not again.)

684
00:32:24,598 --> 00:32:25,838
Where's the present?

685
00:32:26,718 --> 00:32:28,279
Why do I sense that the present

686
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,799
will scare me out?

687
00:32:29,879 --> 00:32:30,679
Not at all.

688
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:03,039
Did you move the entire stage

689
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,238
from Shen's Residence?

690
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:06,958
Look at those things.

691
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:08,879
They are exactly the same as the ones
in my house.

692
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:10,999
You have moved my house here.

693
00:33:12,078 --> 00:33:13,639
How many tea leaves
did my father take from you?

694
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:14,919
No, he didn't.

695
00:33:15,718 --> 00:33:17,799
I just rebuild the exact copy
of the original furniture.

696
00:33:18,198 --> 00:33:20,118
I took no single cent
from Father-in-law.

697
00:33:20,879 --> 00:33:21,679
Wife.

698
00:33:22,718 --> 00:33:23,478
Please.

699
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:42,639
Isn't that my favourite...

700
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:43,639
It's your favourite
martial art performer.

701
00:33:44,118 --> 00:33:45,078
How do you know?

702
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:45,999
Wife.

703
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,159
I know you very well

704
00:33:48,718 --> 00:33:49,879
more than you could imagine.

705
00:33:51,318 --> 00:33:52,879
Regardless of the handsome
martial arts performer

706
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:55,039
or recruiting new servants,

707
00:33:55,879 --> 00:33:57,078
I don't mind them all.

708
00:33:58,639 --> 00:33:59,478
Wife.

709
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:02,039
Do you know what I yearn for?

710
00:34:04,118 --> 00:34:05,159
What?

711
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:07,879
Needless to say,

712
00:34:08,718 --> 00:34:09,559
I yearn for

713
00:34:10,319 --> 00:34:12,678
spending my whole life with you.

714
00:34:14,999 --> 00:34:15,678
But...

715
00:34:17,198 --> 00:34:18,638
But you...

716
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:25,359
What are you doing?

717
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:27,638
Don't you do anything crazy.

718
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,119
Don't you...

719
00:34:31,638 --> 00:34:32,519
I never thought of that before.

720
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:34,799
I just want you to know

721
00:34:35,438 --> 00:34:37,238
that this place is your home.

722
00:34:38,198 --> 00:34:41,198
And you can render me your full trust.

723
00:34:49,678 --> 00:34:50,718
Don't you do anything crazy.

724
00:34:50,718 --> 00:34:52,319
I can't control myself.

725
00:35:01,238 --> 00:35:02,119
Do you still

726
00:35:04,238 --> 00:35:05,238
insist on getting a divorce?

727
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:09,039
I...

728
00:35:11,198 --> 00:35:11,958
I...

729
00:35:13,158 --> 00:35:13,958
Very good.

730
00:35:14,678 --> 00:35:16,198
I need to attend to my work now.

731
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:17,599
I shall leave.

732
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:19,438
Please enjoy.

733
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:34,359
The ebb and flow of life

734
00:35:35,198 --> 00:35:36,918
are just passing through too fast.

735
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:40,039
What the heck was happening?

736
00:35:41,438 --> 00:35:43,119
Why did he know I want a divorce?

737
00:35:53,878 --> 00:35:54,718
It smells so good.

738
00:35:59,918 --> 00:36:01,559
The food served in Pei's Residence

739
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,359
isn't inferior to what I had at home.

740
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:08,319
Wife.

741
00:36:08,638 --> 00:36:09,359
You're up?

742
00:36:11,438 --> 00:36:12,238
Husband.

743
00:36:16,718 --> 00:36:17,799
Regarding yesterday night,

744
00:36:18,398 --> 00:36:20,398
I would like to explain it to you.

745
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:21,559
No worries.

746
00:36:21,918 --> 00:36:23,119
I'm a man of my word.

747
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:25,198
You can act freely here.

748
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:27,079
I didn't mean that.

749
00:36:27,398 --> 00:36:28,198
Honestly, I want...

750
00:36:28,198 --> 00:36:29,119
In that case,

751
00:36:29,398 --> 00:36:30,678
say no more.

752
00:36:32,158 --> 00:36:32,918
Have a seat.

753
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:34,398
The dish is going to cool off.

754
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:01,398
Miss, don't get distracted.

755
00:37:06,918 --> 00:37:07,839
Have a taste.

756
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:23,638
How is the fish cooked?

757
00:37:23,638 --> 00:37:24,759
It's savoury.

758
00:37:25,238 --> 00:37:26,119
How is the dish cooked?

759
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:28,519
Who does the cook learn from?

760
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:30,398
It's the recipe of my family.

761
00:37:31,678 --> 00:37:32,559
Did you cook this?

762
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:36,678
I thought scholar thinks

763
00:37:36,878 --> 00:37:38,119
gentlemen should stay away kitchen.

764
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:41,279
I can not be a gentleman before you,

765
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:42,638
but your husband.

766
00:37:52,958 --> 00:37:53,559
By the way,

767
00:37:54,918 --> 00:37:56,799
speaking of which,

768
00:37:57,918 --> 00:37:59,039
it's weird

769
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:00,759
that I didn't see your parents

770
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:02,279
after we got married.

771
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:04,799
I heard that Pei's family devoted
as the officials in the Imperial Court.

772
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,678
Are your parents not satisfied with me?

773
00:38:09,158 --> 00:38:10,279
Mian, you're elegant, composed,

774
00:38:10,438 --> 00:38:11,638
and flawless.

775
00:38:13,438 --> 00:38:14,478
Even so,

776
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:16,398
if rumours that I don't serve up
your parents get out,

777
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:19,319
I will be a laughing stock.

778
00:38:19,438 --> 00:38:20,198
I've told you

779
00:38:20,478 --> 00:38:22,398
this is your home.

780
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,718
No need to mind those formalities
when you're at home.

781
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:28,999
Miao.

782
00:38:29,398 --> 00:38:30,279
I know

783
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:32,678
that we just got married a few days ago

784
00:38:33,398 --> 00:38:35,519
and we were complete strangers
before that.

785
00:38:36,878 --> 00:38:37,799
You left Shen's Residence

786
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:40,478
and came to an unfamiliar place.

787
00:38:40,878 --> 00:38:41,918
Naturally, you can't adapt
to this place.

788
00:38:42,718 --> 00:38:43,799
Even if I said so,

789
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:45,559
I suppose you wouldn't believe me too.

790
00:38:46,238 --> 00:38:47,958
However, I want you to know

791
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:51,958
that you're at liberty
to do anything you want.

792
00:38:52,438 --> 00:38:54,039
We need no explanation between us.

793
00:39:00,678 --> 00:39:01,478
I'm sorry.

794
00:39:02,158 --> 00:39:02,958
What for?

795
00:39:08,478 --> 00:39:08,918
I...

796
00:39:09,238 --> 00:39:10,599
Let me be honest with you.

797
00:39:11,478 --> 00:39:12,599
It wasn't my intention

798
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,039
to marry you.

799
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:15,279
It's in the past now.

800
00:39:15,799 --> 00:39:17,759
The day in the past is gone by the wind.

801
00:39:18,799 --> 00:39:19,478
Besides,

802
00:39:20,478 --> 00:39:22,398
we're a real married couple

803
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:24,198
and we acted like one too.

804
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,319
I'm sure we will love each other
till death do us part.

805
00:39:57,878 --> 00:39:58,718
My sincerity for you

806
00:39:59,039 --> 00:39:59,958
is genuine.

807
00:40:00,638 --> 00:40:01,559
The promise made before our marriage

808
00:40:01,878 --> 00:40:02,918
will not be broken.

809
00:40:27,918 --> 00:40:28,799
Miss.

810
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,359
Time to return to Shen's Residence.

811
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:31,638
What's with that look?

812
00:40:31,718 --> 00:40:33,559
You will make Mrs. Shen
and Old Master worry.

813
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:36,039
Lvying.

814
00:40:37,279 --> 00:40:38,799
Am I wrong?

815
00:40:39,958 --> 00:40:40,759
Look at

816
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,158
these fishes.

817
00:40:42,799 --> 00:40:44,319
I come by and feed them every day.

818
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:46,519
And they might think
I will stay here for good.

819
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:48,039
If I don't come by

820
00:40:48,398 --> 00:40:49,519
to feed them one day,

821
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:51,438
they will starve

822
00:40:51,638 --> 00:40:52,438
and freeze.

823
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:53,638
Later,

824
00:40:53,878 --> 00:40:56,238
the fins become dull

825
00:40:57,438 --> 00:40:58,238
and finally

826
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:00,559
become a gloomy fish

827
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:03,119
ending up eaten by someone.

828
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:08,799
Miss.

829
00:41:08,918 --> 00:41:10,478
No one is going to pass by here.

830
00:41:10,478 --> 00:41:11,759
Why bother to put up a show?

831
00:41:14,398 --> 00:41:15,958
I'm speaking my heart.

832
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:18,678
No.

833
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:21,119
Normally, all you think is about
fish dishes.

834
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:23,678
Why are you so emotional today?

835
00:41:24,759 --> 00:41:25,759
Do you feel unwell?

836
00:41:27,158 --> 00:41:28,238
Don't make a fuss.

837
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,359
It's because of Pei Yanzhen.

838
00:41:34,279 --> 00:41:35,198
If the opera stage a few days ago
