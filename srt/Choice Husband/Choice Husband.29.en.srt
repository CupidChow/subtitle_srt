What?

22
00:02:02,412 --> 00:02:03,132
I'm saying that

23
00:02:04,253 --> 00:02:05,973
since Xiao is our kid,

24
00:02:06,813 --> 00:02:08,253
if we want him to grow up well,

25

we as his parents

you finally forgave me.

00:02:58,012 --> 00:02:59,693
I never hated you.

Really?

Yes.

00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:09,613
Why would I lie to you?

42
00:03:30,572 --> 00:03:31,732
Since you said you want
to bond with me,

43
00:03:32,693 --> 00:03:34,012
we should stay together,

44

if it's for Miaomiao,

50

such an ordinary good won't be
acceptable.

Calm down, Official Song.

There are

several pieces of jade bracelets
in our store.

I was worried
you won't come and get them.

His Highness is very nice to his wife.

67

He just got back here.

68
00:05:11,052 --> 00:05:12,332
And he's prepared
headdresses and clothes for her.

69
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:13,652
This is nothing.

70
00:05:13,652 --> 00:05:15,092
You didn't see what happened
in the first two years.

He did more than...

72

Now, I only hope

73
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:23,372
that His Highness could make up
with his wife

74

and stop making trouble.

75

was he

88
00:05:43,453 --> 00:05:44,693
talking about Miss Shen?

89
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:04,092
Sorry, I'll leave.

help me.

92

You've walked

93

around the residence these days.

94

What do you think about it?

95
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,092
It has winding roads

96

with picturesque views.

97
00:06:42,892 --> 00:06:43,813
The building is stunningly beautiful

and it's built
with exquisite workmanship.

It's nice.

100

Two years ago,

101
00:06:56,492 --> 00:06:57,133
I once thought

102
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:58,693
this would be the place
where we held our wedding.

103

Miao,

104
00:07:11,652 --> 00:07:12,733
do you have a question for me?

105
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:18,892
Why do you ask that?

106
00:07:20,013 --> 00:07:21,212
Since we're going to start over again,

107
00:07:22,453 --> 00:07:23,693
we shouldn't keep secrets
from each other.

I harbor no ill intention against you.

Will you trust me?

111
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,253
What's gotten into you?

112
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,612
You're acting paranoid.

113
00:07:44,492 --> 00:07:45,652
Did I

114
00:07:46,492 --> 00:07:47,892
do something wrong?

115
00:07:51,853 --> 00:07:52,733
Let me hug you.

116
00:07:54,372 --> 00:07:55,133
A minute will do.

About my vision restoration,

118
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:08,932
I didn't mean to conceal it
from you.

119
00:08:10,372 --> 00:08:10,853
Rationally,

120
00:08:11,772 --> 00:08:14,533
I was afraid the ill-intentioned people
would block the wheels.

121
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:16,013
Emotionally,

122
00:08:18,453 --> 00:08:19,693
I was afraid
you'd abandon me again

123
00:08:21,372 --> 00:08:22,693
after finding out the truth.

124
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:30,652
Miao,

125
00:08:31,893 --> 00:08:33,612
I've repented of everything
I've done in the past.

126
00:08:34,653 --> 00:08:35,932
And I wish for nothing now.

127
00:08:38,213 --> 00:08:39,052
I can give you

128
00:08:40,172 --> 00:08:41,773
whatever you want. Will it do?

129
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,333
The water is getting cold.

130
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:53,292
I'll go get some warm water over.

131
00:08:55,172 --> 00:08:55,693
Miao,

132
00:08:57,693 --> 00:08:58,893
when everything is over,

133
00:09:02,573 --> 00:09:03,453
let's have a fresh start.

134
00:09:05,372 --> 00:09:06,932
You, me,

135
00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:08,013
and Xiao.

136
00:09:09,093 --> 00:09:10,253
We'll leave the capital

137
00:09:13,612 --> 00:09:14,612
and return to Lingzhou, okay?

138
00:09:18,972 --> 00:09:20,333
(What matters now is)

Miao.

Don't be afraid.

It's just a dream.

Miaomiao,

have you found

00:11:09,773 --> 00:11:11,453
any clues these days?

152

If no clue is found,

153
00:11:15,052 --> 00:11:16,292
go back with me now.

154
00:11:17,932 --> 00:11:18,773
I'll go back

155
00:11:18,773 --> 00:11:20,013
when I find Zai.

156
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:21,292
Don't worry.

157
00:11:21,573 --> 00:11:22,773
You're sleeping
in the same room with him.

158
00:11:22,773 --> 00:11:24,052
How can I not worry?

00:11:24,653 --> 00:11:25,253
Third Master Song,

160
00:11:25,732 --> 00:11:26,492
you're out of line.

161
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:32,773
I'm sorry.

162
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:36,133
Miaomiao,

163
00:11:36,653 --> 00:11:37,612
I'm here to help you.

164
00:11:38,213 --> 00:11:40,213
It's no use staying here.

165
00:11:40,412 --> 00:11:41,813
Because Shen Zai is not here.

166
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:43,852
How do you know that?

167
00:11:45,492 --> 00:11:45,932
I suppose.

168
00:11:47,172 --> 00:11:48,292
Anyway, I've made up my mind.

00:11:50,412 --> 00:11:51,612
to bring Pei Yanzhen down.

171
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,292
What are you talking about?

172
00:11:53,492 --> 00:11:54,253
It's not gibberish.

173
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:55,653
I've thought about it for a long time.

174
00:11:56,253 --> 00:11:57,773
You've stayed here for so long.

175
00:11:58,013 --> 00:11:59,972
Pei Yanzhen won't let you off so easily.

176
00:12:00,372 --> 00:12:02,773
The only way is to distract Zhan Yue
and ask to meet Pei Yanzhen

177
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:03,932
outside the city.

178
00:12:04,372 --> 00:12:04,732
By then,

179
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:06,333
the assassins and I will ambush there

180
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,372
and threaten him with his life.

181
00:12:08,573 --> 00:12:10,172
I'm sure we'll find
Shen Zai in this way.

182
00:12:10,372 --> 00:12:10,893
No.

183
00:12:11,372 --> 00:12:11,972
Why?

184
00:12:14,013 --> 00:12:15,412
Do you feel sorry for him?

185
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:17,893
I don't.

186
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:21,612
Miaomiao,

187
00:12:22,612 --> 00:12:24,453
Pei Yanzhen has lied to you many times.

188
00:12:24,852 --> 00:12:26,253
So what if you deceive him once?

189
00:12:26,893 --> 00:12:27,932
Are you going to wait

190
00:12:27,932 --> 00:12:30,693
until the moment
when the Shen family breaks apart

191
00:12:30,813 --> 00:12:31,852
and gets annihilated

192
00:12:32,172 --> 00:12:33,013
because of you?

193
00:12:37,893 --> 00:12:38,653
Tomorrow noon,

194
00:12:38,852 --> 00:12:40,253
I'll wait for you at Yongquan Temple
outside of the city.

195
00:12:40,612 --> 00:12:42,133
We must get Pei Yanzhen trapped first.

196
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:42,932
Then, we'll discuss about it.

197
00:12:44,612 --> 00:12:45,972
This is a make-or-break time.

198
00:12:46,653 --> 00:12:47,292
I'll wait for you.

199
00:12:51,213 --> 00:12:51,893
Who's there?

200
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,213
It's you, Your Highness.

201
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:57,492
I'm sorry to offend you.

202
00:12:58,093 --> 00:12:58,773
It's late at night.

203
00:12:59,172 --> 00:13:00,333
You should go back.

204
00:13:29,052 --> 00:13:30,932
(It's no use staying here.)

205
00:13:31,172 --> 00:13:32,573
(Because Shen Zai is not here.)

206
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:42,333
(Anyway, I've made up my mind.)

207
00:13:42,773 --> 00:13:44,052
(The only way to find Shen Zai is)

208
00:13:44,492 --> 00:13:45,693
(to bring Pei Yanzhen down.)

209
00:13:52,172 --> 00:13:52,653
Pei Yanzhen,

210
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:53,693
what are you doing?

211
00:13:54,213 --> 00:13:54,813
Pei Yanzhen!

212
00:13:55,732 --> 00:13:56,492
Stop!

213
00:13:56,732 --> 00:13:57,412
Stop!

214
00:13:57,693 --> 00:13:59,093
Are you out of your mind? Stop!

215
00:13:59,612 --> 00:14:00,612
Don't make me hate you.

216
00:14:05,813 --> 00:14:06,532
Sorry.

217
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:10,052
I thought your return was

218
00:14:11,412 --> 00:14:12,333
a dream again.

219
00:14:17,693 --> 00:14:18,732
I can't sleep

220
00:14:19,972 --> 00:14:21,093
so I went out for a walk.

221
00:14:22,013 --> 00:14:22,532
Miao,

222
00:14:26,013 --> 00:14:26,932
don't ever leave me again.

223
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:27,453
Okay?

224
00:14:29,732 --> 00:14:30,852
You just returned.

225
00:14:32,732 --> 00:14:33,532
I don't want to,

226
00:14:35,492 --> 00:14:37,253
and I can't lose you again.

227
00:15:10,893 --> 00:15:11,492
Okay.

228
00:15:14,532 --> 00:15:16,093
Don't do this again.

229
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,050
(Regent's Residence)

230
00:16:32,573 --> 00:16:33,292
Miao,

231
00:16:34,013 --> 00:16:34,492
didn't you say

232
00:16:34,492 --> 00:16:36,333
you would bring Zai back safely

233
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,412
and give him back to me?

234
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:41,653
Miao, why did you believe in him?

235
00:16:41,653 --> 00:16:44,213
Run now!

236
00:16:45,052 --> 00:16:45,932
Sister,

237
00:16:46,492 --> 00:16:47,453
help me!

238
00:16:47,893 --> 00:16:49,133
Help me!

239
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:49,732
Miao.

240
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:50,372
Sister.

241
00:16:50,372 --> 00:16:51,052
Run!

242
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,532
- Help me!
- Run!

243
00:16:52,693 --> 00:16:54,052
- Help me!
- My Zai!

244
00:17:32,532 --> 00:17:33,333
Greetings to Your Highness.

245
00:17:34,493 --> 00:17:35,493
What are these?

246
00:17:36,132 --> 00:17:36,973
Your Highness,

247
00:17:37,373 --> 00:17:38,132
these headdresses are

248
00:17:38,132 --> 00:17:40,252
made by the skillful craftsmen
in the capital.

249
00:17:40,573 --> 00:17:42,892
This is a surprise for you
from His Highness.

250
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:44,693
Please pick some

251
00:17:44,693 --> 00:17:45,693
and put them on.

252
00:17:45,693 --> 00:17:46,693
I'm sure His Highness will be

253
00:17:46,693 --> 00:17:47,693
excited to see it.

254
00:17:49,493 --> 00:17:50,012
Get out.

255
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:50,892
Your Highness.

256
00:17:51,052 --> 00:17:51,932
All of you, get out!

257
00:17:52,292 --> 00:17:52,892
Yes.

258
00:18:13,172 --> 00:18:13,772
You're here.

259
00:18:14,853 --> 00:18:16,132
Try the fish congee I made.

260
00:18:17,093 --> 00:18:18,132
See if it suits your taste.

261
00:18:25,132 --> 00:18:25,652
Take a seat.

262
00:18:37,573 --> 00:18:38,333
You may leave.

263
00:18:38,813 --> 00:18:39,573
- Yes.
- Yes.

264
00:18:46,973 --> 00:18:47,532
Miao,

265
00:18:48,613 --> 00:18:50,213
I was too impulsive last night.

266
00:18:50,693 --> 00:18:51,333
I promise

267
00:18:51,973 --> 00:18:53,213
I won't do it again.

268
00:18:57,132 --> 00:18:57,693
Never mind.

269
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:02,573
Do you have any business to do today?

270
00:19:05,892 --> 00:19:06,453
No.

271
00:19:07,453 --> 00:19:08,373
I've looked into it.

272
00:19:09,892 --> 00:19:11,213
It's a good day today.

273
00:19:12,973 --> 00:19:14,772
Go to Yongquan Temple with me.

274
00:19:19,613 --> 00:19:20,932
When we were in Weiyang,

275
00:19:20,932 --> 00:19:22,213
you made a wish before Buddha.

276
00:19:23,213 --> 00:19:24,813
You wished

277
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,853
you could mend fences with me

278
00:19:27,453 --> 00:19:28,892
and our family could reunite again.

279
00:19:30,172 --> 00:19:31,613
Now your wish has come true.

280
00:19:32,453 --> 00:19:33,772
We have to bath and burn incense

281
00:19:34,652 --> 00:19:35,772
to redeem a vow to Buddha.

282
00:19:37,613 --> 00:19:39,772
It's not gibberish.
I've thought about it for so long.

283
00:19:40,453 --> 00:19:42,093
You've stayed here for so long.

284
00:19:42,373 --> 00:19:44,172
Pei Yanzhen won't let you off so easily.

285
00:19:44,652 --> 00:19:47,012
The only way is to distract Zhan Yue
and ask to meet Pei Yanzhen

286
00:19:47,172 --> 00:19:48,132
outside the city.

287
00:19:48,573 --> 00:19:48,932
By then,

288
00:19:49,412 --> 00:19:50,652
the assassins and I will lurk there

289
00:19:50,932 --> 00:19:52,573
and threaten him with his life.

290
00:19:52,772 --> 00:19:54,493
I'm sure we'll find
Shen Zai in this way.

291
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,213
No.

292
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,213
Are you going to wait

293
00:19:56,213 --> 00:19:57,412
until the moment

294
00:19:57,412 --> 00:19:58,292
when the Shen family

295
00:19:58,292 --> 00:19:59,453
breaks apart and gets annihilated

296
00:19:59,453 --> 00:20:00,292
because of you?

297
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:06,932
Are you...

298
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:07,693
Sure.

299
00:20:10,132 --> 00:20:11,213
You say yes just like this?

300
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,132
I agreed

301
00:20:18,693 --> 00:20:20,052
to redeem a vow to Buddha.

302
00:20:23,172 --> 00:20:24,453
It's so lucky of me to be able

303
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:26,172
to hear you laugh again,

304
00:20:27,132 --> 00:20:27,813
to smell your scent,

305
00:20:29,132 --> 00:20:31,813
and to have you back healthily now.

306
00:20:33,613 --> 00:20:34,853
I must've been blessed by Buddha.

307
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:36,573
How would I dare

308
00:20:38,093 --> 00:20:38,973
to ask for more?

309
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:43,613
And I heard that we must be sincere

310
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,532
while redeeming a vow to Buddha.

311
00:20:46,373 --> 00:20:47,693
No weapon is allowed.

312
00:20:48,532 --> 00:20:51,093
Otherwise, it's disrespectful

313
00:20:51,093 --> 00:20:52,532
to Buddha and the immortal.

314
00:20:54,172 --> 00:20:56,213
I feel guilty for not being able
to go to Baima Temple.

315
00:20:57,693 --> 00:20:58,853
Why don't

316
00:20:58,973 --> 00:21:00,813
we go together today,
just the two of us?

317
00:21:01,532 --> 00:21:02,813
Let's not bring
Zhan Yue and others along.

318
00:21:04,213 --> 00:21:04,813
So,

319
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:08,052
it could show our sincerity.

320
00:21:14,813 --> 00:21:15,333
Sure.

321
00:21:16,853 --> 00:21:17,532
As you wish.

322
00:21:22,652 --> 00:21:23,453
Drink it while it's hot.

323
00:21:26,613 --> 00:21:27,453
Aren't you worried

324
00:21:29,453 --> 00:21:30,652
there'd be any accidents?

325
00:21:40,613 --> 00:21:41,693
Everything has both

326
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:44,532
good and bad sides.

327
00:21:45,853 --> 00:21:47,172
As long as I can be with you,

328
00:21:49,573 --> 00:21:50,213
the bad things

329
00:21:51,932 --> 00:21:53,093
won't be necessarily bad.

330
00:21:55,052 --> 00:21:55,932
I'm not competent.

331
00:21:56,693 --> 00:21:57,613
I don't have any skills.

332
00:21:58,573 --> 00:21:59,693
All I have is the entire country.

333
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:02,093
If I could have the honor

334
00:22:03,172 --> 00:22:04,172
to gain your love,

335
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:09,373
I'll let go of everything

336
00:22:10,733 --> 00:22:12,012
and give you the country as the dowry.

337
00:22:23,453 --> 00:22:24,932
Give me the country as the dowry?
