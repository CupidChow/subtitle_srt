How's the baby doing?

00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:52,396
Don't worry. Both the mother
and the baby are safe.

But they're still weak.

They need to take a good rest.

Can I talk to you in private?

Is it true

36
00:02:35,075 --> 00:02:35,995
that Miao is doing all right?

37
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:37,635
Thanks to the medication you gave her,

00:02:38,155 --> 00:02:40,155
she managed to cheat death.

after going through
this difficult labor,

41
00:02:44,396 --> 00:02:47,756
Miao shouldn't get pregnant again
in the coming five years.

42
00:02:51,196 --> 00:02:53,316
Miao's getting poisoned
is a major issue.

43
00:02:54,995 --> 00:02:56,635
Let's not tell anyone else
about this yet.

44
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:57,715
We don't want to alert our enemy.

45
00:02:57,956 --> 00:02:59,715
That's exactly what I thought.

46
00:03:00,036 --> 00:03:01,355
Miao has always been impulsive.

47
00:03:01,635 --> 00:03:04,075
We should never let her
find out what happened.

48
00:03:05,316 --> 00:03:07,036
Official Pei, you might appear
to be a good guy now.

But at the end of the day,

50
00:03:08,435 --> 00:03:09,396
you're the reason

51
00:03:09,396 --> 00:03:11,235
His Majesty and Her Highness were here.

52
00:03:11,995 --> 00:03:13,435
If you're really worried

53
00:03:13,676 --> 00:03:14,956
about Miaomiao and the baby,

54
00:03:15,276 --> 00:03:16,276
why would you have acted so servilely

55
00:03:16,276 --> 00:03:17,715
in front of everyone?

56
00:03:18,155 --> 00:03:18,875
I will protect

57
00:03:19,836 --> 00:03:21,196
my own child.

58
00:03:22,956 --> 00:03:24,075
Master Song, you must be kidding me.

59
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:25,995
The baby might not be
one of the Pei family,

60
00:03:26,676 --> 00:03:27,836
but we know for sure
the baby is not part of Song family.

Pei Yanzhen.

62
00:03:35,836 --> 00:03:36,435
Pei Yanzhen.

63
00:03:37,196 --> 00:03:38,875
Do you dare repeat what you said
in front of Miaomiao?

64
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,280
(None of the flowers worth my glance,
partly due to ascetic practice, partly because of you.)

65
00:03:59,435 --> 00:04:00,355
It was my fault.

66
00:04:01,795 --> 00:04:03,875
I did this to Miao and our child.

67
00:04:05,595 --> 00:04:07,515
Yes. Not only did you
put them in danger,

68
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:08,355
but you also dragged me into this.

69
00:04:08,956 --> 00:04:09,595
If it wasn't for you,

70
00:04:10,235 --> 00:04:11,276
why would the Princess...

71
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:13,355
Forget it.

72
00:04:14,155 --> 00:04:15,875
But why are you so sure

73
00:04:16,396 --> 00:04:17,755
that you're the father
of Shen Miao's baby?

74
00:04:18,876 --> 00:04:20,436
(No one knows
how long Miao has been pregnant.)

75
00:04:20,996 --> 00:04:22,035
(There is a heated argument going on.)

76
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:24,276
It's not something that can be solved
with a diagnosis.

77
00:04:25,315 --> 00:04:28,035
Can you please lie and tell everyone
that she's three-month pregnant?

78
00:04:28,475 --> 00:04:29,396
You might have to
go into hiding temporarily.

79
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:34,075
Thanks for the help, Official Pei.

80
00:04:35,635 --> 00:04:36,515
You will be a father

81
00:04:36,755 --> 00:04:39,276
in the coming summer.

82
00:04:43,035 --> 00:04:44,116
Why did you keep it until now?

83
00:04:44,676 --> 00:04:45,355
The lesser people know about this,

84
00:04:45,755 --> 00:04:47,635
the better it is.

85
00:04:48,515 --> 00:04:49,956
Then, why are you telling me this now?

86
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:53,635
Zhan Yue.

87
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:54,750

partly due to ascetic practice, partly because of you.)

If one day,

89
00:04:56,676 --> 00:04:57,876
I'm forced to leave Shen Miao
and her baby behind,

90
00:04:59,035 --> 00:04:59,755
can you look after them

91
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:01,556
on my behalf?

92
00:05:04,635 --> 00:05:06,355
Shen Miao and the baby
are both in Lingzhou.

93
00:05:06,956 --> 00:05:08,235
I don't think you'll ever leave them.

To watch us playing chess?

97
00:05:20,996 --> 00:05:23,116
Pei Yanzhen was clearly
trying to trick Jiu

98
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:24,635
as he stole the antidote.

99
00:05:29,035 --> 00:05:30,876
Pei Yanzhen and the Shen family.

100

Do you think

101
00:05:32,235 --> 00:05:33,996
that's all I can do?

102
00:05:37,315 --> 00:05:39,235
Bring Song Xiyuan here.

103
00:05:39,716 --> 00:05:40,235
Yes.

(Ninth Princess's Residence)

Get up.

106
00:05:54,596 --> 00:05:56,556
Since you've been
so considerate,

107
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,475
I'll of course reward you
with what you deserve.

108
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:04,355
I heard Shen Miao gave birth to a baby
for the Song family last night.

109
00:06:04,915 --> 00:06:08,035
Yet, Pei Yanzhen
continued standing in your way.

110
00:06:12,355 --> 00:06:14,915
I want to help you

111
00:06:14,915 --> 00:06:17,116
to bring the baby into your family.

112
00:06:17,355 --> 00:06:19,355
What do you think?

113
00:06:21,676 --> 00:06:24,116
Official Pei is backed by His Majesty.

114
00:06:24,556 --> 00:06:25,676
He's doing whatever he wants,

115
00:06:25,755 --> 00:06:29,116
and even trying to steal my wife
and my baby from me.

116
00:06:29,795 --> 00:06:31,355
If Your Highness can bring

117
00:06:31,355 --> 00:06:32,755
the baby back to my family,

118
00:06:33,515 --> 00:06:37,195
I will be forever indebted to you.

119
00:06:37,795 --> 00:06:40,876
I'll do everything to
repay Your Highness's kindness.

120
00:07:01,116 --> 00:07:01,996
Miaomiao, you're awake.

121
00:07:03,195 --> 00:07:04,515
Are you all right, Miaomiao?

122
00:07:05,436 --> 00:07:06,156
How are you feeling?

123
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:11,075
Be careful.

124
00:07:12,956 --> 00:07:13,475
Be careful.

125
00:07:16,195 --> 00:07:17,556
Cover yourself.

126
00:07:20,235 --> 00:07:20,956
Do you know

127
00:07:21,156 --> 00:07:22,396
that you were in a coma for two days?

128
00:07:22,716 --> 00:07:23,396
You must be thirsty, right?

129
00:07:24,996 --> 00:07:25,755
Have some soup.

130
00:07:26,396 --> 00:07:27,075
Aunt.

131
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,355
Where's my baby?

132
00:07:31,355 --> 00:07:32,075
Dear.

133
00:07:36,075 --> 00:07:37,876
Coming. You're awake.

134
00:07:40,156 --> 00:07:42,556
Come and take a look at your baby.

135
00:07:45,556 --> 00:07:46,156
Here.

136
00:07:48,596 --> 00:07:51,795
He has a small face,
a small pair of eyes, a small nose,

137
00:07:51,795 --> 00:07:52,515
and a small mouth.

138
00:07:52,755 --> 00:07:53,596
He looks

139
00:07:53,755 --> 00:07:55,515
like a little rice ball.

140
00:07:56,436 --> 00:07:57,315
He's only two-day-old.

141
00:07:57,996 --> 00:07:58,836
You're responsible for this.

142
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:01,195
You didn't watch your diet
when you were pregnant,

143
00:08:01,436 --> 00:08:02,596
and were always wandering around.

144
00:08:02,956 --> 00:08:03,676
You didn't take good care of yourself.

145
00:08:03,676 --> 00:08:04,396
That's why the baby came early.

146
00:08:05,315 --> 00:08:07,195
You should stay here
as you complete your confinement.

147
00:08:08,116 --> 00:08:10,795
Why do I feel like
it was the fish soup that made me sick?

148
00:08:11,956 --> 00:08:13,436
The fish soup is cooling

149
00:08:13,635 --> 00:08:14,676
and you've always been weak.

150
00:08:14,676 --> 00:08:16,475
That's why it made you sick.

151
00:08:29,436 --> 00:08:30,676
Has anyone visited

152
00:08:31,355 --> 00:08:32,476
when I was in labor?

153
00:08:33,115 --> 00:08:34,276
Both the Pei
and Song families were here.

154
00:08:34,276 --> 00:08:36,276
But I sent them away
before they managed to see you.

155
00:08:38,195 --> 00:08:40,515
Miao, did you see anyone?

156
00:08:41,476 --> 00:08:42,675
Did you manage to recall anything?

157
00:08:46,755 --> 00:08:48,716
I guess it was just a dream.

158
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,195
Since you're conscious now,

159
00:08:54,435 --> 00:08:56,236
I have something to tell you.

160
00:08:56,596 --> 00:08:57,356
I was just thinking

161
00:08:57,956 --> 00:09:00,036
about the baby's name.

162
00:09:00,396 --> 00:09:02,195
Look how fair and chubby this baby is.

163
00:09:02,195 --> 00:09:03,236
He looks just like
a glutinous rice ball.

164
00:09:03,796 --> 00:09:05,396
Shen Tangyuan.

165
00:09:06,115 --> 00:09:06,755
No, that's not a good name.

166
00:09:07,156 --> 00:09:09,476
Shen Tang? That doesn't sound good too.

167
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:13,755
Why don't we name him Shen Yuan?

168
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,236
Why don't we...

169
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:17,875
Shen...

170
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:18,476
No way!

171
00:09:19,995 --> 00:09:21,115
I haven't said anything yet.

172
00:09:21,115 --> 00:09:22,356
Why not?

173
00:09:22,356 --> 00:09:23,435
Keep your voice down.

174
00:09:23,836 --> 00:09:25,036
Why not?

175
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,956
Father, look.

176
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:30,956
The rice ball

177
00:09:31,515 --> 00:09:32,435
is also called Yuanxiao.

178
00:09:33,195 --> 00:09:33,875
Maybe...

179
00:09:35,115 --> 00:09:36,476
Maybe we can name him Shen Xiao.

180
00:09:39,956 --> 00:09:41,356
Shen Xiao?

181
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:42,956
Shen Xiao.

182
00:09:43,675 --> 00:09:44,315
Father, look.

183
00:09:44,396 --> 00:09:45,796
You gave him a good name.

184
00:09:47,075 --> 00:09:49,276
Our family has more men

185
00:09:49,476 --> 00:09:50,515
than women.

186
00:09:50,956 --> 00:09:52,755
Hence my name, Shen Miao,

187
00:09:53,075 --> 00:09:54,195
where Miao stands for fewer women.

188
00:09:54,796 --> 00:09:56,156
When you were giving birth to Shen Zai,

189
00:09:56,236 --> 00:09:57,396
Father was there by your side.

190
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:58,596
Hence his name is Shen Zai.

191
00:10:00,115 --> 00:10:00,596
Father.

192
00:10:01,315 --> 00:10:03,356
Your skill at giving names
is still as good

193
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:04,956

195
00:10:08,236 --> 00:10:08,675
Yes.

197
00:10:16,356 --> 00:10:17,236

Shen Miao.

Your Highness. It's you again.

What are you doing at my place?

You know what?

222
00:11:27,836 --> 00:11:29,555
You were bleeding profusely
during labor.

223
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:30,956
And I was kind enough

224
00:11:31,396 --> 00:11:32,675
to find you the hemostatic medication.

225
00:11:32,675 --> 00:11:33,675
Because of that,
I was grounded by Mother.

226
00:11:35,156 --> 00:11:36,916
I'm worried about you,

227
00:11:37,236 --> 00:11:38,356
so I sneaked out to check on you.

228
00:11:39,276 --> 00:11:41,435
How are you going to repay me?

229
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:43,476
You sent me the medication?

230
00:11:45,156 --> 00:11:46,716
The preterm labor
put you at death's door.

231
00:11:46,716 --> 00:11:49,075
It was me and Pei Yanzhen
who got you the medication.

232
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:50,956
Pei Yanzhen too?

233
00:11:59,476 --> 00:12:00,836
That's what happened.

234
00:12:01,276 --> 00:12:02,396
Pei Yanzhen indeed

235
00:12:02,716 --> 00:12:03,675
cares for you a lot.

236
00:12:10,836 --> 00:12:11,396
But

237
00:12:13,276 --> 00:12:14,036
I've spent a month

00:12:14,036 --> 00:12:15,236
at home.

239
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,356
Why hasn't he dropped by
to pay me a visit yet?

240
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:22,036
Come on. We were rivals.

241
00:12:22,755 --> 00:12:24,836
Do you really think
I'll analyze it for you?

242
00:12:26,115 --> 00:12:26,716
You're right.

243
00:12:49,075 --> 00:12:51,236
Do you think you can buy me off
with the food?

244
00:12:52,156 --> 00:12:54,236
I will never waste my time

being unhappy.

246
00:12:56,236 --> 00:12:59,036
I hereby announce that
I'm giving up on Pei Yanzhen.

247
00:13:01,555 --> 00:13:03,956
But if you want me
to give you my blessing,

248
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,156
you need to do me a favor.

249
00:13:07,716 --> 00:13:09,956
How well do you know
the guard who works for Pei Yanzhen?

250
00:13:11,476 --> 00:13:12,315
Are you talking about Zhan Yue?

251
00:13:13,435 --> 00:13:14,195
He...

252
00:13:14,315 --> 00:13:16,916
Although he's unpredictable
and secretive,

253
00:13:17,315 --> 00:13:18,515
he is a very kind and caring man.

254
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:20,875
He doesn't covet fame or wealth too.

255
00:13:21,356 --> 00:13:22,836
It's hard to come by
a good man like him.

256
00:13:23,555 --> 00:13:24,356
But...

257
00:13:24,796 --> 00:13:25,515
He's very different

258
00:13:25,635 --> 00:13:28,195
from the pervert who disturbed you
the other night.

259
00:13:30,356 --> 00:13:32,356
It's either he put on
a perfect disguise,

260
00:13:32,356 --> 00:13:34,115
or your eyes are just
not as sharp as mine.

261
00:13:34,995 --> 00:13:37,596
You're right.
Whoever dares upset Your Highness

262
00:13:37,596 --> 00:13:39,276
will be my sworn enemy.

263
00:13:43,195 --> 00:13:43,995
You know what?

264
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:44,675
This one...

265
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,675
Don't these tassels look good?

266
00:13:50,036 --> 00:13:50,755
Yes, they do.

267

268
00:14:00,956 --> 00:14:03,236
Stop there, Zhan Yue!

269
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:10,555
You...

270
00:14:16,036 --> 00:14:16,836
It's been a while.

271
00:14:18,195 --> 00:14:18,716
Yes.

272
00:14:21,596 --> 00:14:22,755
I've recovered.

273
00:14:26,276 --> 00:14:26,916
Do you know

274
00:14:27,115 --> 00:14:29,195
that my baby is fair and chubby?

275
00:14:29,195 --> 00:14:30,036
He's really cute.

276
00:14:30,276 --> 00:14:32,675
My dad even wanted
to name him Shen Yuan.

277
00:14:32,675 --> 00:14:33,675
Luckily I was witty enough.

278
00:14:33,675 --> 00:14:34,555
I named him Shen Xiao.

279
00:14:35,115 --> 00:14:36,195
Isn't that a good name?

280
00:14:38,195 --> 00:14:39,956
Do you know why I'm named Shen Miao?

281
00:14:40,396 --> 00:14:42,716
Because my family has
more male members

282
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:43,515
than female.

283
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:46,075
Miao means fewer women.

284
00:14:46,396 --> 00:14:47,476
- That's why...
- Miss Shen.

285

Sometimes, it was there,
and sometimes, it wasn't.

309

I'm sure she was two-month pregnant.

Madam's pulse was
vigorous and strong.

She looked healthy and well-fed.

She was definitely
four months into the pregnancy.

00:16:52,236 --> 00:16:53,236
It's too early to cry now.

328
00:16:53,716 --> 00:16:55,396
If you drain your tear now,

329
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,836
how are you going to cry later?

330
00:16:57,195 --> 00:16:57,635
You...

331
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:58,435
Stop fighting.

332
00:16:58,675 --> 00:17:01,156
His Majesty has arrived.

333
00:17:19,636 --> 00:17:20,195
Get up.

334
00:17:28,435 --> 00:17:29,636
A few months ago,

335
00:17:30,075 --> 00:17:31,795
all physicians in Lingzhou

336
00:17:32,275 --> 00:17:34,915
suffered from many accusations,

337
00:17:35,236 --> 00:17:36,836
trying to determine how old
Shen Miao's fetus was.

338
00:17:38,435 --> 00:17:39,996
The county magistrate
failed to address the issue fairly,

339
00:17:40,956 --> 00:17:42,956
and Magistrate Pei couldn't handle it
as there was a conflict of interest.

340
00:17:43,555 --> 00:17:44,116
The news

341
00:17:44,675 --> 00:17:47,275
reached me.

342
00:17:49,116 --> 00:17:49,836
I feel so sorry

343
00:17:50,075 --> 00:17:52,516
for these physicians.

344
00:17:53,596 --> 00:17:56,236
Besides, I know that Official Pei
and Song Xiyuan

345
00:17:56,236 --> 00:17:58,116
are important to our nation.

346
00:17:59,395 --> 00:18:01,035
In order to resolve this issue,

347
00:18:01,035 --> 00:18:02,236
His Majesty and I have decided

348
00:18:02,996 --> 00:18:05,996
to run a blood test
to identify the father of the baby.

349
00:18:08,876 --> 00:18:10,675
I am beyond grateful

350
00:18:10,915 --> 00:18:12,636
that Your Majesty is willing
to seek justice for me.

351
00:19:07,476 --> 00:19:08,756
A blood test?

352
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:11,236
What if they find out

353
00:19:11,675 --> 00:19:13,075
that the baby's father is Pei Yanzhen?

354
00:19:14,915 --> 00:19:16,915
Then, I can take the opportunity
to sentence him to death.

355
00:19:33,435 --> 00:19:35,195
Your Majesty. Your Highness.

356
00:19:35,636 --> 00:19:36,716
We have collected the blood sample.

357
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,435
Someone has to go first.

358
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,236
Pei Yanzhen.

359
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:48,876
I think

360
00:19:49,516 --> 00:19:51,155
we should start with you.

361
00:19:57,716 --> 00:19:59,996
I think the one who came later
should go first.

362
00:20:00,516 --> 00:20:01,996
Official Pei is never blessed
with good health.

363
00:20:02,675 --> 00:20:03,716
We shouldn't terrify him with this.

364
00:20:04,155 --> 00:20:07,116
I think Song Xiyuan should go first.

365
00:20:08,915 --> 00:20:09,356
Yes, Your Majesty.

366
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:11,516
Thanks for the concern,
Your Majesty and Your Highness.

367
00:20:11,756 --> 00:20:13,435
I will go first.

368
00:20:14,195 --> 00:20:14,756
What's the matter?

369
00:20:15,516 --> 00:20:17,956
Do I have no say in this matter?

370
00:20:18,756 --> 00:20:19,275
Imperial Physician.

371
00:21:07,155 --> 00:21:08,996
Your Majesty. Your Highness.

372
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,636
The blood mixed together.

373
00:21:11,836 --> 00:21:13,915
Official Pei is the father of the baby.

374
00:21:16,435 --> 00:21:17,075
That's great.

375
00:21:27,915 --> 00:21:30,756
Congratulations, Official Pei.

376
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,956
You're now a father.

377
00:21:35,435 --> 00:21:37,435
Thank you, Your Highness.

378
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:41,516
Fate brought your son to me.

379
00:21:42,756 --> 00:21:43,596
Why don't we...

380
00:21:43,596 --> 00:21:44,116
Wait a minute.

381
00:22:29,116 --> 00:22:30,836
Your Majesty. Your Highness.

382
00:22:31,195 --> 00:22:33,516
The baby's blood mixed with
Song Xiyuan's too.

383
00:22:39,516 --> 00:22:40,075
This...

384
00:22:45,836 --> 00:22:46,476
This is absurd.

385
00:22:47,275 --> 00:22:49,275
How can it blend with both of them?

386
00:22:50,516 --> 00:22:52,195
Is there something wrong
with the solution?

387
00:22:53,596 --> 00:22:55,356
Jingde, try it.

388
00:22:55,996 --> 00:22:56,516
Yes.

389
00:23:38,756 --> 00:23:39,836
Your Highness.

390
00:23:47,315 --> 00:23:48,395
Your Majesty. Your Highness.

391
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:50,915
I have been a businessman
for many years.

392
00:23:51,116 --> 00:23:53,356
And I have done many things
that let my family down.

393
00:23:53,915 --> 00:23:56,116
My late wife passed away at a young age

394
00:23:56,116 --> 00:23:57,395
and I'm just a weak man.

395
00:23:57,795 --> 00:23:59,915
Since destiny has brought us here,

396
00:24:00,236 --> 00:24:02,195
I hope that Your Majesty can allow Miao

397
00:24:02,516 --> 00:24:04,116
to continue living with the Shen family.

398
00:24:04,596 --> 00:24:07,075
I wish to make it up to her.

399
00:24:07,996 --> 00:24:10,675
All members of the Shen family
will do our best

400
00:24:11,315 --> 00:24:13,675
to serve the nation

401
00:24:13,915 --> 00:24:16,315
in order to repay the kindness
we received from Your Majesty.

402
00:24:20,956 --> 00:24:22,275
Just like what you said.

403
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:23,516
It's all destined.

404
00:24:24,356 --> 00:24:26,675
You have my permission.

405
00:24:27,195 --> 00:24:28,476
Thank you, Your Majesty.

406
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:53,035
This...

407
00:25:07,996 --> 00:25:08,675
It turns out

408
00:25:09,435 --> 00:25:10,716
they came well-prepared.

409
00:25:16,876 --> 00:25:17,476
Who's there?

410
00:25:33,275 --> 00:25:33,956
Pei Yanzhen.

411
00:25:35,195 --> 00:25:36,315
I was right. You knew martial arts.

412
00:25:37,116 --> 00:25:38,395
What else are you hiding from us?

413
00:25:39,195 --> 00:25:40,716
What was your agenda
when you approached Miaomiao?

414
00:25:41,075 --> 00:25:43,516
Third Master, I don't have time
to deal with you.

415
00:25:44,315 --> 00:25:45,636
Are you going to save Miao

416
00:25:46,116 --> 00:25:47,315
and the baby in her belly?

417
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:50,756
Of course, I am.

418
00:25:51,275 --> 00:25:52,435
But I can do it myself.

419
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:54,035
I don't need help from others.

420
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:55,116
You won't be able to do it alone.

421
00:25:56,075 --> 00:25:58,116
Of course, I can.
I...

422
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:02,315
Do you know why the royal family
tried to interfere with my marriage

423
00:26:02,836 --> 00:26:04,716
when I'm just a county magistrate?

424
00:26:05,075 --> 00:26:07,075
Do you know why the baby's presence

425
00:26:07,075 --> 00:26:08,195
puts our lives at stake?

426
00:26:08,795 --> 00:26:09,555
If we get to the bottom of it,

427
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:12,195
the Empress Dowager's target

428
00:26:13,555 --> 00:26:14,236
has always been me.

429
00:26:17,716 --> 00:26:20,075
I'm the Sixth Prince
the Empress Dowager has been after.

430
00:26:24,555 --> 00:26:25,435
That was when

431
00:26:25,636 --> 00:26:26,756
you formed an alliance, right?

432
00:26:28,356 --> 00:26:30,035
What happened during the blood test?

433
00:26:31,795 --> 00:26:32,956
If you are curious,

434
00:26:33,116 --> 00:26:34,356
deliver this letter to the palace.

435
00:26:35,195 --> 00:26:36,236
I'm not going there.

436
00:26:36,836 --> 00:26:38,716
There's an annoying narcissist there.

437
00:26:38,716 --> 00:26:39,596
You can go there by yourself.

438
00:26:43,675 --> 00:26:44,996
Fine. I'll go.

439
00:26:48,876 --> 00:26:49,516
What?

440
00:26:49,915 --> 00:26:51,075
The Empress Dowager wants
to run a blood test?

441
00:26:51,675 --> 00:26:52,876
Yes. Official Pei.

442
00:26:53,435 --> 00:26:55,476
You come from a noble background.

443
00:26:55,795 --> 00:26:57,075
If she finds out

444
00:26:57,075 --> 00:26:58,675
that you are the father,

445
00:26:58,915 --> 00:27:00,195
it will put

446
00:27:00,476 --> 00:27:03,476
Miaomiao and the baby's lives at stake.

447
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:04,716
What other ideas do you have?

448
00:27:06,516 --> 00:27:07,356
Now,

449
00:27:07,435 --> 00:27:10,395
we must figure something out.

450
00:27:15,116 --> 00:27:15,716
I got it.

451
00:27:16,315 --> 00:27:18,996
The Empress Dowager has
always wanted me to take her side.

452
00:27:19,275 --> 00:27:20,596
If you turn her down for the test

453
00:27:20,596 --> 00:27:23,756
and confirm that the baby
is a descendant of the Song family,

454
00:27:23,956 --> 00:27:25,435
you'll do both of us a favor.

455
00:27:25,675 --> 00:27:27,795
You can resolve
this tricky situation as well.

456
00:27:28,876 --> 00:27:31,435
I guess that's what
you've been longing for, right?

457
00:27:32,795 --> 00:27:34,155
How could you say that?

458
00:27:34,636 --> 00:27:36,315
I only do that
because we have no other options.

459
00:27:38,035 --> 00:27:39,795
Although we can't
use the blood test

460
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:41,636
to destroy your hope
once and for all.

461
00:27:41,956 --> 00:27:43,315
in hindsight,

462
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:45,636
I have no choice

463
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:46,956
but to take up the responsibility

464
00:27:47,435 --> 00:27:49,195
for Miaomiao's sake.

465
00:27:52,155 --> 00:27:54,275
Master Song,
you're a wealthy man indeed.

466
00:27:54,996 --> 00:27:56,516
This is such an elegant move.

467
00:27:57,356 --> 00:27:59,836
You're making it hard for me
to turn you down.

468
00:28:02,155 --> 00:28:02,795
Can I take that as a yes?

469
00:28:03,795 --> 00:28:04,435
In your dreams.

470
00:28:06,555 --> 00:28:07,716
What's the matter, Official Pei?

471
00:28:08,315 --> 00:28:09,155
Why are you in such a hurry?

472
00:28:10,236 --> 00:28:11,315
How did you make sure

473
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:12,915
that the blood blends together?

474
00:28:13,195 --> 00:28:14,356
When you add potassium alum
to the solution,

475
00:28:14,795 --> 00:28:16,236
all blood can blend together.

476
00:28:16,636 --> 00:28:17,876
But Jingde's blood...

477
00:28:18,756 --> 00:28:20,756
We applied the potassium alum
on our hands.

478
00:28:23,915 --> 00:28:24,956
I see.

479
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:29,075
If they find out that Xiao is my kid,

480
00:28:29,075 --> 00:28:29,996
it'll put his life at risk.

481
00:28:31,275 --> 00:28:32,435
If they determine
that the baby's father is Song Xiyuan,

482
00:28:32,876 --> 00:28:34,116
it'll disappoint my ancestors.

483
00:28:35,435 --> 00:28:36,675
It's better

484
00:28:37,596 --> 00:28:38,155
we keep beating around the bush.

485
00:28:41,836 --> 00:28:43,636
I pity those who have to deal

486
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:44,636
with a cunning man like you.

487
00:28:45,596 --> 00:28:46,756
But right now,

488
00:28:47,675 --> 00:28:48,315
I pity myself the most.

489
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:54,795
Lingzhou has been in turmoil.

490
00:28:55,075 --> 00:28:56,356
And the imperial examination

You said that it was for my own good,

502

but you ordered Jingde
to poison the food

other than the Song family

Why does the Empress Dowager
have so much interest in Xiao?

520
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:26,596
Is it really because she's a busybody?

521

I was feeling suspicious too.

522

We saw what happened to the Lu family.

523
00:30:34,435 --> 00:30:36,555
Hence, we should always
have a backup plan.

524
00:30:39,555 --> 00:30:40,675
I've got an idea.

00:37:40,435 --> 00:37:41,316
But...

656
00:37:42,395 --> 00:37:44,796
I visited Lingzhou three years ago.

657
00:37:45,316 --> 00:37:48,595
Why are women more aggressive now?

658
00:37:48,915 --> 00:37:51,595
It's all because of Shen Miao.

659
00:37:52,595 --> 00:37:53,435
(In the past three years,)

660
00:37:53,835 --> 00:37:56,276
(she worked hard on developing
the rouge and silk businesses.)

661
00:37:56,835 --> 00:37:57,835
(She opened workshops
to teach them skills,)

662
00:37:57,835 --> 00:38:00,756
(so they can use it to earn a living.)

663
00:38:01,435 --> 00:38:04,276
(She even offered
martial art classes for the ladies)

664
00:38:04,556 --> 00:38:06,835
(and taught them self-defense skills.)

665
00:38:07,716 --> 00:38:11,835
(She brainwashed all the ladies
and did harm to the whole city.)

666
00:38:18,956 --> 00:38:22,996
I'm glad I didn't marry Shen Miao.

667
00:38:30,956 --> 00:38:34,195
Why didn't you marry her?

668
00:38:36,635 --> 00:38:38,276
Thank God I didn't.

669
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:45,595
Lingzhou.

670
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:48,195
Goodbye.

671
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,600
(Shen's Residence)

672
00:39:02,595 --> 00:39:03,236
Zai!

673
00:39:07,395 --> 00:39:08,395
Why did you jump into the water

674
00:39:08,956 --> 00:39:10,236
all of a sudden?

675
00:39:11,435 --> 00:39:12,395
You are using
only your little thumb, huh?

676
00:39:12,675 --> 00:39:14,276
That's impressive.

677
00:39:14,395 --> 00:39:16,155
I can't even beat you
with both my hands.

678
00:39:16,956 --> 00:39:18,155
You're quite strong.

679
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:18,915
Put it down.

680
00:39:19,236 --> 00:39:20,276
Do you dare put it down?

681
00:39:21,036 --> 00:39:21,796
All right.

682
00:39:21,796 --> 00:39:23,076
This is war!

683
00:39:23,076 --> 00:39:23,796
Give me the book.

684
00:39:23,796 --> 00:39:25,956
And I'll buy you another candied fruit.

685
00:39:26,316 --> 00:39:28,635
Father, you're always fooling around.

686
00:39:28,635 --> 00:39:30,395
Are you really going to keep doing this?

687
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:32,796
We're learning how to wear a disguise
and how to swim,

688
00:39:32,796 --> 00:39:34,236
so that we can escape from danger.

689
00:39:34,435 --> 00:39:36,276
How is this fooling around?

690
00:39:37,276 --> 00:39:38,276
I got it.

691
00:39:38,635 --> 00:39:40,915
You are traumatized
by what happened to the Lu family.

692
00:39:42,435 --> 00:39:43,996
But you can't ignore Zai

693
00:39:43,996 --> 00:39:46,155
when he jumped into the water.

694
00:39:46,355 --> 00:39:48,316
You're also trying
to lure Xiao with candied fruit.

695
00:39:49,476 --> 00:39:50,276
Most importantly,

696
00:39:50,835 --> 00:39:52,635
you're not being professional enough.

697
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:55,875
I saw you there,

698
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:57,036
and decided not to go over.

699
00:39:57,036 --> 00:39:57,915
If you weren't there,

700
00:39:57,915 --> 00:39:59,556
I would definitely rush over.

701
00:40:00,476 --> 00:40:00,675
Dear.

702
00:40:00,675 --> 00:40:01,635
Don't you think

703
00:40:01,635 --> 00:40:03,036
your fear is groundless?

704
00:40:03,796 --> 00:40:05,556
Official Pei is currently
serving the royal court.

705
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:07,195
He has been promoted to be
the Minister of Revenue.

706
00:40:07,476 --> 00:40:08,115
With his support,

707
00:40:08,195 --> 00:40:09,316
the Shen family

708
00:40:09,316 --> 00:40:10,115
will not get annihilated, right?

709
00:40:11,915 --> 00:40:12,956
He has been gone for three years,

710
00:40:13,276 --> 00:40:14,835
and hasn't even sent us a letter.

711
00:40:15,236 --> 00:40:16,635
The Shen family will be finished

712
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:17,595
if we only depend on him.

713
00:40:19,756 --> 00:40:21,756
It's Xiao's birthday in a few days.

714
00:40:22,115 --> 00:40:24,915
I've asked my man
to send him an invitation.

715
00:40:24,915 --> 00:40:26,276
He won't turn down
the invitation, right?

716
00:40:26,756 --> 00:40:28,635
I don't care whether he shows up or not.

717
00:40:31,556 --> 00:40:32,956
Xiao is turning three years old.

718
00:40:33,435 --> 00:40:34,956
Yet, he's still so weak.

719
00:40:35,556 --> 00:40:36,996
I wonder who does he take after.

720
00:40:37,395 --> 00:40:39,076
And he's hiding
behind books all the time.

721
00:40:40,115 --> 00:40:40,956
Who do you think he takes after?

722
00:40:42,476 --> 00:40:44,076
All this while, Xiao always manages

723
00:40:44,076 --> 00:40:46,796
to resolve crisis with the help
of some kind-hearted men.

724
00:40:47,155 --> 00:40:48,956
It hasn't been easy for him
to grow up healthily.

725
00:40:49,756 --> 00:40:51,395
What's wrong

726
00:40:51,595 --> 00:40:52,236
if he takes after Official Pei?

727
00:40:52,236 --> 00:40:53,076
That can't happen!

728
00:40:54,756 --> 00:40:55,395
Xiao.

729
00:40:55,835 --> 00:40:58,556
Let's play in the mud
and climb the trees, all right?

730
00:40:59,675 --> 00:41:00,915
I don't want to do that.

731
00:41:00,915 --> 00:41:02,796
I am halfway through my book.

732
00:41:02,796 --> 00:41:04,835
I want to continue reading.

733
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:07,076
You want to keep reading, huh?

734
00:41:08,276 --> 00:41:08,996
Grandfather.

735
00:41:09,395 --> 00:41:11,796
Where did I stop just now?

736
00:41:13,036 --> 00:41:15,476
I have no idea where you stopped.

737
00:41:15,476 --> 00:41:16,036
How about this?

738
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:18,635
I'll make you a bookmark right away.

739
00:41:18,956 --> 00:41:20,835
The next time you're reading,

740
00:41:20,835 --> 00:41:23,316
you can just clip the bookmark in it
and you'll not forget where you pause.

741
00:41:23,316 --> 00:41:23,956
Father.

742
00:41:24,395 --> 00:41:25,595
When other kids are at his age,

743
00:41:25,595 --> 00:41:27,076
they're trying to demolish the house.

744
00:41:27,155 --> 00:41:28,516
Yet, he still looks so indifferent

745
00:41:28,516 --> 00:41:30,435
and spends all his time
memorizing the books.

746
00:41:31,395 --> 00:41:33,236
Lvying, where is
the martial art teacher I hired?

747
00:41:45,675 --> 00:41:46,355
In the past three years,
other than the Ministry of War,

748
00:41:47,155 --> 00:41:49,556
Ministry of Justice,
and the Ministry of Personnel,

749
00:41:50,195 --> 00:41:51,435
the other ministries
are all on our side.

750
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:53,756
We have full support from

751
00:41:54,195 --> 00:41:55,276
two out of the three
cabinet ministers too.

752
00:41:56,236 --> 00:41:57,276
You never disappoint me.

753
00:41:57,915 --> 00:41:58,516
In the past three years,

754
00:41:59,435 --> 00:42:00,875
we worked through the difficulties

755
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:02,316
to achieve what we have today.

756
00:42:02,675 --> 00:42:04,996
But the Empress Dowager has been
laying low for the past three years.

757
00:42:04,996 --> 00:42:05,796
I'm sure she has something in store.

758
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:08,355
We should not let our guard down.

759
00:42:09,675 --> 00:42:10,316
I got it.

760
00:42:10,915 --> 00:42:12,835
Because of me,
you upset many noble families.

761
00:42:13,395 --> 00:42:14,276
You can't return home,

762
00:42:14,435 --> 00:42:15,355
and can't see your own child.

763
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:16,675
I'm sorry you have to go through this.

764
00:42:23,195 --> 00:42:23,716
By the way,

765
00:42:25,355 --> 00:42:27,875
your guard is still based in Lingzhou,

766
00:42:27,996 --> 00:42:28,996
protecting Shen Miao and her son, right?

767
00:42:31,435 --> 00:42:33,076
Are you talking about Zhan Yue?

768
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:34,395
In recent years,

769
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:35,476
Jiu has been traveling

770
00:42:35,476 --> 00:42:37,435
between Lingzhou and the capital
very frequently.

771
00:42:37,996 --> 00:42:39,635
She's doing that
for your guard Zhan Yue.

772
00:42:40,276 --> 00:42:42,276
I know that she's a grown-up
and will get married soon.

773
00:42:42,835 --> 00:42:43,756
If she has set her mind to it,

774
00:42:44,236 --> 00:42:45,875
I'll tell Mother
to decree the marriage.

775
00:42:51,756 --> 00:42:52,316
Your Majesty.

776
00:42:53,635 --> 00:42:55,516
