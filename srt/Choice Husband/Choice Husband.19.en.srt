I wonder how to determine this matter.

20
00:01:41,145 --> 00:01:42,825
Here comes the imperial decree.

21
00:01:51,026 --> 00:01:52,105
From Heaven's blessings,

22
00:01:52,185 --> 00:01:53,266
behold the Emperor's message.

23
00:01:53,626 --> 00:01:55,705
Qin Zuze embezzled the military fee,

24
00:01:55,705 --> 00:01:57,825
tried to murder the Emperor
and revolted, he shall not be pardoned.

25
00:01:57,986 --> 00:01:59,306
He is executed to decapitation.

26
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,745
The Qin's bloodline is
punished by exile.

27
00:02:02,185 --> 00:02:05,626
Empress Dowager assisted
the evildoers out of jealousy.

28
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,785
She should have been exiled as well.

29
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:08,625
But His Majesty is filial.

30
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,226
For the sake of her poor health

31
00:02:10,386 --> 00:02:11,386
and her permanent illness,

32
00:02:11,705 --> 00:02:14,785
she'll stay at the mausoleum
of the late emperor and reflect herself.

33
00:02:15,106 --> 00:02:17,186
Pei Yanzhen deserves credit
for the mutiny.

34
00:02:17,306 --> 00:02:18,705
He's bestowed with the title
of Regent

35
00:02:19,065 --> 00:02:20,826
and ten thousand taels of gold.

36
00:02:20,826 --> 00:02:22,746
Song Xiyuan has contributed
to the political situation.

37
00:02:22,905 --> 00:02:24,026
He'll secede
from the merchant community,

38
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:25,985
and be bestowed with the position
of Minister of Revenue.

39
00:02:26,065 --> 00:02:28,265
He'll be in charge
of the market and city, the fishery,

40
00:02:28,265 --> 00:02:29,466
the salt and tea business, cash and tax.

will be at Regent's command.

47
00:02:50,065 --> 00:02:52,145
Congratulations, Regent.

48
00:02:57,226 --> 00:02:59,425
Miaomiao's crisis has
finally been resolved.

49
00:02:59,866 --> 00:03:00,586
Now,

50
00:03:01,026 --> 00:03:04,306
it's time for me and you to settle up.

(Shen's Residence)

52
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,545
Since last night,

53
00:03:10,705 --> 00:03:12,505
we've arrested over 100 members
of the Qin family.

54
00:03:12,785 --> 00:03:13,666
According to them,

55
00:03:13,905 --> 00:03:16,026
Qin Miuzhen and 100 guards are
still on the run.

56
00:03:16,386 --> 00:03:17,265
And a team has

57
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:18,386
abducted Old Master and Old Madam Pei.

58
00:03:18,785 --> 00:03:19,946
They might've come to the capital.

59
00:03:23,106 --> 00:03:24,505
Qin Miuzhen is very cunning.

60
00:03:25,386 --> 00:03:27,065
Last night, she deliberately made me
fight at Shen's Residence.

61
00:03:27,345 --> 00:03:29,226
Yet, she secretly deployed
the main army force to Pei's Residence.

62
00:03:30,386 --> 00:03:31,985
How am I supposed
to explain this to Pei Yanzhen?

63
00:03:33,145 --> 00:03:34,065
He just took over the reins of power.

64
00:03:35,306 --> 00:03:37,505
Qin Miuzhen is not the only one
who's with evil intentions.

65
00:03:38,905 --> 00:03:39,625
Be more careful.

66
00:03:39,946 --> 00:03:41,145
Don't give them an opening.

67
00:03:41,345 --> 00:03:41,785
Noted.

68
00:03:43,545 --> 00:03:44,186
Young Master!

69
00:03:44,826 --> 00:03:46,625
Someone, Young Master fell in the water.

70
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,065
Is there anyone?

71
00:03:54,425 --> 00:03:55,226
Zai was perfectly fine.

72
00:03:55,226 --> 00:03:56,306
Why would he fall into the water?

73
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:57,186
He can't swim.

74
00:03:57,186 --> 00:03:58,306
Why didn't you stop him?

75
00:03:58,466 --> 00:03:59,985
Young Master got bored
staying at the residence.

76
00:04:00,505 --> 00:04:01,586
He saw the lotus blooming.

77
00:04:01,705 --> 00:04:03,705
So he tried to pick a few for Madam.

78
00:04:04,265 --> 00:04:05,826
Maybe it's because
of the slippery duckweed.

79
00:04:06,026 --> 00:04:06,985
That's how he fell.

80
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:08,625
Go get a physician over.

81
00:04:08,946 --> 00:04:09,345
Yes.

82
00:04:13,705 --> 00:04:14,306
Guard Zhan,

83
00:04:14,705 --> 00:04:15,906
now that Zai's life is in danger,

84
00:04:15,906 --> 00:04:16,906
what else do you want?

85
00:04:17,346 --> 00:04:18,145
Guard Zhan.

86
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:19,705
I'll go get a physician.

87
00:04:20,506 --> 00:04:21,306
You stay here.

He's

95
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:46,466
just having a fever.

96
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:47,186
Why would he cough up blood?

97
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,825
He has tuberculosis.

98
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:50,866
Tuberculosis

99
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:52,066
is contagious.

100
00:04:53,186 --> 00:04:54,906
He only fell in the water.
How could this happen?

101
00:04:55,145 --> 00:04:55,786
Check on him again.

102
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:57,586

Did you hear about it?

115
00:05:29,066 --> 00:05:30,265
Someone in the Shen family
has tuberculosis.

116
00:05:30,506 --> 00:05:31,466
He's terminally ill

and dying.

00:05:32,746 --> 00:05:33,506
Tuberculosis?

119
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,866
So the only thing
they can do is to prepare

120
00:05:36,186 --> 00:05:37,825
for their funerals and wait for death.

121

He's just been bestowed

Stop right there!

170
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,346
You've got some nerve.

171
00:07:58,385 --> 00:08:00,186
I want to see Zhan Yue.

172
00:08:04,225 --> 00:08:04,945
Zhan Yue!

173
00:08:05,506 --> 00:08:06,186
Zhan Yue!

174
00:08:06,985 --> 00:08:07,586
Zhan Yue!

175
00:08:13,906 --> 00:08:15,825
Zhan Yue, I finally found you.

176
00:08:16,306 --> 00:08:18,186
What's going on in the capital?

177
00:08:19,186 --> 00:08:21,225
Why did the court send the guards over
and stop me from going out?

178
00:08:22,705 --> 00:08:24,466
I tried so hard to get out of there.

179
00:08:25,586 --> 00:08:27,545
When I was on my way here,
they said

180
00:08:28,545 --> 00:08:29,425
Uncle was dead.

181
00:08:30,145 --> 00:08:31,466
Pei Yanzhen became the Regent.

182
00:08:32,186 --> 00:08:32,905
Is that true?

183
00:08:34,985 --> 00:08:35,545
Your Highness,

184
00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:37,665
just go back.

185
00:08:38,306 --> 00:08:39,225
I'm in a hurry.

186
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:41,186
When I settle the Shen family,

187
00:08:41,585 --> 00:08:42,225
I'll go to you.

188

(Shen's Residence)

189
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,545
What happened to the Shen family?

190
00:08:47,146 --> 00:08:47,826
Where is Shen Miao?

191
00:08:48,785 --> 00:08:49,585
Just let me see her.

192
00:08:53,025 --> 00:08:54,785
I know you think I'm an unworldly girl.

193
00:08:55,465 --> 00:08:56,425
But I'm not a fool.

194
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,545
They are all Pei Yanzhen's men.

195
00:09:04,345 --> 00:09:05,545
Did you surround this place?

196
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,345
What for?

197
00:09:10,025 --> 00:09:11,025
Just tell me.

198
00:09:14,225 --> 00:09:14,946
Leave, Your Highness.

199
00:09:16,746 --> 00:09:17,345
Zhan Yue,

200
00:09:19,465 --> 00:09:20,746
I beg of you.

201
00:09:24,826 --> 00:09:26,585
I know you have your reasons.

202
00:09:28,225 --> 00:09:28,826
But,

203
00:09:30,345 --> 00:09:31,905
many things have happened
in the court.

204
00:09:32,465 --> 00:09:33,866
Shen Miao and I are acquaintances.

205
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:35,985
Why don't...

206
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:39,746
Why don't you just let me see her?

207
00:09:40,465 --> 00:09:41,225
Okay?

208

♪I'm waiting for the wind and you

stop drinking.

211
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:34,706
If you want to drink,

212
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:35,985
I'll accompany you.

Your Highness,

214

you've come.

Everyone shuns the Shen family now.

217
00:11:01,826 --> 00:11:03,266
You're royalty.

218
00:11:04,306 --> 00:11:05,585
Aren't you afraid of getting infected?

219
00:11:09,306 --> 00:11:11,225
Pei Yanzhen has succeeded
in eradicating Uncle

220
00:11:11,746 --> 00:11:12,785
and becomes the Regent.

I'm sorry.

If I could figure out

about the plan
that Brother and Pei Yanzhen made

225
00:11:24,665 --> 00:11:25,626
and tell you about it sooner,

226
00:11:25,626 --> 00:11:26,306
you wouldn't have...

227
00:11:31,386 --> 00:11:32,306
I should be the one

228
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,105
who apologizes.

229
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:39,785
I trusted and loved

230
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,225
the wrong person.

231
00:11:43,985 --> 00:11:44,826
Otherwise,

232
00:11:47,545 --> 00:11:49,146
the Shen family wouldn't have
broken apart.

233
00:11:50,985 --> 00:11:52,626
If I didn't see it myself,

234
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:55,985
I would've thought
that Pei Yanzhen was true to you.

235
00:11:57,826 --> 00:11:58,626
It's not your fault.

236
00:11:59,826 --> 00:12:01,146
He's too good at pretending

237
00:12:03,626 --> 00:12:04,665
and he's very cunning.

238
00:12:06,105 --> 00:12:07,785
I can't imagine

239
00:12:08,985 --> 00:12:10,626
that this powerful

240
00:12:10,626 --> 00:12:12,345
and capable Pei Yanzhen

241
00:12:13,785 --> 00:12:16,386
is the same person in my mind.

242
00:12:19,345 --> 00:12:20,905
How I wish that everything was

243
00:12:22,665 --> 00:12:24,465
a bad dream when I woke up.

244

Miao,

245
00:12:30,946 --> 00:12:32,425
perhaps there's a chance
to turn things around.

246
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:35,626
When the furor in the capital recedes,

247
00:12:36,306 --> 00:12:37,626
I'll ask Brother for help

248
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,025
to exonerate you.

249
00:12:41,585 --> 00:12:42,186
Shen Miao,

As long as Brother and I are around,

252
00:12:48,105 --> 00:12:50,706
Pei Yanzhen wouldn't dare lay
a finger on you.

255

I'm afraid

that I can't live to see that day
when the furor recedes.

Don't say that.

00:13:41,826 --> 00:13:42,626
You said

260
00:13:44,225 --> 00:13:46,146
you'll take me to the Western Regions
to do business.

261
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:48,826
You even said

262
00:13:49,706 --> 00:13:51,826
you'll take a tour
of the capital with me.

263
00:13:56,626 --> 00:13:57,826
I'm just like

264
00:13:59,985 --> 00:14:01,866
a walking dead now.

00:14:15,465 --> 00:14:16,785
two things?

268
00:14:22,506 --> 00:14:23,386
First off,

269
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,266
when Aunt passed away,

270
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:30,826
there were many kinds
of sacrificial offerings.

271
00:14:32,266 --> 00:14:34,785
But Madiao from her hometown
was not included in it.

272
00:14:38,465 --> 00:14:39,826
Making her leave with regret.

273
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:42,746
I didn't fulfill my filial duty.

274
00:14:44,866 --> 00:14:47,306
The Song family sets foot
in all kinds of businesses.

275
00:14:48,946 --> 00:14:50,425
Third Master Song is not around.

276
00:14:51,186 --> 00:14:53,186
You can ask his underling, Tie Niu,

277
00:14:53,386 --> 00:14:54,585
to look for it.

278
00:14:57,425 --> 00:14:58,025
In this way,

279
00:14:59,386 --> 00:15:02,066
it can comfort Aunt's spirit in heaven.

280
00:15:04,585 --> 00:15:06,545
It's kind of a small gesture

281
00:15:07,905 --> 00:15:09,905
of respect from a dying person like me.

282
00:15:12,186 --> 00:15:12,946
Secondly,

283
00:15:15,266 --> 00:15:16,626
my dad told me

284
00:15:18,146 --> 00:15:19,105
that the Shen family

285
00:15:20,306 --> 00:15:21,425
must live

286
00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:23,186
and die together.

287
00:15:25,665 --> 00:15:26,345
Your Highness,

288
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:29,665
please tell Zhan Yue

289

that if I die,

290
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:35,425
be sure to bury me
at the Shen family's ancestral tombs.

00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:37,626
Will you do it?

Shen Miao,

293

you can't die.

Are you going to let
Pei Yanzhen bully you like this?

295

You have to stay alive
to seek revenge, Shen Miao.

296
00:15:48,386 --> 00:15:49,066
I'll do it in my next life.

297
00:15:52,146 --> 00:15:53,186
Promise me,

We have to stay away from this place.

302
00:17:20,786 --> 00:17:22,305
The Shen family is so miserable.

303
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:23,626
Two members died at once.

you're looking better today.

310

I'm sure you'll get well
after taking this medicine.

311
00:18:19,386 --> 00:18:21,546
I'm afraid this is a terminal lucidity.

312
00:18:21,546 --> 00:18:22,386
Do not talk nonsense.

313
00:18:23,506 --> 00:18:24,266
When the physician comes,

314
00:18:24,465 --> 00:18:25,345
he'll cure you.

315
00:18:29,546 --> 00:18:30,585
It's not necessary.

316
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:33,746
Tuberculosis is

317

an incurable illness.

318
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,345
The outcome is still the same

319

no matter how hard the physician tries.

All of you may leave.

323
00:18:59,026 --> 00:19:00,906
I have something to tell Tie Niu.

Let's go.

If Young Master Song sees you like this,

what does it look like?

Any last word?

Shut up!

How dare you curse her?

Never mind.

what your master is doing

335
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:47,825
in the capital?

336
00:20:01,185 --> 00:20:01,866
Forget it.

337
00:20:03,866 --> 00:20:07,945
Asking you to find Madiao is
just an excuse.

338
00:20:11,746 --> 00:20:13,266
I do have something to say
before I die.

339
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:16,786
Now

340
00:20:17,985 --> 00:20:20,225
my family has left me.

341
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:23,146
And I'm dying.

342
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:29,386
Xiao is the only one left.

343
00:20:38,266 --> 00:20:40,345
Besides me and the Shen family,

344
00:20:41,026 --> 00:20:43,105
Third Master Song is the person

345
00:20:44,506 --> 00:20:45,626
whom Xiao

346
00:20:46,386 --> 00:20:47,985
trusts the most.

347
00:20:53,746 --> 00:20:55,105
Now that Xiao

348
00:20:56,225 --> 00:20:57,746
is missing.

349
00:21:00,506 --> 00:21:02,105
I, as his mother,

350
00:21:04,185 --> 00:21:04,866
might not

351
00:21:07,185 --> 00:21:09,626
have the chance
to see him

352
00:21:10,386 --> 00:21:11,866
one last time.

353
00:21:17,105 --> 00:21:17,546
Madam.

354
00:21:18,506 --> 00:21:18,985
Madam.

355
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:27,065
All I wish is that
Third Master Song could take Xiao

356
00:21:29,626 --> 00:21:31,866
to my grave and worship me

357
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:34,825
on the first seventh day

358
00:21:37,825 --> 00:21:39,146
after my death.

359
00:21:41,105 --> 00:21:41,866
But,

360
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,746
do not bring Pei Yanzhen along.

361
00:21:50,626 --> 00:21:52,546
I don't want to see him.

362
00:22:01,185 --> 00:22:01,746
Madam.

363
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:02,825
Miss.

364
00:22:03,426 --> 00:22:03,906
Shen Miao.

365
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:04,626
Miss.

366
00:22:04,626 --> 00:22:05,266
Shen Miao.

367
00:22:08,945 --> 00:22:10,426

368
00:22:16,506 --> 00:22:17,546

369

are you clear about them?

373
00:22:28,985 --> 00:22:29,945
I remember them, Madam.

374
00:22:33,825 --> 00:22:34,825
Thank you.

375
00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:37,105
Stop talking, Shen Miao.

376
00:22:38,985 --> 00:22:40,626
- Physician.
- Physician.

377
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:42,585
Yes, I'm here.

378
00:22:43,305 --> 00:22:44,185
Hurry up, Physician.

379
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:03,105
How is she?

380
00:23:04,386 --> 00:23:04,985
Your Highness,

381
00:23:05,065 --> 00:23:05,506
Sir,

382
00:23:06,026 --> 00:23:08,786
Miss Shen is in the last stage
of tuberculosis.

383
00:23:09,705 --> 00:23:11,266
I'm afraid there's no medicine

384
00:23:12,345 --> 00:23:13,506
that can cure her.

385
00:23:14,985 --> 00:23:15,506
What are you talking about?

386
00:23:15,506 --> 00:23:16,146
Sir,

387
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:17,705
based on her condition,

388
00:23:17,705 --> 00:23:18,906
even the divine healer is

389
00:23:19,146 --> 00:23:20,506
not able to cure her.

390
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,906
It won't help

391
00:23:23,105 --> 00:23:24,585
even if you kill me.

392
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:25,945
Zhan Yue,

393
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:27,786
let him go.

394
00:23:30,386 --> 00:23:32,985
I'm well aware of my condition.

395
00:23:34,426 --> 00:23:36,225
Just consider it as accumulating merit.

396
00:23:37,386 --> 00:23:38,105
Miss,

397
00:23:38,426 --> 00:23:39,666
don't say that.

398
00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:41,426
No matter what,

399
00:23:41,626 --> 00:23:43,465
you have to wait
for Old Master and Xiao to come back.

400
00:23:46,786 --> 00:23:48,305
I wish they'll never step

401
00:23:51,065 --> 00:23:54,345
into Shen's Residence.

402
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:57,825
Miss Shen.

403
00:23:58,426 --> 00:23:59,026
Wait a little longer.

404
00:23:59,825 --> 00:24:01,146
I've sent a letter to the capital.

405
00:24:01,746 --> 00:24:03,546
Pei Yanzhen is traveling day and night
to get back to Lingzhou.

406
00:24:06,026 --> 00:24:08,065
I'm afraid it's too late.

407
00:24:10,026 --> 00:24:10,705
Zhan Yue,

408
00:24:11,985 --> 00:24:13,105
listen to me.

409
00:24:15,985 --> 00:24:16,866
Tell him

410
00:24:20,506 --> 00:24:23,585
that I, Shen Miao, am not important.

411
00:24:25,225 --> 00:24:26,705
What matters is

412
00:24:29,266 --> 00:24:30,666
to bury me

413
00:24:32,105 --> 00:24:36,146
at the Shen family's ancestral tombs
after I die.

414
00:24:42,506 --> 00:24:43,345
And...

415
00:24:44,626 --> 00:24:46,146
And Xiao.

416
00:24:48,225 --> 00:24:49,105
Xiao

417
00:24:50,185 --> 00:24:52,786
is his biological son.

418
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:55,426
Be sure...

419
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:59,666
Be sure to treat him nicely.

420
00:25:07,546 --> 00:25:08,345
Also,

421
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:11,426
I dare not ask more from him.

422
00:25:12,985 --> 00:25:15,105
We were husband and wife once.

423
00:25:17,386 --> 00:25:18,546
All I ask is

424
00:25:20,225 --> 00:25:22,386
that he could let my dad live

425
00:25:23,626 --> 00:25:26,465
for the sake
that the Shen family's fortune is

426
00:25:28,866 --> 00:25:30,266
going to be transferred

427
00:25:31,825 --> 00:25:34,786
to the national treasury.

428
00:25:35,465 --> 00:25:36,105
Miss Shen,

429
00:25:36,705 --> 00:25:37,465
just wait a little longer.

430
00:25:38,345 --> 00:25:39,386
I've informed the capital.

431
00:25:39,666 --> 00:25:40,666
Just one day will do.

432
00:25:41,345 --> 00:25:42,626
Pei Yanzhen will be back soon.

433
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:47,666
Wait for what?

434
00:25:50,825 --> 00:25:52,465
Wait to be imprisoned?

435
00:25:54,065 --> 00:25:55,626
Wait to be annihilated?

436
00:25:59,465 --> 00:26:00,786
Or

437
00:26:02,345 --> 00:26:04,345
wait for Pei Yanzhen to come back

438
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:08,305
to kill me

439
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:10,866
and my family?

440
00:26:12,305 --> 00:26:13,345
Pei Yanzhen won't do that.

441
00:26:14,705 --> 00:26:16,065
I can't.

442
00:26:18,345 --> 00:26:19,585
I'm afraid

443
00:26:20,985 --> 00:26:22,266
I can't wait any longer.

No!

I'm useless.

I can't let her rest in peace.

535
00:33:34,666 --> 00:33:36,465
Now that I'm evicted

that everything is gone after death.

541
00:33:48,585 --> 00:33:50,305
Since Madam's soul has ascended

though her body is taken away,

543

I guess no one can disturb her
in the afterlife.

Third Master, please save Miss Shen.

don't be sad.

552
00:34:11,265 --> 00:34:11,986
Madam has

553
00:34:13,146 --> 00:34:14,105
passed away.

554
00:34:16,986 --> 00:34:17,825
Miaomiao, she...

555
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:20,466
Did she really...

556
00:34:39,706 --> 00:34:40,545
Miao, you liked

557
00:34:41,545 --> 00:34:42,545
to eat sweets.

558
00:34:44,065 --> 00:34:44,866
Try this tea.

559
00:35:11,426 --> 00:35:12,186
Please calm down, Your Highness.

560
00:35:12,186 --> 00:35:13,986
- Please calm down, Your Highness.
- Please calm down, Your Highness.

561
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:16,065
Tale of Ancient Sword is
Miao's favorite show.

562
00:35:17,426 --> 00:35:18,505
If you make mistakes,

563
00:35:20,545 --> 00:35:21,666
she'd get mad.

564
00:35:29,065 --> 00:35:29,545
Miao,

565
00:35:31,386 --> 00:35:32,386
many things have happened

566
00:35:33,305 --> 00:35:34,545
during this trip to the capital.

567
00:35:36,186 --> 00:35:37,825
There are many things
I want to tell you.

568
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,946
You liked to watch shows.

569
00:35:42,305 --> 00:35:43,745
If I kill them all,

570
00:35:44,986 --> 00:35:46,345
would you intercede for them?

571
00:35:51,986 --> 00:35:52,585
I've said

572
00:35:52,585 --> 00:35:53,265
that no noise

573
00:35:53,265 --> 00:35:54,585
at Shen's Residence.

574
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:55,666
Please calm down, Your Highness.

575
00:35:56,025 --> 00:35:56,545
It's...

576
00:35:57,105 --> 00:35:58,265
It's Official Song.

577
00:36:05,426 --> 00:36:06,025
Miao,

578
00:36:08,785 --> 00:36:09,745
I'll be right back.

579
00:36:23,505 --> 00:36:24,426
Keep going.

580
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:44,585
Move aside.

581
00:36:44,866 --> 00:36:45,545
Regent has said

582
00:36:45,785 --> 00:36:47,105
that no one is allowed
to barge into Shen's Residence.

583
00:36:47,265 --> 00:36:48,626
Official Song, please don't make
things difficult for us.

584
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,105
He's the Regent, so what?

585
00:36:50,986 --> 00:36:52,585
No one can stop me

586
00:36:53,226 --> 00:36:54,386
from doing what I want.

587
00:37:04,666 --> 00:37:05,226
Stop!

588
00:37:16,946 --> 00:37:17,745
Pei!

589
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:21,065
Where exactly did you hide
Miaomiao's body?

590
00:37:21,626 --> 00:37:22,585
She's my wife.

591
00:37:23,186 --> 00:37:23,946
Why do you care?

592
00:37:26,426 --> 00:37:27,146
Do you deserve her?

593
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:28,386
I thought

594
00:37:28,386 --> 00:37:30,146
you were true to Miaomiao.

595
00:37:30,505 --> 00:37:31,866
Now that she died because of you,

596
00:37:32,186 --> 00:37:33,065
what else do you want?

597
00:37:33,466 --> 00:37:34,666
Are you going to crush
her bones into ashes?

598
00:37:39,226 --> 00:37:39,785
Get out.

599
00:37:41,186 --> 00:37:42,265
Don't disturb her.

600
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:45,626
If you don't hand over
Miaomiao's body today,

601
00:37:46,226 --> 00:37:48,025
I won't leave.

602
00:37:49,065 --> 00:37:49,745
Try me.

603
00:37:52,906 --> 00:37:54,946
You've been sanctimonious

604
00:37:55,226 --> 00:37:56,585
and making profits all these years.

605
00:37:56,585 --> 00:37:58,226
You can't pretend anymore.

606
00:37:58,785 --> 00:38:00,946
I've always wanted to fight you.

607
00:38:01,866 --> 00:38:03,545
I can take this chance
to avenge Miaomiao.

608
00:38:24,025 --> 00:38:24,745
With Master's martial arts skills,

609
00:38:24,745 --> 00:38:25,505
he can't hold him up for long.

610
00:38:25,745 --> 00:38:26,265
Hurry up.

611
00:38:57,946 --> 00:39:00,505
A martial art expert like you has

612
00:39:00,906 --> 00:39:02,426
hidden your skills for decades

613
00:39:02,785 --> 00:39:04,426
for the sake of your revenge plan.

614
00:39:05,386 --> 00:39:05,785
No wonder

615
00:39:05,785 --> 00:39:08,785
you'd despise the lives
of the Shen family.

616
00:39:34,745 --> 00:39:36,186
He's a leading official now.

617
00:39:36,585 --> 00:39:37,265
Don't do anything outrageous.

618
00:39:39,105 --> 00:39:39,666
Song Xiyuan,

619
00:39:39,866 --> 00:39:40,505
you're no match for him.

620
00:39:40,505 --> 00:39:41,025
Just go.

621
00:39:43,146 --> 00:39:44,545
Now, I just regret

622
00:39:45,505 --> 00:39:47,866
that I didn't take her away
from here back then,

623
00:39:48,825 --> 00:39:52,466
causing her to end up
in such a miserable situation.

624
00:39:52,585 --> 00:39:53,105
Your Highness,

625
00:39:53,666 --> 00:39:54,585
something happens in the foyer.

626
00:39:54,745 --> 00:39:55,745
Someone is trying to abduct Madam.

627
00:39:59,866 --> 00:40:00,745
It's you.

628
00:40:04,226 --> 00:40:04,906
Come, Lvying.

629
00:40:05,345 --> 00:40:05,906
Miss.

630
00:40:16,105 --> 00:40:17,345
Put her down.

631
00:40:18,226 --> 00:40:20,065
I'll spare your lives.

632
00:40:38,025 --> 00:40:38,545
Master.

633
00:40:39,426 --> 00:40:39,986
Miao,

634
00:40:41,226 --> 00:40:42,466
you've been asleep for three days.

635
00:40:44,785 --> 00:40:45,745
It's time to wake up.

636
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:52,146
Fine.

637
00:40:54,386 --> 00:40:55,386
I'll watch over you.

640
00:41:02,146 --> 00:41:03,025
I'll wait for you.

641
00:41:04,706 --> 00:41:06,426
My parents had died for me.

642
00:41:08,186 --> 00:41:10,226
Do you have the heart
to leave me alone?

643
00:41:12,186 --> 00:41:13,986
I still have
a lot of things to tell you.

644
00:41:14,626 --> 00:41:15,186
Official Pei,

645
00:41:15,426 --> 00:41:16,545
please give her back to me.

646
00:41:16,545 --> 00:41:17,146
Shut up.

647
00:41:18,505 --> 00:41:19,666
One more word,

648
00:41:20,986 --> 00:41:22,585
I'll kill you right away.

649
00:41:33,946 --> 00:41:34,666
Miao,

650
00:41:36,186 --> 00:41:38,545
I hate hearing someone say you're dead.

651
00:41:40,986 --> 00:41:42,065
I'll kill all the servants
of the Shen family

652
00:41:44,545 --> 00:41:46,626
and the martial artists
so they can go down there

653
00:41:47,386 --> 00:41:48,226
and keep you company
