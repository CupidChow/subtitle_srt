I've sent out the order.

I knew I could count on you.

Your Highness, we should hurry.

38

Official Pei is already waiting.

39

Let's go.

Go!

Aren't you locked inside
the room by the guards?

Tie Niu.

Tie Niu!

00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:28,320
Tie Niu!

51
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,639
Move aside!

52
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,199
Make way!

53
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,839
Yanzhen,

54
00:03:56,839 --> 00:03:58,399
I didn't mean it.

55
00:03:58,399 --> 00:03:59,080
Where is the key?

56
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,199
Quick.

57
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,199
That's not my doing.

58
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,279
It was...

59
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:13,880
Maybe Shen Miao is changing.

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,240
The door is locked from the inside.

61
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,239
Miao!

62
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,640
Are you in there?

63
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,079
Shen Miao? Shen Miao!

64
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:26,119
Quick!

65
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:28,880
Miao!

66
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:31,760
This...

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,200
This is outrageous!

68
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,519
This is indecent!

69
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:35,640
What do you know?

70
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,959
The couple is having a little fun.

71
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,959
Such an embarrassment!

72
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:40,600
Master Song's innocence is ruined.

73
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,440
What innocence?

74
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,399
Silence, all of you!

75
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,720
The magistrate is investigating.

76
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,200
Those unrelated, leave at once!

77
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,040
Leave now!

78
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:47,320
Away with you!

79
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:49,320
- Quick!
- Miss!

80
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:51,359
- Miss!
- Quick.

81
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:52,600
Lvying, take care of Miss Shen.

82
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,839
- Miss...
- Constable Zhao.

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,799
Get Third Master Song out of bed.

84
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:55,399
Yes.

85
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,279
- Get up!
- Yanzhen!

86
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,119
- Get up!
- Wait for me!

87
00:04:59,119 --> 00:04:59,839
Miss.

88
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,679
Pei Yanzhen,
what is wrong with you?

89
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,320
Do you know what you're doing?

90
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,160
If you care about Miao's reputation,

91
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,200
stop talking.

92
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:38,959
Official Pei.

93
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,399
Miao.

94
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,559
How are you?

95
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,959
My head hurts a little.

96
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,640
I don't know

97
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,720
what's wrong with my legs.

98
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:54,839
I can't walk properly.

99
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,600
I think I fell

100
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,239
and...

101
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,799
Third Master Song.

102
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,679
Let's go home.

103
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,279
Let me catch my breath.

104
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,480
I'll ask Tie Niu
to prepare the carriage.

105
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:23,959
Miao.

106
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:24,839
Don't catch a cold.

107
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,720
Thank you, Uncle.

108
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:32,760
I'm not cold.

109
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:36,760
Miao.

110
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,920
This accident was my fault.

111
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,359
Don't you worry.

112
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:42,839
I will settle the matter

113
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:44,600
between Her Highness and me.

114
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:50,399
Official Pei, aren't you
marrying Her Highness?

115
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:53,079
Don't forget to send me an invitation.

116
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,279
Do you not know what I meant?

117
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,959
If you are meeting your loved one,

118
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:00,920
you should hurry.

119
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,959
Go to Her Highness now.

120
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,480
If you angered the princess,

121
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:05,399
you could lose your head.

122
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,399
Miao...

123
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
I came here

124
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,799
to see you again.

125
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,399
I want to explain to you.

126
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,040
That day at Shen's Residence,

127
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:15,000
I meant every word I said.

128
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:16,000
- Official Pei.
- I've always...

129
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,600
My wife went through a lot today.

130
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,880
She mustn't stay here.

131
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,040
If there is anything to discuss,

132
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,720
I'll pay you a visit
at the yamen tomorrow.

133
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:30,959
Goodbye.

134
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,040
Miao.

135
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,399
Miaomiao?

136
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:42,399
- Miao?
- Miaomiao.

137
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,040
Come.

138
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,200
Sit down.

139
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,200
What's wrong?

140
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:49,480
My goodness.

141
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,200
How did you hurt yourself so badly?

142
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,760
I'll take you to a physician.

143
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,359
Come with me to the yamen.

144
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:55,600
We have a physician there.

145
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:57,959
Your Highness!

146
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:58,839
Move aside!

147
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:04,799
Miaomiao.

148
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,559
Sorry, Official Pei.

149
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,480
Something is lost forever
when you miss it.

150
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,359
I wish you

151
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:17,119
and the princess
a blissful married life.

152
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,600
May your love last forever.

153
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:20,720
Come.

154
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:21,920
Be careful.

155
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,399
Miao.

156
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:23,880
Walk slowly.

157
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,519
Move aside!

158
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,720
What are you staring at?

159
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,320
Dismiss!

160
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,520
Be careful.

Well?

165
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,760
Has she eaten?

166
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,440
She's locked herself up in the room

167
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,960
after she came back.

168
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:17,039
She hasn't made a sound.

169
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,440
I am worried.

170
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,239
It's alright. You may go now.

00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:10,959
Several Grand Secretaries
are rooting for you.

339
00:19:11,199 --> 00:19:12,959
It's very likely you will be a minister.

340
00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:15,199
I can't let you kneel before me.

341
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:16,439
I am grateful for that.

342
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,160
However, I think

343
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,199
we should uphold the rites.

344
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,439
Abiding by the rites
is the foundation of the ruling.

345
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:24,119
It applies to the ruler
and his subjects.

346
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:25,160
No one is an exception.

347
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,880
Yes. Well said.

348
00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:29,719
Do I have the honor

349
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:30,959
to have your service?

350
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,880
Ruling with rites in a time of peace,

351
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,719
such is the way to maintain that peace.

352
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,119
Your Majesty.

353
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:45,959
You broke your promise.

354
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:48,880
Your Majesty.

355
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,560
Pei Yanzhen, you said

356
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:51,959
you'd be my aide in the Imperial Court,

357
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,959
that we'd remove the old-fashioned minds

358
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,319
and quell corruption among officers.

359
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:57,599
Why can't you

360
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:59,400
follow the will of my mother and uncle?

361
00:20:00,439 --> 00:20:01,560
In the entire palace,

362
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:04,560
you're the only one I trust.

363
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,319
If you are banished from the capital,

364
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:08,880
what should I do, then?

365
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:11,959
I am only avoiding
the Empress Dowager's attention for now.

366
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,199
The consort kin in the Imperial Court

367
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,119
is toying with power and
feeding everyone their lies.

368
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,680
Official Qin embezzled
money from the treasury.

369
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,680
Despite increased taxation,

370
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,680
the treasury is still empty.

371
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,640
Soldiers must live without warm clothes.

372
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,599
People from across
the land lost their homes.

373
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:26,920
I will become your aide someday
and help you regain

374
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,959
your power.

375
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:30,319
We'll start a new era of peace.

376
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:34,400
(I remember that night.)

377
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:38,319
(It was raining that night.)

378
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,719
Over the past three years,
every word you've said

379
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,079
has never been forgotten.

380
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,280
But you would forsake your promise

381
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,640
over a woman.

382
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:52,199
You refuse to use Jiu's connection

383
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,400
to return here.

384
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,280
You risk suspicion

385
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:59,079
only to make Shen Miao happy.

386
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
If Mother questions your background,

387
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:03,920
and wants you dead,

388
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,359
what should I do?

389
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:08,439
Do you doubt me?

390
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:09,640
Insolence.

391
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:11,439
You and I,

392
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,479
we want the same thing.

393
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,800
A ruler must treat officers as his own.

394
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,400
The officers must repay
the kindness with their lives.

395
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,160
I made you a promise.

396
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,640
Not once
have I given up on fulfilling it.

397
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,400
One day,

398
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:30,319
I will return to
the capital with my own strength,

399
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,599
instead of the protection
from Her Highness.

400
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:33,800
Your Majesty.

401
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,199
My life

402
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,040
is always in your hands.

403
00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:51,199
So be it.

404
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:52,839
I shall

405
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,839
save your skin once again.

406
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,680
He said that?

407
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:11,479
How ambitious of him.

408
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:14,319
He meant to estrange my son and me.

409
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,719
Very well.

410
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,760
Good job,

411
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,439
Pei Yanzhen.

412
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,040
If you're bold enough
to come here alone,

413
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:26,839
I should certainly deliver a bold gift.

414
00:22:28,199 --> 00:22:29,079
Isn't that right?

415
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,719
Very astute, Your Majesty.

416
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:41,040
How did you

417
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,280
fall sick all of a sudden?

418
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:43,880
Is it food poisoning?

419
00:22:44,199 --> 00:22:46,400
She hasn't drunk
a drop of water after waking up.

420
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,319
I think

421
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:48,719
Her Highness upset her too much.

422
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:50,199
Maybe I am just hungry.

423
00:22:50,199 --> 00:22:51,119
Can you please cut it out?

424
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,479
Give me some peace.

425
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,199
Sir.

426
00:22:58,439 --> 00:22:59,000
Well?

427
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,680
Her pulse is steady and strong.

428
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,800
It reads smoothness.

429
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:05,119
Congratulations, Madam.

430
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,439
Congratulations, Third Master Song.

431
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:07,439
She is

432
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,040
pregnant.

433
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:10,040
- What?
- What?

434
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:12,199
Third Master Song, are you overjoyed?

435
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:14,520
Your wife is pregnant now.

436
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,400
Miaomiao.

437
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,560
Did you hear that?

438
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,400
Get lost.

439
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,839
Get out!

440
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:26,199
Get out of my sight!

441
00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:26,719
Miss!

442
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:27,359
Get lost!

443
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:27,880
Take it easy!

444
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,640
Song Xiyuan.

445
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:29,880
What did you promise me?

446
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:32,079
Do not approach my bed
without my permission!

447
00:23:32,199 --> 00:23:33,160
Even if I got drunk and

448
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,880
took advantage of you,

449
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,479
it wouldn't have happened

450
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,719
unless you approached me!

451
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,599
Why do you even

452
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:37,479
look so happy about it?

453
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:38,560
There's nothing to celebrate!

454
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,119
Get out!

455
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:39,719
I don't want to see you again!

456
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:40,880
Miaomiao, hear me out.

457
00:23:41,199 --> 00:23:41,920
It was my fault.

458
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:42,880
I made a mistake.

459
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,079
But I didn't mean it...

460
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:44,640
Shut it!

461
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:47,079
You can berate or
hit me however you want.

462
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,319
- But sit down, please.
- Yes.

463
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:49,280
You could hurt the baby.

464
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:50,280
He is right.

465
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:52,239
Anger, sadness, and fear are harmful.

466
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:53,359
And now you are pregnant.

467
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:54,640
Why don't you get pregnant too?

468
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:55,599
You too! Get out!

469
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:00,800
This is something new.

470
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,359
The Song family is truly unconventional.

471
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,839
She is more upset about her pregnancy

472
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,079
than learning her husband

473
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:06,959
is cheating on her.

474
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:07,880
Nonsense!

475
00:24:08,439 --> 00:24:09,280
Miaomiao, calm down.

476
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,400
Sir.

477
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,800
Any advice for early pregnancy?

478
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,280
The first three months are critical.

479
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,160
But she's four months
into her pregnancy.

480
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,199
She is definitely safe.

481
00:24:17,719 --> 00:24:18,560
What did you say?

482
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,160
She is safe.

483
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,839
Before that.

484
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:23,599
You are four months into your pregnancy.

485
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,599
Judging by the time,

486
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,040
you'll celebrate the baby's full moon

487
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,119
next year.

488
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:28,160
You worthless physician!

489
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,839
Stop spewing nonsense!

490
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:30,520
Miss, no...

491
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,719
Enough of your nonsense!

492
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:32,239
Madam!

493
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:33,239
Why are you hitting me?

494
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:34,119
- Tie Niu!
- You and your nonsense!

495
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:35,319
Get the physician out of here!

496
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:35,800
Get out!

497
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,520
But it's true!

498
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,000
Let's go.

499
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,880
Alright.

500
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,520
You too! Get out!

501
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,400
You too!

502
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,000
Unbelievable!

503
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,400
Scram!

504
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,160
Get out of my sight now!

505
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,119
You're a fraud and a liar!

506
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,880
I've been wronged!

507
00:24:57,439 --> 00:24:58,520
Madam

508
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,319
really is four months
into her pregnancy!

509
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:03,439
My master has only
been married for two months.

510
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,359
How can she be pregnant for four months?

511
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,560
Scram.

512
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,359
You went to His Majesty

513
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,319
to tell him you'll
steer clear of the Ninth Princess.

514
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:31,400
And?

515
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,599
You almost got yourself killed.

516
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,520
Official Pei.

517
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:38,280
Your self-hurting was overly convincing.

518
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,359
That was the only way

519
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,400
to convince those
watching in the palace.

520
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:44,560
But after this negotiation,

521
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,359
my wedding with
Her Highness is off the table.

522
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:56,000
What are you waiting for?

523
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,079
Drink up.

524
00:26:08,439 --> 00:26:10,359
Now that your wedding is canceled,

525
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,160
does it mean you can
start wooing Shen Miao again?

526
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,640
Why not?

527
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,439
Third Master Song is not trustworthy.

528
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:19,640
See the cunning in his eyes?

529
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:22,000
He is a treacherous man.

530
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,000
I think

531
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,199
if you stayed here any longer,

532
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,199
they could already
have a child together.

533
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:29,680
You can attend their reception.

534
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,239
Did you stumble upon a fortune lately?

535
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,520
No.

536
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,119
Seeing how you're so frank with words,

537
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,560
I thought

538
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:40,520
you don't want my money anymore.

539
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,160
Pei Yanzhen!

540
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,839
Official Pei.

541
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:48,400
Yanzhen.

542
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,800
I am sorry.

543
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:51,359
I apologize, okay?

544
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:54,400
Let me help you.

545
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:58,520
Come on.

546
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,040
Open up.

547
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,680
I still don't believe it.

548
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,719
His Majesty would have
let you off the hook so easily.

549
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,680
So? What are the terms?

550
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,640
In three years,

551
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:16,199
he must regain his power.

552
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,599
Are you going up
against the Empress Dowager?

553
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:24,280
Are you sure about this?

554
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,800
The Qin family and
the Empress Dowager are very powerful.

555
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,079
Normal folks can't even touch them.

556
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,319
You could have used my help.

557
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,560
Come, I'll fill the bowl for you.

558
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:39,160
I don't want you to meet your end

559
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,040
even before the fight.

560
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:02,119
You actually learned to knock.

561
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:03,119
Come in.

562
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,760
Are you hurt? How do you feel?

563
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:00,719
I'll live.

564
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:02,719
The Empress Dowager probably sent them.

565
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,800
They mustn't know
I know martial art skills.

566
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,599
The wound looks bad.

567
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:09,160
You need to heal.

568
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,599
I'll send a message to Lingzhou.

569
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,319
I'll order Constable Zhao to stand by.

570
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,199
Zhao.

571
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:17,319
Is Miao in trouble?

572
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:17,640
Quick!

573
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,319
(Jiang's Clinic)
Come out.

574
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:20,520
Wait.

575
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:22,880
What is the meaning of this?

576
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:24,079
Young Master.

577
00:29:24,439 --> 00:29:25,800
All the physicians are here.

578
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,040
Are you specialists in gynecology?

579
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,560
Louder.

580
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,599
Yes.

581
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,680
They are all coming.

582
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:32,599
By the request of the Song family.

583
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:33,920
Come on.

584
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,119
What is this about?

585
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,239
I haven't menstruated for months.

586
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:45,040
Does that mean I am pregnant?

587
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,959
But how did I get pregnant?

588
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,599
Pei Yanzhen.

589
00:29:51,199 --> 00:29:52,319
You said

590
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,599
the Pei family is my home.

591
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,479
I should be the one you trust the most.

592
00:30:03,199 --> 00:30:05,520
But I've never been pregnant before.

593
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,959
But I don't feel any differences.

594
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:12,959
Miaomiao.

595
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:14,680
Miaomiao.

596
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,280
Miaomiao.

597
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:18,560
Don't worry.

598
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:20,000
I got you several physicians.

599
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,880
But we already got one.

600
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:26,880
Yes.

601
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:28,239
But after much pondering,

602
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,359
the physician this morning

603
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:31,400
must be a spy sent by Pei Yanzhen.

604
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,439
He is jealous of our love.

605
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,719
He sought to sabotage our marriage.

606
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:36,520
Of course he would seize this chance.

607
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,800
Pei Yanzhen?

608
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,040
A spy?

609
00:30:39,719 --> 00:30:40,280
Yes.

610
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:42,719
He is jealous that I married a beauty.

611
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,119
He is jealous of our bond.

612
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:46,000
He wanted to estrange us

613
00:30:46,199 --> 00:30:47,000
and tarnished our names!

614
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,839
He even wanted to rob
me of my unborn daughter.

615
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:50,520
I got you three physicians.

616
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,199
They will examine thoroughly.

617
00:30:52,479 --> 00:30:53,119
Song Xiyuan.

618
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,880
Have you lost your mind?

619
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:56,640
When were we ever deeply in love?

620
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,119
When did we have a daughter?

621
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:01,880
Dear, don't be shy.

622
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,839
That night in the bedroom...

623
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:04,760
Forget it.

624
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:06,160
Let's not bring that up.

625
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,119
Fine, examine away.

626
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:13,160
Tie Niu.

627
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,400
Let them in.

628
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,959
Excuse me, Madam.

629
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,239
Well?

630
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,199
Young Master,
your wife is indeed pregnant.

631
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:31,959
How far along?

632
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:35,239
Two months.

633
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,040
- Yes.
- Yes.

634
00:31:37,239 --> 00:31:37,760
- Two months!
- Two months!

635
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,599
- It's two months!
- It's two months!

636

(What is Song Xiyuan
trying to pull off?)

637
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:43,599
I knew it.

638
00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:45,959
I knew Pei Yanzhen was up to no good.

639
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:46,800
(Pei Yanzhen wasn't the father?)

640

Tie Niu.

641
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,520
Reward!

642
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:50,520
Reward them handsomely!

643
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,839
Appreciated, Third Master Song.

644
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,479
Gentlemen,

645
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,239
come.

646
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,479
Dear,

647
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,640
I know we have an agreement.

648
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:18,959
But...

649
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:21,439
But the night is freezing cold.

650
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,119
Won't you let me stay inside?

651
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,719
TThird Master Song.

652
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:28,160
I'm not kicking you out.

653
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,839
I'll get down to business.

654
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,920
Let's make everything clear.

655
00:32:35,479 --> 00:32:36,079
I agree.

656
00:32:36,479 --> 00:32:38,160
As long as it's not
aborting my daughter,

657
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,439
anything can be discussed.

658
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,640
A daughter?

659
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:42,520
What makes you think it's a girl?

660
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,599
Well...

661
00:32:44,439 --> 00:32:45,920
We are connected by blood.

662
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,560
Let's get down to business.

663

(Marriage Certificate)

664
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,359
Before we get married,

665
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,599
I wanted each other

666
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,839
to benefit from this marriage

667
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,680
and used this marriage to make
His Majesty give up on me.

668
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,640
But I never thought

669
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,119
things would turn out this way.

670
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:14,640

00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,800
what we should do with the child

677
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:26,079
in this ruse of a marriage?

678
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,479
We have to get a divorce.

679
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,020
(Marriage Certificate)

680
00:33:44,719 --> 00:33:45,199
Miaomiao.

681
00:33:48,199 --> 00:33:49,280
We can't do that.

682
00:33:49,719 --> 00:33:51,359
You shouldn't joke about this.

683
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,920
If we get a divorce now,

684
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,079
you and your child

685
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,959
will be shunned
by everyone in Lingzhou.

686
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,599
Song Xiyuan.

687
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:00,400
I am not joking.

688
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,400
I'd rather let the child be shunned
than grow up in a family

689
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,079
where the parents have no love.

690
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,520
Besides,

691
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,040
we don't know when
the child will be born.

692
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,439
His Majesty is unlikely to marry me.

693
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,840
As for our business in Jiangnan,

694
00:34:13,479 --> 00:34:14,439
I will fulfill my end

695
00:34:14,439 --> 00:34:15,439
of the promise.

696
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,639
Tomorrow, you must...

697
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,239
Miaomiao.

698
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,919
You've been part
of the family for two months.

699
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,199
Was there not a day you were happy?

700
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,800
Pei Yanzhen is getting married.

701
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,760
Why can't you move on?

702
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,520
And my love for you...

703
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:36,159
Do you not see how much I love you?

704
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:42,679
Stop banging on the door!

705
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,360
It's the middle of the night!

706
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,040
Can you come again tomorrow?

707
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:05,320
It's not because of the others.

708
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:09,000
It's because...

709
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,600
I didn't think it through.

710
00:35:16,479 --> 00:35:17,159
Sorry.

711
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,000
If I hadn't dragged you into this...

712
00:35:20,879 --> 00:35:22,639
if I hadn't gotten drunk that day,

713
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,239
none of these would've happened.

714
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:27,760
Falling into
the water was an accident.

715
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:30,199
But it was our fate.

716
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,679
You know

717
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,239
that's not what I meant.

718
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:36,040
I know you had
no choice but to marry me.

719
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,679
But after spending months together,

720
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,719
don't you think

721
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:42,120
we are meant to be together?

722
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,120
Miaomiao.

723
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,719
Give me a chance.

724
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,159
Give yourself a chance.

725
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,360
Please.

726
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:56,840
Young Master!

727
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,280
Young Master!

728
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,360
(Always be kind)
Young Master, bad news!

729
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,719
May I know

730
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,000
what brought Official Pei here tonight?

731
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:15,320
I was told Miao is pregnant.

732
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,840
I came to check on her.

733
00:36:18,919 --> 00:36:21,120
You're very caring as an officer.

734
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,639
But Miaomiao is my wife.

735
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,120
Her pregnancy is none of your business.

736
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:28,679
It's less than
three months since you married her.

737
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,520
But I was told
she's four months into her pregnancy.

738
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,600
I have reason to think

739
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:36,159
the baby

740
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,520
is a child of the Pei family.

741
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,080
Don't you know it was a false diagnosis?

742
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,239
The swindling physician

743
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:45,879
has been banished from Lingzhou.

744
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:47,239
What are the odds?

745
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,000
I ran into the same physician on my way.

746
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,679
I came

747
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:53,239
to investigate.

748
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,040
Official Pei.

749
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,840
I have been wronged in this matter.

750
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:06,840
Give me a break.

751
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,360
He is a fraud.

752
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,159
I hired the three Jiang physicians
to examine my wife.

753
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:12,239
It's been proven he was wrong.

754
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,600
I didn't sue him for slandering my wife.

755
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,600
That was more
generosity than he deserved.

756
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,320
You accuse each other with hearsay.

757
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:21,360
I happen to know

758
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,760
the renowned gynecologist,
Physician Wei from Huichun Apothecary.

759
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,600
He's been summoned.

760
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,719
Today, I shall host

761
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:28,600
the examination.

762
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,159
Then, we'll learn the truth.

763
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,080
If you insist,

764
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,600
I must resort to extreme measures.

765
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:48,639
Master Song, are you going to assault
an officer of the Imperial Court?

766
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,800
According to the law,

767
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,280
any commoner who assaults

768
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,840
the magistrate, prefect, or commissioner

769
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,040
shall get 100 beatings and
three years of jail time.

770
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:57,959
Any who wounds

771
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,080
will get 100 beatings
and be exiled 2000 li away.

772
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,040
If the officer is maimed,

773
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,520
it's a death sentence.

774
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,080
Official Pei!

775
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,040
The Jianghuai Apothecary Council
requests to see Official Pei!

776
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:13,600
- We want to see Master Song!
- We want to see Master Song!

777
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:14,919
Official Pei!

778
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:15,760
Master Song!

779
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,760
Official Pei!

780
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,639
Lvying.

781
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,360
Are they going to start a fight?

782
00:38:21,959 --> 00:38:23,800
If Master Song wants a fight,

783
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:25,600
Official Pei wouldn't do that.

784
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:27,360
Just sit down and rest.

785
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,600
Keep the baby safe.

786
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:34,000
No. We must go.

787
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:34,879
Let's take a look.

788
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,159
- Four months!
- Two months!

789
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:37,760
Four months!

790
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,840
Two months!

791
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,679
Four months!

792
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:42,479
It's two months!

793
00:38:42,479 --> 00:38:44,479
Four months!

794
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,919
Four months!

795
00:38:45,919 --> 00:38:46,639
Two months!

796
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,399
Four months!

797
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,040
What...

798
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,320
What is going on?

799
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,080
Two months!

800
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,760
Four months!

801
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,399
It has to be four months!

802
00:38:53,399 --> 00:38:54,239
Two months!

803
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:56,840
Quiet down!

804
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:57,760
Quiet down!

805
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,360
Listen to Official Pei!

806
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,479
Physician Tian, what do you think?

807
00:39:02,879 --> 00:39:03,800
Sir,

808
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:05,560
I've been practicing for years.

809
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,800
I've always been cautious.

810
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:08,560
I didn't make a mistake.

811
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:09,719
Madam Song...

812
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,560
No.

813
00:39:11,879 --> 00:39:12,760
Miss Shen

814
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,120
has indeed been
pregnant for four months.

815
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,840
Master Song slandered me.

816
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,360
It tarnishes

817
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,879
the reputation
I've built up over the years.

818
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,000
Who is this fraud?

819
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,840
It's two months. That's the answer.

820
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,320
Madam's pulse has always been smooth.

821
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,120
The pulsing is even.

822
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:38,679
Sometimes it's felt, and sometimes not.

823
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,959
Of course she's been
pregnant for two months.

824
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,360
Impossible.

825
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:45,760
Her pulse is strong and healthy.

826
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,959
It was smooth and rounded.

827
00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:49,360
It's the sign of
four months into pregnancy!

828
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:50,360
Two months!

829
00:39:50,479 --> 00:39:51,320
Four months!

830
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:52,959
Two months!

831
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:54,159
Two months!

832
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,719
Four months!

833
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,000
Silence! All of you!

834
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,520
Miao.

835
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,360
Miaomiao.

836
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:17,679
Stop arguing.

837
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,760
You too, gentlemen.

838
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,360
I want to know the truth.

839
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,520
The baby is in me.

840
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,679
Just examine it again.

841
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,320
Sir.

842
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:32,360
He is here.

843
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,840
Is he fit for the task?

844
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,840
No one knows the truth.

845
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,280
Lvying.

846
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:04,959
Bring a handkerchief.

847
00:41:04,959 --> 00:41:06,040
Wipe the physician's sweat away.

848
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:06,679
Yes.

849
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:08,360
Never mind. I appreciate it.

850
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,639
I heard about your mastery

851
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:13,679
in medicinal knowledge.

852
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,120
Examine as you wish.

853
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,840
Do not let the others concern you.

854
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,679
Thank you for being considerate.

855
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,120
You're welcome.

856
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:24,959
Sir,

857
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:26,560
I want to know the truth.

858
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:28,879
Please do a thorough examination.

859
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,320
I'll take responsibility for the result.

860
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:32,959
Rest assured.

861
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,840
I'll do everything I can.

862
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,239
Pei Yanzhen.

863
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:52,479
Who is this incompetent physician?

864
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,840
What is taking him so long

865
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,280
to get a result?

866
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,600
Master Song, what's the rush?

867
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:00,639
Does it concern you?

868
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:02,840
What is this nonsense?

869
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:05,560
It was a logical deduction.

870
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,360
- Well?
- Well?

871
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,679
Gentlemen.

872
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,479
Miss Shen has been pregnant

873
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:20,919
for four months.

874
00:42:21,399 --> 00:42:21,959
Incompetence!

875
00:42:22,399 --> 00:42:23,280
Another fraud!

876
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,639
You live up to your reputation.

877
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:26,560
Thanks for the service.

878
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,120
It's my duty after all.

879
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:30,719
That's not possible!

880
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,320
Miss Shen's physiognomy
and Eight Characters

881
00:42:32,479 --> 00:42:33,399
show it's two months.

882
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,520
Did Official Pei cheat?

883
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,520
Yeah.

884
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,360
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Yeah.

885
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,479
That is despicable!

886
00:42:38,879 --> 00:42:40,479
I request
another examination in the name

887
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:41,439
of my reputation!

888
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,360
Another examination!

889
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,040
Yes!

890
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:43,560
Master Song.

891
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:45,560
I took up too much of your time.

892
00:42:45,919 --> 00:42:47,040
I'm taking her with me.

893
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,679
She is my wife.

894
00:42:49,159 --> 00:42:49,719
Don't you dare!

895
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,360
That's enough!
