Move aside.

I won't.

You're full of surprises.

I won't repeat this.

33
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:21,867
Move aside.

34
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:23,946
Interesting.

35
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:25,787
I will play your game, then.

36
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:37,386
Young Master.

You shameless man.

00:02:42,306 --> 00:02:42,746
Stupid man.

41
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:43,627
We serve different masters.

42
00:02:43,627 --> 00:02:44,746
Just admit it if you're inferior to us.

43
00:02:44,746 --> 00:02:45,507
Don't swear.

44

You!

Don't fight.

Miao.

Please hear me out.

All of you, stop!

53
00:03:09,586 --> 00:03:10,386
Mother.

Miao.

55
00:03:13,946 --> 00:03:14,466
Miaomiao.

56
00:03:17,186 --> 00:03:17,987
You got hurt.

57
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:19,707
It was Great-uncle.

58
00:03:19,707 --> 00:03:21,267
He is the reason that Mother was hurt.

59
00:03:22,987 --> 00:03:23,826
Miaomiao, let's go.

60
00:03:24,106 --> 00:03:24,987
I will take you for treatment.

61
00:03:25,427 --> 00:03:25,907
Miao.

62
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:26,787
Don't go.

63
00:03:29,306 --> 00:03:29,946
Regent.

64
00:03:30,707 --> 00:03:32,627
Every time
Miaomiao got hurt because of you.

65
00:03:33,306 --> 00:03:34,787
How far are you

66
00:03:34,787 --> 00:03:35,627
going to push it?

67
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:36,666
Official Song.

68
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:37,907
Please don't say that.

69
00:03:38,147 --> 00:03:39,707
Hadn't you hidden Madam in this place,

70
00:03:39,826 --> 00:03:41,106
His Highness wouldn't have been
seriously injured.

71
00:03:41,386 --> 00:03:43,026
If he hadn't forced Miaomiao and Xiao,

72
00:03:43,147 --> 00:03:45,147
they would have settled
in Weiyang peacefully.

73
00:03:45,867 --> 00:03:46,427
Your Highness.

74
00:03:46,987 --> 00:03:48,147
One's mind is vulnerable.

75
00:03:48,147 --> 00:03:50,347
You can't manipulate Miaomiao
with dirty tricks.

76
00:03:50,586 --> 00:03:51,867
Miaomiao is a human.

77
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,867
I couldn't care less about

78
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:54,987
how sincerely you've treated her before.

79
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:57,147
She's the only daughter
of the Shen family

80
00:03:57,386 --> 00:03:59,267
who used to lead a glorious life
in Lingzhou.

81
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:01,306
Yet because of you,

82
00:04:01,546 --> 00:04:02,427
she couldn't return to her home

83
00:04:02,707 --> 00:04:03,627
to gather with her family.

84
00:04:03,987 --> 00:04:05,907
You should've been aware of her awkward
situation if you had a conscience.

85
00:04:06,347 --> 00:04:07,907
Quit pestering her.

86
00:04:08,746 --> 00:04:09,227
Miao.

87
00:04:09,546 --> 00:04:11,907
By now, you should know
that I truly love you.

88
00:04:11,907 --> 00:04:12,586
Enough!

89
00:04:15,466 --> 00:04:16,107
Miao.

90
00:04:18,107 --> 00:04:19,507
I know you love me.

91
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:21,907
No matter what happened
to us before,

92
00:04:22,186 --> 00:04:22,986
I will give you my word today.

93
00:04:24,026 --> 00:04:24,627
From now on,

94
00:04:24,947 --> 00:04:25,627
between Shen Miao and the nation,

95
00:04:25,627 --> 00:04:27,107
I choose Shen Miao over the latter.

96
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:29,186
Miao.

97
00:04:30,306 --> 00:04:31,827
Please give me another chance.

98
00:04:42,507 --> 00:04:43,866
It's true that both of us

99
00:04:45,146 --> 00:04:45,667
had fallen in love.

100
00:04:47,947 --> 00:04:48,667
However, I suppose

101
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:50,347
I'm the hateful one to you.

102
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:52,667
Otherwise,

103
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,266
you wouldn't have treated me

104
00:04:56,387 --> 00:04:57,347
so cruelly.

105
00:04:57,866 --> 00:04:59,227
Shen Miao. Tell me.

106
00:04:59,746 --> 00:05:00,787
What has he done to you?

107
00:05:01,387 --> 00:05:02,787
You should let go of all grievances now

108
00:05:03,026 --> 00:05:04,227
even though he had once outfoxed you.

109
00:05:04,547 --> 00:05:06,667
He knows very well what he did.

110
00:05:07,986 --> 00:05:09,227
Miaomiao, let's leave.

111
00:05:10,026 --> 00:05:10,947
I will take you for treatment.

112
00:05:17,466 --> 00:05:18,026
Come here, Xiao.

113
00:05:18,426 --> 00:05:18,866
Let's go.

114
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,180
(Baima Temple)

115
00:06:09,146 --> 00:06:09,746
Master.

116
00:06:12,146 --> 00:06:12,586
Miaomiao.

117
00:06:12,787 --> 00:06:15,186
This is Master Guanshan of Baima Temple.

118
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,146
He just returned
from his journey yesterday.

119
00:06:17,466 --> 00:06:19,026
Hence, I asked for his help
to treat you.

120
00:06:19,986 --> 00:06:21,347
Master Guanshan is well-known
throughout the nation.

121
00:06:21,907 --> 00:06:23,146
I can't trouble him

122
00:06:23,347 --> 00:06:24,907
to treat my minor injuries.

123
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:28,547
Young lady, don't be courteous.

124
00:06:28,907 --> 00:06:32,347
Wangyun and I
have been friends for years.

125
00:06:32,627 --> 00:06:34,186
Hence, we're fated to meet.

126
00:06:34,507 --> 00:06:35,746
Master Song told me

127
00:06:36,026 --> 00:06:38,067
about your old injury two years ago.

128
00:06:38,627 --> 00:06:40,186
I shall treat all of them.

129
00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:44,466
I will accept your treatment, then.

130
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:46,347
This way, please.

131
00:06:47,426 --> 00:06:47,947
Let's go.

132
00:07:00,026 --> 00:07:00,586
Miss Lvying.

133
00:07:04,426 --> 00:07:05,067
What's wrong?

134
00:07:05,547 --> 00:07:07,507
Why sigh?

135
00:07:09,706 --> 00:07:11,866
I can't see through Miss's mind.

136
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,507
Why did she return to the mountain
to rescue His Highness

137
00:07:15,107 --> 00:07:17,627
when she was trying to avoid him?

138
00:07:19,347 --> 00:07:21,426
We could've run off.

139
00:07:21,426 --> 00:07:23,026
However, she chose to stay.

140
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:24,586
I have no idea either.

141
00:07:25,347 --> 00:07:25,947
I found

142
00:07:26,426 --> 00:07:28,146
that it's getting harder
to understand them.

143
00:07:29,347 --> 00:07:30,146
Lvying,

144
00:07:30,907 --> 00:07:32,107
I found this happening

145
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:32,907
to my master too.

146
00:07:33,146 --> 00:07:34,627
He becomes emotionally unstable

147
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:36,306
when he thinks of Miss Shen.

148
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:37,466
He's just beside himself.

149
00:07:38,347 --> 00:07:38,907
For sure?

150
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:40,227
Of course.

151
00:07:42,347 --> 00:07:43,026
Miss Lvying.

152
00:07:43,466 --> 00:07:44,186
Let me ask you this.

153
00:07:44,466 --> 00:07:45,907
If you were Miss Shen,

154
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:47,947
will you choose His Highness

155
00:07:48,107 --> 00:07:49,026
or my master?

156
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:54,586
His Highness is scheming

157
00:07:55,026 --> 00:07:55,667
and unreliable,

158
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:58,347
while Master Song likes goofing around

159
00:07:58,627 --> 00:07:59,306
and is undependable.

160
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:00,907
If I were to choose,

161
00:08:01,706 --> 00:08:03,827
I will choose someone
who treats me nicely

162
00:08:04,266 --> 00:08:05,387
and can make me happy.

163
00:08:06,387 --> 00:08:07,667
He must be a reliable man

164
00:08:07,907 --> 00:08:08,907
and good company to me.

165
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:09,787
Also...

166
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:16,266
Why do you ask me this suddenly?

167
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:18,667
I...

168
00:08:18,827 --> 00:08:19,266
I...

169
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:25,827
I never plan to get married

170
00:08:26,227 --> 00:08:27,266
or to have a baby.

171
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:29,347
I just want to stay beside my miss.

172
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:30,746
I won't consider the rest.

173
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:33,386
Lvying.

174
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,107
Never.

175
00:08:47,266 --> 00:08:47,747
What?

176
00:08:48,347 --> 00:08:50,307
You want Master Guanshan
to treat Pei Yanzhen's eyes?

177
00:08:51,307 --> 00:08:51,867
No way.

178
00:08:52,427 --> 00:08:53,026
I won't agree with this.

179
00:08:58,066 --> 00:08:59,146
He got injured yesterday

180
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:00,787
because of me.

181
00:09:01,547 --> 00:09:02,667
If he didn't go up the mountain,

182
00:09:02,987 --> 00:09:04,026
he wouldn't have got injured.

183
00:09:06,187 --> 00:09:06,787
Over these two years,

184
00:09:07,307 --> 00:09:08,826
I know he suffered a lot.

185
00:09:10,187 --> 00:09:11,307
I can't be at ease

186
00:09:11,626 --> 00:09:12,987
if I don't repay what I owed him.

187
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:14,386
Miaomiao.

188
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:17,547
Your excuse sounds farfetched though.

189
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:18,586
Besides,

190
00:09:19,386 --> 00:09:20,867
Master Guanshan is quite tied up.

191
00:09:20,867 --> 00:09:21,547
Am I right?

192
00:09:22,107 --> 00:09:24,787
You're referring to the Regent,
aren't you?

193
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,747
Master Wangyun has entrusted me

194
00:09:28,907 --> 00:09:30,026
to treat His Highness's eyes.

195
00:09:30,227 --> 00:09:31,586
The medicine I have is merely

196
00:09:31,747 --> 00:09:34,187
for the wounds on both of you.

197
00:09:34,506 --> 00:09:35,466
As for the sore point,

198
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,347
not even the elixir can be of help.

199
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:38,747
Before I leave,

200
00:09:39,187 --> 00:09:40,386
I have a message

201
00:09:40,987 --> 00:09:42,547
for you, Miss Shen.

202
00:09:44,706 --> 00:09:45,266
Thank you so much.

203
00:09:47,026 --> 00:09:47,626
I shall take my leave.

204
00:09:49,026 --> 00:09:49,747
Thank you.

205
00:09:55,826 --> 00:09:57,706
(Don't obsess with the truth)
Don't obsess with the truth.

206
00:09:59,747 --> 00:10:00,347
Look.

207
00:10:00,706 --> 00:10:04,107
Master warns you not to go near Zhen.
[*Zhen and truth sound alike.]

208
00:10:08,466 --> 00:10:09,107
Why?

209
00:10:09,706 --> 00:10:11,066
Aren't you heading back to the capital?

210
00:10:12,506 --> 00:10:13,506
Are you driving me away?

211
00:10:14,066 --> 00:10:14,706
No, I didn't.

212
00:10:15,867 --> 00:10:17,427
I want to ask you for a favor.

213
00:10:18,747 --> 00:10:20,826
Now my family is in Yanlan

214
00:10:21,386 --> 00:10:23,227
that the place is unstable.

215
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,066
I fear that they might
get involved in the war.

216
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:27,227
Could you please apply for a pass
on their behalf

217
00:10:27,747 --> 00:10:29,706
and send them back here

218
00:10:29,826 --> 00:10:30,987
after you return to the capital?

219
00:10:32,026 --> 00:10:32,706
Sure, of course.

220
00:10:33,146 --> 00:10:34,386
I will send men to get them back.

221
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:36,466
Thank you so much.

222
00:10:38,266 --> 00:10:40,386
After Pei Yanzhen recovers,

223
00:10:40,946 --> 00:10:42,227
I will go back with you

224
00:10:42,586 --> 00:10:43,586
to meet my family in the capital.

225
00:10:46,347 --> 00:10:46,867
Miaomiao.

226
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:49,466
Do you mean it?

227
00:10:50,706 --> 00:10:51,466
Aren't you

228
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:53,826
angry at me

229
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:55,427
that I've deceived you
for the past two years?

230
00:10:58,506 --> 00:10:59,227
Third Master Song.

231
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:01,386
I'm not a heartless person.

232
00:11:02,307 --> 00:11:04,347
I can feel your kindness to me

233
00:11:04,946 --> 00:11:05,987
in these two years.

234
00:11:05,987 --> 00:11:06,747
I know it in my heart.

235
00:11:09,026 --> 00:11:10,706
I can forgo everything

236
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:12,946
as long as you won't lie to me again.

237
00:11:13,427 --> 00:11:14,987
Our life will continue just like before.

238
00:11:15,747 --> 00:11:16,466
Miaomiao.

239
00:11:18,026 --> 00:11:18,626
Come on.

240
00:11:18,867 --> 00:11:20,826
I will go and see Xiao.

241
00:11:26,427 --> 00:11:28,626
Spring is coming

242
00:11:29,386 --> 00:11:30,867
in my favor.

243
00:11:40,107 --> 00:11:40,626
Your Highness.

244
00:11:41,427 --> 00:11:42,506
Your eyes.

245
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:44,347
Zhao.

246
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:48,747
I think

247
00:11:50,227 --> 00:11:51,427
I can see some blur shadows.

248
00:11:53,026 --> 00:11:53,506
Your Highness.

249
00:11:54,227 --> 00:11:55,427
The illness must be coming
from your heart.

250
00:11:55,427 --> 00:11:57,146
Shen Miao is your elixir.

251
00:11:57,146 --> 00:11:57,747
That's great.

252
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:01,826
Sadly, she determines to leave.

253
00:12:02,466 --> 00:12:03,466
I wanted to let her go

254
00:12:03,826 --> 00:12:04,826
after meeting her
in the mountain yesterday.

255
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:08,747
However, our reunion happened
before the Buddha.

256
00:12:10,506 --> 00:12:12,586
What should I do to make peace with her?

257
00:12:15,506 --> 00:12:16,307
In my opinion,

258
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:19,227
the biggest hindrance between you
is Song Xiyuan.

259
00:12:21,266 --> 00:12:21,907
Perhaps...

260
00:12:23,626 --> 00:12:24,107
Your Highness.

261
00:12:29,826 --> 00:12:30,347
Your Highness.

262
00:12:30,427 --> 00:12:32,187
My miss invites Master Guanshan over

263
00:12:32,187 --> 00:12:33,146
to treat your eyes.

264
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:35,626
Amitabha.

265
00:12:45,146 --> 00:12:48,427
The wounds on your head and the back

266
00:12:48,427 --> 00:12:49,386
have almost recovered.

267
00:12:50,586 --> 00:12:52,586
I will prescribe the medicine for you.

268
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:56,946
The feverish heat will be removed
and you will be recovered

269
00:12:57,146 --> 00:12:58,347
after taking the medicine
for a few days.

270
00:12:58,787 --> 00:13:00,187
As for your eyes,

271
00:13:00,427 --> 00:13:01,826
the poison residue has been eliminated

272
00:13:01,946 --> 00:13:03,347
during the previous treatment.

273
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:04,626
Your vision will resume

274
00:13:04,706 --> 00:13:06,547
in no time.

275
00:13:11,787 --> 00:13:12,386
Sir,

276
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:15,026
your eyes are healed?

277
00:13:16,386 --> 00:13:16,867
Master,

278
00:13:17,946 --> 00:13:19,107
I would like to ask for a favor.

279
00:13:20,107 --> 00:13:21,427
Regarding my eyes,

280
00:13:22,187 --> 00:13:24,427
please keep it a secret.

281
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:27,307
Because something

282
00:13:28,386 --> 00:13:31,026
can only be discerned by blind eyes.

283
00:13:34,187 --> 00:13:35,427
Amitabha.

284
00:13:37,307 --> 00:13:38,427
I've heard

285
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:40,787
that you're observant

286
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,347
and intelligent.

287
00:13:42,946 --> 00:13:43,787
My presumption is proved

288
00:13:44,266 --> 00:13:45,506
after I saw you yesterday.

289
00:13:46,586 --> 00:13:47,547
But

290
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:48,907
you

291
00:13:52,227 --> 00:13:53,026
need to know

292
00:13:54,307 --> 00:13:56,907
that beauty is merely void form.

293
00:13:59,026 --> 00:13:59,987
You've taken me wrong.

294
00:14:00,826 --> 00:14:01,466
I...

295
00:14:02,747 --> 00:14:03,867
I'm looking for a suitable chance

296
00:14:04,307 --> 00:14:05,506
to confess to Miao myself.

297
00:14:06,307 --> 00:14:07,227
Please don't take me wrong.

298
00:14:12,187 --> 00:14:14,307
If you said so,

299
00:14:15,026 --> 00:14:18,347
I will offer you a message

300
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,107
as the prescription

301
00:14:20,706 --> 00:14:21,987
to your sore point.

302
00:14:24,547 --> 00:14:27,187
Nip the vain hope.

303
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,347
Miss Lvying, what are you looking at?

304
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:40,146
I...

305
00:14:42,907 --> 00:14:43,547
Miss Lvying.

306
00:14:43,946 --> 00:14:45,386
I was cracking a joke
with you yesterday.

307
00:14:45,466 --> 00:14:46,506
Don't take it to heart.

308
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:48,586
My miss doesn't allow me
to talk to the airheads.

309
00:14:49,547 --> 00:14:51,107
But why did you talk so much
to Tie Niu?

310
00:14:51,867 --> 00:14:52,667
Who are you implying?

311
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,307
The one who's responding to me.

312
00:14:54,506 --> 00:14:56,266
You're so annoying.

313
00:14:56,266 --> 00:14:56,826
Agh!

314
00:14:57,946 --> 00:14:59,386
I'm just joking.

315
00:14:59,386 --> 00:15:00,787
I know what you came for. Take it back.

316
00:15:04,706 --> 00:15:05,307
Brat.

317
00:15:05,907 --> 00:15:07,826
Don't ignore me again.

318
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:09,386
Get it?

319
00:15:17,107 --> 00:15:17,907
I can't even find a bird feather

320
00:15:18,466 --> 00:15:19,787
in this shabby place.

321
00:15:20,307 --> 00:15:22,187
I'm going to hunt rabbits.

322
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,220
(Nip the vain hope)

323
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:42,026
Nip the vain hope.

324
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:01,427
Don't obsess with the truth.

325
00:16:11,066 --> 00:16:12,066
I'm not pursuing vain hope.

326
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:13,946
I will brave the storm

327
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:16,187
even though it will strike me to death.

328
00:16:21,187 --> 00:16:22,187
How could I not pursue the truth?

329
00:16:30,987 --> 00:16:31,547
Lvying.

330
00:16:31,787 --> 00:16:33,307
Bring Young Master to that carriage.

331
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:34,066
Sure.

332
00:16:34,307 --> 00:16:34,787
Go ahead.

333
00:16:36,107 --> 00:16:36,506
Miaomiao.

334
00:16:36,867 --> 00:16:37,307
Look at this.

335
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:38,907
I have prepared two carriages.

336
00:16:39,347 --> 00:16:40,626
We can reach the capital very soon

337
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,347
while enjoying the journey
on the way back.

338
00:16:43,547 --> 00:16:44,347
You're so considerate.

339
00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:46,667
But why there are two carriages?

340
00:16:47,547 --> 00:16:48,547
Let me tell you this.

341
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:50,026
Xiao is a grown-up now

342
00:16:50,026 --> 00:16:51,747
and he needs personal space.

343
00:16:52,706 --> 00:16:53,227
Master.

344
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:54,266
I think

345
00:16:54,386 --> 00:16:56,146
it's you who need a space
with Miss Shen.

346
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:01,706
How fortuitous.

347
00:17:02,026 --> 00:17:03,146
You're heading back too?

348
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:05,346
My master is summoned

349
00:17:05,506 --> 00:17:06,346
to return to the capital today.

350
00:17:07,386 --> 00:17:08,427
What are the odds, huh?

351
00:17:08,626 --> 00:17:09,827
My master is returning too.

352
00:17:10,467 --> 00:17:11,026
Oh, that's great.

353
00:17:11,146 --> 00:17:12,307
We can have companions
on the journey back.

354
00:17:12,307 --> 00:17:13,187
That's not so great.

355
00:17:13,547 --> 00:17:15,866
I can tell you chose today
on purpose.

356
00:17:17,067 --> 00:17:17,547
Your Highness.

357
00:17:18,547 --> 00:17:19,346
Master Guanshan advised you

358
00:17:19,346 --> 00:17:20,587
to keep yourself safe

359
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:21,947
as your lungs have been
plagued by injuries.

360
00:17:25,266 --> 00:17:26,386
Your sickness is serious.

361
00:17:27,187 --> 00:17:29,427
He's malingering.

362
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:30,866
If his sickness is that serious,

363
00:17:31,106 --> 00:17:32,787
why doesn't he stay here to recuperate?

364
00:17:34,106 --> 00:17:34,707
Miao.

365
00:17:35,146 --> 00:17:36,187
I know you're worried about me.

366
00:17:36,427 --> 00:17:37,307
However, I can't defy
the imperial decree.

367
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:38,827
I must be on my way today

368
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:41,547
no matter what.

369
00:17:44,866 --> 00:17:45,506
Miss Shen.

370
00:17:45,707 --> 00:17:47,187
Please allow us to travel with you.

371
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:48,067
I'm afraid

372
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,026
that His Highness
will feel sick on the way.

373
00:17:50,026 --> 00:17:51,547
It's better to
have extra pair of hands.

374
00:17:57,746 --> 00:17:58,346
Well.

375
00:17:58,907 --> 00:17:59,947
I will help him out.

376
00:18:00,307 --> 00:18:01,587
After all, he's Xiao's Great-uncle.

377
00:18:05,707 --> 00:18:06,146
Let's go.

378
00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:07,106
Come on.

379
00:18:11,067 --> 00:18:11,707
Miaomiao.

380
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:13,827
Obviously, this is showmanship.

381
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:14,146
Well.

382
00:18:14,146 --> 00:18:14,907
Look at me.

383
00:18:16,787 --> 00:18:17,346
Enough.

384
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:19,427
I know Pei Yanzhen always puts on a play

385
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,307
in a low-key manner

386
00:18:21,307 --> 00:18:22,467
to deceive others.

387
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:24,146
Somehow, he's exaggerating today.

388
00:18:24,547 --> 00:18:25,146
I guess

389
00:18:25,307 --> 00:18:26,667
it might be real.

390
00:18:28,547 --> 00:18:29,707
After all, we are friends.

391
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,307
It's better to show him some kindness.

392
00:18:35,026 --> 00:18:35,427
Careful.

393
00:18:35,427 --> 00:18:35,907
Miss.

394
00:18:44,427 --> 00:18:45,226
Your Majesty.

395
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:47,146
I heard that Zhan Yue is heading back.

396
00:18:47,146 --> 00:18:47,787
Right?

397
00:18:50,626 --> 00:18:51,467
He's not in again.

398
00:18:52,146 --> 00:18:53,707
Why am I always trapped in the palace

399
00:18:54,626 --> 00:18:55,787
but he can go anywhere he wants?

400
00:19:06,307 --> 00:19:07,307
Pei Yanzhen?

401
00:19:10,427 --> 00:19:11,547
He's coming back.

402
00:19:11,787 --> 00:19:12,547
That's great.

403
00:19:17,427 --> 00:19:18,626
Ninth Princess.

404
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,900
(Your Majesty,
I'm the Prince of Yanlan.)

405
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,580
(I would like to marry your sister,
Ninth Princess. Please grant my wish.)

406
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:54,680
Miaomiao.

407
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,320
(Morality)

408
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,587
Please heed my advice.

409
00:19:57,506 --> 00:19:58,907
Pei Yanzhen

410
00:19:59,146 --> 00:20:01,187
is a smooth-talker and he's cunning.

411
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,146
Don't believe in him.

412
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,667
There's only responsibility between us.

413
00:20:11,187 --> 00:20:12,427
It's not a love relationship.

414
00:20:13,307 --> 00:20:15,026
Don't make so much noise.

415
00:20:15,067 --> 00:20:17,467
I'm not saying that you
will rekindle the old flame.

416
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:19,026
It's just a reminder.

417
00:20:29,707 --> 00:20:30,266
Miaomiao.

418
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:31,827
Do you want to play chess?

419
00:20:37,226 --> 00:20:38,346
Or do you fancy a story?

420
00:20:38,787 --> 00:20:39,947
I've learnt a new song lately.

421
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,067
Let me sing for you.

422
00:21:03,187 --> 00:21:03,667
Master.

423
00:21:04,707 --> 00:21:05,907
Can I ask you one question?

424
00:21:06,787 --> 00:21:07,787
How does it feel

425
00:21:08,986 --> 00:21:10,667
when you fall in love with someone

426
00:21:11,787 --> 00:21:12,707
who doesn't like you?

427
00:21:13,587 --> 00:21:14,866
Don't be sarcastic.

428
00:21:15,947 --> 00:21:16,707
But that person

429
00:21:17,427 --> 00:21:18,386
seems to have fallen for

430
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:20,187
someone who has no edge over you.

431
00:21:22,067 --> 00:21:23,067
How do you feel?

432
00:21:24,707 --> 00:21:25,226
Tie Niu.

433
00:21:25,547 --> 00:21:26,506
Are you done?

434
00:21:27,707 --> 00:21:28,307
Is this

435
00:21:29,787 --> 00:21:31,307
the agony of love?

436
00:21:48,787 --> 00:21:49,467
No.

437
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:50,707
Tie Niu.

438
00:21:51,106 --> 00:21:52,986
We must join hands

439
00:21:53,587 --> 00:21:55,547
to get rid of Devious Pei

440
00:21:56,067 --> 00:21:57,067
and Lackey Zhao

441
00:21:57,506 --> 00:21:59,787
before we reach the capital.

442
00:22:23,106 --> 00:22:24,626
Ah, we're in the middle of nowhere.

443
00:22:27,026 --> 00:22:27,506
Miaomiao.

444
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,587
You may not get used to the food here.

445
00:22:29,746 --> 00:22:31,346
So, I have prepared you some desserts.

446
00:22:31,506 --> 00:22:32,106
Have a taste.

447
00:22:38,266 --> 00:22:39,427
Unlike someone

448
00:22:39,707 --> 00:22:41,266
who only enjoys all the pleasure himself

449
00:22:41,746 --> 00:22:43,307
even though he claimed

450
00:22:44,187 --> 00:22:46,787
that he chose you over the nation.

451
00:22:47,026 --> 00:22:47,707
I tell you what,

452
00:22:47,707 --> 00:22:48,866
it's a mere idle promise.

453
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:51,866
Why do you sound like

454
00:22:52,266 --> 00:22:53,266
you're blaming Pei Yanzhen

455
00:22:53,266 --> 00:22:54,746
for not preparing desserts for you?

456
00:22:55,386 --> 00:22:56,587
Miaomiao, actually...

457
00:23:03,986 --> 00:23:04,467
Tie Niu.

458
00:23:04,827 --> 00:23:05,626
Let's go take a stroll.

459
00:23:06,307 --> 00:23:06,746
Sure.

460
00:23:09,106 --> 00:23:10,226
Finish them.

461
00:23:26,587 --> 00:23:27,106
Lvying.

462
00:23:28,787 --> 00:23:30,667
I wanted to ask you something.

463
00:23:32,226 --> 00:23:34,947
How did Pei Yanzhen hurt his eyes?

464
00:23:38,986 --> 00:23:40,707
Upon knowing your 'death',

465
00:23:41,506 --> 00:23:42,346
His Highness refused to eat or sleep.

466
00:23:43,067 --> 00:23:45,587
He even stopped others
from solving the poison by Qin Miuzhen.

467
00:23:46,026 --> 00:23:47,827
He missed out
on the golden hour for treatment.

468
00:23:48,587 --> 00:23:49,506
Therefore,
the heart meridian was blocked

469
00:23:49,866 --> 00:23:50,787
and the other meridians were damaged.

470
00:23:52,787 --> 00:23:53,866
Afterwards, Young Master fell sick.

471
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:55,626
His Highness then decided
to get back on his feet

472
00:23:55,986 --> 00:23:57,106
as he was worried
about Young Master.

473
00:23:58,307 --> 00:23:58,947
But...

474
00:24:00,866 --> 00:24:01,626
Your Highness.

475
00:24:02,746 --> 00:24:04,787
Your eyes were poisoned

476
00:24:05,307 --> 00:24:07,787
and there is no cure for it.

477
00:24:08,386 --> 00:24:09,427
Your vision can't be resumed.

478
00:24:10,427 --> 00:24:10,866
It's impossible.

479
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:12,667
Don't you dare say that again!

480
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:13,587
Official Zhan.

481
00:24:13,587 --> 00:24:14,106
Zhan Yue.

482
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:15,746
Eunuch Xiuye is here.

483
00:24:16,026 --> 00:24:16,707
Don't act rashly.

484
00:24:18,146 --> 00:24:20,067
Afterwards, the news of you

485
00:24:20,067 --> 00:24:21,386
leaving the scrimshaw deer
to His Highness

486
00:24:22,067 --> 00:24:24,067
got out.

487
00:24:25,746 --> 00:24:26,587
In these two years,

488
00:24:27,226 --> 00:24:28,667
the foes from the imperial court

489
00:24:28,986 --> 00:24:31,467
and thugs who coveted the fortune
of the Lu family

490
00:24:31,947 --> 00:24:33,346
kept on turning up

491
00:24:33,866 --> 00:24:34,947
and made waves in the residence.

492
00:24:35,506 --> 00:24:37,427
His Highness and Young Master
were almost killed for several times.

493
00:24:38,026 --> 00:24:38,907
It was a tough time.

494
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:42,707
His Highness
can't leave the imperial court

495
00:24:43,626 --> 00:24:44,787
as he wants to protect Young Master.

496
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:49,146
Miss.

497
00:24:51,307 --> 00:24:52,667
Life is tough.

498
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:55,346
Lvying.

499
00:24:56,266 --> 00:24:57,667
I didn't expect that from you though.

500
00:25:04,307 --> 00:25:04,787
By the way.

501
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:09,307
You are close to Constable Zhao.

502
00:25:10,187 --> 00:25:11,026
I'm curious

503
00:25:11,587 --> 00:25:14,026
if there's something between you two
when I wasn't around.

504
00:25:18,587 --> 00:25:19,626
I used to think

505
00:25:20,026 --> 00:25:21,547
that Official Zhao liked fooling around

506
00:25:21,907 --> 00:25:22,986
and he was a smooth talker.

507
00:25:23,587 --> 00:25:25,907
But now I realize

508
00:25:26,866 --> 00:25:28,307
that he's a sincere

509
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:30,187
and bright man.

510
00:25:31,827 --> 00:25:32,787
Judging by that tone,

511
00:25:33,346 --> 00:25:35,427
I guess I will hear good news from you
in no time.

512
00:25:36,947 --> 00:25:40,787
However, I find Tie Niu
to be honest and cute.

513
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:42,307
He's considerate despite his clumsiness.

514
00:25:43,467 --> 00:25:45,427
I like him too.

515
00:25:49,866 --> 00:25:50,506
Miss.

516
00:25:51,307 --> 00:25:54,787
Perhaps men possess many sides.

517
00:25:55,226 --> 00:25:57,787
Just like Tie Niu,
he's clumsy but considerate.

518
00:25:58,266 --> 00:26:01,067
Official Zhao
is a sincere smooth talker.

519
00:26:03,346 --> 00:26:04,187
And His Highness.

520
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:06,307
He has plunged you into trouble,

521
00:26:07,026 --> 00:26:07,866
but perhaps

522
00:26:08,947 --> 00:26:10,307
his feeling for you is genuine as well.

523
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:28,707
Great-uncle.

524
00:26:32,307 --> 00:26:33,026
Great-uncle.

525
00:26:33,026 --> 00:26:34,346
Mother gives this to you.

526
00:26:35,947 --> 00:26:36,986
Thank her for me.

527
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:19,420
(Rooster Crows Relay Station)

528
00:27:19,467 --> 00:27:19,986
Lvying.

529
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:21,506
Wake Xiao up.

530
00:27:21,626 --> 00:27:22,266
- We've arrived.
- Miss.

531
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:23,187
Xiao is sleeping.

532
00:27:23,187 --> 00:27:24,346
Why don't you go in first?

533
00:27:24,746 --> 00:27:25,667
- All right?
- Try to wake him up.

534
00:27:26,787 --> 00:27:27,506
Give me a second.

535
00:27:27,506 --> 00:27:28,346
You may go in first.

536
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:29,106
Sure.

537
00:27:40,667 --> 00:27:41,626
How come

538
00:27:41,947 --> 00:27:42,947
no one is around

539
00:27:43,427 --> 00:27:45,146
to take care of you?

540
00:27:47,307 --> 00:27:49,226
Zhan Yue and Constable Zhao
aren't the considerate type.

541
00:27:49,866 --> 00:27:50,907
I've gotten used to

542
00:27:51,986 --> 00:27:52,986
walking without their help.

543
00:27:55,427 --> 00:27:56,547
You never change.

544
00:27:57,026 --> 00:27:58,866
You never take care of yourself
when you're tied up with work.

545
00:27:59,707 --> 00:28:01,427
I wonder if Xiao has learnt

546
00:28:01,626 --> 00:28:03,067
this bad habit from you.

547
00:28:06,506 --> 00:28:06,986
Well.

548
00:28:07,266 --> 00:28:08,106
I will take you in first.

549
00:28:08,947 --> 00:28:09,467
Thank you.

550
00:28:09,986 --> 00:28:10,547
Careful.

551
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:17,467
This box is so heavy.

552
00:28:21,787 --> 00:28:23,866
When did His Highness lose the ability
to walk by himself?

553
00:28:24,106 --> 00:28:26,026
He seems perfectly fine

554
00:28:26,866 --> 00:28:27,947
when he kills with the sword.

555
00:28:30,067 --> 00:28:30,947
He's really something.

556
00:28:31,187 --> 00:28:32,707
He shows his weakness
to win her heart in return.

557
00:28:32,707 --> 00:28:34,026
As expected of His Highness.

558
00:28:34,707 --> 00:28:37,146
He has such a grip on Miss Shen.

559
00:28:37,226 --> 00:28:37,947
Impressive.

560
00:28:38,866 --> 00:28:41,187
How many rooms do you have
in this relay station?

561
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:43,506
Official Song.

562
00:28:43,866 --> 00:28:44,787
The relay station isn't big.

563
00:28:44,907 --> 00:28:46,587
There are two levels
and a courtyard at the centre.

564
00:28:47,266 --> 00:28:48,427
Truth be told,

565
00:28:48,707 --> 00:28:49,386
some of the rooms

566
00:28:49,587 --> 00:28:50,866
on the second floor leak.

567
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,467
Naturally, we will assign
important officials like you

568
00:28:52,626 --> 00:28:53,907
to rooms in the courtyard.

569
00:28:54,226 --> 00:28:55,587
Your room is the Second Suite.

570
00:28:56,506 --> 00:28:57,266
Sounds marvelous.

571
00:28:58,187 --> 00:29:00,667
Please assign me and that young lady

572
00:29:00,707 --> 00:29:01,827
to the rooms at the courtyard.

573
00:29:01,986 --> 00:29:02,746
The closer the better.

574
00:29:03,787 --> 00:29:04,707
But

575
00:29:04,707 --> 00:29:06,346
there is only the First Suite left.

576
00:29:06,547 --> 00:29:08,467
Put her in the First Suite then.

577
00:29:10,067 --> 00:29:12,547
That room is specially prepared
for His Highness.

578
00:29:18,787 --> 00:29:20,067
Official Song, you...

579
00:29:21,106 --> 00:29:21,626
Official Song.

580
00:29:21,907 --> 00:29:23,667
I will never have the audacity

581
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:25,067
to make fool of His Highness.

582
00:29:26,346 --> 00:29:28,026
No, you're not.

583
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:28,707
Then...

584
00:29:28,707 --> 00:29:29,506
Listen.

585
00:29:29,746 --> 00:29:31,467
I'm doing this for your own good.

586
00:29:31,947 --> 00:29:34,386
His Highness originates
from the water town, Jiangnan.

587
00:29:34,626 --> 00:29:36,106
He prefers a damp place.

588
00:29:36,106 --> 00:29:38,026
It's better if the roof leaks.

589
00:29:38,386 --> 00:29:38,907
Not only that,

590
00:29:39,787 --> 00:29:41,346
His Highness represents the reign.

591
00:29:41,787 --> 00:29:43,467
Someone who holds a lofty status

592
00:29:43,467 --> 00:29:45,467
should dwell in a higher place.

593
00:29:45,787 --> 00:29:47,506
He will blame you

594
00:29:47,707 --> 00:29:49,707
if you assign him a room
on the ground floor.

595
00:29:50,907 --> 00:29:51,986
Oh, really?

596
00:29:53,226 --> 00:29:55,146
We've been in
the imperial court for years.

597
00:29:55,386 --> 00:29:56,386
I know him like the back of my hand.

598
00:29:58,026 --> 00:29:59,146
Thank you for your advice,
Official Song.

599
00:29:59,587 --> 00:30:00,827
I will arrange the rooms

600
00:30:01,106 --> 00:30:01,787
and meal right now.

601
00:30:06,146 --> 00:30:07,026
Thank you, Official Song.

602
00:30:11,827 --> 00:30:12,547
Mind the step.

603
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:13,067
Sure.

604
00:30:15,427 --> 00:30:16,026
Miaomiao.

605
00:30:16,386 --> 00:30:17,467
Don't stay close to him.

606
00:30:18,427 --> 00:30:19,506
He can't walk by himself

607
00:30:19,506 --> 00:30:20,547
and no one is around him.

608
00:30:20,547 --> 00:30:21,626
So, I must help him out.

609
00:30:24,106 --> 00:30:24,547
Fine.

610
00:30:24,947 --> 00:30:26,226
Don't worry.

611
00:30:26,346 --> 00:30:27,187
I will

612
00:30:27,547 --> 00:30:28,787
take good care of him.

613
00:30:29,146 --> 00:30:29,587
Your Highness.

614
00:30:29,707 --> 00:30:30,386
I will help you.

615
00:30:34,907 --> 00:30:36,827
Oh, Pei Yanzhen.

616
00:30:37,506 --> 00:30:39,626
Never think that I don't discern
your devious tricks.

617
00:30:40,307 --> 00:30:41,787
You manipulated Miaomiao's kindness.

618
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:43,266
How mean.

619
00:30:44,346 --> 00:30:45,386
You are not

620
00:30:45,787 --> 00:30:47,067
better than me.

621
00:30:47,787 --> 00:30:49,427
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

622
00:30:52,427 --> 00:30:54,226
Ever since my eyes have gone blind,

623
00:30:54,787 --> 00:30:55,866
my hearing has improved.

624
00:30:56,026 --> 00:30:58,707
As for your conversation
with the official,

625
00:30:58,707 --> 00:31:00,467
I heard it loud and clear.

626
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:02,667
So?

627
00:31:03,307 --> 00:31:04,746
Do you think Miaomiao will trust you?

628
00:31:09,106 --> 00:31:09,746
What has happened?

629
00:31:11,547 --> 00:31:11,907
Come.

630
00:31:12,266 --> 00:31:13,226
What happened, Third Master Song?

631
00:31:13,307 --> 00:31:13,746
I'm fine.

632
00:31:14,386 --> 00:31:16,587
I had a squabble with him just now.

633
00:31:17,026 --> 00:31:18,307
I know he didn't mean it.

634
00:31:18,787 --> 00:31:19,386
Third Master Song.

635
00:31:19,626 --> 00:31:20,626
He is now visually impaired.

636
00:31:20,626 --> 00:31:21,626
How could you do that to him?

637
00:31:23,026 --> 00:31:23,986
How mean of you.

638
00:31:25,787 --> 00:31:26,307
Tie Niu.

639
00:31:26,307 --> 00:31:27,146
Let me help you.

640
00:31:27,626 --> 00:31:28,467
I can handle this.

641
00:31:29,707 --> 00:31:31,146
Gosh, this box is so heavy.

642
00:31:31,626 --> 00:31:33,146
Can anyone please give me a hand?

643
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:33,787
You can put it above my box.

644
00:31:33,787 --> 00:31:34,547
We can carry the boxes together.

645
00:31:34,547 --> 00:31:34,947
Tie Niu.

646
00:31:40,986 --> 00:31:41,587
Oh, my hip.

647
00:31:42,386 --> 00:31:43,787
Gosh, I've grown older. I'm so useless.

648
00:31:44,146 --> 00:31:45,467
His Highness will dismiss
someone useless like you

649
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:47,026
sooner or later.

650
00:31:47,266 --> 00:31:47,787
Let's go, Tie Niu.

651
00:31:47,787 --> 00:31:48,226
Hey.

652
00:31:48,547 --> 00:31:48,787
Lvying.

653
00:31:48,787 --> 00:31:49,506
Let's go, Xiao.

654
00:31:49,506 --> 00:31:50,226
Look, my hip is in pain.

655
00:31:50,226 --> 00:31:51,547
You need some exercise.

656
00:31:55,026 --> 00:31:56,907
How come this trick doesn't work out?

657
00:31:57,187 --> 00:31:58,106
Please don't learn such a doggy trick

658
00:31:58,346 --> 00:31:59,506
from Pei Yanzhen.

659
00:32:00,787 --> 00:32:01,386
Why?

660
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:02,307
Why can't I learn this

661
00:32:02,307 --> 00:32:03,427
from His Highness?

662
00:32:04,307 --> 00:32:04,947
Third Master.

663
00:32:05,907 --> 00:32:07,026
Forgive me

664
00:32:07,866 --> 00:32:09,307
for causing trouble to Miao and you.

665
00:32:11,187 --> 00:32:11,746
Miao.

666
00:32:12,626 --> 00:32:14,226
Just now, Third Master told me

667
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:15,986
that my room is on the second floor.

668
00:32:17,026 --> 00:32:18,266
Please take me there.

669
00:32:18,547 --> 00:32:19,106
Hold on.

670
00:32:20,386 --> 00:32:20,907
Third Master Song.

671
00:32:21,067 --> 00:32:21,907
Where is my room?

672
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:24,386
The First Suite in the courtyard.

673
00:32:24,467 --> 00:32:25,266
Mine is the Second Suite.

674
00:32:26,587 --> 00:32:27,947
It's inconvenient for him
to walk up the stairs.

675
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:28,787
You stay on the second floor.

676
00:32:28,787 --> 00:32:29,827
You stay in the First Suite.

677
00:32:30,266 --> 00:32:30,707
Let's go.

678
00:32:39,746 --> 00:32:41,427
How cunning of you, Pei Yanzhen.

679
00:32:42,587 --> 00:32:43,106
Master.

680
00:32:43,266 --> 00:32:43,986
Where's my room?

681
00:32:44,827 --> 00:32:45,386
Third Master.

682
00:32:45,746 --> 00:32:46,866
Where's our room?

683
00:32:46,866 --> 00:32:47,787
Who cares!

684
00:32:48,547 --> 00:32:49,106
Get out of my sight.

685
00:32:50,187 --> 00:32:50,866
Look at his bad temper.

686
00:32:51,506 --> 00:32:53,106
He needs some chrysanthemum tea.

687
00:33:04,467 --> 00:33:05,866
Don't obsess with the truth.

688
00:33:07,947 --> 00:33:09,746
Don't obsess with the truth.

689
00:33:13,506 --> 00:33:14,146
Miaomiao.

690
00:33:19,947 --> 00:33:21,187
What brings you here at this hour?

691
00:33:21,187 --> 00:33:22,067
You're still up.

692
00:33:22,307 --> 00:33:23,026
Come on.

693
00:33:24,106 --> 00:33:25,026
What are you doing?

694
00:33:26,427 --> 00:33:27,947
Come on. Have a seat.

695
00:33:31,106 --> 00:33:31,986
I tell you what.

696
00:33:32,226 --> 00:33:34,187
Lvying has put Xiao to bed.

697
00:33:34,386 --> 00:33:35,346
It's rare to have leisure time at night.

698
00:33:35,746 --> 00:33:38,026
Don't you fancy a snifter?

699
00:33:39,787 --> 00:33:40,986
Com on. Take a sip.

700
00:33:41,746 --> 00:33:42,506
Come on.

701
00:33:46,307 --> 00:33:46,667
Here.

702
00:33:47,266 --> 00:33:48,266
Take a sip.

703
00:33:49,346 --> 00:33:49,827
Miao.

704
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:51,746
Can I come in?

705
00:33:52,827 --> 00:33:53,667
Why is he here?

706
00:33:54,547 --> 00:33:55,307
No idea.

707
00:33:55,626 --> 00:33:57,346
Perhaps he comes
with something important to tell.

708
00:33:58,506 --> 00:33:59,067
Wait.

709
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:00,827
It's late at night.

710
00:34:00,827 --> 00:34:01,827
Why does he choose to come

711
00:34:01,986 --> 00:34:03,026
to a young lady's room

712
00:34:03,026 --> 00:34:04,106
at this hour?

713
00:34:04,187 --> 00:34:05,707
He must have harbored
an evil intention.

714
00:34:05,947 --> 00:34:06,907
People will suspect you two

715
00:34:06,907 --> 00:34:08,507
if they see you together at night.

716
00:34:09,546 --> 00:34:10,346
Rightfully so.

717
00:34:10,586 --> 00:34:12,786
If people see us being in the same room

718
00:34:12,786 --> 00:34:13,346
at this hour...

719
00:34:13,346 --> 00:34:14,227
No, it's different.

720
00:34:14,507 --> 00:34:16,507
We're a lovely couple.

721
00:34:16,826 --> 00:34:17,947
We're not afraid of gossip.

722
00:34:21,386 --> 00:34:22,386
He's blind, anyway.

723
00:34:26,866 --> 00:34:27,947
Who allows you to come in?

724
00:34:28,826 --> 00:34:29,826
You're here too, Master Song.

725
00:34:30,306 --> 00:34:31,346
I'm worried that Miao
didn't take enough food

726
00:34:31,707 --> 00:34:32,306
during the journey.

727
00:34:32,546 --> 00:34:33,267
So, I cooked her noodles.

728
00:34:33,786 --> 00:34:34,786
I should've cooked more

729
00:34:35,346 --> 00:34:36,546
for you, Master Song.

730
00:34:37,987 --> 00:34:38,786
Do you think

731
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:40,826
I want to eat the noodles you made?

732
00:34:41,187 --> 00:34:43,267
I have brought some dishes
for Miaomiao.

733
00:34:43,346 --> 00:34:44,947
Yours is just a petty one.

734
00:34:47,707 --> 00:34:49,747
How come I don't smell the dishes here?

735
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:51,267
In that case,

736
00:34:51,826 --> 00:34:52,747
I shall not interrupt you.

737
00:34:53,346 --> 00:34:53,987
Hold on.

738
00:34:54,707 --> 00:34:55,707
Since you've come,

739
00:34:55,947 --> 00:34:56,707
just join us.

740
00:34:56,707 --> 00:34:57,626
No way.

741
00:34:58,507 --> 00:34:58,987
Miao.

742
00:34:59,586 --> 00:35:00,626
I can tell Master Song
doesn't want me to be here.

743
00:35:01,346 --> 00:35:02,826
I better leave.

744
00:35:02,826 --> 00:35:03,866
It's good that you notice this.

745
00:35:04,106 --> 00:35:04,586
Wait.

746
00:35:12,786 --> 00:35:13,386
Third Master Song.

747
00:35:13,586 --> 00:35:14,866
Don't bully Pei Yanzhen.

748
00:35:14,866 --> 00:35:15,386
Did I?

749
00:35:15,386 --> 00:35:16,267
Eat the noodles and shut up.

750
00:35:18,346 --> 00:35:19,066
Don't be afraid of him.

751
00:35:19,586 --> 00:35:20,106
I'm here.

752
00:35:20,546 --> 00:35:21,467
No one can bully you.

753
00:35:23,386 --> 00:35:24,146
I will send you back to your room.

754
00:35:28,346 --> 00:35:29,066
Be careful.

755
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:43,187
Come.

756
00:35:48,866 --> 00:35:49,987
Take a seat here.

757
00:35:50,306 --> 00:35:51,866
I will get Zhan Yue to serve you.

758
00:35:56,987 --> 00:35:57,586
Are you all right?

759
00:35:59,386 --> 00:36:00,146
Are you still not

760
00:36:00,146 --> 00:36:01,507
used to your blindness?

761
00:36:01,907 --> 00:36:02,507
I'm fine.

762
00:36:02,866 --> 00:36:04,267
Probably I'm disoriented

763
00:36:04,427 --> 00:36:05,346
due to the injury on my head.

764
00:36:06,427 --> 00:36:07,586
I will change
the wound dressing for you.

765
00:36:07,586 --> 00:36:08,306
Where's the medicine?

766
00:36:09,187 --> 00:36:09,826
Over here.

767
00:36:15,187 --> 00:36:15,786
This is weird.

768
00:36:16,306 --> 00:36:17,507
How come you know that?

769
00:36:20,467 --> 00:36:21,427
Before this,

770
00:36:22,027 --> 00:36:22,907
I got tripped up there.

771
00:36:23,187 --> 00:36:24,187
So, I remember the place.

772
00:36:27,146 --> 00:36:27,546
Come.

773
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:28,747
Mind the step.

774
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:35,826
Sit down.

775
00:37:15,227 --> 00:37:16,146
It's scary, isn't it?

776
00:37:18,546 --> 00:37:19,027
No.

777
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:23,907
I didn't know it was a deep wound.

778
00:37:24,507 --> 00:37:26,546
Hopefully, it won't leave scars.

779
00:37:27,027 --> 00:37:28,346
Miao, you care about me, don't you?

780
00:37:30,866 --> 00:37:31,866
Don't take me wrong.

781
00:37:32,987 --> 00:37:34,546
For everything you've done for me,

782
00:37:35,027 --> 00:37:36,546
- I feel...
- You feel grateful to me.

783
00:37:37,027 --> 00:37:37,786
I know.

784
00:37:38,987 --> 00:37:39,546
Yes, you're right.

785
00:37:50,707 --> 00:37:51,826
Is it hurt?

786
00:37:52,306 --> 00:37:52,907
It's fine.

787
00:37:54,306 --> 00:37:55,027
Miao.

788
00:37:55,947 --> 00:37:58,146
The wound on my head is caused by you.

789
00:38:00,427 --> 00:38:02,306
As you know,

790
00:38:03,386 --> 00:38:05,306
I have cooped up
in the residence these years

791
00:38:06,306 --> 00:38:07,667
as I don't want to expose my blindness.

792
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,386
No one in the capital knew
that I had a problem with my eyes.

793
00:38:12,227 --> 00:38:15,947
But now I'm clueless about
what I should do with all the injuries

794
00:38:16,947 --> 00:38:19,826
when I return to the capital.

795
00:38:24,507 --> 00:38:26,987
You still have Zhan Yue and the rest.

796
00:38:28,826 --> 00:38:29,507
As the saying goes,

797
00:38:29,947 --> 00:38:31,987
"Even a filial child will be tired
of looking after a bedridden parent."

798
00:38:32,907 --> 00:38:33,507
I know Zhan Yue

799
00:38:35,427 --> 00:38:36,747
wanted to leave me.

800
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,160
(Rooster Crows Relay Station)

801
00:38:41,747 --> 00:38:42,507
I got a cold.

802
00:38:44,866 --> 00:38:46,027
Seriously?

803
00:38:47,066 --> 00:38:48,987
Well, there's more saddening news.

804
00:38:50,306 --> 00:38:51,826
Both Zhan Yue and Constable Zhao

805
00:38:52,267 --> 00:38:53,586
have already gotten sick of me.

806
00:38:54,027 --> 00:38:56,267
I sense that
from trivial things in life.

807
00:38:56,747 --> 00:38:57,586
Whenever I think of this,

808
00:38:57,586 --> 00:38:58,386
my heart...

809
00:38:58,507 --> 00:38:59,146
No worries.

810
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:01,586
You're the Regent

811
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:03,626
and they've been by your side for years.

812
00:39:03,626 --> 00:39:04,306
The bond between you is deep.

813
00:39:05,146 --> 00:39:06,826
Perhaps they just complain a bit.

814
00:39:06,826 --> 00:39:08,106
They won't leave you.

815
00:39:08,106 --> 00:39:08,826
What about you?

816
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:11,987
Me?

817
00:39:13,747 --> 00:39:14,306
Are you

818
00:39:15,146 --> 00:39:16,507
taking Xiao away

819
00:39:17,467 --> 00:39:18,987
and never seeing me again?

820
00:39:28,027 --> 00:39:29,306
After I return to the capital,

821
00:39:30,987 --> 00:39:32,747
I will be with my family.

822
00:39:33,987 --> 00:39:34,826
As for the rest,

823
00:39:36,427 --> 00:39:37,866
I haven't thought about it.

824
00:39:45,667 --> 00:39:46,187
Miao.

825
00:39:46,386 --> 00:39:46,866
Here.

826
00:39:47,626 --> 00:39:48,346
Open this.

827
00:39:48,947 --> 00:39:49,386
Now.

828
00:40:00,866 --> 00:40:01,586
Two years ago,

829
00:40:02,106 --> 00:40:02,707
I found the exact address

830
00:40:02,707 --> 00:40:04,866
of Master Shen at Yanlan.

831
00:40:06,106 --> 00:40:06,826
However...

832
00:40:08,586 --> 00:40:09,386
However, misunderstandings ran deep

833
00:40:09,386 --> 00:40:10,227
between us.

834
00:40:11,306 --> 00:40:13,546
So, I sent men
to protect your family in secret.

835
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,860
(To the Regent, Pei Yanzhen)

836
00:40:16,907 --> 00:40:19,346
This is the information collected
from Yanlan over the two years.

837
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:21,586
And this portrait

838
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:23,386
was drawn recently.

839
00:40:24,027 --> 00:40:24,586
Take a look.

840
00:40:37,626 --> 00:40:39,187
Zai has all grown up.

841
00:40:40,987 --> 00:40:41,747
I wonder

842
00:40:42,626 --> 00:40:44,427
if he still remembers me.

843
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,586
Previously, I wanted
to get your family back.

844
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:51,707
But I had no idea how to confess

845
00:40:53,507 --> 00:40:55,227
your death to your parents.

846
00:40:55,826 --> 00:40:56,386
Now,

847
00:40:57,586 --> 00:40:58,106
Miao,

848
00:40:58,227 --> 00:41:00,386
I will get them back to my residence.

849
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:01,826
- We can...
- There's no need.

850
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:04,306
Don't intervene in this.

851
00:41:06,546 --> 00:41:08,427
Song Xiyuan and I
have planned this.

852
00:41:13,747 --> 00:41:14,467
I...

853
00:41:18,227 --> 00:41:19,346
To me,

854
00:41:21,786 --> 00:41:23,427
this is the best distance between us.

855
00:41:25,546 --> 00:41:26,866
We're not too close

856
00:41:27,987 --> 00:41:29,507
nor we're at each other's throats.

857
00:41:30,427 --> 00:41:31,146
Both of us

858
00:41:32,346 --> 00:41:34,146
are just Xiao's parents
and nothing else.

859
00:41:36,267 --> 00:41:37,467
We shall return to our lives

860
00:41:39,306 --> 00:41:40,306
after going back.

861
00:41:43,146 --> 00:41:43,786
Fret not.

862
00:41:44,987 --> 00:41:46,987
I won't stop Xiao from meeting with you.

863
00:41:48,586 --> 00:41:49,106
Miao.

864
00:41:49,786 --> 00:41:50,386
You should know

865
00:41:50,667 --> 00:41:52,306
I ask for more than this.

866
00:41:52,546 --> 00:41:53,106
What I'm trying to say is...

867
00:41:53,106 --> 00:41:54,187
Many things

868
00:41:56,227 --> 00:41:56,826
are already

869
00:41:56,826 --> 00:41:57,947
spilled milk.

870
00:42:03,626 --> 00:42:04,427
It's late now.

871
00:42:05,146 --> 00:42:06,227
Please get rest early.

872
00:42:06,866 --> 00:42:07,866
I shall take my leave, Your Highness.
