Why did you come back suddenly?

00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:41,360
(Qin Zuze)
Your Majesty.

(Qin Zuze)

00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,479
Is it right

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,400
for an educated person
to disobey one's own mother?

25
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:51,080
General Qin, I disagree.

We return this time

33
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,839
to get rid of the vile people

34
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:08,080
by Your Majesty's side.

This way, please.

00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:19,920
Miss, the trainer is here.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,319
Shen Xiao, greet him.

40
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,479
Greetings, Sir.

41
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,679
Is he learning martial arts
at such a young age?

42
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,280
He's not young.

43
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,679
We need to educate children

44
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,720
when they are young.

45
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,599
Mother.

46
00:02:40,839 --> 00:02:42,520
I saw him before.

47
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,319
Where?

48
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,119
We put him on our gate.

49
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:49,959
Grandfather said the fiercer he looks,

50
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,720
the better he can guard the house.

51
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,199
Sir, can you guard the house?

52
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,319
Miss Shen. Young Master is too precious.

53
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,399
I'm afraid he cannot withstand

54
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:01,119
the training.

55
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:02,160
Please look for someone else.

56
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,039
Sir, he's just a child!

57
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:04,920
Don't mind him!

58
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,319
Next person.

59
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:13,360
Mother, his viciousness

60
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,360
can really guard the house.

61
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,839
Miss Shen, please find someone else.

62
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:20,839
Miss Shen.

63
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,759
Mother, he's so ugly!

64
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:26,800
Farewell.

65
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,240
Sir...

66
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,280
Here.

67
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,319
- Xiao!
- Xiao!

68
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:56,800
Xiao.

69
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,199
Xiao.

70
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:01,599
- Xiao!
- Xiao!

71
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,039
What happened?

72
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:03,920
I...

73
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,240
Xiao.

74
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,759
Well...

75
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,080
Xiao, wake up!

76
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,080
Xiao, wake up.

77
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,640
Miaomiao.

78
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,080
I came over as soon as I heard the news.

79
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,160
How is Xiao?

80
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:18,199
Perhaps he is exhausted
from the training.

81
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:20,719
This is...

82
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:25,080
I have ginseng,
deer antlers and cordyceps.

83
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,560
Feed him more.

84
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,439
You are really generous.

85
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:38,800
Mother.

86
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,879
You're awake?

87
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:43,520
Xiyuan, you're here.

88
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:44,400
Xiao.

89
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,039
Tell me.

90
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,640
Who made you suffer?

91
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,400
I'll teach him a lesson.

92
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,999
It's not anyone's fault.

93
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:54,520
Mother and Master
only did it for my sake.

94
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,879
Look. He's really considerate.

95
00:04:58,039 --> 00:04:59,319
His kindness

96
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,199
is just like mine.

97
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,080
You too.

98
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,759
Xiao is a premature child.

99
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:05,640
He is weak.

100
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,159
You should take it slow

101
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,560
when it comes to learning martial arts.

102
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,719
Xiao.

103
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,039
Tell me.

104
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,560
What do you want to do
when you grow up?

105
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,120
I want...

106
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:19,199
I want to eat bayberries.

107
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,400
What's so hard about that?

108
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:26,960
The Song family
has an orchard that's dozens of mu big.

109
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,199
It covers half of the outskirts
in the north of the city.

110
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:30,279
You can have

111
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,640
as many bayberries as you want,

112
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,840
let alone

113
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,039
a single one.

114
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,759
Let's pick them up tomorrow. All right?

115
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,199
All right.

116
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:41,240
Come.

117
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,039
Mother, let's go together.

118
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,159
Why do both of you
decide things so quickly?

119
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,279
Xiao only mentioned

120
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,400
a small wish.

121
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
Can't we fulfill it?

122
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:55,120
Mother.

123
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,479
- Miaomiao.
- Mother.

124
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:58,400
Fine.

125
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,279
Fine, Xiao.

126
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,279
I'll take you there.

127
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,599
All right.

128
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:10,759
Why are you soaking wet?

129
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:12,319
Her Highness summoned me

130
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,199
and made me wait.

131
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,039
Qin Zuze must have been well-prepared

132
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,279
before returning.

133
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,240
Your life is in danger.

134
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,920
I have to congratulate you.

135
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:33,920
What for?

136
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,599
His Majesty said

137
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:38,039
Ninth Princess is interested in you
that she travelled a lot.

138
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,319
He is going to grant a marriage.

139
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,039
What?

140
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,840
No way.

141
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,159
She was always angry at me.

142
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:45,400
Is that a form of affection?

143
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,360
Are you lying to me?

144
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,960
I dare not fake an imperial edict.

145
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:50,120
But...

146
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,759
But she didn't act like that

147
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:53,920
when she liked you.

148
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,999
The nature of things

149
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,840
changes according to the environment.

150
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:04,439
If you apologize to me,

151
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,240
I will give you Shen Miao's portrait.

152
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,400
It was drawn few days ago.

153
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,360
Fresh out of the oven.

154
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,759
Pei Yanzhen, you...

155
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,279
How despicable.

156
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,120
How's Miao?

157
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,960
She is doing great.

158
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,800
You miss them,

159
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,840
but they don't miss you.

160
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,080
Shen Xiao is close to Song Xiyuan
like they are father and son.

161
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,960
The three of them

162
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,800
are living happy lives.

163
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:35,759
Oh.

164
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,279
Our scouts said

165
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,719
confidants of Qin Zuze
have arrived at Lingzhou City.

166
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,159
They pretended to be merchants and
opened up shops near Shen's Residence.

167
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:43,999
The Shen's Residence?

168
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,279
What are they planning for?

169
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,680
We still don't know.

170
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,240
It's been three years.

171
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,279
Perhaps Empress Dowager
has forgotten Shen Miao and her child.

172
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,640
It might just be a misunderstanding.

173
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,319
This concerns Miao and her child.

174
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,360
We must be careful.

175
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,319
Xiao's birthday is coming soon.

176
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,640
Make the preparation. We'll go back.

177
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,680
But

178
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,439
if the Empress Dowager finds out...

179
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,560
Be careful.

180
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:05,920
Don't let other people find out.

181
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,680
This basket is
for Grandfather and Grandmother.

182
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,599
This basket is for Uncle.

183
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:25,640
This big basket is for Mother.

184
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,560
This small basket is for me.

185
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:32,639
What a happy day.

186
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:34,240
Miaomiao.

187
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,440
Let me tell you.

188
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,279
This orchard was
my mother's betrothal gift.

189
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,519
Later, my father found out

190
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,479
she liked to eat these fruits,

191
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,039
so he ordered someone to plant them.

192
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:46,680
Can the Song family eat so much?

193
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,200
No.

194
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:49,159
What about the rest?

195
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,320
We sold them.

196
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:51,920
That's it.

197
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,039
It's exactly the same as what I said.

198
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,560
You don't understand the intention

199
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,519
behind this action.

200
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,240
Lychees at Lingnan

201
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,519
are called "Concubine's Smile".

202
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,959
I want to give a name

203
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,200
to the bayberries of Song's Orchard.

204
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,560
I will call them

205
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,279
"Miaomiao's Smile".

206
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,880
What do you think?

207
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,399
"Miaomiao's Smile".

208
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,880
Mother.

209
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,440
I think it's very good.

210
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,000
"Miaomiao's Smile".

211
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,000
"Miaomiao's Smile".

212
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,360
Does Xiao smile as well?

213
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,120
Xiao smiles.

214
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:26,560
I smile too.

215
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,560
Xiyuan smiles!

216
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:32,639
Stop!

217
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,079
Official Pei.

218
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:48,920
It has been three years.

219
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,039
There has been no news about you.

220
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,200
Why did you

221
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,680
choose to come back now?

222
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,519
Is it

223
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:58,479
because of my son's birthday?

224
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,680
Master Song, you misunderstood.

225
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:02,320
I am

226
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,320
only back here for work purposes.

227
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:08,680
They say

228
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,760
evil people have bad luck.

229
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,479
The road here is wide,

230
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,120
yet your wheels

231
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,240
still got stuck in the mud.

232
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,399
Seems like

233
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
the roads of Lingzhou

234
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,800
still don't welcome you.

235
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,760
You should return to the capital

236
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,680
and remain as a minister.

237
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,120
Let's go.

238
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,959
Sir, let's go.

239
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,000
Official Zhan is waiting for us.

240
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:48,526
"Miaomiao's Smile".

241
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,920
This name

242
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:52,599
is beautiful.

243
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:58,448
Ask Zhan Yue to go to Zhezhe Tavern

244
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:00,360
and check the situation.

245
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,660
(Shen Residence)

246
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,639
Pei Yanzhen

247
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:30,760
already left,

248
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:32,479
but why does he still annoy me?

249
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,479
No.

250
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,279
I can't be affected by him.

251
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:38,079
My business is going to be snatched.

252
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,200
Make money.
I must think about making money.

253
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,750
(Tavern)

254
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,320
Zhan Yue, how dare you.

255
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,680
What are you looking at?

256
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,320
You are acting sneakily.

257
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:20,079
I...

258
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:21,479
Are you following me?

259
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,800
I know I'm handsome

260
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:26,560
but I have important things to do.

261
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,800
Farewell.

262
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,079
Are you investigating a case?

263
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,440
Is it fun?

264
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,360
Can you bring me along?

265
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,519
This is important.

266
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:38,200
There's no fun in it.

267
00:12:38,719 --> 00:12:39,240
No.

268
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,360
If you won't bring me,

269
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,399
I will go inside the tavern
and tell everyone

270
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:47,519
that Guard Zhan is peeking.

271
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:51,479
Let's go.

272
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,039
Dear customers, what do you want?

273
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:06,920
A jar of wine and two dishes.

274
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,479
- Sure.
- That's all?

275
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,959
You're so stingy.

276
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:11,760
Are you paying?

277
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,279
Sir.

278
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,399
Five minutes ago, he was...

279
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:18,639
I'll pay.

280
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,079
I want this, this and this.

281
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:28,880
Sure. Please wait.

282
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,120
What are you looking at?

283
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,120
I don't like you.

284
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,800
Who likes you?

285
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:53,920
Her?

286
00:13:55,599 --> 00:13:56,360
This is serious.

287
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,599
Why are you jealous?

288
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,479
I'm not jealous.

289
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,560
Besides,

290
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,200
when did I like you?

291
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,519
No wonder you don't want me here.

292
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,599
I'm insensible

293
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,079
and disturbed both of you.

294
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,360
Causing trouble out of nothing.

295
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:16,120
You...

296
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,079
Why are you so anxious?

297
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,000
Why are you comparing her to me?

298
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,279
Besides,

299
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,039
when did I like you?

300
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:18,560
Why isn't Ninth Princess here yet?

301
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,639
There's a new tavern called Zhezhe
in the east of the city.

302
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:24,399
They snatched most of my business.

303
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,200
I made a few thousand taels less.

304
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,560
Do you need someone
to cause trouble there?

305
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:33,000
Why don't I bring Zhan Yue?

306
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,079
No need.

307
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:35,719
I just

308
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:37,320
want you to study

309
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,560
their business methods.

310
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:41,560
At the same time,

311
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,440
we will look at how pretty

312
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,320
their dancers are.

313
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,360
See you at quarter to six tomorrow.

314
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,599
Sure.

315
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:52,479
Why isn't she here yet?

316
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:28,880
You're finally here.
Take the wine inside.

317
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,959
This is exactly the same as
the Master's seal of the Shen family.

318
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,479
We have been doing business
with him for a few months.

319
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,839
There won't be a mistake.

320
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:52,399
With these few falsified ledgers,

321
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,680
we will soon be able to seize

322
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,639
the Shen family's assets.

323
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,880
Keep this Shen family's seal well.

324
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,479
Shen family's seal?

325
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,000
Who is it?

326
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:00,920
Let's go.

327
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:12,680
What's going on?

328
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,600
It's just a cat.

329
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:35,200
Let's go.

330
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,480
We'll look somewhere else.

331
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,680
Let's go.

332
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,039
I think

333
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:06,800
your eyes look familiar.

334
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,600
Are your legs fine?

335
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,560
The red mark behind your ear

336
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,519
looks familiar too.

337
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:26,159
The callus on your left hand

338
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,279
suggests you are left-handed.

339
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,560
I've never seen someone like you.

340
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,960
This is weird.

341
00:18:35,879 --> 00:18:37,080
We never met before.

342
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:39,080
Your way of getting to know me

343
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,440
is quite old-fashioned, Miss.

344
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:42,639
You are perceptive.

345
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,119
I am

346
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:45,960
a girl.

347
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:47,999
I just learned to disguise myself.

348
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,320
How embarrassing.

349
00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:53,119
May I know your name

350
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:54,080
and where your house is?

351
00:18:54,639 --> 00:18:56,920
I will visit
and thank you in the future.

352
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,279
Someone's here.

353
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,560
He looks like...

354
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:10,200
Pei Yanzhen?

355
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,560
He is just a scholar.
He doesn't know martial arts.

356
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,800
He is also not that kind.

357
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,920
It won't be him.

358
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:20,920
He is not worthy for me to think of him.

359
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,100
(Ledger)

360
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,119
I was interrupted by the Ninth Princess.

361
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,519
How was your investigation?

362
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,639
That tavern

363
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:57,840
is used to frame the Shen family indeed.

364
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,159
Failing to report a large tribute,

365
00:20:00,447 --> 00:20:01,607
taking the royal court's land,

366
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,440
and involving themselves
in the official trade of salt and iron.

367
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,920
These crimes

368
00:20:05,399 --> 00:20:07,680
are enough to put
the whole Shen family to death.

369
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,200
Don't be afraid.

370
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,080
It's me.

371
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,320
It's me.

372
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,279
Miaomiao.

373
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,159
Are you trying to scare me to death?

374
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,320
Father.

375
00:20:51,639 --> 00:20:52,840
Where is our family's seal?

376
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:53,759
Seal?

377
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,279
Where's my seal?

378
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:00,920
Where's my seal?

379
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:02,680
It's over here.

380
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,519
It's here.

381
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:08,359
The seal is here.

382
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:10,879
What's wrong?

383
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,200
Someone forged

384
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,720
our family's seal at Zhezhe Tavern.

385
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,159
I don't know what their intention is.

386
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,999
Is it true?

387
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:24,359
But...

388
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:27,519
But tomorrow is Xiao's birthday.

389
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,560
Go back and rest.

390
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,440
When this is over,

391
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,399
we'll investigate it.

392
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,560
Go back and sleep.

393
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:37,960
Keep it well.

394
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,639
Xiao.

395
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:03,639
I am here.

396
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,320
I don't care if Pei Yanzhen isn't here.

397
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,639
But why is Song Xiyuan absent as well?

398
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,279
Xiao.

399
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,359
Xiyuan.

400
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:33,680
Xiao.

401
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:35,279
This is your birthday present.

402
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:35,999
Do you like it?

403
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,159
Xiao.

404
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:40,359
This is also your birthday present.

405
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,359
A lousy jade.

406
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:44,359
What a shame to be giving that.

407
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:46,759
The Shen family does have everything.

408
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:49,320
Xiao. If you like it,

409
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,359
you can take it.

410
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,519
It's not appropriate.

411
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:02,080
Mother.

412
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,879
I want this.

413
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:07,800
I want to make a bookmark with this.

414
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:09,600
Young Master will grow
to be someone capable

415
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,720
with his love for literature.

416
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,320
Xiao, don't play with that.

417
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,279
Let's play with the cat.

418
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,440
Come here.

419
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,239
It's Xiao's birthday.

420
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,440
Since he likes it, just take it.

421
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,800
It might be useful

422
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:42,560
in an important situation in the future.

423
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,200
You prefer my birthday gift, right?

424
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,359
Make yourself at home.

425
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,200
I like it.

426
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:53,359
I knew it.

427
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:58,840
Pei Yanzhen.

428
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:04,720
Look.

429
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,039
It is smiling at you.

430
00:24:10,879 --> 00:24:11,440
Miao.

431
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,720
Xiao, look.

432
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:16,680
Was it you

433
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,519
last night?

434
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,800
Quick, tell your mother.

435
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,480
Mother.

436
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,639
Xiyuan said

437
00:24:23,639 --> 00:24:26,159
this cat is calling your name.

438
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,279
Meow.

439
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:29,920
It really is.

440
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,440
Mother, play with me.

441
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,879
Mother, hurry.

442
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,239
Come here, Mother.

443
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:45,600
Is it cute?

444
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,279
Give me.

445
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:48,840
Give me.

446
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,359
I want to play with it.

447
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,600
I'm giving you both.

448
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,359
Sure. Pet it.

449
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:08,039
Give it.

450
00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:09,680
Let it play.

451
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,239
Look.

452
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,200
Come and have a look.

453
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:17,039
Have a look at the rouge.

454
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:20,279
Why? Did you regret it?

455
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,440
Why did you give such a precious pendant

456
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,399
to Shen Miao then?

457
00:25:23,727 --> 00:25:24,766
The Qin family is cunning.

458
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:25,999
Leaving that jade pendant

459
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,879
might save Miao's life at least.

460
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:30,879
Let's go, Xiao.

461
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,759
Hurry up.

462
00:25:33,879 --> 00:25:34,560
Pei Yanzhen!

463
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,920
Pei Yanzhen!

464
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,759
Come, Xiao.

465
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:40,879
Hurry.

466
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,879
Follow me.

467
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,159
I can't turn back right now.

468
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,279
Pei Yanzhen!

469
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,800
Pei Yanzhen,
I have something to tell you!

470
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,480
Pei Yanzhen, why are you avoiding me?

471
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:55,960
Pei Yanzhen!

472
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,680
Benefactor.

473
00:26:09,639 --> 00:26:10,720
Who are you calling?

474
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,879
You made a mistake.

475
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:14,960
Zhan Yue.

476
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,359
Why did he ignore me?

477
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:18,999
Has he been avoiding me?

478
00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:22,840
He returned to Lingzhou in secret.

479
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,359
He left because his work is done.

480
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,680
Besides, why should he avoid you?

481
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:28,960
He has been

482
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,720
lying to me for the past three years.

483
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,200
He didn't even look for you.
How could he lie to you?

484
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,800
Mother.

485
00:26:35,438 --> 00:26:38,958
Didn't you say I could always be safe

486
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,480
because I met a benefactor?

487
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,480
When I fell in the water,
fell down from the tree

488
00:26:43,879 --> 00:26:45,200
and got lost once,

489
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,639
it was this man who helped me.

490
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:51,119
It's nothing much.

491
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,759
Did Pei Yanzhen

492
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:54,080
ask you to protect us in secret?

493
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:55,399
How can you say he isn't lying?

494
00:26:55,999 --> 00:26:57,879
He kept hiding and won't give up.

495
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,279
He even saved me at the tavern
last night.

496
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,759
What does he want?

497
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:03,639
Pei Yanzhen's intention is complicated.

498
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:04,960
I wouldn't know.

499
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,759
Zhan Yue!

500
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,720
Your Majesty,

501
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,440
(Daqing Gate)

502
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,840
when I returned to Lingzhou
to visit my family,

503
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,320
I accidentally found out

504
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:28,999
someone forging seals and documents

505
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,039
to frame the Shen family.

506
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,920
Please investigate it.

507
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:38,960
Everyone knows

508
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:40,720
your relationship with the Shen family.

509
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,159
Are you doing this for personal reason

510
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:44,600
or for justice?

511
00:27:46,639 --> 00:27:48,600
The Shen family is reputable in Lingzhou

512
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:51,039
yet they are still being framed.

513
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,920
If we are going to ignore this,

514
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,639
wouldn't it put everyone at risk

515
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,080
and cause chaos among people?

516
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:04,999
Your Majesty.

517
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:06,840
You must

518
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:09,039
investigate this.

519
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,480
In that case,

520
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,759
I'll follow your suggestion, Uncle.

521
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,399
Yes.

522
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,200
(Tavern)

523
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,960
Pei Yanzhen helped us
plead for our innocence

524
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,320
(Tavern)
in the morning,

525
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,039
and the tavern got cleaned out
in the afternoon.

526
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:46,119
I'm afraid we can't find any more clues.

527
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,399
What clues do you need?

528
00:28:49,207 --> 00:28:50,886
If the Shen family's assets
go to the treasury,

529
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,960
the person who benefits the most
is General Qin

530
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,039
apart from the Empress Dowager.

531
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,159
There are no more suspects.

532
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,279
Thankfully, Pei Yanzhen is around.

533
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:04,039
He wouldn't have done this

534
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:05,519
if he didn't have
lingering feelings for you.

535
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,560
If he does have feelings for you,

536
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,800
why did he go missing for three years?

537
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,279
In order to help the society,

538
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,879
he must have offended many nobles
for the past three years.

539
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,440
He is a righteous person.

540
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,239
I'm sure he has to do this

541
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:29,200
because he doesn't want to
involve our family.

542
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,519
(I knew it)

543
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,399
(since I'm too good to be given up.)

544
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:38,359
Brother.

545
00:29:38,879 --> 00:29:40,600
How can you let His Majesty
investigate this?

546
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,639
If he finds out
we are the ones behind it...

547
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,840
It's nothing much.

548
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,519
The people they captured

549
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:49,999
are the Qin family's men
who aren't afraid of death.

550
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:51,399
In the end,

551
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,800
all witnesses will be dead
and they won't find anything.

552
00:29:59,879 --> 00:30:01,680
We spent a lot of effort.

553
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,920
I didn't expect

554
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,039
Pei Yanzhen to spoil our plan
near the end.

555
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,560
What a cunning person.

556
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:12,399
They divorced for three years,

557
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,159
but he still can't forget
the Shen family.

558
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:17,639
It's nothing.

559
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,119
We have Pei Yanzhen's weakness now.

560
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:24,759
There's nothing difficult about him.

561
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,840
Brother, you mean...

562
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,440
My daughter Qin Miuzhen

563
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,159
is at the age of marriage.

564
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,239
If you grant a marriage,

565
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,320
do you think Pei Yanzhen
will go against your edict

566
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,879
with his love for Shen Miao?

567
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,879
I will see what he says.

568
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,039
If it's true,

569
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,680
I can get rid of him.

570
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,600
Your Majesty.

571
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:06,119
I will never marry Qin Miuzhen.

572
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:11,759
I knew you would say that.

573
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,200
But rejecting a marriage
is punishable by death.

574
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,480
Doing that is what they want.

575
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,519
I might not be able to protect you

576
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,320
even if I'm the emperor.

577
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,440
If you die,
who will protect Shen Miao and her son?

578
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:27,960
Pei Yanzhen.

579
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,399
There's always hope
as long as you are still alive.

580
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,840
The marriage is a delaying tactic.

581
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,639
You can get a divorce later.

582
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,560
Even if I marry Qin Miuzhen,

583
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,800
the Qin family won't spare everyone.

584
00:31:46,366 --> 00:31:47,886
However, you will buy enough time

585
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,759
and have an opportunity
to hit the enemy on the inside.

586
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:53,359
When you have the evidence
of Qin family's crime,

587
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,080
you can arrest them all.

588
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:57,920
Yanzhen.

589
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,279
Even if you don't think about yourself,

590
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,920
you should think about
Shen Miao and her son.

591
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:04,840
Do you think Mother

592
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,519
will spare the Shen family
and your parents

593
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:08,279
after you die?

594
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,720
I think

595
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,519
there are other solutions

596
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,840
as long as the decision isn't final.

597
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:19,519
I can give you time

598
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,119
but the Qin family won't.

599
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,519
The order for the marriage
has not been issued.

600
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:25,720
But Mother has ordered

601
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,399
Qin Miuzhen to return to Lingzhou
and prepare for the wedding.

602
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,239
She wanted you to be the escort.

603
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,239
Yanzhen. Everything is related.

604
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:34,879
You have to think carefully.

605
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:47,720
How is it? Is it fine?

606
00:32:47,879 --> 00:32:49,239
You've asked me 800 times.

607
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:50,560
You are charming.

608
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,519
Miss. That's Official Pei's boat.

609
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:38,720
Pei Yanzhen.

610
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:44,920
Pei Yanzhen.

611
00:33:46,239 --> 00:33:47,359
I appreciate

612
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:49,039
your kindness.

613
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:52,279
To protected us, three years ago

614
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:53,279
you asked Zhan Yue to protect us

615
00:33:53,879 --> 00:33:55,600
even when you went to the city alone.

616
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:58,800
A few days ago, you even went to
the tavern in the middle of the night

617
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,320
to clear Shen family's name.

618
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,720
Pei Yanzhen.

619
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:10,399
Don't bear everything
all by yourself anymore.

620
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,359
I'll be here with you.

621
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,920
We'll shoulder everything together.

622
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:16,200
Shall we?

623
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:21,599
Yanzhen. I fell asleep.

624
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,159
Why didn't you wake me up?

625
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,520
The cousin from the Qin family?

626
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,520
It's been a long time, Jiu.

627
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,280
(Qin Miuzhen)
I wouldn't have met you again

628
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,200
without Official Pei's invitation.

629
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:43,680
That's impossible.

630
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,920
Pei Yanzhen doesn't like you.

631
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,040
Who does he like?

632
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:47,839
You

633
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:49,200
or her?

634
00:34:51,319 --> 00:34:53,119
Shen Miao, don't listen to her nonsense.

635
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:55,599
She is good at sowing discord.

636
00:34:55,808 --> 00:34:57,209
I'm sure it's a one-sided love.

637
00:34:57,799 --> 00:34:59,879
She just followed him shamelessly.

638
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,720
Didn't you do the same back then?

639
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:04,079
You...

640
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,000
Pei Yanzhen,
let's not talk about Miss Qin for now.

641
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:17,760
Do you really like me?

642
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,280
I protected Shen Xiao in secret

643
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,599
because I still think

644
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,359
Xiao is my child

645
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:29,799
regardless of how others think.

646
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,879
I helped the Shen family
in the royal court

647
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,399
because it was the right thing to do.

648
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,159
Even if it happens to someone else,

649
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,399
I will also help them.

Fine.

653
00:35:50,319 --> 00:35:50,960
Great.

654
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:54,040

00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:58,399
We are here.

673
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,960
What is this place?

674
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,559
It's me, Madam.

675
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,399
Tie Niu.

676
00:37:20,399 --> 00:37:21,520
Why is it you?

677
00:37:21,799 --> 00:37:23,240
Why did you put up this act?

678
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,240
Master sees that you are in a bad mood

679
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,639
and wanted to surprise you.

680
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,079
What kind of surprise?

681
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:30,799
Send me back.

682
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:33,240
Return it!

683
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:34,440
If you want it,

684
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,079
just follow me.

685
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,359
Tie Niu!

686
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,000
Tie Niu, return it!

687
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:40,399
Tie Niu.

688
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,680
Tie Niu!

689
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,680
You...

690
00:38:05,799 --> 00:38:07,119
Are you charmed?

691
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:08,799
Are you drunk?

692
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,040
Tie Niu. Tie Niu!

693
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,119
Since you are here,

694
00:38:14,399 --> 00:38:16,399
I've prepared some dishes.

695
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:17,799
Let's have a drink.

696
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:19,079
You are really drunk.

697
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:20,319
I'll ask Tie Niu to send you back.

698
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,920
Tie Niu!

699
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,879
I'm not drunk.

700
00:38:30,879 --> 00:38:31,399
Fine.

701
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,720
I'm drunk.

702
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,240
I am very drunk.

703
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:40,799
I'm so drunk that I have no strength.

704
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,760
I'm so drunk

705
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,480
that I'm going to fall into the river.

706
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,399
Miaomiao!

707
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:48,839
Miaomiao!

708
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:49,639
Hold me.

709
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:51,319
Miaomiao!

710
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:00,359
Miaomiao, I can't swim!

711
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,399
Help me!

712
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:02,599
Miao...

713
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:12,280
Ladies like you

714
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,480
are getting harder to please nowadays.

715
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:20,040
You won't even hold me

716
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,159
after you see me being drunk.

717
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:25,639
You won't treat me
like how you treat Pei Yanzhen.

718
00:39:29,399 --> 00:39:30,760
I wonder if you are

719
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:33,440
purposely fooling me

720
00:39:34,319 --> 00:39:35,440
like Pei Yanzhen,

721
00:39:36,879 --> 00:39:38,119
just to see me embarrass myself.

722
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,440
Yanzhen is definitely

723
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:44,399
not a good person.

724
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:46,559
But look at me.

725
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,040
For the past three years...

726
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,399
Aren't we drinking?

727
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:51,159
Falling in love

728
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,760
hurts the body and mind.

729
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:57,720
It's better to become someone heartless

730
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,399
and make the most of today.

731
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:01,399
Let's get drunk and forget our sorrows.

732
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,720
Cheers.

733
00:40:14,399 --> 00:40:14,960
Leave.

734
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:15,879
Yes.

735
00:40:18,799 --> 00:40:20,720
Your Highness summoned me
so late at night.

736
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,200
I wonder what kind of emergency it is.

737
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,359
Brother.

738
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,159
Pei Yanzhen agreed

739
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:28,879
to escort Zhen to Lingzhou.

740
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,200
I don't get it.

741
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,319
What is he trying to do?

742
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:36,960
He is only doing it

743
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,559
to confuse us

744
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,359
and delay for a few days.

745
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,240
But he will meet Shen Miao

746
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:44,639
when he returns to Lingzhou.

747
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,399
It will bring out his feelings for her.

748
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:52,079
What if he really marries Zhen

749
00:40:52,399 --> 00:40:53,520
to protect his life and assets?

750
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,480
Then, she will be

751
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,280
the spy and assassin

752
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:03,920
we plant beside Pei Yanzhen.

753
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:07,799
Your Highness, please draft the edict
to grant the marriage

754
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,119
according to our original plan.

755
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,760
If he rejects the marriage,

756
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,920
we will be able to get rid of him.

757
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,920
It's all over no matter what happens.

758
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,480
Pei Yanzhen

759
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,520
will no longer trouble us.

760
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,159
Miss Shen's confession today

761
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,159
is really moving.

762
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,960
To protected us, three years ago

763
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:46,839
you asked Zhan Yue to protect us

764
00:41:47,399 --> 00:41:48,920
even when you went to the city alone.

765
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,680
A few days ago, you even went to
the tavern in the middle of the night

766
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,280
to clear the Shen family's name.

767
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:55,760
Pei Yanzhen.

768
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,599
Don't bear everything
all by yourself anymore.

769
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:02,799
I'll be here with you.

770
00:42:03,399 --> 00:42:05,399
We'll shoulder everything together.

771
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:06,680
Shall we?

772
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,399
If I didn't know about her relationship

773
00:42:13,399 --> 00:42:15,720
with Song Xiyuan in the last three years

774
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,159
and her indecent personality,

775
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,879
I would really believe her.

776
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:21,200
Pei Yanzhen.

777
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,960
Shen Miao is just a merchant's daughter.

778
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:24,960
She has...

779
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:38,200
Congratulations, Official Pei.

780
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,960
You are favored
by many beautiful ladies,

781
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,920
yet you don't know how to cherish them.

782
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,159
Where is Shen Miao?

783
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:45,319
It has been three years.

784
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:46,839
Shen Miao is already

785
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:48,280
favoring Song Xiyuan now.

786
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:49,200
What you did today

787
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,559
broke her heart even more.

788
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,680
Even if you know where she is,

789
00:42:53,399 --> 00:42:55,040
you still have to marry Qin Miuzhen.
