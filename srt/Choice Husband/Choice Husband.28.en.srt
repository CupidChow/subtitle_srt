It's fine. I can handle this.

I can do it myself.

Hush.

Do you really think

00:02:16,412 --> 00:02:17,933
your body is made of iron?

25
00:02:19,293 --> 00:02:20,373
Look at the serious wound.

26
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:21,653
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

27
00:02:22,972 --> 00:02:23,453
It's fine.

28
00:02:23,692 --> 00:02:24,332
It has already recovered.

29
00:02:24,813 --> 00:02:25,453
I don't feel pain.

30
00:02:25,972 --> 00:02:26,933
It hasn't recovered yet.

Official Zhao hurt you too badly.

32

No, it wasn't Official Zhao.

33
00:02:33,332 --> 00:02:35,892
I was hit by the falling beam.

34
00:02:36,492 --> 00:02:38,612
Do you think I can't fight him?

35
00:02:43,492 --> 00:02:44,052
I...

36
00:02:44,653 --> 00:02:46,252
Let me continue to apply the ointment.

37
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:05,772
Stop!

38
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:08,933
Under this pure moon,

39
00:03:09,093 --> 00:03:10,933
what are you doing here?

40
00:03:11,412 --> 00:03:12,612
- I...
- I...

41
00:03:12,972 --> 00:03:14,252
I'm helping Tie Niu
to apply the ointment.

42
00:03:14,453 --> 00:03:14,972
That's right.

43
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,532
Helping him with the ointment?

44
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:18,532
But you touched him.

45
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,052
That's the skin-to-skin contact.

46
00:03:20,772 --> 00:03:21,573
Brat.

47
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:23,573
Why can't you notice

48
00:03:23,772 --> 00:03:25,933
that I'm injured too?

49
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,653
Did you get hurt too?

50
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:30,692
Did I get hurt too?

51
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:32,052
Look at this.

52
00:03:32,173 --> 00:03:32,692
Look at here,

53
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:33,252
here

54
00:03:33,853 --> 00:03:34,373
and here.

55
00:03:34,373 --> 00:03:35,573
Come on.

56
00:03:35,573 --> 00:03:36,853
I need the ointment too.

57
00:03:36,853 --> 00:03:37,933
Over here.

58
00:03:37,933 --> 00:03:38,213
You!

59
00:03:39,373 --> 00:03:40,052
Shameless.

60
00:03:40,813 --> 00:03:41,653
You deserve the pain.

61
00:03:43,213 --> 00:03:43,933
Lvying!

62
00:03:45,132 --> 00:03:46,132
I'm shameless?

63
00:03:46,532 --> 00:03:47,132
Tie Niu!

64
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,132
You hurt your fist, not me.

65
00:03:55,293 --> 00:03:55,933
Miss Lvying.

66
00:03:58,252 --> 00:03:59,252
My blade.

67
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:01,972
Where's my blade?

68
00:04:10,813 --> 00:04:14,612
Have you watched the show
during the day?

69
00:04:15,772 --> 00:04:16,972
Do you fathom

70
00:04:18,053 --> 00:04:18,932
the story?

71
00:04:21,893 --> 00:04:23,092
I know nothing about the show.

72
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:24,733
I couldn't understand

73
00:04:25,493 --> 00:04:26,613
what they were gabbling about.

74
00:04:26,972 --> 00:04:28,493
I thought you were a mighty hero.

75
00:04:28,972 --> 00:04:30,733
How timid of you.

76
00:04:31,412 --> 00:04:32,932
Just be straight with me.

77
00:04:33,853 --> 00:04:35,212
Do you like me or not?

78
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:38,212
I need an answer today

79
00:04:38,773 --> 00:04:39,812
and nothing else.

80
00:04:43,773 --> 00:04:44,733
Are you deaf?

81
00:04:49,493 --> 00:04:50,573
I want to tell you

82
00:04:51,212 --> 00:04:51,972
that I like you.

83
00:04:54,092 --> 00:04:55,053
And I want to marry you.

84
00:04:55,972 --> 00:04:56,932
If you can't fathom this,

85
00:04:58,053 --> 00:04:59,293
I will explain to you the entire night,

86
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:00,972
the entire year

87
00:05:01,453 --> 00:05:02,252
and my whole life.

88
00:05:03,573 --> 00:05:04,092
Your Highness.

89
00:05:06,812 --> 00:05:08,372
You're the one
who can't see through this.

90
00:05:09,853 --> 00:05:10,812
I don't like you.

91
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:12,532
I don't have a thing for you

92
00:05:13,812 --> 00:05:14,733
nor will I marry you.

93
00:05:24,372 --> 00:05:24,972
That's impossible.

94
00:05:27,132 --> 00:05:28,733
Why did you treat me nicely then?

95
00:05:29,972 --> 00:05:32,532
Why did you rescue me

96
00:05:34,053 --> 00:05:35,252
during Qin Miuzhen's assassination
two years ago?

97
00:05:35,532 --> 00:05:36,013
And...

98
00:05:36,013 --> 00:05:37,532
It was my responsibility to protect you.

99
00:05:41,293 --> 00:05:42,493
Please accept my apology

100
00:05:44,252 --> 00:05:45,532
if I have misled you.

101
00:05:46,773 --> 00:05:48,333
However, if you insist on

102
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,493
forcing me,

103
00:05:51,013 --> 00:05:52,132
I would report to His Highness

104
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:54,212
and I will leave the capital forever.

105
00:05:54,212 --> 00:05:54,972
Shut it!

106
00:06:05,692 --> 00:06:07,893
You can also ask His Majesty
to sentence me to death.

107
00:06:10,212 --> 00:06:11,132
But nothing will be changed.

108
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:13,972
Love relationship is forged
when two people truly love each other,

109
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,212
not by force.

110
00:06:30,293 --> 00:06:31,092
You leave now, Zhan Yue.

111
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,573
I won't see you again.

112
00:07:25,252 --> 00:07:25,812
Xiao.

113
00:07:41,372 --> 00:07:42,132
Your Highness, do you come here

114
00:07:42,493 --> 00:07:43,532
with some sort of machination again?

115
00:07:45,773 --> 00:07:46,252
I...

116
00:07:50,013 --> 00:07:50,853
I came here for Xiao.

117
00:07:51,372 --> 00:07:52,013
Oh, good.

118
00:07:52,692 --> 00:07:53,613
Let me tell you this.

119
00:07:54,053 --> 00:07:55,132
After returning to the capital,

120
00:07:55,372 --> 00:07:56,853
Xiao and I will stay
at Song's Residence.

121
00:07:57,293 --> 00:07:57,932
No, I don't agree.

122
00:07:58,733 --> 00:07:59,412
Miss Shen.

123
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,173
We better get something straight.

124
00:08:02,573 --> 00:08:03,173
I admit

125
00:08:03,652 --> 00:08:05,013
that I feigned blindness

126
00:08:05,212 --> 00:08:06,212
on purpose.

127
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:08,573
But I wasn't aiming at you.

128
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:10,333
What do you mean?

129
00:08:11,173 --> 00:08:12,532
Xiao is my child.

130
00:08:13,132 --> 00:08:15,212
Over these two years, you abandoned him

131
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,733
and went to Weiyang
with Third Master Song.

132
00:08:17,252 --> 00:08:18,333
I won't hold you accountable.

133
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:20,092
However, you turn up

134
00:08:20,092 --> 00:08:20,893
after a sudden departure.

135
00:08:20,893 --> 00:08:22,372
I don't think it's fair to me.

136
00:08:23,053 --> 00:08:24,293
Xiao belongs to the Shen family.

137
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:26,252
I won't allow him to stay with you

138
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:27,733
and get involved

139
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:29,893
in the murky imperial court.

140
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:32,173
Xiao is my son too.

141
00:08:32,173 --> 00:08:33,253
Do you think he can be in the clear

142
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:34,332
staying with Third Master Song

143
00:08:34,332 --> 00:08:35,572
despite of his identity?

144
00:08:36,493 --> 00:08:38,253
Do you want him to call me Great-uncle

145
00:08:39,092 --> 00:08:40,212
and leave him fatherless for good?

146
00:08:42,412 --> 00:08:43,012
Miao.

147
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:46,092
I have gone through all of these before.

148
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,253
I don't want to put Xiao through

149
00:08:48,652 --> 00:08:49,933
the same misery I had before.

150
00:08:52,253 --> 00:08:53,173
What do you want me to do?

151
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,212
Let's raise Xiao together

152
00:08:55,212 --> 00:08:56,493
for one year.

153
00:08:56,972 --> 00:08:58,092
After he grows up,

154
00:08:58,373 --> 00:08:59,452
he will choose his future.

155
00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:00,493
Just one month.

156
00:09:01,212 --> 00:09:01,772
Half a year.

157
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:03,452
Three months.

158
00:09:03,613 --> 00:09:04,173
Deal.

159
00:09:05,532 --> 00:09:06,092
Rest assured.

160
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:08,173
I will keep my promise

161
00:09:08,652 --> 00:09:10,412
and never keep anything
from you and Xiao.

162
00:09:11,572 --> 00:09:12,613
I hope you can put yourself

163
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:14,293
in Xiao's shoes.

164
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:16,173
Please don't repeat what had happened

165
00:09:16,652 --> 00:09:17,332
two years ago.

166
00:09:45,053 --> 00:09:45,572
Your Highness.

167
00:09:46,493 --> 00:09:48,613
Are you going to give up on her?

168
00:09:55,212 --> 00:09:56,053
I knew it.

169
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,493
You're just playing hard to get.

170
00:09:58,412 --> 00:10:00,332
Highbrows always have a quack

171
00:10:00,613 --> 00:10:02,572
for wooing the ladies.

172
00:10:03,613 --> 00:10:05,693
Honestly, I did that out of desperation.

173
00:10:06,972 --> 00:10:07,972
If I didn't do that,

174
00:10:08,693 --> 00:10:10,613
she would've left
with Third Master Song.

175
00:10:12,853 --> 00:10:13,493
You're right.

176
00:10:19,813 --> 00:10:20,412
Your Highness.

177
00:10:21,613 --> 00:10:24,373
If Miss Shen is moving
into the residence,

178
00:10:24,572 --> 00:10:25,493
then Lvying...

179
00:10:26,813 --> 00:10:27,293
Your Highness.

180
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,373
Please be generous

181
00:10:29,373 --> 00:10:30,452
and pass on some tips to me.

182
00:10:30,853 --> 00:10:31,493
Do you want to learn?

183
00:10:32,053 --> 00:10:33,332
Yes, with full sincerity.

184
00:10:35,053 --> 00:10:37,053
Restrain yourself
from being a smooth talker.

185
00:10:37,693 --> 00:10:38,733
You should behave well.

186
00:10:39,332 --> 00:10:39,972
All right, sure.

187
00:10:46,452 --> 00:10:47,092
Official Zhan.

188
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:48,373
What's wrong with you?

189
00:10:49,853 --> 00:10:51,493
Did Her Highness bully you again?

190
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,332
Did you turn her down?

191
00:11:04,092 --> 00:11:04,853
I don't deserve her.

192
00:11:07,253 --> 00:11:08,293
That's your own thought.

193
00:11:09,212 --> 00:11:09,733
Zhan Yue.

194
00:11:10,813 --> 00:11:12,332
You will regret it

195
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:14,053
if you miss out on her.

196
00:11:16,933 --> 00:11:17,493
Whether I will regret it

197
00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:19,493
or not,

198
00:11:21,813 --> 00:11:23,813
Her Highness is of noble identity.

199
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:27,452
She deserves a better man.

200
00:11:31,412 --> 00:11:31,853
Thanks.

201
00:11:35,853 --> 00:11:36,972
What's wrong with Zhan Yue?

202
00:11:37,452 --> 00:11:38,493
He gives up on Her Highness

203
00:11:38,493 --> 00:11:40,012
who woos him.

204
00:11:40,012 --> 00:11:41,293
So what kind of woman is he looking for?

205
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,332
He's not easily satisfied.

206
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:44,253
What do you think, Your Highness?

207
00:11:50,253 --> 00:11:50,813
Your Highness.

208
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:51,733
Your Highness.

209
00:11:53,493 --> 00:11:54,053
What...

210
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,452
What's wrong with you two?

211
00:12:20,813 --> 00:12:21,493
Are you cold?

212
00:12:23,173 --> 00:12:23,813
Put this on.

213
00:12:25,652 --> 00:12:26,173
Here.

214
00:12:27,092 --> 00:12:27,613
I...

215
00:12:28,452 --> 00:12:29,173
Thank you.

216
00:12:36,053 --> 00:12:37,293
Look at the moon.

217

(Regent's Residence)

218
00:13:12,012 --> 00:13:13,133
Xiao, come here.

219
00:13:16,452 --> 00:13:17,332
Don't worry, Xiao.

220
00:13:17,892 --> 00:13:19,892
I have something to speak to Xiyuan.
I will be back soon.

221
00:13:20,412 --> 00:13:21,253
I swear

222
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:23,012
I won't leave you alone.

223
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,452
Lvying, stay with Xiao.

224
00:13:30,972 --> 00:13:31,813
Let's go.

225
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,540
(Regent's Residence)

226
00:13:55,972 --> 00:13:56,452
Miaomiao.

227
00:13:57,652 --> 00:13:58,293
Do you really want to stay here?

228
00:13:58,813 --> 00:14:01,572
Regent's Residence is impregnable.

229
00:14:01,853 --> 00:14:03,733
What if anything befalls you

230
00:14:03,772 --> 00:14:04,452
in this residence?

231
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:05,572
Well.

232
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,572
You have done more than enough for me.

233
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:09,412
I shouldn't rely on you.

234
00:14:10,572 --> 00:14:11,493
I don't mind.

235
00:14:11,772 --> 00:14:12,493
I know.

236
00:14:15,972 --> 00:14:17,173
But Pei Yanzhen was right.

237
00:14:18,053 --> 00:14:19,853
I should do justice to Xiao

238
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:21,572
regardless of the conflicts
between him and me.

239
00:14:22,772 --> 00:14:23,572
The coming three months

240
00:14:24,332 --> 00:14:26,133
is the compensation for Xiao
over these years.

241
00:14:28,853 --> 00:14:29,532
I know now.

242
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:40,532
Father.

243
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:49,813
I thought we were going
to get you back.

244
00:14:50,412 --> 00:14:52,373
Why did you depart from Yanlan alone?

245
00:14:52,373 --> 00:14:53,253
What has happened to you?

246
00:14:55,572 --> 00:14:56,173
Where's Zai?

247
00:14:57,012 --> 00:14:58,892
Why didn't he come back with you?

248
00:14:58,892 --> 00:14:59,532
Miao.

249
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:02,053
Concerning such a dangerous situation,

250
00:15:02,332 --> 00:15:05,493
it's very hard for us
to make it back here in one piece.

251
00:15:06,092 --> 00:15:06,572
Then,

252
00:15:08,253 --> 00:15:09,092
what about Zai?

253
00:15:12,853 --> 00:15:13,452
Zai

254
00:15:14,933 --> 00:15:16,613
was captured by Pei Yanzhen.

255
00:15:17,493 --> 00:15:18,092
What?

256
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:19,332
That's impossible.

257
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:21,173
Pei Yanzhen has been...

258
00:15:21,173 --> 00:15:23,012
I heard it myself.
How can this not be true?

259
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:24,933
I'm telling the truth.

260
00:15:25,452 --> 00:15:26,733
Pei Yanzhen did that.

261
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:28,693
I have given three two-dots out.

262
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:29,293
It's your turn now.

263
00:15:31,652 --> 00:15:32,532
Six-character from you?

264
00:15:34,572 --> 00:15:35,053
Father.

265
00:15:35,173 --> 00:15:36,493
When are we departing?

266
00:15:36,493 --> 00:15:37,933
I miss Sister very much.

267
00:15:39,532 --> 00:15:41,972
I packed the money two days ago.

268
00:15:42,253 --> 00:15:43,853
Once Third Master Song's men arrive,

269
00:15:44,053 --> 00:15:47,373
we will get to reunite
with Miao and Xiao soon.

270
00:15:47,693 --> 00:15:50,452
May I ask if you're Master Shen Qian?

271
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:56,173
This...

272
00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:57,772
Miao.

273
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,012
What happened to Miao?

274
00:16:01,813 --> 00:16:03,173
I'm the servant
from the Regent's Residence.

275
00:16:03,572 --> 00:16:04,212
According to His Highness,

276
00:16:04,572 --> 00:16:06,933
Miss Shen was almost killed
at Baima Temple in Weiyang.

277
00:16:07,532 --> 00:16:08,452
And she hasn't regained
consciousness.

278
00:16:08,772 --> 00:16:10,373
I'm here to escort you back

279
00:16:10,373 --> 00:16:11,212
to the capital.

280
00:16:11,613 --> 00:16:12,092
What...

281
00:16:12,092 --> 00:16:12,693
What did you say?

282
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:13,813
Miao was almost killed?

283
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:15,173
Who did that?

284
00:16:15,173 --> 00:16:16,253
How's Miao now?

285
00:16:16,253 --> 00:16:16,613
Father.

286
00:16:16,613 --> 00:16:17,613
Ask no more.

287
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:19,212
Sister's life is at stake now.

288
00:16:19,373 --> 00:16:20,693
We better depart now.

289
00:16:21,332 --> 00:16:22,012
You're right.

290
00:16:22,212 --> 00:16:22,853
Hurry up.

291
00:16:22,853 --> 00:16:23,933
Pack some clothes

292
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:24,853
and we will set off now.

293
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:25,452
Sure.

294
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:26,373
Give me a moment.

295
00:16:38,972 --> 00:16:39,933
They are the servants of Song's family.

296
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:40,772
I can invite them over

297
00:16:40,772 --> 00:16:42,012
for the journey back to the capital.

298
00:16:45,053 --> 00:16:47,532
Put me down. What are you doing?

299
00:16:48,012 --> 00:16:48,452
Very good.

300
00:16:48,452 --> 00:16:49,133
Be careful.

301
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:54,733
Thank you so much.

302
00:16:56,493 --> 00:16:56,972
I will carry them.

303
00:17:02,293 --> 00:17:03,092
Where's Zai?

304
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:11,253
Did you see my son, Zai?

305
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:13,133
No.

306
00:17:20,692 --> 00:17:21,932
The scrimshaw deer

307
00:17:22,692 --> 00:17:24,452
is always with Xiao

308
00:17:24,972 --> 00:17:26,452
and never leaves him.

309
00:17:27,452 --> 00:17:28,332
How could it be here?

310
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:30,853
It must be a counterfeit
changed by Pei Yanzhen.

311
00:17:39,972 --> 00:17:41,172
Is everything he did on the way back

312
00:17:42,773 --> 00:17:44,292
out of deception?

313
00:17:45,692 --> 00:17:46,972
It's all but a scheme.

314
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:50,292
I can't believe this.

315
00:17:50,972 --> 00:17:51,572
Miao.

316
00:17:52,212 --> 00:17:55,572
If Third Master Song's men
hadn't escorted us back,

317
00:17:55,893 --> 00:17:57,692
I couldn't imagine what Pei Yanzhen
would've done to us.

318
00:17:58,332 --> 00:17:59,853
We've been looking over our shoulders

319
00:17:59,853 --> 00:18:00,773
and we fear that you...

320
00:18:01,773 --> 00:18:03,533
If anything horrible befalls you,

321
00:18:04,212 --> 00:18:05,092
both of us will...

322
00:18:07,613 --> 00:18:08,413
It's all my fault.

323
00:18:09,013 --> 00:18:10,653
I should've sent more men
to protect you.

324
00:18:11,292 --> 00:18:12,212
I didn't expect

325
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:13,692
Pei Yanzhen could be so fast.

326
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,413
The news of your return

327
00:18:20,972 --> 00:18:21,692
was exposed by me

328
00:18:21,692 --> 00:18:23,212
that night in the relay station.

329
00:18:23,373 --> 00:18:24,452
And it benefitted him
to act one step ahead.

330
00:18:26,452 --> 00:18:27,172
I'm to blame.

331
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:29,653
We have witnessed his capability

332
00:18:29,653 --> 00:18:31,292
in putting showmanship.

333
00:18:31,932 --> 00:18:34,853
But I've never expected
he would do it again so soon.

334
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:36,212
It's not your fault.

335
00:18:37,373 --> 00:18:37,972
Also,

336
00:18:38,373 --> 00:18:40,373
he's the Regent

337
00:18:40,373 --> 00:18:41,452
and he's powerful.

338
00:18:41,812 --> 00:18:43,572
But what is his purpose

339
00:18:43,692 --> 00:18:45,212
of abducting Zai?

340
00:18:50,853 --> 00:18:51,533
I know.

341
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,493
The reason why he wants you to move
into the Regent's Residence

342
00:18:55,853 --> 00:18:58,653
is to wipe out the Shen family.

343
00:19:00,692 --> 00:19:01,812
Back in the days in Lingzhou,

344
00:19:02,133 --> 00:19:03,972
he married you because of money.

345
00:19:04,413 --> 00:19:06,133
A leopard can't change its spots.

346
00:19:06,972 --> 00:19:08,092
Over the years, we have revealed

347
00:19:08,373 --> 00:19:09,893
our identity

348
00:19:10,292 --> 00:19:11,452
to ease the business in Yanlan.

349
00:19:11,853 --> 00:19:13,092
I'm sure he still covets

350
00:19:13,692 --> 00:19:16,052
the fortune of both Shen and Lu family

351
00:19:16,893 --> 00:19:19,812
after failing to find anything
from the scrimshaw deer.

352
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:21,172
I don't think so.

353
00:19:22,212 --> 00:19:23,332
I've already told him

354
00:19:23,613 --> 00:19:25,653
the entire property of the Lu family
has been liquidated into several stores

355
00:19:25,653 --> 00:19:26,893
under the name of the Shen family.

356
00:19:27,172 --> 00:19:28,212
Miaomiao, let me ask you this.

357
00:19:29,332 --> 00:19:31,533
If Old Master Shen weren't saved
by my servants

358
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:32,893
and returned here

359
00:19:32,893 --> 00:19:35,332
just before you moved into
the Regent's Residence,

360
00:19:35,932 --> 00:19:37,653
if you only got to know about
the disappearance of your family

361
00:19:38,253 --> 00:19:40,493
after you're with Pei Yanzhen,

362
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:41,493
what would you do then?

363
00:19:42,092 --> 00:19:43,972
I would save them in every possible way.

364
00:19:44,413 --> 00:19:45,812
That's the intention of his setup.

365
00:19:46,972 --> 00:19:47,653
Miaomiao.

366
00:19:50,373 --> 00:19:51,692
Don't forget about this.

367
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:53,613
Back then,

368
00:19:53,613 --> 00:19:56,172
he tried to eliminate
the Shen family.

369
00:19:56,773 --> 00:19:57,292
It's out of the question

370
00:19:57,972 --> 00:19:59,932
he will let you off easily.

371
00:20:13,773 --> 00:20:14,292
Your Highness.

372
00:20:14,773 --> 00:20:15,692
Please sit down.

373
00:20:17,893 --> 00:20:19,413
She has left with Song Xiyuan
for a long time.

374
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:21,692
How come she's not back yet?

375
00:20:26,452 --> 00:20:28,092
Probably she got held up by something.

376
00:20:28,452 --> 00:20:29,533
Xiao is here.

377
00:20:30,052 --> 00:20:32,092
Shen Miao won't run off alone.

378
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:39,692
Stop walking around in front of me.

379
00:20:40,972 --> 00:20:41,972
I'm getting giddy.

380
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:45,373
For some reason,

381
00:20:46,572 --> 00:20:47,972
I can feel that something comes up.

382
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,092
You're just overwhelmed with joy.

383
00:20:52,092 --> 00:20:53,572
That's why you're anxious.

384
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,692
You're over the moon as the person
you've been waiting for two years

385
00:20:56,052 --> 00:20:56,893
is coming back to you.

386
00:21:03,373 --> 00:21:04,212
I'm going

387
00:21:04,212 --> 00:21:04,613
to confront Pei Yanzhen.

388
00:21:04,613 --> 00:21:05,373
Hold on, Miao.

389
00:21:05,853 --> 00:21:06,853
Since we've discovered the foe's plan,

390
00:21:07,212 --> 00:21:08,572
we'd better make a plan
to deal with it now.

391
00:21:08,972 --> 00:21:10,893
If you show all of the cards
to Pei Yanzhen,

392
00:21:11,332 --> 00:21:12,613
we won't stand a chance to win.

393
00:21:13,212 --> 00:21:13,773
Miao.

394
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:15,413
Master Song is right.

395
00:21:15,572 --> 00:21:17,960
This is a long game.

396
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,373
Father.

397
00:21:18,613 --> 00:21:20,452
Zai and Xiao have fallen prey to him.

398
00:21:20,452 --> 00:21:21,452
We can't wait anymore.

399
00:21:21,452 --> 00:21:21,893
Watch out!

400
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:24,812
Third Master Song.

401
00:21:24,812 --> 00:21:26,172
Master Song.

402
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:27,932
Tie Niu.

403
00:21:28,452 --> 00:21:29,172
Catch the assassin.

404
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:30,932
Faster.

405
00:21:30,932 --> 00:21:32,452
Go get a physician.

406
00:21:52,452 --> 00:21:53,013
Sir.

407
00:21:53,773 --> 00:21:55,653
Is the dart poisonous?

408
00:21:56,172 --> 00:21:57,052
Fortunately, it's not.

409
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,092
But there's a groove on the arrow.

410
00:21:59,773 --> 00:22:00,653
Concerning Official Song's injury,

411
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:02,332
he needs some time to recuperate.

412
00:22:03,733 --> 00:22:04,172
All right.

413
00:22:04,172 --> 00:22:04,972
Thank you, sir.

414
00:22:06,932 --> 00:22:07,493
Miaomiao.

415
00:22:07,932 --> 00:22:08,773
Fret not.

416
00:22:09,572 --> 00:22:10,893
I look frail from the outside,

417
00:22:11,253 --> 00:22:12,692
but I practice martial art skills too.

418
00:22:13,493 --> 00:22:14,292
My body is tough.

419
00:22:15,413 --> 00:22:15,932
Take a seat.

420
00:22:22,972 --> 00:22:23,413
Master.

421
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:25,572
Master.

422
00:22:25,893 --> 00:22:26,413
Look.

423
00:22:26,893 --> 00:22:28,373
This was found in the murderer.

424
00:22:31,013 --> 00:22:31,733
You may leave now.

425
00:22:32,013 --> 00:22:32,452
Yes.

426
00:22:42,013 --> 00:22:43,653
The murderer who shot my father today.

427
00:22:46,373 --> 00:22:47,013
Was it him?

428
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,880
(Song's Residence)

429
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,332
No.

430
00:23:19,013 --> 00:23:19,733
No, you can't go.

431
00:23:20,292 --> 00:23:21,773
Why do you risk your life

432
00:23:21,812 --> 00:23:22,733
to confront him?

433
00:23:23,052 --> 00:23:24,893
Can you please consider me and Xiao?

434
00:23:25,452 --> 00:23:26,172
Have you ever thought

435
00:23:26,373 --> 00:23:27,653
that how miserable we will be

436
00:23:27,653 --> 00:23:28,853
to lose you again?

437
00:23:30,373 --> 00:23:31,812
But I have no choice now.

438
00:23:32,172 --> 00:23:33,613
Zai is in his hand.

439
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:35,052
If I don't enter his residence

440
00:23:35,052 --> 00:23:36,212
to look for clues,

441
00:23:36,493 --> 00:23:37,413
concerning Pei Yanzhen's character,

442
00:23:37,413 --> 00:23:38,893
I will never be able to see Zai again.

443
00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:43,212
If Pei Yanzhen comes after

444
00:23:43,733 --> 00:23:45,653
the fortune of the Shen family,

445
00:23:46,013 --> 00:23:47,133
he must have a foolproof plan

446
00:23:47,172 --> 00:23:48,133
aside from kidnapping Zai.

447
00:23:48,373 --> 00:23:49,572
If you confront him unprepared,

448
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,133
you will expose
your parents' whereabouts,

449
00:23:51,133 --> 00:23:52,493
let alone rescue Zai.

450
00:23:52,493 --> 00:23:53,413
Have you thought of these?

451
00:23:59,092 --> 00:23:59,653
Miaomiao.

452
00:24:01,253 --> 00:24:02,413
You have to consider Xiao

453
00:24:03,452 --> 00:24:04,932
and all of us before you decide.

454
00:24:05,692 --> 00:24:08,373
There are many choices
other than Pei Yanzhen in this world.

455
00:24:10,092 --> 00:24:10,812
Probably you will have a better choice

456
00:24:12,052 --> 00:24:13,653
after leaving him.

457
00:24:18,092 --> 00:24:20,653
If he really did that to me,

458
00:24:21,692 --> 00:24:23,052
I will never forgive him.

459
00:24:24,493 --> 00:24:25,572
However, I need to know the truth.

460
00:24:27,292 --> 00:24:29,373
Are you sure you can get the truth
out from him?

461
00:24:30,812 --> 00:24:31,972
Old Master Shen was right.

462
00:24:32,572 --> 00:24:34,253
This is a long game.

463
00:24:36,972 --> 00:24:37,493
Miaomiao.

464
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,653
I know what you care about the most.

465
00:24:42,572 --> 00:24:43,972
I will help you in my power

466
00:24:44,853 --> 00:24:46,533
and protect you from harm.

Why haven't you gone to bed?

Mother, you're back.

Let me check.

472
00:25:28,452 --> 00:25:30,092
His lie is impeccable.

473
00:25:31,052 --> 00:25:32,692
I wouldn't have noticed this

474

without the crack on it.

I have something to ask you.

Answer me honestly.

Throughout the journey,

479

did anyone touch it?

480

It was Great-uncle.

Oh, right.

482
00:25:52,292 --> 00:25:53,373
And Official Zhao too.

483
00:25:53,572 --> 00:25:54,773
He said

484
00:25:54,972 --> 00:25:56,052
that he never saw this before.

485
00:25:58,452 --> 00:26:00,812
Actually, when you were away,

486
00:26:01,013 --> 00:26:04,052
Great-uncle would ask this from me

487

whenever he missed you.

488
00:26:11,493 --> 00:26:13,292
Probably he wasn't thinking of me,

489
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:16,212
but to cast a big web.

490

Mother, I don't understand
what you said.

Nothing, Xiao.

00:27:25,092 --> 00:27:25,932
But I heard

507
00:27:25,932 --> 00:27:27,893
that his eyes were already hurt
two years ago.

508
00:27:28,212 --> 00:27:29,013
He went to Weiyang this time

509
00:27:29,092 --> 00:27:30,533
to treat his eyes.

510
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:31,653
Speaking of Official Song,

511
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,533
he was once an influential character
in the imperial court.

512
00:27:34,893 --> 00:27:36,452
But he was exiled to Weiyang
by His Highness.

513
00:27:36,932 --> 00:27:38,493
How come this feuding pair

514
00:27:39,253 --> 00:27:41,533
returned together?

515
00:27:56,172 --> 00:27:56,932
Your Highness,

516
00:27:57,932 --> 00:27:59,893
you look great today.

517
00:28:01,172 --> 00:28:03,452
However, I'm not better than you.
How fortunate of you.

518
00:28:03,733 --> 00:28:05,253
I heard that you were shot yesterday.

519
00:28:05,253 --> 00:28:07,052
Yet you return in a tip-top form today.

520
00:28:07,893 --> 00:28:08,613
People might think

521
00:28:08,932 --> 00:28:11,133
that your wound is a fake one.

522
00:28:17,773 --> 00:28:19,653
Here comes His Majesty.

523
00:28:26,613 --> 00:28:30,773
- Long live the emperor.
- Long live the emperor.

524
00:28:31,092 --> 00:28:32,013
Rise.

525
00:28:32,413 --> 00:28:34,052
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

526
00:28:40,613 --> 00:28:42,292
You're finally back.

527
00:28:43,092 --> 00:28:43,853
With both of you here,

528
00:28:44,373 --> 00:28:45,692
I can be at ease now.

529
00:28:46,493 --> 00:28:48,052
It's my great pleasure

530
00:28:48,413 --> 00:28:50,172
to be trusted by you, Your Majesty.

531
00:28:55,052 --> 00:28:55,493
Your Majesty.

532
00:28:56,452 --> 00:28:57,972
I heard that there was
an unrest at the border

533
00:28:58,773 --> 00:29:00,373
while I was on my way back from Weiyang.

534
00:29:00,692 --> 00:29:01,413
May I ask

535
00:29:01,812 --> 00:29:02,533
what has happened?

536
00:29:04,572 --> 00:29:06,692
This is what has been
bothering me.

537
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:08,893
Our neighboring country
has been creating disturbances

538
00:29:09,133 --> 00:29:09,893
for centuries.

539
00:29:10,493 --> 00:29:12,332
They deployed the army troops

540
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:13,452
to harass the frontier

541
00:29:13,893 --> 00:29:15,172
when you were away.

542
00:29:15,773 --> 00:29:16,653
That's hateful.

543
00:29:17,212 --> 00:29:18,413
I've dispatched troops to suppress.

544
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:22,212
Unexpectedly, the terrain and weather
in the grassland are complicated.

545
00:29:22,692 --> 00:29:23,812
And the war ended

546
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:25,773
in a dead heat.

547
00:29:26,533 --> 00:29:29,653
A few days ago, the Prince sent
a missive to negotiate for peace.

548
00:29:29,932 --> 00:29:31,172
They wanted a truce

549
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:33,533
and promised
to stop meddling in our land.

550
00:29:34,292 --> 00:29:35,533
For the well-being of the two nations,

551
00:29:35,812 --> 00:29:37,092
they requested a marital union with us

552
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:38,853
so as to forge a good diplomatic bond.

553
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:42,092
However,

554
00:29:44,812 --> 00:29:46,932
they asked to marry my younger sister,

555
00:29:47,493 --> 00:29:48,253
Ninth Princess.

556
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:52,653
Request for Ninth Princess?

557
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:01,653
Master.

558
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:02,572
Just now,

559
00:30:02,572 --> 00:30:03,653
several officials

560
00:30:03,653 --> 00:30:05,373
wanted to invite you
to Guchun Restaurant

561
00:30:05,452 --> 00:30:08,172
for the allied marriage discussion.

562
00:30:08,452 --> 00:30:09,853
Master, who's sent
for the allied marriage?

563
00:30:09,853 --> 00:30:10,773
Don't ask so much.

564
00:30:11,133 --> 00:30:13,332
Never let Miaomiao know about this.

565
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:14,493
Otherwise, she'll be worried.

566
00:30:15,932 --> 00:30:16,533
Official Pei.

567
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,172
Are you heading home?

568
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:22,332
Of course.

569
00:30:22,332 --> 00:30:22,893
What a coincidence.

570
00:30:23,373 --> 00:30:25,292
I'm going to visit Xiao too.

571
00:30:25,893 --> 00:30:26,452
Why don't we go together?

572
00:30:32,092 --> 00:30:32,572
Official Pei.

573
00:30:33,212 --> 00:30:33,812
Why dawdle?

574
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,013
Get on the carriage.

575
00:30:36,572 --> 00:30:37,972
Please, Official Pei.

576
00:30:49,733 --> 00:30:52,212
Official Song, you're kind of clingy.

577
00:30:52,972 --> 00:30:53,493
Why?

578
00:30:53,972 --> 00:30:55,292
Are you not accepting me as a guest?

579
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:56,692
Don't tell me

580
00:30:56,692 --> 00:30:58,452
you speak ill of me

581
00:30:58,853 --> 00:31:00,253
because of my dashing look.

582
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,920
(Calmness)

583
00:31:02,692 --> 00:31:03,733
Surely, you jest.

584
00:31:04,413 --> 00:31:05,653
I'm not like someone

585
00:31:06,212 --> 00:31:07,212
who intends

586
00:31:07,373 --> 00:31:08,893
to steal away

587
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:10,572
other's wife and son.

588
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:13,212
Lvying.

589
00:31:13,212 --> 00:31:15,253
I've written some discourses
on the politics.

590
00:31:15,253 --> 00:31:16,212
Please review it.

591
00:31:16,373 --> 00:31:16,853
Gosh, Young Master.

592
00:31:16,853 --> 00:31:17,972
Please spare me.

593
00:31:18,572 --> 00:31:19,853
It's impossible

594
00:31:20,172 --> 00:31:21,092
for me

595
00:31:21,092 --> 00:31:22,013
to fathom such profound knowledge.

596
00:31:22,212 --> 00:31:24,013
Lvying, you will be
learning strategies

597
00:31:24,013 --> 00:31:26,212
of doing business
as you stay by Mother's side.

598
00:31:26,212 --> 00:31:27,733
You ought to learn from now.

599
00:31:27,733 --> 00:31:28,572
Tell me

600
00:31:28,572 --> 00:31:29,572
what you don't understand.

601
00:31:31,853 --> 00:31:32,853
Oh, I almost forgot

602
00:31:32,853 --> 00:31:34,692
the chicken soup in the kitchen.

603
00:31:34,972 --> 00:31:35,853
Miss will blame me

604
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:36,733
if it is overcooked.

605
00:31:36,733 --> 00:31:37,932
Right?

606
00:31:38,172 --> 00:31:39,052
I must check on it now.

607
00:31:40,092 --> 00:31:41,373
Lvying.

608
00:31:54,572 --> 00:31:55,172
Not bad.

609
00:31:55,653 --> 00:31:56,692
Not bad?

610
00:31:57,212 --> 00:31:58,613
It's very good.

611
00:31:58,733 --> 00:31:59,332
Brilliant.

612
00:31:59,452 --> 00:32:00,452
Excellent.

613
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:01,692
Xiao.

614
00:32:02,292 --> 00:32:03,052
Never be

615
00:32:03,052 --> 00:32:03,932
clever clogs like him

616
00:32:03,932 --> 00:32:04,893
when you grow up.

617
00:32:07,572 --> 00:32:08,733
Of course, he's considered excellent

618
00:32:09,653 --> 00:32:10,733
compared to you, Third Master Song.

619
00:32:11,733 --> 00:32:12,373
Xiao.

620
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:15,212
One usually gets less than expected
when he aims at mediocrity,

621
00:32:15,692 --> 00:32:17,212
let alone those who aim for lower goals.

622
00:32:17,733 --> 00:32:20,133
You must take a longer view.

623
00:32:23,212 --> 00:32:23,932
Xiao.

624
00:32:25,452 --> 00:32:26,013
What's wrong?

625
00:32:31,893 --> 00:32:32,413
Miao.

626
00:32:33,013 --> 00:32:33,893
What's wrong?

627
00:32:38,733 --> 00:32:40,653
Probably I got tired
after the journey back.

628
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:42,052
Your Highness,
you must be occupied with work.

629
00:32:42,332 --> 00:32:43,133
Please don't let us keep you.

630
00:32:44,572 --> 00:32:45,133
Third Master Song.

631
00:32:45,613 --> 00:32:46,733
May I have a word with you?

632
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:55,613
Gentlemen shouldn't force others

633
00:32:56,013 --> 00:32:57,253
to go on their way.

634
00:32:58,572 --> 00:33:00,773
Official Pei, you're a scholar.

635
00:33:01,853 --> 00:33:03,853
I think you understand what it means.

636
00:33:08,212 --> 00:33:08,893
Song Xiyuan.

637
00:33:10,533 --> 00:33:11,572
I don't care what you're plotting.

638
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:12,972
Stay away from Miao and Xiao.

639
00:33:13,172 --> 00:33:15,212
I should say that to you instead.

640
00:33:15,733 --> 00:33:17,373
After all, you're the one

641
00:33:17,733 --> 00:33:18,653
who always brings troubles to them.

642
00:33:19,212 --> 00:33:20,373
What do you ask for?

643
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:22,572
I want you to leave the capital

644
00:33:23,092 --> 00:33:23,893
and stay out of the sight of Miaomiao.

645
00:33:24,572 --> 00:33:25,373
That's impossible.

646
00:33:27,733 --> 00:33:29,052
If so, we have nothing to talk about.

647
00:33:29,373 --> 00:33:30,493
And we don't have to pretend anymore.

648
00:33:30,932 --> 00:33:31,493
Your Highness.

649
00:33:32,452 --> 00:33:33,692
We will work our magic.

650
00:33:44,373 --> 00:33:44,893
Miaomiao.

651
00:33:51,052 --> 00:33:51,972
Have you found any clues about Zai

652
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,092
from the residence?

653
00:33:56,733 --> 00:33:57,413
It's fine.

654
00:33:57,932 --> 00:33:58,733
Don't worry.

655
00:33:59,092 --> 00:34:00,013
Let's go back

656
00:34:00,212 --> 00:34:01,253
and plan.

657
00:34:01,413 --> 00:34:01,893
All right?

658
00:34:02,972 --> 00:34:03,533
Third Master Song.

659
00:34:04,452 --> 00:34:05,972
You have done so much for me.

660
00:34:06,613 --> 00:34:07,572
When we were in Weiyang for two years,

661
00:34:08,732 --> 00:34:10,373
you made my heroine's dream come true.

662
00:34:11,052 --> 00:34:11,933
And for the three years in Lingzhou,

663
00:34:12,613 --> 00:34:14,213
thank you for taking care
of Xiao for me.

664
00:34:15,732 --> 00:34:16,373
However,

665
00:34:18,133 --> 00:34:19,853
I need to do this myself.

666
00:34:20,213 --> 00:34:22,413
I'm afraid that I can't repay

667
00:34:22,973 --> 00:34:24,173
all your kindness

668
00:34:24,572 --> 00:34:25,732
if I get you involved again.

669
00:34:29,252 --> 00:34:30,292
Please don't push me away.

670
00:34:31,572 --> 00:34:31,933
Miaomiao.

671
00:34:33,373 --> 00:34:34,173
Tell me honestly.

672
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:35,973
What do I mean to you?

673
00:34:39,933 --> 00:34:40,572
Friend.

674
00:34:52,213 --> 00:34:52,693
Well.

675
00:34:53,613 --> 00:34:55,012
Even though you just regard me
as your friend,

676
00:34:55,532 --> 00:34:57,213
I can't put you in danger alone.

677
00:34:57,693 --> 00:34:59,413
I can't stand the pain
I have had for the past two years.

678
00:34:59,613 --> 00:35:00,732
Could you promise me

679
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:02,252
for the sake of Xiao and your parents?

680
00:35:02,732 --> 00:35:03,373
All right?

681
00:35:07,893 --> 00:35:10,572
Actually, I have a plan.

682
00:35:10,973 --> 00:35:12,092
As long as you collaborate with me,

683
00:35:12,413 --> 00:35:13,492
we can find Zai for sure.

684
00:35:14,732 --> 00:35:15,213
Will you

685
00:35:17,052 --> 00:35:17,893
give it a try?

686
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,980
(Regent's Residence)

687
00:35:30,492 --> 00:35:31,133
Pei Yanzhen.

688
00:35:39,532 --> 00:35:40,732
Pei Yanzhen, what's wrong with you?

689
00:35:41,213 --> 00:35:42,092
Sitting there in silence.

690
00:35:47,532 --> 00:35:49,453
You acted weirdly since the afternoon.

691
00:35:49,933 --> 00:35:50,413
What happened?

692
00:35:54,213 --> 00:35:55,893
Probably Shen Miao has given her trust
to Third Master Song

693
00:35:55,893 --> 00:35:57,772
instead of you.

694
00:35:58,653 --> 00:35:59,572
Well.

695
00:35:59,933 --> 00:36:00,973
It's not her fault.

696
00:36:01,572 --> 00:36:02,613
Official Song

697
00:36:02,973 --> 00:36:04,332
is honey-lipped and amusing.

698
00:36:04,732 --> 00:36:05,213
Unlike you,

699
00:36:05,732 --> 00:36:06,732
you're eccentric

700
00:36:07,052 --> 00:36:07,772
and refuse to clear up

701
00:36:07,973 --> 00:36:09,213
the misunderstandings.

702
00:36:09,532 --> 00:36:10,373
Serve you right.

703
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:15,373
Pei Yanzhen.

704
00:36:16,012 --> 00:36:17,092
You ungrateful fellow.

705
00:36:17,492 --> 00:36:18,373
I just came back from Song's Residence

706
00:36:18,492 --> 00:36:20,373
with some information.

707
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:22,332
What have you found?

708
00:36:36,373 --> 00:36:36,973
Banknotes?

709
00:36:37,893 --> 00:36:38,732
Well, I will tell you then.

710
00:36:39,213 --> 00:36:41,213
Shen Miao's parents have returned here.

711
00:36:41,453 --> 00:36:42,693
However, Shen Zai is nowhere to be seen.

712
00:36:43,213 --> 00:36:43,933
Do you think

713
00:36:44,532 --> 00:36:45,373
Song Xiyuan would make use of this

714
00:36:45,373 --> 00:36:47,133
to plot against us?

715
00:36:47,453 --> 00:36:48,853
I can scout more for you.

716
00:36:49,252 --> 00:36:51,012
As long as you offer more money.

717
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,460
(Yanzhen, the evil intention
of Yanlan becomes apparent.)

718
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,860
(They deployed troops to harass our land
when you were away.)

719
00:37:00,853 --> 00:37:01,332
What?

720
00:37:02,373 --> 00:37:02,973
Yes, that's true.

721
00:37:04,213 --> 00:37:04,973
His Majesty intends

722
00:37:05,213 --> 00:37:06,532
to send Ninth Princess
for the allied marriage.

723
00:37:11,213 --> 00:37:12,332
You should give it some thought.

724
00:37:31,893 --> 00:37:32,893
The attack from the neighboring country

725
00:37:33,092 --> 00:37:34,252
was because of the drought
in their place

726
00:37:34,373 --> 00:37:35,453
and they lack food supplies.

727
00:37:35,893 --> 00:37:37,173
The allied marriage
isn't their real motive.

728
00:37:38,213 --> 00:37:39,693
Perhaps we can organize a trade

729
00:37:39,973 --> 00:37:41,173
with them.

730
00:37:41,732 --> 00:37:42,693
We can trade them the rice grains

731
00:37:42,853 --> 00:37:43,572
and linen fabrics

732
00:37:43,732 --> 00:37:45,973
for their steeds and weapons.

733
00:37:46,413 --> 00:37:47,133
Probably that will hit the spot.

734
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:49,413
Therefore, we don't have to
send Princess for allied marriage.

735
00:37:50,012 --> 00:37:51,213
And it will

736
00:37:51,693 --> 00:37:53,492
solve the pain in the pack
that has lasted for centuries.

737
00:37:57,893 --> 00:37:58,732
According to what you said,

738
00:38:00,373 --> 00:38:01,732
it's a brilliant proposition.

739
00:38:20,012 --> 00:38:20,693
Please forgive me.

740
00:38:21,772 --> 00:38:23,853
My friend is too reserved to speak.

741
00:38:24,693 --> 00:38:26,853
So I have to help him out.

742
00:38:36,173 --> 00:38:37,213
Hongque, where are you taking me?

743
00:38:37,572 --> 00:38:38,933
I have to try on the wedding gown.

744
00:38:39,973 --> 00:38:40,453
Be careful.

745
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,492
Zhan Yue.

746
00:38:44,453 --> 00:38:45,052
Your Highness.

747
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:49,173
Who asked you to come here?

748
00:38:51,812 --> 00:38:53,012
Did Brother send you to escort me
for the allied marriage

749
00:38:53,772 --> 00:38:54,812
because of your great skills?

750
00:38:54,973 --> 00:38:55,453
No.

751
00:38:56,453 --> 00:38:57,092
Why are you here then?

752
00:39:04,213 --> 00:39:05,332
I found this.

753
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,012
Please don't lose it again.

754
00:39:09,853 --> 00:39:10,492
All right?

755
00:39:29,292 --> 00:39:30,012
Pass it to Pei Yanzhen.

756
00:39:34,012 --> 00:39:36,092
Gosh, I beg of you.

757
00:39:45,052 --> 00:39:46,653
Zhan Yue.

758
00:39:51,572 --> 00:39:52,453
I didn't lose it.

759
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:56,373
I just don't deserve this.

760
00:39:57,332 --> 00:39:57,893
Your Highness.

761
00:40:00,173 --> 00:40:01,973
This paper crane is stupid.

762
00:40:04,772 --> 00:40:06,732
It lied that it wanted freedom

763
00:40:07,413 --> 00:40:09,492
because it doesn't deserve
a warm embrace.

764
00:40:12,133 --> 00:40:13,012
Can you please

765
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:14,732
accept its apology?

766
00:40:40,292 --> 00:40:41,252
- Miss.
- Miss.

767
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:27,332
(Zai seems)

768
00:41:28,173 --> 00:41:30,012
(to be locked up in another place.)

769
00:41:31,052 --> 00:41:32,012
(I must think of a way)

770
00:41:33,213 --> 00:41:34,732
(to make him tell me.)

771
00:41:46,373 --> 00:41:46,933
Master.

772
00:41:50,492 --> 00:41:51,772
You just got injured

773
00:41:51,772 --> 00:41:52,973
and you need some rest.

774
00:41:53,252 --> 00:41:55,532
But it seems you're in a good mood
to play with the bird.

775
00:41:55,893 --> 00:41:56,653
It's boring though.

776
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:58,933
This bird can ward off my boredom.

777
00:42:00,012 --> 00:42:01,973
Go and check on Old Master Shen
if he needs anything.

778
00:42:01,973 --> 00:42:02,973
Do treat them nicely.

779
00:42:04,092 --> 00:42:04,772
Yes, Master.

780
00:42:09,532 --> 00:42:10,373
Third Master Song.

781
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:11,653
You're mighty and brave.

782
00:42:12,173 --> 00:42:12,933
Third Master Song.

783
00:42:13,252 --> 00:42:14,252
You're wise and resourceful.

784
00:42:15,213 --> 00:42:15,772
Excellent.

785
00:42:16,532 --> 00:42:17,133
Say something else.

786
00:42:18,213 --> 00:42:20,092
Annihilate the Song family.

787
00:42:20,812 --> 00:42:21,693
Hey.

788
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:23,732
I've taught you many times.
Can't you remember it well?

789
00:42:24,413 --> 00:42:27,413
It should be
"annihilate the Shen family".

790
00:42:27,772 --> 00:42:28,492
Can you remember that?

791
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:32,012
Annihilate the Shen family.

792
00:42:32,613 --> 00:42:34,572
Annihilate the Shen family.

793
00:42:35,572 --> 00:42:36,052
Well done.
