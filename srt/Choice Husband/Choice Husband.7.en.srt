167
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:37,649
Don't worry.

168
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:39,610
This is nothing.

169
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:51,889
Hurry!

170
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:52,850
Hurry!

171
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:53,449
Coming!

172
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:55,610
Get more water!

173
00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:57,009
Get another two buckets of water!

174
00:10:58,529 --> 00:10:59,410
Lower the sedan!

175
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:00,009
Be careful.

176
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:01,490
Miss,

177
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:02,889
I think something happened
at Pei's Residence.

178
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:04,769
Here.

179
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:06,970
Coming.

180
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:07,769
Hurry!

181
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:10,769
It's not enough! Get more water!

182
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:14,889
Useless servants!

183
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,250
Did you not take
any precautionary measures at all?

184
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,490
Yanzhen must've been
too lenient on all of you!

185
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:23,930
Fang Dazhu!

186
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:24,930
- Fang Dazhu!
- Madam...

187
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,050
What happened?

188
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:26,529
Miss Shen.

189
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:27,290
Perfect timing.

190
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:29,009
This matter is too strange.

191
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,410
The fire came too suddenly.

192
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,009
Someone even broke the water tank.

193
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:34,970
Guard Zhan happened to be away as well.

194
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:35,930
That's how things got this bad.

195
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,649
There are many important
ancient scriptures and paintings inside.

196
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,810
Someone must've done this on purpose.

197
00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:41,649
Lvying,

198
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,649
get the people from our residence
to help put out the fire.

199
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:44,769
If there isn't enough water,

200
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:46,730
use Official Pei's name to borrow more
from the other residences.

201
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:47,410
Hurry!

202
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:48,170
Yes.

203
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:49,529
You guys come with me!

204
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:50,170
- Yes!
- Yes!

205
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,170
Hurry!

206
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,209
Hurry, everyone!

207
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,290
Quickly!

208
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:54,410
Who is she?

209
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:55,209
Hurry!

210
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:57,290
Why do the servants of the Pei family
listen to her commands?

211
00:11:58,129 --> 00:11:59,850
From what I heard just now,

212
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:01,129
her surname seems to be Shen.

213
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:02,769
Shen?

214
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,170
I'll pay 20 times more!

215
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:06,290
20 times!

216
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,970
I'll offer 30 times more!
I'm taking all of them!

217
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:08,410
These,

218
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,170
these,

219
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,089
and all of these too.

220
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,930
You uncivilized peasant!

221
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,050
How dare you oppose me!

222
00:12:15,689 --> 00:12:16,850
It's her!

223
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,490
All right. Shen Miao.

224
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,410
She must've done that
on purpose that day.

225
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,649
I'll show her!

226
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,290
The words are too small.

227
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,490
I can't read them.

228
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:48,649
Tie Niu,

229
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,529
read them out loud for me.

230
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:51,370
Yes.

231
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:54,930
On the fourth day of October...

232
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:55,730
I say,

233
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,170
Master Song,

234
00:12:57,529 --> 00:12:59,410
you've barely
gone through them for two hours.

235
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,610
Yet, you're already taking breaks
and having refreshments.

236
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,050
Do you plan on staying here

237
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,449
for months or years?

238
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:06,490
Sir!

239
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,209
This is bad!

240
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:10,410
There is a fire at Pei's Residence!

241
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:16,209
A fire is a serious matter.

242
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,810
Are you sure you don't need
to make a trip home?

243
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,089
You...

244
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:34,610
Fan me.

245
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:36,009
Yes.

246
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,689
Why did you stop me?

247
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:56,209
Miss,

248
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,769
there is a fire.

249
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,050
You should go somewhere safe,

250
00:13:59,050 --> 00:13:59,970
so you don't get hurt.

251
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,529
Don't touch me!

252
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:03,810
I am royalty!

253
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,730
I'm not someone
a peasant like you can touch!

254
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,209
I didn't know you are the princess.

255
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:11,089
Forgive me, Your Highness.

256
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,120
(Pei's Residence)

257
00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:14,730
Steward.

258
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,730
This is the Ninth Princess.

259
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,170
Send someone to escort her

260
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,250
to the other residence at once!

261
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:20,610
Things are chaotic here right now.

262
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,610
You mustn't let Her Highness get hurt.

263
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:22,730
Go back to what you were doing!

264
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,490
Don't try to play games with me.

265
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,329
You're the one I met
at the temple of love and fate!

266
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:33,370
- Temple of love and fate?
- Over here.

267
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,209
What are you talking about?

268
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:36,370
Lvying,

269
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,089
is there such a temple in Lingzhou?

270
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:43,290
There is the Daming Temple in the east

271
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,649
and the Great Buddhist Temple
in the west.

272
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:45,930
But I've never heard
of the temple of love and fate.

273
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,970
It's the one where you go
to pray for a good marriage.

274
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,290
What was its name again?

275
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:50,850
Everyone in the city knows

276
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,209
that Miss Shen
never leaves the residence.

277
00:14:53,689 --> 00:14:55,009
She can't be the one
you're referring to.

278
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,810
You must've been mistaken.

279
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,209
Even if you weren't the one
who offended me that day,

280
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:02,569
you're a divorced woman.

281
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:04,370
Today is the wedding day
of your second marriage.

282
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,250
What gives you the right to interfere
with the Pei family's affairs?

283
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,449
Haven't you sullied
Pei Yanzhen's reputation enough?

284
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:10,810
Your Highness is right to remind me.

285
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,329
Lvying,

286
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:13,490
let's go.

287
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:15,490
The water is here.

288
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,209
Are we going to leave just like this?

289
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:23,490
Listen up!

290
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:26,610
Everyone here must ensure
that the residence stays in one piece!

291
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,290
If anything goes wrong,

292
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:29,889
you will be punished severely!

293
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:36,129
The Ninth Princess is right.

294
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:41,250
I have no position to interfere
with the Pei family anymore.

295
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,560
(Lingzhou Government Office)

296
00:15:47,569 --> 00:15:49,009
(Lingzhou Government Office)
Don't think this is the end of it.

297
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:51,170
Once Official Pei
deals with his family matters,

298
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:52,689
(Lingzhou Government Office)
he'll punish all of you!

299
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,569
My young master is an upright man.

300
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,089
How dare you slander him!

301
00:15:58,089 --> 00:15:58,970
Upright?

302
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:05,209
Right.

303
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:07,209
You're dumb.

304
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:09,569
You wouldn't be able to tell

305
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,370
even if your young master did something.

306
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:12,050
You...

307
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:13,850
Watch where you are.

308
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:24,610
Official Pei,

309
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:26,769
I'll take my leave now.

310
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:29,889
My bride is waiting for me at home
to celebrate our wedding night together.

311
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,009
Let's go.

312
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:33,449
Young Master.

313
00:16:33,689 --> 00:16:34,170
Please.

314
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:37,689
It's quite stuffy in there.

315
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:38,970
The weather is nice today.

316
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:40,810
I'll walk instead.

317
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:43,290
Let's go.

318
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:47,889
Sir,

319
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:48,970
are you letting them go just like that?

320
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:51,050
There will be other opportunities.

321
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,370
Let's return to the residence first.

322
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:10,850
Lvying,

323
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:11,890
what's going on here?

324
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:13,449
I heard that

325
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:16,289
before Third Master Song was born,
a fortune teller told Madam Song

326
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,010
(Madam Xia)
that if her firstborn were a son,

327
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,370
(Madam Chun)
he wouldn't live past a month.

328
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,169
So Master Song named him
Third Master Song.

329
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:25,530
Such a trick.

330
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,610
He hoped it would fend off the spirits
from taking him away from them.

331
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,370
They hoped that if they pretended
they had already lost two sons,

332
00:17:31,569 --> 00:17:32,890
the third may be spared.

333
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:34,569
After Madam Song passed away,

334
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:35,890
Master Song's two concubines,
Madam Chun and Madam Xia

335
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,890
took over the management of all
internal matters of the residence.

336
00:17:38,569 --> 00:17:41,049
The two young masters next to them
are their sons.

337
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,730
Fourth Young Master
and Fifth Young Master.

338
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:47,089
The water in the Song family

339
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:48,970
runs much deeper than I expected.

340
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,329
I heard the Shen family
is a reputable family.

341
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,530
But their daughter
has such poor manners.

342
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:57,890
Doesn't she know
that she should serve her elders tea

343
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,569
on the day she joins
her husband's family?

344
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,890
Don't scare the bride.

345
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,130
We're a family from now on.

346
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,650
Although we are just concubines,

347
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,289
we are still considered to be
your mother-in-laws.

348
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,010
Don't be afraid of us.

349
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:13,770
I'm not.

350
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,569
So, are both of you going
to play good guy and bad guy

351
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:18,610
to intimidate me

352
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:19,850
on my first day here?

353
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:21,850
Listen to this kid.

354
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,650
What nonsense is she saying?

355
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,089
All we would do is dote on you.

356
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:27,890
Come

357
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,490
and meet your sisters.

358
00:18:32,289 --> 00:18:32,890
Come in.

359
00:18:42,209 --> 00:18:43,370
I didn't know Third Master Song

360
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,370
has so many sisters.

361
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,289
Did you not do a thorough check?

362
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:46,530
I don't know anything about this.

363
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,770
Greetings, Madam.

364
00:18:49,089 --> 00:18:50,250
No need to be so courteous.

365
00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:53,970
I see my father-in-law
was free with his love.

366
00:18:54,449 --> 00:18:56,569
I, Shen Miao, greet all of you.

367
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:57,289
Nonsense!

368
00:18:57,809 --> 00:18:59,289
Who are you calling
Old Master's concubines?

369
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,449
We are all Third Master's lovers.

370
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:04,890
- You...
- Are you going to say

371
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:05,169
that

372
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:05,890
you thought

373
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,289
I was some
sort of fascinating character,

374
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:09,370
but after seeing me today,
I don't appear all that special?

375
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:10,289
This is all...

376
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:11,010
Are you going to say

377
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,569
that since all of us serve Third Master,

378
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:13,890
we shouldn't make things difficult
for each other

379
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,130
to keep the peace
between the wife and concubines

380
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:15,730
and harmony in the family?

381
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,049
You...

382
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:16,530
And you.

383
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,370
You're going to intimidate me

384
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,010
and threaten me.

385
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:18,650
If necessary,

386
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,289
you'll use the fact that this
is my second marriage

387
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:21,890
to make me obey all of you obediently.

388
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,850
Are you wondering
how I know all of this?

389
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:24,890
No.

390
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,809
No need to hide your true thoughts.

391
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:28,650
Fifth Brother,

392
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,569
if you have so much free time,
read stories and watch plays.

393
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,169
The people
who manage the household affairs

394
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:34,289
in my family put up much better acts

395
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,370
in front of my father

396
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,770
than any of you do.

397
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:37,329
Shen Miao!

398
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:38,650
What are you trying to do?

399
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,049
Lvying,

400
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,730
bring the items in.

401
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:43,530
Yes.

402
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:45,289
Excuse me.

403
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,180
(Song's Maquillage Shop Accounts)

404
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:57,610
These...

405
00:19:58,089 --> 00:19:59,650
Aren't these all
the Song family's accounts?

406
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:00,089
How did you...

407
00:20:00,089 --> 00:20:02,049
I couldn't possibly come unprepared.

408
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:04,449
The Song family
has been merchants for generations.

409
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,209
It is a reputable and well-to-do family.

410
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,250
But just on my first day here,

411
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:08,370
I witnessed a mess in the family.

412
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,770
Concubines not behaving like concubines.

413
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:10,770
Brothers not behaving like brothers.

414
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:11,809
This won't do at all.

415
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,289
What do you want to do?

416
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:15,890
I've married into the Song family.

417
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:18,209
Naturally, that gives me the authority
to manage internal affairs.

418
00:20:19,449 --> 00:20:21,370
Madam Chun and Madam Xia
will be in charge

419
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,490
of purchasing necessities, cleaning,

420
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,650
gardening, and greeting guests.

421
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:25,490
No need to report to me every day.

422
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,370
You only need to monitor, supervise,

423
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,370
and cross-check each other.

424
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,370
However,

425
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:30,970
if one person makes a mistake,

426
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,530
the other will bear
the same responsibility.

427
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,370
But don't worry.

428
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:35,049
Both of you will be given allowances

429
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:36,770
according to what
an official consort would receive.

430
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:39,250
Rest assured.

431
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:40,569
You are my elders.

432
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,010
I won't mistreat you.

433
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,530
Who knows what you have in mind?

434
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:46,370
Fourth Brother. Fifth Brother.

435
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,530
Both of you are grown men.

436
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,449
It won't do for you
to fritter your time away senselessly.

437
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:51,809
Fourth Brother,

438
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,490
I heard you're good at gambling.

439
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,490
Your calculation must be good.

440
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,250
I... I suppose.

441
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,569
How about this?

442
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,370
You'll be responsible for
managing Third Master Song's accounts.

443
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,490
He is frivolous with money.

444
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,130
That's unbecoming of him.

445
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,650
You must rein him in.

446
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,730
Can I do that?

447
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:08,809
Of course.

448
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:09,610
I have high hopes for you.

449
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:10,890
Fifth Brother.

450
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,329
Your voice is loud and clear,

451
00:21:13,329 --> 00:21:14,089
and you have a rosy complexion.

452
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,089
You must handle your liquor well.

453
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:16,730
How about this?

454
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:17,850
From now on,

455
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,850
you'll be in charge
of expanding the family business.

456
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:21,130
I'll give you a share of the profits
according to the ratio.

457
00:21:21,449 --> 00:21:22,010
Is that agreeable?

458
00:21:22,569 --> 00:21:23,130
Sister-in-law,

459
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:26,370
you truly are my benefactor!

460
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,049
Madam,

461
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,610
what about us?

462
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:40,329
Both of you are beauties.

463
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,130
You have good physiques too.

464
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:46,569
You'll be entrusted
with the most important task

465
00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:48,970
of taking care of Third Master Song,
of course.

466
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:52,130
Be sure to serve him well

467
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,809
and make sure

468
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,130
that he is thoroughly satisfied.

469
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,250
Are you truly that magnanimous, Madam?

470
00:21:59,209 --> 00:22:00,209
You'll know the kind of person I am

471
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,569
in time.

472
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,010
All right.

473
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,010
I've said a lot. I'm tired.

474
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:06,209
Lvying,

475
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,289
help me back to my room.

476
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:13,890
Madam is so nice!

477
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:14,449
Indeed.

478
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,049
What are you all grinning for?

479
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:18,329
Have I mistreated

480
00:22:18,329 --> 00:22:19,850
or starved any of you?

481
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,730
She has you eating out of her hand
with just a few words!

482
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:24,530
And you!

483
00:22:25,569 --> 00:22:26,569
Useless!

484
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,449
I wasted time and effort
feeding all of you!

485
00:22:31,329 --> 00:22:32,650
Keep your eyes peeled.

486
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:36,449
This woman
won't be an easy character to handle.

487
00:22:50,449 --> 00:22:51,010
Madam,

488
00:22:51,289 --> 00:22:52,569
all the items you brought
from the Shen family

489
00:22:52,569 --> 00:22:53,689
have been arranged accordingly.

490
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:55,449
Good work.

491
00:22:55,449 --> 00:22:56,250
Madam is tired.

492
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,169
You may leave now.

493
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:58,449
- Yes.
- Yes.

494
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:14,049
How dare he trick me!

495
00:23:14,449 --> 00:23:15,370
I'll give him a piece of my mind

496
00:23:15,449 --> 00:23:16,530
when he comes back!

497
00:23:17,289 --> 00:23:18,010
Miss,

498
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,289
it's your first day here.

499
00:23:19,449 --> 00:23:20,449
Lower your voice.

500
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:21,809
I told him everything

501
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:23,569
about my background
before we got married.

502
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:24,730
But look what he did.

503
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:25,970
He didn't tell me anything

504
00:23:26,209 --> 00:23:27,850
about the mess of his family!

505
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:30,370
If I were any less clever

506
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,209
or poor with words,

507
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,289
I would be

508
00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:33,530
in deep trouble now.

509
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,610
Master Song has it rough as well.

510
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:38,370
He seems so carefree,

511
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,409
but he has
such a problematic family too.

512
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,929
And you think I had it easier

513
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:44,289
with the Pei and Shen families?

514
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:45,689
Am I not worthy of pity?

515
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,169
You're the most pitiful, Miss.

516
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:48,809
Never mind.

517
00:23:49,089 --> 00:23:49,730
Forget about him.

518
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:52,449
Lvying,

519
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,169
go and find out

520
00:23:54,329 --> 00:23:55,530
the situation at Pei's Residence.

521
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,850
Didn't you say
you weren't going to interfere anymore?

522
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:03,449
I'm just worried that Third Master Song
might get caught up in it.

523
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:04,490
Besides,

524
00:24:04,689 --> 00:24:06,610
Pei Yanzhen has Her Highness
to fuss over him.

525
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:07,329
He is not my concern.

526
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,329
Lvying, go and check on them for me.

527
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:12,329
Fine.

528
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:12,929
Hurry.

529
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:21,449
Sir,

530
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,370
everything has been settled.

531
00:24:23,689 --> 00:24:25,569
We didn't suffer many losses

532
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:26,850
except for the few walls
that were blackened by smoke.

533
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:28,610
It's all thanks to you

534
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:29,689
that the residence stayed in one piece.

535
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,929
I do not deserve the credit.

536
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:32,850
It was...

537
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:33,610
Pei Yanzhen!

538
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:35,929
Yanzhen!

539
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:37,490
Spend some time with me.

540
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:39,809
Why didn't you tell me

541
00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:41,289
Her Highness was here?

542
00:24:42,169 --> 00:24:44,010
I helped put out the fire

543
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,329
and protected
all the books and scriptures.

544
00:24:45,329 --> 00:24:46,409
Of course, I would be here.

545
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:48,650
You ought to thank me.

546
00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:49,890
Your Highness, you...

547
00:24:50,809 --> 00:24:51,850
Why are you still here?

548
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:52,409
Leave.

549
00:24:58,929 --> 00:24:59,809
Thank you, Your Highness.

550
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:03,130
I will surely repay your kindness.

551
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,089
But the fire happened too suddenly.

552
00:25:05,089 --> 00:25:05,809
I need

553
00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:07,650
to investigate this matter.

554
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,409
I will visit you again
at a later date to give my thanks.

555
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:10,209
No!

556
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:11,890
I don't want that.

557
00:25:13,089 --> 00:25:14,329
I just want this moment.

558
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,049
I saw Shen Miao today.

559
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:21,770
She was hovering outside suspiciously.

560
00:25:22,449 --> 00:25:24,250
I bet she's the one who set the fire!

561
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:24,730
Really?

562
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:25,890
Of course.

563
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:28,689
She was outside for quite a while.

564
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:30,929
It got a lot of people talking.

565
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:32,689
Yanzhen,

566
00:25:33,209 --> 00:25:34,049
I think

567
00:25:34,329 --> 00:25:35,289
she holds ill intentions.

568
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:39,169
She hurt your reputation
when you got divorced,

569
00:25:39,569 --> 00:25:41,850
and she relentlessly came back today.

570
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,449
You must be tired today.

571
00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:52,449
Get some rest.

572
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,650
There's a garden party
going on in a few days.

573
00:25:55,049 --> 00:25:56,890
Many sons and daughters
of the nobles will be there.

574
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,569
Won't you come with me? Please?

575
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:03,569
Really?

576
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,089
I'll go back and prepare right now!

577
00:26:11,089 --> 00:26:11,770
(Miao...)

578
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:21,250
My dear.

579
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:24,089
I am home.

580
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:26,970
You're smiling so sinisterly.

581
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,130
You must be feeling guilty.

582
00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:29,850
You could tell?

583
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:32,289
My wife is intelligent indeed.

584
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:33,970
What are you doing?

585
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:36,329
Get out.

586
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:37,209
What?

587
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:38,850
Get out.

588
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:40,730
Out!

589
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,490
Hurry up!

590
00:26:43,089 --> 00:26:43,530
You...

591
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,130
You've got special interests, my dear.

592
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:45,970
You want to go outside?

593
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:46,970
Don't tear my clothes!

594
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,010
What if someone else sees us?

595
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:49,250
I've never met anyone

596
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,730
more shameless than you!

597
00:26:51,329 --> 00:26:52,530
Tricking me into taking care
of your family affairs

598
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,209
is one thing.

599
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,970
We agreed we wouldn't
consummate our marriage.

600
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,010
Are you going to go back on your words?

601
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:56,970
My dear,

602
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,169
you've misunderstood.

603
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:01,890
I am at fault for deceiving you.

604
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:04,010
But if I told you,
you might not have married me.

605
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:05,449
Look at the concubines of my father's.

606
00:27:05,449 --> 00:27:07,250
They curse and pray
for my death every day

607
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,370
so they can let
their sons take over my position.

608
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:11,490
If I married an ordinary woman,

609
00:27:11,809 --> 00:27:13,049
I would only ruin her life.

610
00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:14,490
So you chose to ruin mine instead.

611
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:16,610
Dear,

612
00:27:17,449 --> 00:27:19,689
you've got your fair share
of love problems too.

613
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:20,929
We're two of a kind.

614
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,209
We're doing the whole of Lingzhou
a big favor.

615
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:23,689
You...

616
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:27,089
Shameless!

617
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:50,530
Official Pei,

618
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,289
you've fed the fish so much,

619
00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:54,850
but I haven't seen my dinner yet.

620
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:55,610
No witty remarks.

621
00:27:56,289 --> 00:27:57,289
I sent you away from Lingzhou
to investigate a case.

622
00:27:57,289 --> 00:27:58,569
How is that coming along?

623
00:27:59,049 --> 00:27:59,689
Who do you think I am?

624
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:00,409
Here you go.

625
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:03,490
Ever since Third Master Song
took over the Song family business,

626
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:06,610
he managed to get into the tea
and salt business in only a few years.

627
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:07,970
He is a man of means.

628
00:28:08,409 --> 00:28:09,850
It appears that
Song Xiyuan approached Miao

629
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,329
to get his hands
on the Lu family's wealth.

630
00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:14,449
You're still worried about her?

631
00:28:14,449 --> 00:28:15,770
You're in a tough spot yourself.

632
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,089
Her Highness invited me
to enjoy the scenery tomorrow.

633
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:22,530
I accepted her invitation.

634
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:23,850
Why?

635
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:25,650
Her Highness is...

636
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:29,370
Miao still has feelings for me.

637
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:32,209
I can get her
to come back to me with this.

638
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,169
This is called having a strategy.

639
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,530
You've got lots more to learn.

640
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,610
You think too highly of yourself.

641
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:39,850
She still has feelings for you?

642
00:28:40,209 --> 00:28:41,370
Well, she exchanged bows

643
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,490
with someone else before you today.

644
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:45,250
I think

645
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,169
you're the one
who can't forget about her.

646
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:49,250
Zhan Yue.

647
00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:53,929
No dinner for you

648
00:28:55,209 --> 00:28:56,130
tonight.

649
00:29:00,209 --> 00:29:00,809
Pei Yanzhen!

650
00:29:02,329 --> 00:29:02,890
Pei Yanzhen!

651
00:29:12,409 --> 00:29:12,970
I mean,

652
00:29:13,409 --> 00:29:15,209
my wife is such a smart woman.

653
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:18,010
They wanted to intimidate you today,

654
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:19,809
but you turned around

655
00:29:19,809 --> 00:29:21,449
and put them in their places.

656
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,890
I can't thank you enough.

657
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:26,569
You helped me get out
of entering the palace.

658
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:28,130
I had to repay the favor.

659
00:29:28,329 --> 00:29:29,209
Is that all?

660
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:30,409
What else?

661
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:34,049
Aren't you even a little attracted

662
00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:36,370
to a charming and good-looking man
like me?

663
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,049
Not even in the slightest?

664
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:44,169
Forget it.

665
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:47,089
You're drinking more tea?

666
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:47,730
It's late.

667
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:48,530
You should be leaving.

668
00:29:49,209 --> 00:29:50,650
I often wake up thirsty
in the middle of the night.

669
00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:52,010
Better to be prepared.

670
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,089
The tea

671
00:29:55,089 --> 00:29:56,610
will be cold by then.

672
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:59,209
What are you doing?

673
00:29:59,289 --> 00:30:00,890
I said you're not staying here
for the night.

674
00:30:01,289 --> 00:30:02,209
If I don't sleep here

675
00:30:02,449 --> 00:30:03,929
on our wedding night,

676
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,809
how are you going to uphold
your authority in this household?

677
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:07,490
Miaomiao,

678
00:30:07,929 --> 00:30:09,610
I'm doing this for your sake.

679
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,610
Time to sleep.

680
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:15,689
No way.

681
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:17,289
Dear,

682
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:19,610
are you going to sleep on the floor?

683
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:20,490
No.

684
00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:21,569
You are.

685
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,970
(Always be kind)

686
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:34,049
Why aren't they coming out yet?

687
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:35,250
- That's right.
- Why aren't they coming out yet?

688
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:42,530
Here they come!

689
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:44,130
Third Master,

690
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,409
you haven't come to see me in a while.

691
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:50,890
I don't think I know you.

692
00:30:51,209 --> 00:30:52,250
What about me?

693
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,049
Young Master,

694
00:30:53,169 --> 00:30:53,569
you said

695
00:30:53,569 --> 00:30:55,809
my dimples are cute.

696
00:30:57,209 --> 00:30:59,929
I'm sure I said you are cute that

697
00:31:00,169 --> 00:31:01,970
you're perfect
to be a doorkeeper at our residence.

698
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,449
- Madam!
- Madam!

699
00:31:04,449 --> 00:31:06,370
You told us to serve him well.

700
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,370
But look at him.

701
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:08,329
All right.

702
00:31:08,329 --> 00:31:08,770
How about this?

703
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:10,970
He has important tasks
to handle today.

704
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,010
So I won't consider
that you've failed your duties.

705
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:12,569
All right?

706
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:13,530
You may leave now.

707
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,770
- Madam!
- Madam!

708
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:16,970
All right.

709
00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:21,209
I'll assign you an important task

710
00:31:21,329 --> 00:31:23,250
that concerns his health.

711
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:24,370
Do you think you can handle it?

712
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:25,569
Of course.

713
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:26,370
Madam,

714
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:27,490
tell us what we need to do.

715
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:30,250
Get some money from Lvying

716
00:31:30,449 --> 00:31:32,169
and have a small charcoal burner made.

717
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:33,610
Third Master
likes to drink tea throughout the night.

718
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,089
Cold tea is bad for his health.

719
00:31:36,289 --> 00:31:36,650
Yes.

720
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:37,209
Right away.

721
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:38,089
Hurry!

722
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:39,010
- Come on!
- Let's go!

723
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:53,010
My dear,

724
00:31:53,209 --> 00:31:55,250
aren't I principled
and well-disciplined?

725
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:56,850
I don't bat an eyelid

726
00:31:57,049 --> 00:31:58,370
at any other women

727
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:59,809
besides you.

728
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,169
I never let them get close to me.

729
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:02,850
That's rich coming from you.

730
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,770
You've ruined my plans today.

731
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:06,970
Today is my first day
of ruling the household.

732
00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:08,490
But you messed up my plans

733
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:09,809
and gave me so much trouble.

734
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:10,569
Never mind.

735
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:11,650
I can't count on you.

736
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:12,689
Don't interfere
with how I manage things anymore.

737
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:14,530
What?

738
00:32:14,689 --> 00:32:16,010
Go and do what you're supposed to do.

739
00:32:16,089 --> 00:32:17,130
I have to prepare gifts

740
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,490
to comfort the others.

741
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,650
Miaomiao

742
00:32:26,329 --> 00:32:27,530
is spectacular indeed.

743
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:31,289
What?

744
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,010
How dare the Shen family
be so ungrateful!

745
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:40,010
Mother,

746
00:32:40,689 --> 00:32:42,730
love can't be forced.

747
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:43,970
As it is,

748
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,370
we should let this matter go.

749
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,530
A mere merchant

750
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:51,650
dares to defy heaven's will
time and time again.

751
00:32:53,209 --> 00:32:57,049
It is time to clean up Lingzhou City.

752
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,250
What do you mean, Mother?

753
00:33:00,289 --> 00:33:02,250
Find a way to bring Jiu back first.

754
00:33:03,209 --> 00:33:04,089
You'll know the rest

755
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,370
when the time comes.

756
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:09,010
I'm returning to my palace.

757
00:33:21,089 --> 00:33:21,650
Jingde.

758
00:33:22,689 --> 00:33:23,370
Do you think

759
00:33:24,329 --> 00:33:26,409
she still wants
to get rid of Pei Yanzhen?

760
00:33:31,449 --> 00:33:32,409
If that's the case,

761
00:33:33,449 --> 00:33:35,530
that's all the more reason
I can't let Jiu return.

762
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,940
(Bieyi Garden)

763
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:49,329
Your Highness,

764
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,970
your dress looks beautiful.

765
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,610
I begged my brother

766
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,730
to deliver this from the capital
as fast as possible.

767
00:33:55,209 --> 00:33:57,209
These country bumpkins
in Lingzhou wouldn't be able to compare.

768
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,130
How's the job I asked you to do?

769
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:01,929
I've made the arrangements.

770
00:34:02,169 --> 00:34:04,610
But won't Official Pei be mad?

771
00:34:06,089 --> 00:34:07,250
Do you think I want to do this?

772
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:09,010
Mother keeps urging me
to return to the capital.

773
00:34:09,169 --> 00:34:10,129
If I don't seize my chance now,

774
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:11,649
I won't get another opportunity.

775
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:15,449
Find a few guards
that he won't be familiar with.

776
00:34:15,609 --> 00:34:16,330
Tell them

777
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,409
to ambush him in the woods.

778
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,209
Go rough.

779
00:34:19,209 --> 00:34:20,090
No need to hold back.

780
00:34:20,689 --> 00:34:23,010
We can't let Yanzhen notice anything.

781
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:25,090
Let's go.

782
00:34:39,609 --> 00:34:40,050
Miss.

783
00:34:40,609 --> 00:34:41,129
Here.

784
00:34:42,849 --> 00:34:43,330
Come.

785
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:46,849
This is where we'll be staying.

786
00:34:46,849 --> 00:34:48,169
Third Master Song will be here in a bit.

787
00:34:50,209 --> 00:34:51,609
I haven't been out in a while

788
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,250
since I got married.

789
00:34:53,649 --> 00:34:54,849
Third Master Song's a good man.

790
00:34:54,849 --> 00:34:56,570
He knows I can't stand being cooped up.

791
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:58,570
Come on.

792
00:34:58,730 --> 00:34:59,169
Let's go.

793
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:05,409
The air is great.

794
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:13,209
Official Pei.

795
00:35:15,409 --> 00:35:16,129
What a coincidence.

796
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,050
You're a busy man, Official Pei.

797
00:35:20,449 --> 00:35:21,970
How did you find time
to come on an outing?

798
00:35:22,169 --> 00:35:24,010
No need to arrest people
at their weddings?

799
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,090
You jest, Third Master.

800
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:28,730
There aren't many

801
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,970
who would steal and set fire

802
00:35:31,209 --> 00:35:31,849
in Lingzhou City.

803
00:35:33,929 --> 00:35:35,050
I'll be going ahead.

804
00:35:35,449 --> 00:35:37,889
My wife is waiting for me
at the bamboo pavilion.

805
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:39,490
That's a coincidence.

806
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:40,649
I will go there too.

807
00:35:41,449 --> 00:35:43,530
Why don't we go together?

808
00:35:45,929 --> 00:35:48,050
Only if you can keep up.

809
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:49,290
If you ask me,

810
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:50,929
you're a scholar.

811
00:35:50,929 --> 00:35:51,970
It's not something embarrassing,

812
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,209
even if you're slow.

813
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:12,570
I underestimated your horsemanship.

814
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:13,490
What?

815
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,010
Do you have a lover waiting
for you up ahead too?

816
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:17,889
I'm just riding.

817
00:36:18,169 --> 00:36:19,129
I have no intention
of turning this into a competition.

818
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:22,730
Are you trying to win against me?

819
00:36:23,649 --> 00:36:24,530
I am only

820
00:36:24,609 --> 00:36:27,050
going at my usual speed too.

821
00:36:44,449 --> 00:36:45,129
Official Pei,

822
00:36:45,449 --> 00:36:47,010
I see you're sweating.

823
00:36:47,409 --> 00:36:48,849
Are you running low on stamina?

824
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:50,970
You're a government official
of Lingzhou.

825
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:53,010
It would be bad
if something were to happen to you

826
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,050
over a simple race.

827
00:37:05,129 --> 00:37:06,570
You should've given up sooner.

828
00:37:07,129 --> 00:37:08,129
You little brat.

829
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:09,609
You've got a long way to go

830
00:37:10,169 --> 00:37:11,209
before you can become a match for me.

831
00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:40,609
Pei Yanzhen,

832
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:41,929
you plotted against me!

833
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,090
Nothing of the sort.

834
00:37:44,409 --> 00:37:46,409
It's obvious I'm no match
for your horse-riding skills.

835
00:37:47,689 --> 00:37:48,490
Get down here!

836
00:37:54,929 --> 00:37:55,730
You know martial art skills.

837
00:38:02,409 --> 00:38:02,929
Official Pei!

838
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:05,129
Third Master!

839
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:06,530
Official Pei!

840
00:38:07,409 --> 00:38:08,409
Third Master Song,

841
00:38:08,849 --> 00:38:10,449
what are you two doing?

842
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:14,490
Official Pei and I had a match,

843
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,290
and we hit it off.

844
00:38:15,409 --> 00:38:18,010
Of course, that means
we must share woes together too.

845
00:38:19,929 --> 00:38:20,330
Sir.

846
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:20,889
Young Master.

847
00:38:20,889 --> 00:38:21,330
Here.

848
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:21,810
Quickly.

849
00:38:23,689 --> 00:38:24,369
Are you all right, sir?

850
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,730
What is this awful place?

851
00:38:32,609 --> 00:38:33,810
The incense smells terrible.

852
00:38:34,369 --> 00:38:35,050
And

853
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:36,609
who are all these people?

854
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:38,649
No idea.

855
00:38:41,169 --> 00:38:43,369
Her Highness isn't here for you, is she?

856
00:38:44,609 --> 00:38:45,169
It's fine.

857
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:47,090
We just need to avoid her.

858
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:48,209
Let's go.

859
00:38:52,609 --> 00:38:53,649
Miss Shen!

860
00:38:53,929 --> 00:38:55,369
Miss Shen.

861
00:38:55,409 --> 00:38:56,649
No. Madam Song.

862
00:38:56,849 --> 00:38:58,409
Your gold-plated jade hairpin,

863
00:38:58,409 --> 00:38:59,929
gold-thread embroidered dress,

864
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,330
and Yuelinxiang

865
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:03,530
are all the latest products
of the Raiment Pavilion.

866
00:39:04,369 --> 00:39:05,409
Miss Shen,

867
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:06,810
you haven't come out in a while.

868
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:07,889
Yet, today,

869
00:39:07,889 --> 00:39:09,530
you look so glamorous.

870
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:11,649
You must collect yourself, Madam Song.

871
00:39:11,929 --> 00:39:13,689
Third Master Song is young
and holds much promise.

872
00:39:13,689 --> 00:39:15,730
He is charismatic and romantic too.

873
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:17,290
You're blessed.

874
00:39:17,409 --> 00:39:18,330
That's right.

875
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:19,609
Recently, I heard

876
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:22,129
the Empress Dowager is finding
a husband for the Ninth Princess.

877
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,570
It seems
she has her eyes on Official Pei.

878
00:39:24,609 --> 00:39:26,409
Maybe Official Pei divorced you

879
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:27,929
to climb the ladder of power and wealth.

880
00:39:29,929 --> 00:39:30,889
His personal affairs

881
00:39:31,209 --> 00:39:32,689
have nothing to do with me.

882
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:39,929
She meets gains and losses
with equanimity.

883
00:39:40,409 --> 00:39:42,689
She's truly a noble lady of Lingzhou.

884
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,050
In my opinion,

885
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,530
Her Highness isn't much better

886
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,129
than her.

887
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:50,730
Who is she?

888
00:39:51,929 --> 00:39:54,129
How dare you compare me to Shen Miao?

889
00:39:55,409 --> 00:39:56,649
You've got some audacity

890
00:39:56,929 --> 00:39:58,330
to gossip about the royal family!

891
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:00,409
How I get along with Yanzhen

892
00:40:00,889 --> 00:40:04,209
and how he invited me here

893
00:40:04,409 --> 00:40:05,929
is none of your business!

894
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,730
Greetings, Your Highness.

895
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:12,330
I've dressed lightly
for the outing today. You're excused.

896
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,369
You saw that, didn't you?

897
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,649
Thank goodness
we slipped out from the back door.

898
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:24,129
Otherwise, if she saw my attire,

899
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,929
she'll definitely kick up another fuss.

900
00:40:27,209 --> 00:40:28,129
Yes, you're right.

901
00:40:28,689 --> 00:40:29,250
Miss,

902
00:40:29,449 --> 00:40:30,369
wait for me inside.

903
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:31,689
I'll get you a change of clothes.

904
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:32,530
All right.

905
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:39,970
Young Master,

906
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:40,409
what do you think?

907
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:41,369
It fits you, right?

908
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,010
Foolish.

909
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:45,449
I am a man blessed
with natural beauty and charm.

910
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:47,169
I would look good in anything.

911
00:41:00,369 --> 00:41:02,010
Young Master,
he is dressed in the same clothes.

912
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:02,490
Sir!

913
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:03,169
Look.

914
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,369
When two people wear the same clothes,

915
00:41:04,649 --> 00:41:06,609
only the ugly one
finds himself embarrassed.

916
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:13,490
I'll show you.

917
00:41:17,929 --> 00:41:18,490
Tie Niu,

918
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,649
what did he mean?

919
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,490
Does he

920
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,530
look better than me?

921
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:28,730
How did you do your job?

922
00:41:28,889 --> 00:41:30,010
Why did you bring me
the same clothes he is wearing?

923
00:41:30,129 --> 00:41:30,929
These spare clothes

924
00:41:31,169 --> 00:41:32,770
belong to the owner
of the bamboo forest.

925
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:34,129
You chose them yourself.

926
00:41:34,689 --> 00:41:36,250
How is it my fault?

927
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:37,010
You shouldn't have

928
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:39,250
pulled Official Pei down with you.

929
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,849
Things wouldn't be so awkward now.

930
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:43,490
We'll see who feels embarrassed.

931
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:45,409
Hurry up and find me some other clothes!

932
00:41:45,649 --> 00:41:47,050
They must be fancier
and more luxurious than his!

933
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:47,649
Do you hear me?

934
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:51,929
Go!

935
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:04,490
Is that Official Pei?

936
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,010
I think so.

937
00:42:06,209 --> 00:42:07,250
White robes,

938
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,209
tall,

939
00:42:08,209 --> 00:42:09,010
and majestic.

940
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:10,609
Who else could it be

941
00:42:10,609 --> 00:42:11,369
besides him?

942
00:42:13,449 --> 00:42:14,290
In that case,

943
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:15,369
let's make our move.

944
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:16,010
Let's go.

945
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:20,889
Your Highness.

946
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:22,849
Who are you?

947
00:42:23,369 --> 00:42:24,649
Your Highness, it's us.

948
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:26,290
Who?

949
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:27,369
What do you guys want?

950
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:28,849
I know.

951
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,530
You are pretending

952
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:32,129
not to know us.

953
00:42:32,369 --> 00:42:33,209
As expected of Her Highness.

954
00:42:33,849 --> 00:42:35,290
Are we starting already?

955
00:42:36,369 --> 00:42:37,090
In that case,

956
00:42:37,609 --> 00:42:39,050
please excuse us.

957
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:42,290
I see.

958
00:42:42,449 --> 00:42:43,849
You're from the martial arts world.

959
00:42:44,409 --> 00:42:46,169
But you've come across me today.

960
00:42:46,169 --> 00:42:47,770
It's your unlucky day.

961
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:48,530
Hold on.

962
00:43:01,209 --> 00:43:02,169
That was a mistake.

963
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:03,770
I have a weapon.

964
00:43:03,889 --> 00:43:04,689
That makes things unfair.

965
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:05,889
Come on.

966
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:07,490
I can take you guys on

967
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:08,570
with my bare fists.

968
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:09,609
Bring it on!

969
00:43:13,209 --> 00:43:14,010
My feet!

970
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:15,409
