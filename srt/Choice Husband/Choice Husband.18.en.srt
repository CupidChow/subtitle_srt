to be an emperor.

Pei Yanzhen...

Someone!

Take down

this traitor who commits regicide!

33
00:02:43,601 --> 00:02:44,321
Pei Yanzhen.

34
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:47,081
My son protected you many times

35
00:02:47,681 --> 00:02:49,720
and this is how you repay him?

36
00:02:50,241 --> 00:02:51,241
Release him now!

37
00:02:51,441 --> 00:02:52,041
Mother.

38
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:56,961
The culprit here

39
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,840
is Qin Zuze.

40
00:03:04,521 --> 00:03:05,120
Impossible.

41
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,961
Your uncle won't hurt you.

42
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,480
This brat here
must have misled him to do that.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,401
Cinnabar poison is rare

44
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:15,280
but not incurable.

45
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:17,000
Why haven't any imperial physicians

46
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,681
come to serve the antidote?

47
00:03:19,521 --> 00:03:20,881
And the poison Uncle gave me

48
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,200
was just spilled on my bed.

49
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,801
I saw and heard everything myself,

50
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,241
so stop deluding yourself, Mother.

51
00:03:30,681 --> 00:03:31,601
Impossible.

52
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,681
Impossible.

53
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:35,521
Brother.

54
00:03:36,321 --> 00:03:38,401
This brat misled you, did he?

55
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:41,000
Your Highness,

56
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,241
His Majesty is soft-hearted

57
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,760
and weak.

58
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,000
He is not suited to be an emperor.

59
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:49,881
For the stability of the imperial court,

60
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,760
please use your seal
to issue an edict

61
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,041
and pass the throne to me.

62
00:04:00,681 --> 00:04:01,560
Insolence.

63
00:04:02,401 --> 00:04:04,161
Did you hear what you just said?

64
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,760
He is your nephew!

65
00:04:12,321 --> 00:04:13,441
I'm doing this

66
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:16,160
for you,

67
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,841
and the Qin family.

68
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:19,681
Everyone in the court

69
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,841
is Pei Yanzhen's ally.

70
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:25,480
If His Majesty was decisive enough,

71
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:27,440
this would never

72
00:04:27,841 --> 00:04:29,200
have happened.

73
00:04:32,241 --> 00:04:34,640
I've put my faith in you.

74
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,681
Ever since I became the Empress,

75
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,920
I gave you everything.

76
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,440
I let you collude with others.

77
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:46,760
I let you sell noble titles.

78
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,281
I let you withhold the military wage.

79
00:04:48,281 --> 00:04:50,681
I turned a blind eye to them.

80
00:04:50,841 --> 00:04:53,040
What more do you want?

81
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,480
Your Highness, you should realize

82
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,001
that His Majesty insists

83
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,241
on using Pei Yanzhen.

84
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:04,360
In his eyes,

85
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,160
I stick out like a sore thumb.

86
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,841
If I do not act proactively,

87
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,521
I'll meet my end

88
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:14,081
soon.

89
00:05:14,521 --> 00:05:15,640
I'm here.

90
00:05:15,961 --> 00:05:17,360
That will never happen.

91
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,681
If you do care about me,

92
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:22,081
then

93
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,160
pass the throne to me.

94
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,801
By the way,

95
00:05:27,121 --> 00:05:29,360
my people surrounded this place.

96
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,040
You are alone here.

97
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,320
Attack.

98
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,360
Don't move.

99
00:05:38,001 --> 00:05:38,440
Don't move.

100
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,081
Song Xiyuan.

101
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:51,480
Which side are you on?

102
00:05:51,961 --> 00:05:53,241
I beg your pardon, Official Qin.

103
00:05:53,841 --> 00:05:55,480
I am a court purveyor.

104
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:56,801
I am remunerated by the imperial court.

105
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,200
Naturally, I serve His Majesty
and the court.

106
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,081
I act with my sense of justice,

107
00:06:02,401 --> 00:06:02,920
so

108
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,681
I am on nobody's side.

109
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,681
All soldiers in the capital

110
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,521
are my men.

111
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,160
You think a merchant like you

112
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,040
can hold them off?

113
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,920
Somebody.

114
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,401
Somebody!

115
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,200
Anybody?

116
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:27,841
Somebody!

117
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:25,440
Your Majesty,

118
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,160
my soldiers have secured the palace.

119
00:07:28,721 --> 00:07:29,561
Pardon

120
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:31,440
my tardiness.

121
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,001
Sister, you cannot trust Pei Yanzhen.

122
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,401
He studied martial arts in secret
and lied about his background

123
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,961
for his revenge.

124
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:56,401
He is a prince. He is the Sixth Prince.

125
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,320
Nonsense.

126
00:07:58,121 --> 00:07:58,640
Somebody.

127
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,480
Take this traitor

128
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,200
to prison.

129
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,200
Pei Yanzhen.

130
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:07,200
The Qin family

131
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,880
will have our payback.

132
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,800
(Pei's Residence)

133
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,440
Miss Shen.

134
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,481
Some distant relatives
came to visit us today

135
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:33,640
and they want to see Xiao.

136
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,161
I figure

137
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,120
Xiao must be tired after playing
for the entire day,

138
00:08:37,361 --> 00:08:39,200
so I came to pick him up.

139
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,401
Well, unfortunately,

140
00:08:41,081 --> 00:08:42,961
Old Madam and Master brought Master Xiao

141
00:08:42,961 --> 00:08:44,200
to a temple.

142
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:45,721
They won't be back this soon.

143
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:48,601
Perhaps you can come
another day, Miss Shen?

144
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,521
Alright.

145
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,601
The sun is setting

146
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,800
and the temple will be closed soon.

147
00:08:57,601 --> 00:08:58,320
I'm already here

148
00:08:58,521 --> 00:09:00,120
so I might as well wait

149
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,440
for them inside.

150
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,880
Old Master said

151
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:04,841
they would be fasting in the temple,

152
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,081
so they would spend some nights there.

153
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,081
I believe he'll be away for a few days.

154
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,961
Do you know which temple
they are visiting?

155
00:09:14,961 --> 00:09:15,921
I can go find them.

156
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,320
I dare not

157
00:09:18,481 --> 00:09:19,521
inquire more details.

158
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:22,800
So I don't know which temple they went.

159
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:30,361
I'm so sorry

160
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:32,680
that you have to leave
empty-handed, Miss Shen.

161
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,361
I see.

162
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,880
I'll come another day.

163
00:09:40,961 --> 00:09:41,401
Thank you.

164
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:11,640
Miss,

165
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,521
why are you trembling?

166
00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:17,800
Did they give you a hard time?

167
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,041
Not at all.

168
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,000
I picked up a scent

169
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,680
outside of Pei's Residence.

170
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,921
And what's so special about it?

171
00:10:32,481 --> 00:10:33,521
I only know

172
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,440
one person

173
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,440
who would mix agarwood perfume

174
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,440
with aquilaria crassna perfume.

175
00:10:40,521 --> 00:10:42,000
And that's Old Madam Pei.

176
00:10:44,481 --> 00:10:47,161
So Old Madam Pei never left?

177
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:49,521
Then Master Xiao...

178
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:55,921
It seems like
we can't take him back now.

179
00:10:57,161 --> 00:10:58,320
If we barge in,

180
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,281
we will alert them.

181
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,640
But what if he's in danger?

182
00:11:07,281 --> 00:11:08,921
Pei Yanzhen is his father nonetheless.

183
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,361
I think he'll be fine.

184
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,760
Let's head back home first

185
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,601
and investigate further
before we think of a solution.

186
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,240
You lost.

187
00:12:06,841 --> 00:12:07,721
So don't be coy.

188
00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:09,481
Miss Qin

189
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,721
and the rest

190
00:12:11,721 --> 00:12:12,680
are lying in wait

191
00:12:12,961 --> 00:12:13,961
in Lingzhou.

192
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,440
I'm here to buy them time.

193
00:12:18,161 --> 00:12:19,161
When you return,

194
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:22,320
there is no Shen family anymore.

195
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,680
Zhao.

196
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,601
Official Zhan.

197
00:12:38,601 --> 00:12:39,041
They are...

198
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,721
They are Qin's men.

199
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,281
When Miss Shen was about to return home,

200
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:43,401
they prepped their bows for an ambush.

201
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,640
I managed to subdue them.

202
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,880
Now that Qin Zuze is imprisoned,

203
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:06,800
Mother is no longer a threat.

204
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,601
Will you stop here?

205
00:13:11,481 --> 00:13:12,481
Your Majesty, you truly think

206
00:13:12,481 --> 00:13:14,361
I am the one who refuses to move on?

207
00:13:14,601 --> 00:13:15,240
I know

208
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,921
Mother is untrusting and paranoid.

209
00:13:19,361 --> 00:13:22,281
She has done you wrong
many times in the past.

210
00:13:24,481 --> 00:13:26,200
But I will make it up to you.

211
00:13:26,961 --> 00:13:29,161
In politics or for the Shen family,

212
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,000
I will compensate you.

213
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:35,601
Don't lie to yourself, Your Majesty.

214
00:13:36,361 --> 00:13:38,640
Her Highness tried to kill
my son and me several times.

215
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,120
Were they ever for political reasons?

216
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,680
The hardship I endured

217
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,760
and the truth I seek

218
00:13:44,961 --> 00:13:47,401
cannot be compensated
by titles and fortune.

219
00:13:47,401 --> 00:13:48,041
Pei Yanzhen.

220
00:13:53,841 --> 00:13:54,680
Let bygone

221
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:56,640
be bygone, can you?

222
00:13:57,281 --> 00:13:58,401
We can work together

223
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,880
and bring peace to this world.

224
00:14:00,521 --> 00:14:01,841
Didn't you promise me that?

225
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:03,240
But

226
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,560
can peace truly return

227
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:07,161
when I stop?

228
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:09,000
I promise

229
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,481
that once everything is over,

230
00:14:11,281 --> 00:14:14,320
Mother will be confined
to this palace.

231
00:14:14,841 --> 00:14:16,680
No one will try to harm you.

232
00:14:17,521 --> 00:14:19,601
Trust me, please.

233
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,000
I know

234
00:14:28,521 --> 00:14:30,041
killing Her Highness

235
00:14:31,401 --> 00:14:34,200
cannot bring back the dead.

236
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,521
If Her Highness and Official Qin

237
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,320
are stripped of their power
to wreak havoc,

238
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:40,521
people will be able to live well too.

239
00:14:41,601 --> 00:14:42,161
Your Majesty,

240
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,361
I have eliminated

241
00:14:43,361 --> 00:14:44,880
the biggest obstacle in your path.

242
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:47,320
Soon, the imperial court
will see improvements.

243
00:14:48,161 --> 00:14:50,200
I'm sure you can lead

244
00:14:50,521 --> 00:14:51,640
the court on your own.

245
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,921
As for me,

246
00:14:56,081 --> 00:14:57,000
my parents are old

247
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:58,961
and my son's body is fragile.

248
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,240
I just want to return to Lingzhou

249
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:03,961
to keep them company.

250
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,800
Will you grant me my wish, Your Majesty?

251
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:39,320
(Change of Plan. Don't come back.)

252
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,200
Death

253
00:16:22,721 --> 00:16:24,000
or more death.

254
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,281
Death or more death.

255
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:44,841
Pei Yanzhen.

256
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,120
Is this you?

257
00:16:52,921 --> 00:16:54,440
Is this you?

258
00:17:03,361 --> 00:17:04,800
Lvying.

259
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:06,920
Miss?

260
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,680
Lvying, go find my aunt.

261
00:17:08,881 --> 00:17:10,001
Ask her and Shen Zai
to change into plain clothing.

262
00:17:10,001 --> 00:17:11,040
Then, leave from the back door.

263
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,520
What about you, Miss?

264
00:17:12,721 --> 00:17:13,961
If you're staying, I will too.

265
00:17:13,961 --> 00:17:14,641
Listen to me.

266
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,800
Pei Yanzhen has our family seal now

267
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,001
and I need to do something.

268
00:17:18,241 --> 00:17:19,241
We cannot all die here.

269
00:17:19,241 --> 00:17:20,520
Just follow my instruction.

270
00:17:21,121 --> 00:17:21,481
But I...

271
00:17:21,481 --> 00:17:22,001
Go now.

272
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,320
Miss Shen.

273
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:48,641
Zhan Yue.

274
00:17:49,481 --> 00:17:50,160
What are you doing?

275
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:52,440
Official Pei asked me

276
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,200
to keep the Shen family safe.

277
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:55,920
Good.

278
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:56,961
I want to talk to him.

279
00:17:58,081 --> 00:17:59,160
He is in the capital.

280
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,241
Then bring me to the capital.

281
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,241
Miss Shen.

282
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,081
Official Pei is occupied
so no visitors allowed.

283
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:08,520
Did Pei Yanzhen ask you
to surround Shen's Residence?

284
00:18:09,361 --> 00:18:09,920
Did he

285
00:18:11,121 --> 00:18:12,320
ask you to keep me here?

286
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:16,040
Answer me!

287
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,721
Sorry, I have no comment.

288
00:18:24,641 --> 00:18:25,200
I see.

289
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:30,001
If I insist on leaving?

290
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,121
Did he ask you to kill me as well?

291
00:18:34,761 --> 00:18:35,361
Miss Shen.

292
00:18:35,961 --> 00:18:37,241
Why do you have to be this stubbornly?

293
00:18:37,481 --> 00:18:39,241
Then why is Pei Yanzhen so hellbent

294
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,520
on forbidding me to leave?

295
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:42,881
Unless he did something

296
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,881
that I cannot know?

297
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:44,920
Zhan Yue!

298
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,121
We treat Pei Yanzhen and you
with kindness,

299
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,481
but you are taking this too far.

300
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:49,481
How dare you.

301
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:52,280
They are Miss Shen's relatives.

302
00:18:52,641 --> 00:18:53,241
Let them go now.

303
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:58,881
Zhan Yue.

304
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,400
I do not know
why Pei Yanzhen is doing this,

305
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,081
but this is the Shen family's
private residence.

306
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,680
If His Majesty wants to arrest us,

307
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,881
you'll still need his edict to act.

308
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,601
We are dutiful merchants.

309
00:19:07,601 --> 00:19:08,520
We don't steal or rob.

310
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,160
What gives you the right
to do this here?

311
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:14,400
Miss Shen, you're mistaken.

312
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:15,961
It's because...

313
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:16,520
Because of what?

314
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,121
Before everything is over,

315
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,841
please do not tell

316
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,680
Miao the truth.

317
00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:28,481
Miss Shen.

318
00:19:29,481 --> 00:19:30,841
All I can say

319
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,121
is that I'm following
Official Pei's order.

320
00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:35,601
Please stay inside with your family

321
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:37,280
until Official Pei's safe return.

322
00:19:37,641 --> 00:19:38,721
Everything will become clear then.

323
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:43,200
Okay.

324
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,601
I will not squander

325
00:19:46,121 --> 00:19:47,241
his kindness away.

326
00:19:47,761 --> 00:19:48,400
However,

327
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:50,961
I can't leave the place,

328
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:54,121
can I invite guests over?

329
00:19:56,001 --> 00:19:57,601
Which guest would you like
to invite, Miss Shen?

330
00:19:58,481 --> 00:19:59,361
Song Xiyuan.

331
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:01,881
Master Song isn't in Lingzhou.

332
00:20:02,241 --> 00:20:03,641
I'm afraid he can't pay you a visit.

333
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,241
I see.

334
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,520
Aunt, let's head back.

335
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,121
We'll speak later.

336
00:20:32,121 --> 00:20:32,761
Surround

337
00:20:33,361 --> 00:20:34,081
the Shen's Residence

338
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,961
and do not let anyone leave.

339
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:36,761
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

340
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,040
(Personal Guard)

341
00:20:59,001 --> 00:20:59,761
Empress Dowager's guard?

342
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,721
I followed Qin's secret code
all the way here.

343
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,200
I have news from the capital.

344
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,081
Qin Zuze tried to poison His Majesty

345
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,481
to usurp the throne.

346
00:21:08,761 --> 00:21:11,680
He was caught by Pei Yanzhen
and is to be beheaded.

347
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:12,881
What?

348
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,520
You're lying.

349
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,200
Her Highness said

350
00:21:15,761 --> 00:21:16,881
if you made up for your mistake,

351
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,520
you and your father could be spared.

352
00:21:20,361 --> 00:21:21,761
She wants to retaliate
against Pei Yanzhen

353
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,601
but she can't leave the capital
nor does she

354
00:21:23,961 --> 00:21:24,761
have the personnel for it.

355
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,841
Per the Empress Dowager's order,

356
00:21:35,081 --> 00:21:36,761
we are here to capture the family
of the traitor, Pei Yanzhen.

357
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,241
Who dares to get in our way?

358
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,520
Wake up.

359
00:21:51,121 --> 00:21:52,081
Qin Miuzhen?

360
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,160
Your Majesty,

361
00:21:56,001 --> 00:21:58,440
the probe into the Qin family's betrayal
is complete.

362
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,200
Qin Zuze will be beheaded

363
00:22:01,481 --> 00:22:03,761
while the rest of the family
will be exiled.

364
00:22:04,481 --> 00:22:07,440
However, the daughter, Qin Miuzhen,

365
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:10,520
remains at large in Lingzhou
with followers of the Qin family.

366
00:22:11,001 --> 00:22:13,160
She hasn't been captured yet.

367
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,440
Thanks to
Official Pei and Official Song,

368
00:22:15,841 --> 00:22:18,440
the Qin family's betrayal
came to an end.

369
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,641
Your Majesty, for many years,

370
00:22:24,121 --> 00:22:26,680
Qin Zuze utilized his proximity
to the throne

371
00:22:26,961 --> 00:22:28,160
to abuse

372
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:30,121
and exploit the people.

373
00:22:30,481 --> 00:22:33,520
His seditious act

374
00:22:34,001 --> 00:22:36,280
shook the imperial court
and disrupted our harmony.

375
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,361
Fortunately, Official Pei was there
to save us from this predicament.

376
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,440
More than one hundred officials
have signed a petition

377
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,580
(Petition)
to reinstate Official Pei

378
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,280
to reinstate Official Pei

379
00:22:46,481 --> 00:22:48,481
and bestow him lordship

380
00:22:48,761 --> 00:22:50,001
for his service.

381
00:22:54,761 --> 00:22:57,160
Never once in history was someone of a
different surname given lordship.

382
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,920
We cannot break this tradition
for Official Pei.

383
00:22:59,481 --> 00:23:00,001
Settle down.

384
00:23:00,961 --> 00:23:03,241
I have made up my mind.

385
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,001
I hereby announce...

386
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,001
Hold on.

387
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:21,200
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

388
00:23:27,761 --> 00:23:28,680
At ease.

389
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,361
- Thanks, Your Highness.
- Thanks, Your Highness.

390
00:23:42,001 --> 00:23:44,761
The imperial court
feels different today.

391
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,001
Son.

392
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,361
Do we have a challenge at hand?

393
00:23:48,641 --> 00:23:49,320
Mother,

394
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,361
didn't I tell you to rest
in your palace?

395
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,800
Why did you come?

396
00:23:55,961 --> 00:23:59,761
I heard that some officials
signed a petition

397
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,440
to make Official Pei a lord.

398
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,241
I'm here to share the joy.

399
00:24:06,481 --> 00:24:07,400
Coincidentally,

400
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:11,121
I also have something about Official Pei

401
00:24:11,601 --> 00:24:14,081
that I want everyone to know.

402
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,121
Your Majesty, fellow officials,

403
00:24:19,881 --> 00:24:23,241
I am the clan leader of the Pei family
in Lingzhou.

404
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,440
As I traced back

405
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,520
the genealogy record today,
I made the discovery

406
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,761
that though Pei Yanzhen was raised
by Third Madam,

407
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,040
she did not give birth to him.

408
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,481
He was adopted.

409
00:24:36,001 --> 00:24:38,040
His biological parents remain

410
00:24:40,081 --> 00:24:41,241
unknown.

411
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:50,800
Master Pei.

412
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,800
The Pei family is nonetheless

413
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,641
a noble family in Lingzhou.

414
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,361
How could this mistake occur?

415
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,200
It's precisely because the Pei family
is a noble family in Lingzhou

416
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:02,520
that the bloodline
becomes all the more important.

417
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,800
If Pei Yanzhen isn't a descendant
of the Pei family,

418
00:25:07,081 --> 00:25:10,001
his background
should be called into question.

419
00:25:11,641 --> 00:25:12,961
A man of mysterious background

420
00:25:12,961 --> 00:25:15,121
works in the imperial court

421
00:25:15,121 --> 00:25:16,800
and is about to be given lordship.

422
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:19,040
Isn't that ridiculous?

423
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,280
Mother.

424
00:25:21,081 --> 00:25:22,400
Why are you doing this?

425
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,721
Of course.

426
00:25:24,601 --> 00:25:27,081
The genealogy record can be fabricated

427
00:25:29,001 --> 00:25:30,001
so I

428
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,560
brought Official Pei's adoptive parents

429
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,961
to the capital.

430
00:25:35,641 --> 00:25:36,440
Official Pei,

431
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,841
if you're willing to join the Pei family

432
00:25:39,761 --> 00:25:43,001
and swear to never join the court,

433
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,220
I

434
00:25:47,241 --> 00:25:49,081
can issue an edict
and grant you your wish.

435
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,961
Official Pei,

436
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,560
perhaps you can talk
to your father first?

437
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:08,280
Miss.

438
00:26:08,841 --> 00:26:10,320
Is Official Pei a bad person?

439
00:26:14,001 --> 00:26:15,481
Isn't it clear?

440
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,040
If he isn't plotting something,

441
00:26:19,881 --> 00:26:21,601
why would he ask Zhan Yue
to surround our residence?

442
00:26:25,761 --> 00:26:26,481
Miao.

443
00:26:27,481 --> 00:26:28,881
You didn't sleep at all.

444
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:31,040
Get some rest now.

445
00:26:37,241 --> 00:26:37,961
Aunt.

446
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,721
Father asked me to take care
of the family

447
00:26:43,841 --> 00:26:45,001
but I misjudged someone's character

448
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,040
and allowed him to put us
in this rough spot.

449
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,121
How can I sleep with that in mind?

450
00:26:52,641 --> 00:26:54,200
It is not your fault.

451
00:26:54,881 --> 00:26:57,040
Pei Yanzhen is a wolf

452
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,520
in sheep's clothing.

453
00:26:59,121 --> 00:27:01,200
Even your father and I
fell under his deception.

454
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,721
I just feel sorry for you, Miao.

455
00:27:04,641 --> 00:27:07,241
If you're upset, just cry.

456
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,761
Don't bottle it up.

457
00:27:16,641 --> 00:27:17,200
No.

458
00:27:18,881 --> 00:27:20,001
I can't just sit around doing nothing.

459
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,160
Pei Yanzhen

460
00:27:23,361 --> 00:27:24,481
got his hands full in the capital.

461
00:27:25,761 --> 00:27:27,160
He won't have time for us.

462
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,761
So now is the moment
to think of a solution.

463
00:27:32,241 --> 00:27:33,241
But they are numerous out there.

464
00:27:33,761 --> 00:27:35,040
How can we escape?

465
00:27:37,641 --> 00:27:38,440
Don't worry.

466
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:40,440
I have a plan.

467
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,950
(Wende Hall)

468
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:10,040
They say

469
00:28:11,081 --> 00:28:13,641
raising a child is harder
than giving birth to a child.

470
00:28:13,961 --> 00:28:16,920
You happily served the Pei family
for many years.

471
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,040
Is that to repay them

472
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,241
or do you have an agenda?

473
00:28:21,721 --> 00:28:22,721
Cut to the chase, Your Highness.

474
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,200
Where are my parents?

475
00:28:27,361 --> 00:28:30,721
Parents, you say?

476
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,160
Weren't your mother a lady

477
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,320
from the Liu family of Jiangnan
more than two decades ago?

478
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,560
And weren't your father

479
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,361
the late emperor who is now
buried in the Imperial Mausoleum?

480
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,160
Why?

481
00:28:48,241 --> 00:28:49,761
You won't admit it now?

482
00:28:52,121 --> 00:28:54,121
I don't care
who my biological father is.

483
00:28:55,081 --> 00:28:55,800
I

484
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:57,881
belong to the Pei family.

485
00:28:59,881 --> 00:29:01,800
What about your petty mother?

486
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,641
How cunning of you.

487
00:29:12,641 --> 00:29:14,601
It's such an elaborate plan.

488
00:29:15,641 --> 00:29:18,001
When you learned that your mother
died in a village,

489
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,961
you made the decision to avenge her
by getting into the imperial court.

490
00:29:23,961 --> 00:29:25,481
Now show me

491
00:29:25,841 --> 00:29:27,881
what you can do

492
00:29:29,961 --> 00:29:32,721
in here.

493
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,761
Bring them in.

494
00:29:44,761 --> 00:29:45,800
Father, Mother.

495
00:29:46,241 --> 00:29:46,881
- Zhen.
- Zhen.

496
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,841
Pei Yanzhen.

497
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,961
I'll confess.

498
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:56,400
I had my people
kill your biological mother.

499
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:04,001
If she didn't ensorcel

500
00:30:04,241 --> 00:30:05,520
the late emperor with her beauty

501
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,761
and cause me to fall out of favor...

502
00:30:08,761 --> 00:30:09,361
Shut up!

503
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:11,361
My mother

504
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,680
wasn't like that.

505
00:30:15,121 --> 00:30:17,160
She was a loose woman
who seduced the late emperor.

506
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,481
She deserved to die.

507
00:30:19,121 --> 00:30:20,520
And you, the brat.

508
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,200
My biggest regret

509
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,520
is failing to skin both of you

510
00:30:23,761 --> 00:30:26,001
before abandoning your corpses
in the wild.

511
00:30:26,001 --> 00:30:27,721
You wouldn't have the chance

512
00:30:27,721 --> 00:30:29,400
to stand up against me now.

513
00:30:30,001 --> 00:30:31,280
You murderer.

514
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,121
What makes you think you can speak
as if you're in the right?

515
00:30:34,881 --> 00:30:37,481
How can you be the Empress Dowager?

516
00:30:37,881 --> 00:30:39,601
Insolence! Kill him now.

517
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:40,481
Stop.

518
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:41,881
Dear.

519
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,040
Your Highness,

520
00:30:53,481 --> 00:30:55,881
if you merely want to kill them,

521
00:30:58,121 --> 00:30:59,841
why invite me here?

522
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,680
How I enjoy

523
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,040
talking to someone smart.

524
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:14,721
My brother and my family

525
00:31:15,761 --> 00:31:18,800
died because of you.

526
00:31:19,721 --> 00:31:21,200
The fury within me can only be quelled

527
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,641
by getting my vengeance.

528
00:31:23,881 --> 00:31:24,560
Also,

529
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,881
you repeatedly persuade

530
00:31:28,361 --> 00:31:30,280
His Majesty
to keep distance from me.

531
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,280
You are evil. You...

532
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,200
Somebody.

533
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:35,841
Yes, Your Highness.

534
00:31:35,841 --> 00:31:36,881
Make him kneel.

535
00:31:38,121 --> 00:31:38,800
Kneel.

536
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,280
Why? You won't concede?

537
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:55,400
Your Highness,

538
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,241
since when do you care about
what others think of you?

539
00:31:59,241 --> 00:32:01,160
In this palace and this world,

540
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,920
you can punish or kill anyone you like.

541
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,361
Indeed.

542
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,920
And I'll tell you now.

543
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,601
You can save them

544
00:32:19,121 --> 00:32:20,680
with your life.

545
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,200
Okay.

546
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,160
Zhen!

547
00:32:55,961 --> 00:32:58,001
Father, Mother.

548
00:32:59,721 --> 00:33:01,001
Without you two,

549
00:33:02,721 --> 00:33:04,241
I wouldn't be alive today.

550
00:33:06,481 --> 00:33:08,961
Sorry that I can't repay

551
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,481
your kindness.

552
00:33:15,001 --> 00:33:16,641
But I definitely can't let you die

553
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:19,241
because of me.

554
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,400
- Zhen.
- No, Zhen!

555
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,001
Stop.

556
00:33:40,761 --> 00:33:41,241
Mother.

557
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,560
Son, why are you here?

558
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,001
Stop it already, Mother.

559
00:33:46,001 --> 00:33:47,160
You have done enough.

560
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,361
The traitor was Uncle.

561
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:51,841
Pei Yanzhen

562
00:33:52,601 --> 00:33:54,001
saved me.

563
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,800
Don't be silly now.

564
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,841
He did everything to serve his interest,

565
00:33:57,841 --> 00:33:58,920
and get your throne.

566
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,001
You are the emperor.

567
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,560
You are almighty.

568
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,280
But he is my Six Brother!

569
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:05,560
Mother,

570
00:34:06,641 --> 00:34:08,480
Father wanted to pass the throne to him.

571
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,081
In that case,

572
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,921
I can abdicate and give him the throne.

573
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,361
How did I

574
00:34:17,161 --> 00:34:19,000
give birth to a fool like you?

575
00:34:23,841 --> 00:34:25,280
Pei Yanzhen did everything

576
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,401
to trick the Shen family
and earn your trust.

577
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:29,081
How can he be innocent?

578
00:34:30,121 --> 00:34:31,520
In this palace,

579
00:34:33,361 --> 00:34:35,441
I...

580
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:38,760
Only I treat you well.

581
00:34:40,681 --> 00:34:41,601
And today,

582
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,480
I will

583
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,760
help you see things clearly.

584
00:34:51,081 --> 00:34:51,960
Pei Yanzhen.

585
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,641
If you won't die today,

586
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,320
the entire Pei family
will die for you.

587
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,240
Go ahead now.

588
00:35:07,841 --> 00:35:08,480
Wait.

589
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,040
A life for another, you say?

590
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,441
I'll die on behalf of him.

591
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:17,921
Father!

592
00:35:18,921 --> 00:35:19,601
Dear.

593
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:21,280
Father!

594
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,240
Dear, how can you die before me?

595
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,641
Father!

596
00:35:29,081 --> 00:35:30,280
Hurry up now.

597
00:35:30,441 --> 00:35:31,921
Kill them already.

598
00:35:35,641 --> 00:35:36,320
Mother!

599
00:35:37,681 --> 00:35:38,201
Mother!

600
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,040
Mother!

601
00:35:41,441 --> 00:35:41,960
Mother.

602
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:46,121
Zhen.

603
00:35:46,841 --> 00:35:47,841
Your father and I

604
00:35:49,121 --> 00:35:50,201
never regret it.

605
00:35:53,121 --> 00:35:56,240
We sent Xiao

606
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,320
to Master Wangyun.

607
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,161
He's safe.

608
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:01,161
Mother.

609
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,681
Live well.

610
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,361
Promise me.

611
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,161
Mother.

612
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,361
Live well.

613
00:36:09,361 --> 00:36:09,841
Mother.

614
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,560
Mother.

615
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:15,800
Mother.

616
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,601
Mother!

617
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,720
It's okay.
I'll get you two out of this place.

618
00:36:23,161 --> 00:36:24,681
I'll get you two out.

619
00:36:25,161 --> 00:36:26,681
Kill him too.

620
00:36:49,161 --> 00:36:49,760
Brother!

621
00:36:54,681 --> 00:36:55,240
Your Majesty,

622
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,000
don't call me that.

623
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,161
Your Highness.

624
00:37:01,641 --> 00:37:02,960
You think I should die.

625
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,560
But what about my parents?

626
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,520
What did they do?

627
00:37:12,161 --> 00:37:13,121
You killed them

628
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,520
because those who go against you
have to die.

629
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,960
You...

630
00:37:20,081 --> 00:37:22,121
This is sedition.

631
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,000
Help!

632
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,240
He wants to kill the emperor.

633
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,560
He's a traitor. He needs to die!

634
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,240
Shut your mouth.

635
00:37:31,201 --> 00:37:33,760
I am just repaying you the same favor.

636
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,280
When you killed indiscriminately,
Your Highness,

637
00:37:45,201 --> 00:37:47,641
and tore the imperial court apart,
have you thought about this day?

638
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,681
When you abducted the innocent

639
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,720
and abused your power,
have you thought about this day?

640
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,361
You fail as the Empress Dowager

641
00:37:55,881 --> 00:37:57,040
and show no remorse.

642
00:37:58,081 --> 00:38:00,641
Who among the people here deserves
to die the most if not you?

643
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,560
And today

644
00:38:05,401 --> 00:38:07,161
is the day the countless people

645
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,681
who lost their lives innocently
in the past 20 years

646
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:12,601
have their retribution.

647
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:13,601
Help!

648
00:38:13,601 --> 00:38:14,161
Brother!

649
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:50,870
(Funeral)

650
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,180
(Memorial Tablet of Pei and Gu)

651
00:40:40,841 --> 00:40:41,520
Brother.

652
00:40:43,361 --> 00:40:44,040
I'm sorry.

653
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,361
Your Majesty, do not

654
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,081
call me that.

655
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,560
(Funeral)

656
00:41:00,121 --> 00:41:01,601
I hid my past

657
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,480
and gave up the prince title.

658
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,480
But what did I get in return?

659
00:41:12,201 --> 00:41:13,401
You came to visit me

660
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,480
because you know I command the army.

661
00:41:20,601 --> 00:41:22,000
So how sincere

662
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:25,121
is your apology, Your Majesty?

663
00:41:25,361 --> 00:41:25,960
Six Brother,

664
00:41:27,081 --> 00:41:27,720
I...

665
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,681
Six Brother.

666
00:41:48,841 --> 00:41:51,121
Father wanted you to inherit the throne

667
00:41:52,081 --> 00:41:53,161
but Mother and I...

668
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,760
That's why when I met you,

669
00:42:00,081 --> 00:42:01,000
I couldn't believe...

670
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,921
I refused to believe your new identity.

671
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,161
Because I'm afraid
of losing a good friend

672
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:08,841
or Mother.

673
00:42:11,201 --> 00:42:11,800
But

674
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,361
I realize my mistake now.

675
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,361
