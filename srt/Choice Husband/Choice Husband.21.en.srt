they look at us as if we're thieves.

You and I are in prison now.

Don't we look like thieves?

00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:54,220
Isn't that Miss Shen?

24
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:55,461
It's been so long since I saw her.

25
00:01:55,821 --> 00:01:58,020
I heard that the Shen family
offended the Regent.

26
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,540
All of them were annihilated.

27
00:01:59,741 --> 00:02:01,220
Didn't a plague hit them?

28
00:02:01,461 --> 00:02:03,300
The plague was Regent's doing.

29
00:02:03,501 --> 00:02:05,660
Shen Miao cheated on him.

30
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:06,980
It was an act of revenge.

31
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,460
Let's go.

32
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,221
Hurry up.

33
00:02:21,021 --> 00:02:21,581
Miss Shen.

34
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:23,221
Let's grab the stuff real fast

35
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:24,021
and go back earlier.

36
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,740
As he dares to do it,

37
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,221
will he care what the people say?

38
00:02:30,701 --> 00:02:32,301
I think you've misunderstood
His Highness.

39
00:02:32,781 --> 00:02:33,501
The Qin family is powerful

40
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:34,180
and the nation is unstable.

41
00:02:34,581 --> 00:02:35,701
He just wanted to protect you.

42
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:36,301
I understand.

43
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,620
I'll cook today.

44
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,501
Do you know
what His Highness usually likes to eat?

45
00:02:48,221 --> 00:02:49,900
Pei Yanzhen and I have known
each other for years.

46
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,460
We eat and sleep together

47
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,900
but I know nothing about him.

48
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:58,180
That's not what I meant.

49
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,900
It's a great thing that you're willing

50
00:03:01,221 --> 00:03:02,260
to cook for His Highness.

51
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:05,260
Not to mention me,

52
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,661
I'm afraid no one

53
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,781
in the world knows his preference.

54
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:12,900
In fact,

55
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,501
he brother has had a tough life.

56
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,900
Over a decade ago,

57
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:21,781
when he was adopted by the Pei family...

58
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,620
I hate that look of his.

59
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,421
He's just pretending.

60
00:03:35,581 --> 00:03:36,221
Young Master.

61
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,180
All of you

62
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,581
perform worse academically
than my young master.

63
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:43,380
It's a cowardly action
to keep picking on

64
00:03:43,661 --> 00:03:44,540
my young master.

65
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:45,661
You're just a servant.

66
00:03:45,861 --> 00:03:46,941
How dare you be insubordinate

67
00:03:46,941 --> 00:03:48,620
and stand up for this silly thing?

68
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:49,301
Guys,

69
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:49,941
let's go.

70
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,501
- Hit him.
- Hit him.

71
00:03:51,501 --> 00:03:52,100
Stop!

72
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:53,661
Stop!

73
00:03:55,221 --> 00:03:55,900
Stop!

74
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,021
Stop hitting him!

75
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,380
Stop hitting him!

76
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,021
Stop!

77
00:04:02,061 --> 00:04:02,581
Stop!

78
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,180
Pei Yanzhen,

79
00:04:06,141 --> 00:04:08,180
do you know what you've done wrong?

80
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,021
A gentleman shouldn't act recklessly.

81
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,221
I was wrong.

82
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:14,900
But Clan Leader,

83
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,940
if I kneel for 24 hours,

84
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:18,260
can you let my servant go?

85
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,141
He was insubordinate and made a mess.

86
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:21,540
You even intercede for him?

87
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,540
You... You're

88
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:25,500
a fool growing without watering.

89
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,500
How dare you intercede for him?

90
00:04:28,741 --> 00:04:29,461
How dare you talk back?

91
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:30,220
You even talk back.

92
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,341
You're stubborn.

93
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,380
How dare you plead?

94
00:04:32,901 --> 00:04:34,220
What a stubborn kid.

95
00:04:41,421 --> 00:04:42,141
Where is Zhi?

96
00:04:42,621 --> 00:04:43,141
He...

97
00:04:44,021 --> 00:04:44,540
He...

98
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,901
The Pei family keeps a dog
to safeguard the residence.

99
00:04:47,341 --> 00:04:48,540
But once the animals dare

100
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,341
to bite their masters,

101
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:52,060
we certainly have
to beat them to death.

102
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:52,940
What did you say?

103
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,181
I'm not wrong.

104
00:04:54,421 --> 00:04:55,421
You and your servant are

105
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:56,940
the dogs of the Pei family.

106
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:06,980
- The dogs of the Pei family.
- The dogs of the Pei family.

107
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,980
He had been seen as a disgrace
to the Liu family since childhood.

108
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,220
They didn't care about him.

109
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,621
Then, he was adopted by the Pei family.

110
00:05:13,341 --> 00:05:14,301
As he was a weakling,

111
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,181
the clan members were harsh to him.

112
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,741
He didn't know about his parentage
until he was eight.

113
00:05:19,621 --> 00:05:20,341
And he became

114
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,581
violently ill that year.

115
00:05:22,621 --> 00:05:23,461
He and I are the disciples

116
00:05:23,461 --> 00:05:25,341
of Master Yuanzhen,
the Martial Monk of Daming Temple.

117
00:05:26,461 --> 00:05:27,880
Master once said

118
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,060
that he got a late start
and a poor body,

119
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,780
it made him unfit to practice
martial arts.

120
00:05:32,581 --> 00:05:34,341
But he kneeled for 24 hours.

121
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,861
It softened Master's heart,
so he accepted him as a disciple.

122
00:05:37,861 --> 00:05:38,581
After he was accepted,

123
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:40,780
he practiced day and night,
coming rain or shine.

124
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,820
He worked a lot harder than me.

125
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,820
That was how he learned
martial arts skills.

126
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:47,021
Miss Shen,

127
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,901
do you think that I'm lying to you

128
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,220
to elicit sympathy,

129
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,341
so you can forgive him?

130
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,141
Aren't you?

131
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,820
But I'm going to say it, anyway.

132
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,581
Since the servant died,

133
00:06:13,141 --> 00:06:14,341
he knew that nothing around him

134
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:15,461
would last forever.

135
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,980
He can't let people notice

136
00:06:18,341 --> 00:06:19,500
the thing he loves.

137
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:21,940
He doesn't like to eat sweets

138
00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:24,980
because no one has ever given him
the sweetness of life.

139
00:06:26,021 --> 00:06:26,701
Miss Shen,

140
00:06:27,341 --> 00:06:28,461
he did lie to you.

141
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,341
But I really hope

142
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,500
that you could give
each other a chance.

143
00:06:33,581 --> 00:06:34,780
He truly loves you.

144
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,380
(Shen's Residence)

145
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,260
Try the osmanthus cakes.

146
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,380
I wonder how it tastes.

147
00:07:33,581 --> 00:07:34,741
As long as it's made by you,

148
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:36,660
I'll like it no matter how it tastes.

149
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,380
Pei Yanzhen,

150
00:07:57,421 --> 00:07:58,780
when we were in Lingzhou,

151
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,421
you once said you'll marry me again.

152
00:08:03,461 --> 00:08:05,181
Does it still count?

153
00:08:07,301 --> 00:08:08,060
Of course it does.

154
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:09,861
Miao,

155
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,421
the third day
of the next month is a good day.

156
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,820
Let's hold our wedding
at Shen's Residence.

157
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,260
I'll invite all the people
in the city over.

158
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,380
What about Xiao?

159
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,741
I'll get someone to escort him back.

160
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,021
Then, the people will be shocked

161
00:08:24,701 --> 00:08:26,901
to know the Regent actually has
a wife and a kid.

162
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:29,820
You keep us here
as if we're your second family.

163
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,781
And you have to return
to the capital sooner or later.

164
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:33,180
We'll be living in different cities.

165
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:36,701
Miao,

00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,900
Bring these with you.

336
00:18:21,621 --> 00:18:22,060
Sure.

337
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:37,780
Miss.

338
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,540
It's only been several years.

339
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,780
Why does it become like this?

340
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,101
Anyway,

341
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,660
whatever happens today,

342
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,261
I must send Xiao to my dad
with the help

343
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,660
of Third Master Song.

344
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,341
Is there really no room for maneuver?

345
00:18:58,341 --> 00:18:59,381
What Pei Yanzhen said,

346
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,420
I dare not believe any of it.

347
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:05,341
I have to count on myself now.

348
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,261
Also, the only person
I can trust is myself.

349
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,180
Miss,

350
00:19:10,581 --> 00:19:11,341
we're all set

351
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,780
and waiting for your order.

352
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,621
Your Majesty.

353
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:41,660
Xiuye,

354
00:19:42,621 --> 00:19:45,540
send the fish
to Regent's Residence tomorrow.

355
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,020
Your Majesty,

356
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,020
why tomorrow?

357
00:19:49,461 --> 00:19:50,940
I'm sure it's going to be fun

358
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,900
at Regent's Residence tonight.

359
00:19:54,501 --> 00:19:55,060
Just

360
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,180
count me out.

361
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,820
Yes, Your Majesty.

362
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,220
(Tablet of the Late Emperor)

363

(Regent's Residence)

364
00:20:23,221 --> 00:20:24,820
I can't believe Regent will hold

365
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,180
his wedding at Qin's Residence.

366
00:20:26,581 --> 00:20:28,101
It's a great spot.

367
00:20:32,581 --> 00:20:33,060
Miuzhen,

368
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,461
if Brother knows
you're going to do this,

369
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:36,741
I'm sure he won't let you off.

370
00:20:39,701 --> 00:20:41,820
Regent crucified my family,

371
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,621
and evicted Empress Dowager out
of the capital.

372
00:20:45,221 --> 00:20:46,020
Your Highness,

373
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,261
it's not just for my sake.

374
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,180
You should also fight
for Empress Dowager.

375
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,381
But it was the Qin family
who revolted at first.

376
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:55,221
You actually believe
what that brat said.

separating the two's worlds♪

to a night sky of stars♪

Miao,

381
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,900
I finally got to marry you.

382
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,180
Last time when we got married,

383
00:22:02,861 --> 00:22:05,581
I couldn't get to tell you
about my parentage.

384
00:22:08,341 --> 00:22:09,140
And now,

385
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,420
my biological parents

386
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,261
and foster parents have passed away.

387
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,261
And Father-in-law is

388
00:22:18,621 --> 00:22:19,660
in the border area.

389
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,741
Heaven

390
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,300
and earth will be our parents,

391
00:22:26,101 --> 00:22:26,900
to witness our wedding ceremony.

392
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:29,940
Sure.

393
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:19,861
I'm warning you.

394
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:21,300
No matter what,

395
00:23:21,741 --> 00:23:23,020
do not hurt Zhan Yue.

396
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:25,780
Otherwise, even when Mother comes
here in person,

397
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,900
I'll still kill you.

398
00:23:29,221 --> 00:23:30,940
You've formed
a strong attachment to him.

399
00:23:31,621 --> 00:23:33,701
But every man is bad in nature.

400
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,861
Shen Miao is an example of it.

401
00:23:37,341 --> 00:23:37,981
It's none of your business.

402
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,221
Your Highness,

403
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,140
I thought you weren't coming.

404
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,341
Zhan Yue,

405
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,341
as I come here in person,

406
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,101
why didn't Regent come out
and welcome me?

407
00:23:54,741 --> 00:23:55,420
What are you talking about?

408
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,140
The ceremony has already begun.

409
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,261
Come with me.

410
00:23:58,861 --> 00:23:59,660
Stay back, Zhan Yue.

411
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,261
What's wrong?

412
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,140
Did I make you mad again?

413
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:03,940
Who do you think you are?

414
00:24:04,381 --> 00:24:05,940
What makes you think
you can drop the honorifics?

415
00:24:06,461 --> 00:24:07,581
Just go and ask Regent over.

416
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,701
Go on.

417
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:22,300
By the way,

418
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,940
you must have left the wedding gift
in the carriage.

419
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:25,861
I'll go get it for you.

420
00:24:59,101 --> 00:25:00,020
From now on,

421
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,820
you and I will be together

422
00:25:04,981 --> 00:25:05,780
until we grow old.

423
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,140
Regent,

424
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,140
I'm sorry.

425
00:26:07,501 --> 00:26:09,221
I have to turn
your wedding into a funeral.

Master Song,

427
00:26:11,741 --> 00:26:13,861
I don't think they're our men.

428
00:26:14,861 --> 00:26:16,300
Did someone try
to kill him tonight as well?

429
00:26:18,501 --> 00:26:18,981
Miao,

430
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:20,300
quickly leave.

431
00:26:20,741 --> 00:26:21,780
They're after me.

432
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,060
Hurry up!

433
00:26:23,221 --> 00:26:23,741
Kill him!

434
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:30,300
The enemy's enemy

435
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,381
is our friend.

436
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,741
We should take this chance to help

437
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,221
those people eradicate Regent.

438
00:26:34,981 --> 00:26:35,501
No.

439
00:26:35,981 --> 00:26:36,981
Our primary task tonight is

440
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,900
to protect Miaomiao and her son
and get them out of here.

441
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,341
- Yes.
- Yes.

442
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,221
Let's go, Miss.

443
00:26:53,221 --> 00:26:53,900
Hurry up, Miss.

444
00:26:59,180 --> 00:26:59,820
Miss.

445
00:27:00,101 --> 00:27:00,660
Pei Yanzhen.

00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,861
the guards
of the Regent's Residence are here.

448
00:27:06,101 --> 00:27:07,420
I'm afraid we can't get Miss out today.

449
00:27:07,741 --> 00:27:08,501
Let's evacuate now.

450
00:27:08,701 --> 00:27:09,581
We'll find another chance.

451
00:27:10,381 --> 00:27:10,940
No.

452
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:12,101
If I leave now,

453
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,780
it'll be harder for Miaomiao
to escape from here.

(Happiness)

455

It's not right.

Tie Niu,

457
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,701
didn't we agree

458
00:27:33,701 --> 00:27:34,981
not to kill Pei Yanzhen?

459
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:36,900
But their every attack is fatal.

460
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,741
Watch out, Pei Yanzhen!

461
00:28:00,341 --> 00:28:00,900
Miss,

462
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,861
let's leave.

463
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,741
Lvying is still waiting for you
outside the city.

464
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:04,780
No.

465
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,621
I can't leave.

466
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:52,900
Are you alright, Zhan Yue?

467
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,461
Stay back.

Miao,

472
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:18,940
what's going on?

473
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:23,701
Are you trying to kill me?

474
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,940
Third Master Song did send someone over.

475
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,621
But I didn't want to kill...

476
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,780
So everything you said to me

477
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:36,820
was a lie.

478
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,341
Was it?

479
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,701
You were affectionate towards me.

480
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,581
It was just to gain my trust

481
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:46,221
and get the assassins

482
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,981
here, am I right?

483
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,221
Their every attack

484
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,461
was fatal.

485
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,581
Are you really so eager to kill me?

486
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,660
What about you?

487
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,501
Have you ever taken pity
on the Shen family's lives?

488
00:30:05,341 --> 00:30:06,581
You should've known me

489
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,741
and got prepared.

490
00:30:27,501 --> 00:30:28,501
I did.

491
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,741
But then, I forgot,

492
00:30:33,741 --> 00:30:34,341
Miao.

493
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,861
Watch out! Be careful!

494
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,020
Pei Yanzhen!

495
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,341
Watch out!

00:31:24,581 --> 00:31:25,180
Miao!

Miaomiao!

499

Miao.

500
00:31:39,501 --> 00:31:40,701
How dare you call her?

501
00:31:42,261 --> 00:31:42,780
Miaomiao.

502
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,900
Miaomiao, you fool.

503
00:31:45,581 --> 00:31:46,900

00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:14,021
I wonder how he's doing now.

671
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,221
Weiyang.

672
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:30,860
Be careful.

673
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:44,981
This way.

674
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,580
As you can't remember the past,

675
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,660
just forget it.

676
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:03,741
It breaks

677
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,580
my heart to see you like this.

678
00:40:14,541 --> 00:40:15,701
What a nice aroma.

679
00:40:15,701 --> 00:40:16,221
How is it?

680
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,100
Credit taken.

681
00:40:18,741 --> 00:40:20,180
I'll ask the physician to make more.

682
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,221
Wait.

683
00:40:24,261 --> 00:40:25,660
What is your name again?

684
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,701
Are you willing to accept me now?

685
00:40:28,741 --> 00:40:30,340
I'm Song Xiyuan.

686
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,701
Here you go again.

687
00:40:32,741 --> 00:40:33,380
Zhang San,

688
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,221
throw this guy out!

689
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,180
Tie Niu, you...

690
00:40:38,221 --> 00:40:38,741
Young Master,

691
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,741
it's Miss Sheng who pays me

692
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,420
my monthly wages now.

693
00:40:42,781 --> 00:40:43,380
Just go.

694
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,501
Sheng,

695
00:40:48,701 --> 00:40:49,660
I'll come to visit you again.

696
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,741
Don't ever come again.

697
00:40:50,741 --> 00:40:51,541
If it wasn't for you,

698
00:40:51,541 --> 00:40:53,061
I wouldn't have had
a headache and chest pain.

699
00:40:53,061 --> 00:40:54,061
Just stay away from me.

700
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,061
Young Master,

701
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,741
try to be considerate.

702
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,860
I'll need Miss Shen's help to put

703
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:02,021
in a good word for me with Miss Lvying

704
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,221
after she recovers.

705
00:41:04,701 --> 00:41:05,340
Let's go, Young Master.

706
00:41:05,501 --> 00:41:06,140
Stop disturbing her.

707
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:06,781
Don't touch me.

708
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:15,180
Young Master,

709
00:41:17,221 --> 00:41:17,940
do you think

710
00:41:18,261 --> 00:41:20,461
Miss Shen's illness is curable?

711
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,900
Why would we cure her?

712
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,781
What happened in the past was awful.

713
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,180
Isn't it better not to cure her?

714
00:41:27,741 --> 00:41:30,620
But she even forgot about our names.

715
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,541
And now, she seems to forget

716
00:41:32,541 --> 00:41:34,100
everything besides money.

717
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,140
I've looked

718
00:41:35,261 --> 00:41:36,301
for her five times this month.

719
00:41:36,301 --> 00:41:36,860
Stop.

720
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:40,380
First off, she only forgot your name.

721
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,580
She still remembers my surname.

722
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:42,580
Moreover,

723
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,461
if such a condition has emerged,

724
00:41:44,981 --> 00:41:46,301
shouldn't you watch over her

725
00:41:46,301 --> 00:41:47,461
and prevent her from running around?

726
00:41:48,021 --> 00:41:48,701
Let me tell you this.

727
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:49,940
Pei Yanzhen

728
00:41:50,261 --> 00:41:52,501
has always thought something is fishy
about Miaomiao's death.

729
00:41:52,781 --> 00:41:54,100
He has left the capital now.

730
00:41:54,501 --> 00:41:56,221
He might find us at any time.

731
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,900
If anything happens,

732
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,061
I'll never let you off.

733
00:42:02,021 --> 00:42:03,180
Official Pei has left the capital.

734
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,900
Then, does it mean Miss Lvying...

735
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,701
He's so selfish.

736
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,501
All he cares about is his wife.

737
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,981
He has no empathy at all.

738
00:42:18,541 --> 00:42:19,301
Be gentle.

739
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,580
Weiyang is such a good place.

740
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,701
There's a lot of good food and fun.

741
00:42:28,981 --> 00:42:29,701
Miss Lvying,

742
00:42:30,021 --> 00:42:30,741
in my opinion,

743
00:42:30,821 --> 00:42:33,100
His Highness said
he'll stay here for a long time.

744
00:42:33,541 --> 00:42:33,860
Look.

745
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,781
This is what I collected.

746
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,821
Where would you like to go?

747
00:42:35,821 --> 00:42:36,541
I'll bring you there.

748
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:41,701
Miss Lvying.

749
00:42:42,301 --> 00:42:43,061
Miss Lvying.

750
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,221
It's my master's fault.

751
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,380
He implicated an innocent man like me.

752
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,140
Official Zhao,

753
00:42:51,501 --> 00:42:52,660
His Highness asked you
to call the Prince over.

754
00:42:53,461 --> 00:42:54,261
