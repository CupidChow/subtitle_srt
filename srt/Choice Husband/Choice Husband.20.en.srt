As Pei Yanzhen predicted,

20
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:52,729
they faked their death.

21
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,409
But when they were buried,

22
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,570
we had checked on them.

23
00:01:57,089 --> 00:01:58,330
I heard there's a secret medicine
in the Western Regions

24
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,970
that can stop one from breathing.

25
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,010
I guess this is the thing.

26
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,050
It looks like Shen Miao is

27
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:05,809
hiding something.

28
00:02:30,529 --> 00:02:31,050
Miao,

29
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,289
you haven't eaten or drunk
for three days.

30
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,529
Have some food.

31
00:02:35,649 --> 00:02:37,410
Where did you take Lvying?

32
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,529
Try the fish congee I made.

33
00:02:43,529 --> 00:02:44,369
It's fragrant and soft.

34
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:46,890
It took me two hours to make it.

35
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,330
Pei Yanzhen,

36
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:51,970
what are you trying to do?

37
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,050
Miao,

38
00:02:57,929 --> 00:02:59,649
you promised
that you'll never leave me.

39
00:03:00,809 --> 00:03:01,610
You promised me that.

40
00:03:02,089 --> 00:03:03,569
I was just spitballing
and you really bought it.

41
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:05,890
You're too naive, Your Highness.

42
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,449
I just took a trip to the capital.

43
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:10,210
What exactly has happened
between us?

44
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,089
Just give Lvying back to me.

45
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:13,569
Or else,

46
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,809
I'll perish with you.

47
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,009
It seems like you're certain

48
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:25,449
that people from the Shen family
have escaped.

49
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:27,809
Today, my subordinates came
to report

50
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,169
that the coffins at the Shen's cemetery
were forced open.

51
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,009
The bodies of your aunt
and Shen Zai were missing.

52
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,970
A lot of valuable stuff
disappeared as well.

53
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,089
You've thought too much.

54
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,089
Not everyone

55
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:46,850
in this world is
as scheming as you.

56
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,250
But everyone in this world is

57
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:51,490
eyeing the fortune of the Shen family.

58
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,729
The tomb raiders are everywhere.

59
00:03:54,089 --> 00:03:56,569
So I'm sure this is the doing
of the tomb raiders.

60
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,529
What has it got to do with me?

61
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,009
I've heard of tomb raiding.

62
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:04,130
But I didn't know
they'd steal the bodies too.

63
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,369
What's so surprising about it?

64
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:07,050
Didn't you also keep my body

65
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,330
for three days?

66
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:13,569
Miao,

67
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,090
it's a big world.

68
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,890
Unless Father-in-law can vanish
into thin air,

69
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:21,409
otherwise,

70
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,370
I'll certainly find them out

71
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,650
as long as I want.

72
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:30,890
Are you threatening me?

73
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:57,810
I'll get you another bowl
of fish congee.

74
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,050
I've already got someone
on my mind.

75
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:33,249
As long as I can watch her
from afar,

76
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,449
that'd be enough.

77
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:36,770
Shut up.

78
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,569
Is this the young lady
of the Shen family?

79
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,330
She's so cute and smart.

80
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,530
I can tell that she's a beauty.

81
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,210
Right.

82
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,210
When she turns sixteen,

83
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,610
I'm sure there'll be

84
00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:06,650
many young men asking
to marry her.

85
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:07,490
I agree.

86
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,569
She's still a kid.

87
00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:10,009
Everything is not known yet.

88
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,169
Please take a seat over there.

89
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:17,210
Dad,

90
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:18,610
everyone compliments me.

91
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,890
Don't ever call me
Hairless Girl again.

92
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:23,610
Look, you have sparse hair

93
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,689
that can't even be braided.

94
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,569
It can only be made
into a small bun.

95
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,009
You're definitely

96
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:29,770
Hairless Girl.

97
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,449
Everyone says this.

98
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:32,849
Don't you underestimate me.

99
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,770
It's not that you're beautiful.

100
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:42,050
Obviously, they only think
that the fortune of

101
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:45,650
the Shen family and your grandpa,
the Lu family, is beautiful.

102
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:49,090
Miao, remember this.

103
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,129
As one of the Shen family,

104
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,530
don't ever think
of competing with the money.

105
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,689
To the people, money always comes

106
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:02,009
before the Shen family.

107
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,210
Got it?

108
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:07,249
Good girl.

109
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,169
Let's go.

110
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,129
I've always remembered this.

111
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:15,890
How could I totally forgot about this

112
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,129
just because Pei Yanzhen rejected
the proposal in front of everyone?

113
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:24,449
That I even dared to compare myself
with the money.

114
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,530
Well, now.

115
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,729
I invited the bad guy over

116
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,969
and lost all money
the Shen family owned.

117
00:07:56,689 --> 00:07:57,210
Miao,

118
00:07:57,569 --> 00:07:58,569
come and eat something.

119
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:03,009
I'm hungry.

120
00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:05,129
Eat with me.

121
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:11,530
After the meal,

122
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,689
I'll take you to Lvying.

123
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:21,969
You mean

124
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,129
Mother has been sent to the mausoleum?

125
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,009
And Pei Yanzhen

126
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,409
is actually my...

127
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:28,729
His Majesty didn't tell you this

128
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:31,050
because he didn't want
to get you into this mess.

129
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:32,489
Your Highness,

130
00:08:33,369 --> 00:08:35,210
my martial brother isn't
what you think he is.

131
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,410
Besides, Shen Miao is
alive and well now.

132
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,249
Just stop...

133
00:08:38,249 --> 00:08:39,369
What do you mean

134
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,049
by the person I think he is?

135
00:08:43,369 --> 00:08:44,489
He evicted

136
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,770
my mother.

137
00:08:46,369 --> 00:08:47,369
But the entire family of

138
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,850
Pei Yanzhen's biological mother
was killed.

139
00:08:51,689 --> 00:08:52,970
Now, even his foster parents

140
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,369
were killed by Empress Dowager.

141
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,249
I...

142
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:02,330
Fine.

143
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:03,650
Let me ask you this.

144
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:06,650
Did the Shen family

145
00:09:07,689 --> 00:09:09,449
have something to do
with his family vendetta?

146
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,850
Did they kill his family?

147
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:18,970
No matter what,

148
00:09:20,609 --> 00:09:21,650
I swear

149
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,249
to be at daggers drawn
with Pei Yanzhen.

150
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:28,369
Zhan Yue,

151
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:30,569
if you take his side,

152
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,609
from now on,

153
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:34,049
let's not meet again.

154
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,489
Very well.

155
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:50,249
Lvying.

156
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:51,689
Miss, are you alright?

157
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:52,569
Are you okay?

158
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:53,609
I'm fine.

159
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:54,410
Miaomiao,

160
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,330
did Pei Yanzhen make
things hard for you?

161
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,330
What happened?

162
00:10:02,249 --> 00:10:03,770
Did he threaten you
by torturing you?

163
00:10:04,129 --> 00:10:05,090
I'll go to him now.

164
00:10:05,369 --> 00:10:06,049
Third Master,

165
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,009
let bygones be bygones.

166
00:10:11,609 --> 00:10:12,330
Anyway,

167
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:14,129
you've helped me this time.

168
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,129
I'll be sure to find a way
to get you out of here.

169
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,129
What are you going to do?

170
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:23,330
Are you going to curry favor
with Pei Yanzhen?

171
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:26,609
No way.

172
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:28,770
I don't agree.

173
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,170
No matter what,

174
00:10:30,489 --> 00:10:32,449
it should be me to protect you.

175
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:38,489
Miaomiao,

176
00:10:39,609 --> 00:10:41,129
what exactly is going on?

177
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,210
Is there any misunderstanding
between us?

178
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:45,850
If yes,

179
00:10:46,249 --> 00:10:47,210
it must be Pei Yanzhen

180
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,170
who deliberately sows discord
among us.

181
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:52,850
The sun and moon can prove
my love for you.

182
00:10:57,489 --> 00:10:58,330
Then, you tell me.

183
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,009
How did Pei Yanzhen make himself
the Regent?

184
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:05,929
In fact, just like you,

185
00:11:07,609 --> 00:11:08,489
I was deceived.

186
00:11:15,689 --> 00:11:16,809
Did Pei Yanzhen

187
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,210
incite you to marry me?

188
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,090
No matter how our relationship started,

189
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:36,730
at this moment,

190
00:11:37,449 --> 00:11:38,730
I mean every word I say

191
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,929
and every move I make.

192
00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:00,129
You haven't slept for three days.

193
00:12:00,609 --> 00:12:01,330
Go take a break.

194
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:03,689
No.

195
00:12:04,609 --> 00:12:05,730
There are some memorials
I need to read.

196
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:08,689
Pei Yanzhen,

197
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,049
now that you've got your revenge,

198
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,689
it's time for you to stop this.

199
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:20,730
You're asking me

200
00:12:21,369 --> 00:12:22,569
to let go of Shen Miao?

201
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,049
The Shen family faked their death,

202
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,210
but it's true that you've used her.

203
00:12:28,369 --> 00:12:29,009
There's a huge

204
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,129
misunderstanding between you.

205
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,369
Miao.

206
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:42,170
Come with me.

207
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:43,770
I've got something to tell you.

208
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,650
Will you let me hug you for a while?

209
00:13:13,489 --> 00:13:14,049
Miao.

210
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,809
You have no idea
what has happened to me lately.

211
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,249
The imperial court is tumultuous.

212
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,650
My parents were forced
to kill themselves.

213
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,369
Even you want to leave now.

214
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,290
If I could end this furor sooner,

215
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,210
maybe everything would be different.

216
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:31,609
Miao,

217
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,410
don't ever leave me again, okay?

218
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:40,609
Okay.

219
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:45,249
If I promise you,

220
00:13:46,569 --> 00:13:48,489
when are you going
to let Song Xiyuan go?

221
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,689
Do you succumb to me

222
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,129
just to intercede for Song Xiyuan?

223
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:21,249
If you don't let him go,

224
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,489
- I'll...
- What will you do?

225
00:14:24,369 --> 00:14:26,129
I'm just a commoner.

226
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:27,689
How would I dare

227
00:14:28,249 --> 00:14:29,249
and how else can I do?

228
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,770
Are you going to talk to me like this?

229
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:32,369
What else can I do?

230
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,009
You said that Shen family
might be annihilated yourself.

231
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,090
I thought

232
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:46,369
there might be
some kind of mistake.

233
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:56,249
It's like what you said.

234
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:57,970
You use the sword with your left hand

235
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:59,129
and write with your right hand.

236
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:01,410
You indeed excel in literature
and martial arts.

237
00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:03,489
No wonder you never used
your left hand

238
00:15:03,489 --> 00:15:04,650
to hold my hand.

239
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,970
Might be annihilated?

240
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,650
Might be annihilated!

241
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:09,530
Pei Yanzhen,

242
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:11,210
that's so cruel of you.

243
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,449
Listen to me, Miao.

244
00:15:20,489 --> 00:15:21,850
I can't believe you want to kill me

245
00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:23,569
with the hairpin I gave you.

246
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,850
I should've killed you earlier.

247
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:26,929
It's the only way

248
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:28,809
to keep my family away from bad luck.

249
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:29,689
It's the only way

250
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,530
to take away my wrath.

251
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,369
I can only take Xiao away
after killing you.

252
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,330
So you faked your death

253
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,730
just to get away from me

254
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,170
and find a chance to take revenge on me.

255
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,009
So what if it's true?

256
00:15:41,129 --> 00:15:42,410
After what you did to the Shen family

257
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:43,449
and me,

258
00:15:43,689 --> 00:15:45,129
shouldn't I kill you?

259
00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:46,290
Shen Miao!

260
00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:14,609
You don't have to remind me

261
00:16:15,369 --> 00:16:16,929
that my surname is Shen.

262
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:19,809
If not,

263
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,449
why would you marry me

264
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,770
and feed me the
contraceptive medicine?

265
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:29,290
If I wasn't from the Shen family,

266
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:32,369
why would you eagerly instruct
the Song family to ask for my hand?

267
00:16:32,369 --> 00:16:34,330
It's just you feared that someone
would obtain my family's fortune.

268
00:16:34,569 --> 00:16:36,809
Yet, you pretended to be
at daggers drawn with them.

269
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,609
If I wasn't from the Shen family,

270
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,650
why would you send Xiao
to Pei's Residence

271
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,009
on the eve of your trip to the capital?

272
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:44,449
It was to protect your son
from getting hurt,

273
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,249
when the Shen family was encircled
and vanquished.

274
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,609
If I wasn't from the Shen family,

275
00:16:53,689 --> 00:16:56,009
why would you put your life at stake

276
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,090
to reject the proposal?

277
00:16:58,249 --> 00:16:59,290
It was to cheat my dad out
of his seal

278
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,530
to help you with the regime change.

279
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:01,609
Your Highness,

280
00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:04,450
were you excited

281
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,209
when you knew that I fell for you?

282
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:12,369
The name "Pei Yanzhen" holds

283
00:17:13,489 --> 00:17:15,329
the meaning of concealing the truth.

284
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,849
I, Shen Miao, am really pathetic
and ludicrous.

285
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:23,050
I've lost my body, fortune and family

286
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,890
for nothing.

287
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,530
Even now, I still don't know
about your real name.

288
00:17:28,969 --> 00:17:30,530
I'm such a joke,

289
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,969
that it's unprecedented.

290
00:17:33,489 --> 00:17:34,810
It's extremely ridiculous.

291
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:39,849
So you think

292
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:42,129
that I incited Song Xiyuan
to ask for your hand?

293
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:43,890
I rejected the proposal

294
00:17:45,009 --> 00:17:46,489
just to obtain
the Shen family's seal?

295
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,129
Now that you've wielded wide powers,

296
00:17:51,849 --> 00:17:53,369
why bother pretending?

297
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,369
Didn't you marry me

298
00:17:55,969 --> 00:17:57,290
for the fortune of the Shen family?

299
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:02,209
And for the Lu family's fortune?

300
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:04,690
The whereabout
of the Lu family's fortune is unknown.

301
00:18:05,369 --> 00:18:06,329
You pull this charade

302
00:18:06,849 --> 00:18:08,369
just to make me talk.

303
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,770
Am I right?

304
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,650
It doesn't matter anymore.

305
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,290
All I wish now is
that you could let me go.

306
00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:23,969
For the sake that the great fortune

307
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,209
of the Shen family is within your reach.

308
00:18:38,489 --> 00:18:40,089
And for the sake

309
00:18:43,249 --> 00:18:45,089
that I've served you
and your subordinate,

310
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:47,729
Song Xiyuan

311
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,849
for the past three years.

312
00:18:51,249 --> 00:18:51,930
Shut up!

313
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:02,329
Shen Miao,

314
00:19:04,329 --> 00:19:05,450
I don't care what you think.

315
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,009
You've promised that you won't leave me.

316
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,329
You must practice

317
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:10,849
what you preach.

318
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,209
(Without my command,)

319
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:19,170
(Miss Shen is not allowed
to leave here.)

320
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:20,410
(Noted.)

321
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,220
(Shen's Residence)

322
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:55,770
Move!

323
00:19:56,969 --> 00:19:57,530
Be gentle.

324
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,009
Move!

325
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,530
Are you alright, Young Master?

326
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:03,690
This is an order from His Highness.

327
00:20:04,089 --> 00:20:05,450
Official Song, please leave
Shen's Residence

328
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:06,450
and don't ever come back.

329
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:16,329
Young Master,

330
00:20:17,209 --> 00:20:18,690
what should we do next?

331
00:20:20,489 --> 00:20:21,089
Let's go back to the capital.

332
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:25,009
Pei Yanzhen holds great power now.

333
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,530
If we want to save
Miaomiao from him,

334
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:29,530
we'll have to make
a well-thought-out plan.

335
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:32,290
Young Master,

336
00:20:33,089 --> 00:20:34,489
are you sure you can defeat him?

337
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:36,849
I'm serious

338
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,690
this time.

339
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,329
I've let Lvying in.

340
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:12,410
I didn't tell her
that it was your order.

341
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:17,650
Can't you two just talk nicely?

342
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:21,609
So what if I do?

343
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:24,729
Whatever I say now,

344
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:26,810
she won't believe it.

345
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:44,729
Dad.

346
00:21:47,209 --> 00:21:47,729
Mom.

347
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:06,690
(Miao.)

348
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,890
(You must stay safe.)

349
00:22:14,609 --> 00:22:15,530
Come take a look.

350
00:22:21,369 --> 00:22:22,170
Sir,

351
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:25,170
did you return from the South?

352
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,890
I'd like to ask you something.

353
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,089
The South?

354
00:22:30,209 --> 00:22:31,290
We can't go there anymore.

355
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,329
Now the national affairs are
at Regent's command.

356
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:36,609
He commanded to conduct strict
investigations at the checkpoints.

357
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:38,890
No one does
business there anymore.

358
00:22:39,209 --> 00:22:40,129
Regent?

359
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:42,770
He's the former Minister of Revenue,

360
00:22:43,209 --> 00:22:44,930
Official Pei Yanzhen.

361
00:22:46,969 --> 00:22:47,450
I'll get going.

362
00:23:04,969 --> 00:23:05,450
Please rise.

363
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,729
I take refuge in the ancestral hall,

364
00:23:11,729 --> 00:23:12,489
and ignore the public affairs.

365
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,890
Xiyuan, what do you need

366
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:16,170
to see me about?

367
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,570
I'm not here

368
00:23:18,969 --> 00:23:19,770
for the public affairs.

369
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:23,009
I'm just wondering if you're keeping

370
00:23:23,249 --> 00:23:25,690
a carp or a golden dragon
in the pond.

371
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:30,849
You must be joking.

372
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,089
This is just a small garden.

373
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:34,530
There's no golden dragon.

374
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:39,290
A dragon should be staying
at an abyss.

375
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,050
It lays dormant temporarily

376
00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:42,690
for the future.

377
00:23:43,969 --> 00:23:44,729
Unfortunately,

378
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,969
the only golden dragon in the world

379
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:49,009
seems to have taken a long break

380
00:23:49,249 --> 00:23:50,690
that its claws and scales
have been worn blunt.

381
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:51,410
Nonsense!

382
00:23:53,489 --> 00:23:54,489
With Regent around,

383
00:23:54,849 --> 00:23:56,209
how dare you say that.

384
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,410
I just want you to know

385
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:02,810
that whenever it is,

386
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:06,249
I won't show my loyalty
to anybody else

387
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:07,969
besides Your Majesty.

388
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:15,009
I'm tired.

389
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,530
You should go back.

390
00:24:35,969 --> 00:24:36,450
Young Master,

391
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:37,890
how was it?

392
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:40,650
His Majesty didn't agree.

393
00:24:41,729 --> 00:24:42,570
What to do, then?

394
00:24:43,969 --> 00:24:44,609
Tie Niu,

395
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,170
look at the people behind me.

396
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:48,249
Don't they look familiar?

397
00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:50,890
Young Master,

398
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,009
are you joking?

399
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,810
This is my first time at the palace.

400
00:24:54,249 --> 00:24:55,489
You're joking.

401
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:56,690
Didn't you see them wearing

402
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,530
the same military uniform
as Pei Yanzhen's men?

403
00:25:01,729 --> 00:25:02,249
We're toast.

404
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:03,329
Young Master,

405
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:04,729
you're saying

406
00:25:05,209 --> 00:25:07,129
that the entire palace has been
under Pei Yanzhen's control?

407
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,129
It seems like I've underestimated him.

408
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:11,369
He's able to go this far.

409
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:13,570
I think it's just his choice

410
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,329
whether to take the throne.

411
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:16,690
Doesn't it mean
we're in great trouble now?

412
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:19,969
We're screwed.

413
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,770
How could I have
a silly subordinate like you?

414
00:25:22,329 --> 00:25:23,089
It doesn't mean

415
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:24,530
this will last forever.

416
00:25:25,009 --> 00:25:26,209
Pei Yanzhen is not in the capital.

417
00:25:26,969 --> 00:25:29,209
Someone in court
must've been restless.

418
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:31,369
It's a perfect time
to make connections.

419
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,089
Come, Young Master.

420
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:38,530
Miss.

421
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,129
Miss.

422
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:48,249
How could you have the mood

423
00:25:48,249 --> 00:25:49,530
to play with the bird
at a time like this?

424
00:25:51,209 --> 00:25:52,089
If it wasn't for it,

425
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,009
I'm afraid I would've died long ago.

426
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:56,290
Also,

427
00:25:56,969 --> 00:25:57,849
besides playing with the bird,

428
00:25:58,329 --> 00:25:59,249
what else can I do?

429
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:06,129
Miss Shen,

430
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,489
His Highness asked me
to bring the bird over.

431
00:26:11,209 --> 00:26:11,930
Official Zhan,

432
00:26:12,209 --> 00:26:13,690
this is the only fun Miss has got.

433
00:26:17,729 --> 00:26:18,530
This is His Highness's order.

434
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,329
I dare not disobey it.

435
00:26:21,129 --> 00:26:21,930
Miss.

436
00:26:22,489 --> 00:26:23,089
Never mind.

437
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:28,729
Guard Zhan,

438
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,290
the Mid-Autumn Festival is
approaching.

439
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,369
Last year at this time,

440
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,890
there were many people gathering
at Shen's Residence,

441
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:37,129
viewing the moon,
enjoying mooncakes

442
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,290
and eating osmanthus cakes.

443
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:40,770
Everything is different now.

444
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,209
But I need to find sustenance
in something.

445
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:46,209
Can you please buy me
some osmanthus cakes?

446
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,890
Pei Yanzhen, the scholar,

447
00:27:04,329 --> 00:27:06,650
is handsome and knowledgeable.

448
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:09,209
He's a decent gentleman.

449
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:12,489
Do you really think

450
00:27:12,489 --> 00:27:14,489
this silly bird is a trap
that Song Xiyuan set?

451
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:15,609
Whether it's true or not,

452
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:17,650
I don't want it
to stay by Miao's side.

453
00:27:20,089 --> 00:27:21,450
I'll go get Shen Miao
some pastries.

454
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:28,489
Pei

455
00:27:29,009 --> 00:27:30,329
is so mean.

456
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,249
He'll be back soon?

457
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:33,770
But he's not back yet.

458
00:27:34,329 --> 00:27:35,410
Fried Cabbage with Vinegar.

459
00:27:48,489 --> 00:27:49,129
Pei Yanzhen,

460
00:27:49,489 --> 00:27:51,089
are you captured by Empress Dowager?

461
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:53,369
Mother,

462
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:55,849
can you stop disturbing me?

463
00:27:55,849 --> 00:27:57,170
How can you talk
to your mother like this?

464
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,770
Great-uncle said

465
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,170
one should concentrate,

466
00:28:00,249 --> 00:28:02,729
be sincere, be patient

467
00:28:02,729 --> 00:28:05,170
and clear the mind while studying.

468
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,209
Let me see what you're reading.

469
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:11,050
- Come on.
- No.

470
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,170
Let me see.

471
00:28:12,729 --> 00:28:13,489
Or I'll tickle you.

472
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:14,209
If you don't let me see,

473
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:14,849
I'll tickle you.

474
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,609
Let me take a look.

475
00:28:17,369 --> 00:28:19,170
Do you know all these words?

476
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,060
(Peace and Prosperity)

477
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,770
Miss, here are the osmanthus cakes.

478
00:29:13,489 --> 00:29:14,089
Miss.

479
00:29:14,249 --> 00:29:15,249
What did Master Song say?

480
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:17,450
Song Xiyuan said

481
00:29:17,849 --> 00:29:18,570
he has contacted

482
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,489
the officials in the capital
who are against Pei Yanzhen.

483
00:29:20,849 --> 00:29:22,249
He asked us to find a way
to go to the capital.

484
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,650
Then, he'll take the chance
to get us out.

485
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:25,729
It looks like Master Song

486
00:29:25,729 --> 00:29:26,890
is true to you, Miss.

487
00:29:27,129 --> 00:29:28,570
There are good guys in the world.

488
00:29:31,489 --> 00:29:32,410
Then, do you think

489
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:35,450
he does it for my sake

490
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,329
or for the sake
of the Lu family's fortune?

491
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:44,209
Do you know where the Lu family hid
their money?

492
00:29:44,729 --> 00:29:45,609
If we get the money,

493
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,849
would we be able
to bring Regent down?

494
00:29:52,849 --> 00:29:53,890
The Lu family's fortune is

495
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:55,770
just a rumor.

496
00:29:57,369 --> 00:29:58,129
But,

497
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:01,209
we can use this method

498
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,170
to go to the capital.

499
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,369
It takes forever to pick it like this.

500
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:32,650
After so long,

501
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,570
it's all I've got.

502
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:36,930
I got an idea.

503
00:30:38,249 --> 00:30:38,770
Lvying.

504
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:41,650
Lvying.

505
00:30:42,729 --> 00:30:43,290
Lv...

506
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:44,650
Pei Yanzhen,

507
00:30:45,369 --> 00:30:45,770
come here.

508
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:47,930
Perfect timing.

509
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:49,170
I'd like to make osmanthus cakes today.

510
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,770
Help me pick
some osmanthus flowers, will you?

511
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:52,969
You're so virtuous.

512
00:30:53,369 --> 00:30:54,249
What can I do to repay you?

513
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,329
Just let me enjoy the food alone.

514
00:30:56,329 --> 00:30:56,849
Just don't eat it.

515
00:30:56,849 --> 00:30:57,609
It's considered a payback.

516
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:58,650
Will you help me?

517
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:00,290
Sure.

518
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:06,060
♪For whom am I waiting
this relationship for?♪

519
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:12,900
♪The tangling love
becomes the river under the sky♪

520
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:20,180
♪The years are long. The night is short.
The clear spring wine is warm♪

521
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:26,340
♪The passing of time goes on and on♪

522
00:31:27,489 --> 00:31:28,009
This will be sufficient.

523
00:31:31,969 --> 00:31:32,770
Quickly get down here.

524
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:34,930
Well,

525
00:31:35,609 --> 00:31:36,770
Lvying took the ladder away.

526
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:37,849
She went to pick the flowers
from another tree.

527
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,530
Well, you can catch me
from down there.

528
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,290
I'll jump off the roof.

529
00:31:43,249 --> 00:31:45,129
I only agreed to catch
the flowers for you.

530
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:47,329
I didn't say I'd catch you.

531
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:48,450
Pei Yanzhen!

532
00:31:49,089 --> 00:31:50,450
Then, am I allowed to try the cake?

533
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:53,249
Lvying!

534
00:31:53,609 --> 00:31:54,129
Lv...

535
00:31:56,969 --> 00:31:57,690
Pei Yanzhen,

536
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,849
you don't have compassion for the lady.

537
00:32:01,009 --> 00:32:02,249
Didn't you refuse

538
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:03,609
to help me?

539
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:05,690
They are

540
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:06,729
different.

541
00:32:10,969 --> 00:32:11,810
If you catch me,

542
00:32:12,729 --> 00:32:14,690
I'll make osmanthus cakes
for you every year.

543
00:32:22,129 --> 00:32:22,609
Miao.

544
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:23,050
Be careful!

545
00:32:24,489 --> 00:32:25,329
What are you doing here?

546
00:32:28,009 --> 00:32:28,530
Miao,

547
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:32,770
I'd like to eat
the osmanthus cakes you make.

548
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:40,129
You said

549
00:32:41,489 --> 00:32:42,450
that if I caught you,

550
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,089
you'd make osmanthus cakes
for me every year.

551
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:49,450
But the next year,

552
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,410
we got divorced hastily.

553
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:55,890
Now that I've caught you,

554
00:32:59,129 --> 00:33:00,129
where is my osmanthus cake?

555
00:33:09,209 --> 00:33:10,530
I did make you osmanthus cakes.

556
00:33:12,129 --> 00:33:12,890
Did you forget it?

557
00:33:15,089 --> 00:33:15,770
Pei Yanzhen,

558
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,009
I even specially made you...

559
00:33:18,009 --> 00:33:18,650
Miss Shen,

560
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:20,249
I'm promoted to Minister of Revenue.

561
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:23,249
I'll leave Lingzhou and go
to the capital with His Majesty

562
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:24,770
tomorrow to take office.

563
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:30,340
♪Grant me a life
where we grow old together♪

564
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,980
♪Who sends the love letter

565
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,820
♪At the river of lovesickness?♪

566
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:41,320
♪Grant me happiness for
the rest of my life together with you♪

567
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,930
It was the osmanthus cake you made?

568
00:33:43,729 --> 00:33:45,089
Did you not know what it was?

569
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,489
I never opened it.

570
00:33:50,249 --> 00:33:51,530
Because I was afraid
if I opened it,

571
00:33:53,089 --> 00:33:54,050
I wouldn't have the heart

572
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:56,609
to leave you and our kid behind

573
00:33:57,249 --> 00:33:58,249
and go to the capital.

574
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:04,249
That time, you said

575
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,650
you didn't want to implicate us,

576
00:34:07,249 --> 00:34:08,450
so you heartlessly rejected us

577
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:09,250
and left us alone.

578
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:11,970
But now, you always claim

579
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,529
that you keep me here

580
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:15,970
and separate me from my kid

581
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,010
for my own good.

582
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:22,490
Pei Yanzhen,

583
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:24,890
I can't figure out

584
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:26,769
if you're telling me

585
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,809
the truth.

586
00:34:29,769 --> 00:34:30,410
Miao,

587
00:34:31,609 --> 00:34:32,930
the two things you mentioned

588
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,170
are true.

589
00:34:48,769 --> 00:34:49,970
The moon is almost full.

590
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:02,049
Yanzhen,

591
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,250
I'm just an ordinary lady.

592
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:09,129
All I wish is
a simple sheer of happiness.

593
00:35:10,769 --> 00:35:11,769
From now on,

594
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:13,650
let's stop harboring suspicion,

595
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:14,970
and forget about the power

596
00:35:15,529 --> 00:35:16,450
and the fortune,

597
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:17,970
okay?

598
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,529
I'll overlook the past.

599
00:35:22,769 --> 00:35:24,170
It's the Mid-Autumn Festival.

600
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,690
Let's be happy together.

601
00:35:27,769 --> 00:35:28,490
I'll pick the osmanthus flowers

602
00:35:29,089 --> 00:35:30,849
to make pastries for you every year.

603
00:35:31,569 --> 00:35:32,210
Okay?

604
00:35:41,529 --> 00:35:42,730
What's done is done.

605
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:44,250
I've gone so far.

606
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:49,129
I can't just give up as I want.

607
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,049
The entire world belongs
to the Emperor.

608
00:35:56,369 --> 00:35:57,529
Only with the power,

609
00:35:58,769 --> 00:36:00,250
I can protect you and Xiao.

610
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,410
You can't have it both ways.

611
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:11,250
The moon waxes only to wane.
What goes up must come down.

612
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,490
Your Highness, you're too ambitious

613
00:36:14,769 --> 00:36:15,609
and greedy.

614
00:36:16,569 --> 00:36:17,450
It's not that I'm greedy.

615
00:36:18,769 --> 00:36:19,890
But this is the fact.

616
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:21,809
Miao,

617
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,010
just stay by my side

618
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:26,450
and have faith in me.

619
00:36:30,569 --> 00:36:31,369
Unfortunately,

620
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:35,250
even if you keep me here
for my entire life,

621
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,450
you still won't be able to get
the fortune of the Shen and Lu family.

622
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:44,329
The two families' fortune is
no longer in my hands.

623
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:47,329
They're not with any
of the Shen family either.

624
00:36:48,769 --> 00:36:50,569
I've already given it
to somebody else.

625
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,450
(You still think that I do this
for the Lu family's fortune?)

626
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,089
Is it Song Xiyuan again?

627
00:37:09,289 --> 00:37:10,010
Does it matter?

628
00:37:15,769 --> 00:37:16,650
Just get some rest.

629
00:37:17,809 --> 00:37:19,809
I'll come and visit you again.

630
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,250
I'm too greedy.

631
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,890
It's just a few pieces
of osmanthus cakes.

632
00:37:53,809 --> 00:37:56,450
It's no match for the great fortune
of the two families.

633
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:02,609
Let alone the entire nation.

634
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,210
Regent invents new policies.

635
00:38:10,369 --> 00:38:13,609
He stops the mutiny, allows people
to raise voices, combats corruption,

636
00:38:14,049 --> 00:38:17,250
promotes agricultural development,
reduces taxes, expands the imperial exam,

637
00:38:17,569 --> 00:38:18,569
and rectifies
the officials' styles of work.

638
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:22,049
We'll do as he commands.

639
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:24,450
But now, the national treasury is empty.

640
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:25,970
If we reduce the taxes,

641
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,930
we won't be able to support the soldiers
who are posted at the border gate

642
00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:32,250
and it'll make things hard
for the scholar and military officials.

643
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:33,289
Your Majesty,

644
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:36,890
prohibit referrals, expand
the imperial exam and recruit talents

645
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,730
might be able to prevent the officials
from forming a conspiracy.

646
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:42,569
But it'll also cause the problem
of having redundant officials.

647
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:44,890
Do not make rash decisions.

648
00:38:48,089 --> 00:38:48,730
Liu,

649
00:38:49,569 --> 00:38:50,890
you're the Minister of Personnel.

650
00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:52,210
Do not talk nonsense.

651
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:53,809
Your Majesty,

652
00:38:54,289 --> 00:38:56,010
this is not nonsense.

653
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,849
Please reconsider it.

654
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,450
Regent has made up his mind.

655
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:02,650
Do not cause trouble again.

656
00:39:03,609 --> 00:39:04,210
Are you trying

657
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:06,410
to make Regent mad?

658
00:39:08,049 --> 00:39:08,609
That's enough.

659
00:39:09,049 --> 00:39:09,809
I'm tired.

660
00:39:10,329 --> 00:39:12,010
Let's call it a day.

661
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:14,490
If there's anything else,

662
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,369
just let Regent make
the decision.

663
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,129
- Goodbye, Your Majesty.
- Goodbye, Your Majesty.

664
00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:34,250
As Regent insists

665
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,730
on reducing taxes
and rectifying the styles of work,

666
00:39:36,089 --> 00:39:37,970
we won't have the money,
the guts and the time

667
00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:40,329
to listen to music, enjoy dances
and drink wine here anymore.

668
00:39:41,609 --> 00:39:44,250
Official Lu, are you afraid
of being annihilated?

669
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:48,010
But isn't it too late to say this now?

670
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:51,089
When you supported
Official Pei back then,

671
00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:53,250
did you ever think
that this would happen?

672
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:55,210
Official Song,

673
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,210
you're the only one

674
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,210
who can confront him now.

675
00:39:59,849 --> 00:40:02,690
Do you have a plan?

676
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:06,410
Tie Niu.

677
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:07,529
All of you may leave.

678
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,609
Since the Regent is unkind,

679
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:15,369
we could just go against him.

680
00:40:16,529 --> 00:40:17,730
Giving the power back
to His Majesty

681
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:19,089
is the right thing to do.

682
00:40:19,609 --> 00:40:21,970
But the military troop is
under Pei Yanzhen's command.

683
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:23,650
How are we supposed to do that?

684
00:40:28,609 --> 00:40:29,890
Eliminate his bodyguards,

685
00:40:30,329 --> 00:40:31,490
lower his guard,

686
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:33,730
and lure him into the trap.

687
00:40:34,529 --> 00:40:36,529
It'll make things a lot easier for us.

688
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:40,250
But there's no way
he'd do it without a struggle.

689
00:40:42,849 --> 00:40:44,010
I have my way.

690
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:09,210
He's here.

691
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:16,970
Miss!

692
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:28,849
How is your foot?

693
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:31,650
Miao,

694
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:33,010
your arm has just recovered.

695
00:41:33,129 --> 00:41:34,329
How could you be so careless?

696
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:37,089
I'm fine.

697
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:39,890
It's the Mid-Autumn Festival today.

698
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:41,809
But there's no one

699
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,410
at Shen's Residence,

700
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,250
and I'm all alone here.

701
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:46,730
So I was a little spaced out.

702
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:47,930
You have me.

703
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:49,049
I'm here with you.

704
00:41:50,529 --> 00:41:51,010
Miao,

705
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:51,970
what would you like to eat?

706
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,049
Or what would you like to watch?

707
00:41:53,289 --> 00:41:54,170
I'll have it arranged right away.

708
00:41:56,049 --> 00:41:57,369
I can do that too.

709
00:41:58,849 --> 00:41:59,529
Just that

710
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,450
I'd like to go out
and buy something.

711
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:03,970
Do you allow me to do that?

712
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:05,089
What do you need?

713
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:06,970
I'll ask someone to buy it for you.

714
00:42:14,329 --> 00:42:15,730
It's the Mid-Autumn Festival today.

715
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:18,250
I'd like to make some osmanthus cakes
as it's the tradition

716
00:42:18,529 --> 00:42:19,450
of the Shen family.

717
00:42:20,089 --> 00:42:21,289
But making osmanthus cakes

718
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:23,809
is quite an art. There are
many things to pay attention to.

719
00:42:24,369 --> 00:42:26,410
I'm afraid the servants won't know
what I need.

720
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,170
But you just sprained your ankle.

721
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:30,849
I'm alright.

722
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:32,210
Look.

723
00:42:34,569 --> 00:42:35,170
It's doing well.

724
00:42:37,049 --> 00:42:38,289
I'll ask Zhan Yue to go with you.

725
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:40,609
He can protect you.

726
00:42:40,609 --> 00:42:41,129
Okay?

727
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:43,410
As you wish.

728
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:47,730
Miao,

729
00:42:48,809 --> 00:42:49,650
the osmanthus cakes for tonight,

730
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:50,930
can I have them too?

731
00:42:55,609 --> 00:42:56,569
I'll see you here

732
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:58,410
tonight.
