1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
As long as I can enter the Ning'an Palace

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,200
and pay all the price

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,600
I will be willing to do so.

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,400
The End

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,800
The End

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,800
Everything seems to be a dream.

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,400
I have owed a lot of people.

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,800
Chaozhe, help me.

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,600
I will be a good person after this.

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
The End

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
I will be the one to take the favor.

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,800
There are some things you can't give me.

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
But what about them?

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,000
The life you chose is for Mr. You.

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,400
In this world, everyone has the right to escape.

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,000
But I can't.

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,000
I want to regret it.

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,400
I will do my best to return.

20
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,400
Does Mr. Zhang believe that everything is decided?

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,200
I would rather believe in the future.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,200
Congratulations, Your Highness.

23
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,000
Congratulations, Your Highness.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,400
We are all in the same boat.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,200
Ning'an, what are you doing?

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,200
In the end,

27
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,800
there is a pair of invisible hands

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,800
that can break everything.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,600
The revenge is long.

30
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,800
Who are you?

31
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,800
The Emperor of the mortal world is so long-winded.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,200
He is so absurd.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,800
The Emperor of the mortal world is so absurd.

34
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,200
The End

35
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,200
Mr. Zhang, which one do you think is better for me than me?

36
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,200
You are the one who is the most beautiful girl in the world.

37
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:59,200
The End

38
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,000
Your Majesty.

39
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,200
Xie Qing, I told you to tell you a good news.

40
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,200
Zhang Zhe is in the spy camp.

41
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,200
He has found several spy bases in the capital.

42
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200
Mr. Zhang is so mysterious.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,200
He is much happier than the new one.

44
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,200
Zhang Qing thinks that the spy base is not involved in the spy case.

45
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,200
Your Majesty, the spy base was captured by Zhao Xing.

46
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,200
He has no evidence of the fall and fall of the spy base.

47
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,200
Zhao Xing also tried to find out the secret between the spy base and Zhao Xing.

48
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,200
So you mean the spy base is innocent?

49
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,200
Not necessarily.

50
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,200
I came here today to ask His Majesty to give me a decree

51
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,200
to go to Tongzhou.

52
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,200
Is it possible that the spy base is innocent?

53
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,200
It is not meaningful to argue with the spy base.

54
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,200
It can only be proven by the fact.

55
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,200
It is not urgent.

56
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
Mr. Gu is going to enter the capital today.

57
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,200
You help me to bring the people here.

58
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,200
I will take the stuff and finish it.

59
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
Then I will go to Tongzhou.

60
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,200
Yes.

61
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,200
Uncle Xue is smart.

62
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,200
He is a little bit suspicious.

63
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
He is trying to get the post.

64
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,200
But he is not aware of the danger.

65
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,200
Who would have thought that Mr. Xie who is getting the news every day

66
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,200
is the real danger of his family.

67
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,200
Sister Liu, are you there?

68
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
Come in.

69
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,200
I came to ask you about your business.

70
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,200
If you are not here, I will be relieved.

71
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,200
I didn't expect that you came to secretly eat snacks.

72
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,200
You are a little bit greedy.

73
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,200
Have a taste.

74
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,200
This is so delicious.

75
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,200
You came to Tonghe Village.

76
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,200
It is just a common snack in the palace.

77
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,200
It is not fishy.

78
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,200
If you like it...

79
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,200
I like it.

80
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,200
Then I will take it.

81
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
Thank you, sister.

82
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,200
I want you to try it.

83
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,200
I didn't ask you to leave a piece of it for me.

84
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,200
The guest for today is here.

85
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
Come on in.

86
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,200
Good day, Mr. Xie.

87
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Tell me, is this man old and confused?

88
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,200
He was the one who talked about it a few days ago.

89
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,200
I knew it long ago.

90
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
Are you sure?

91
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,200
Shengping gets an assistant,

92
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,200
so I come to save you.

93
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
Thank you!

94
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,200
Today's image is an chưaistic.

95
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,080
You know Zhao Jing!

96
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,280
You've got a plan.

97
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,520
Three months ago,

98
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,720
my head got cherish again.

99
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,800
I don't know that you'd come back because of me.

100
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,120
Let me talk to minority of Vocal School basketball team.

101
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,800
Luckily,

102
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,800
It's better than my cooking.

103
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,680
Is it that good?

104
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,040
Of course.

105
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,880
Do you want to try it?

106
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,640
Then try it.

107
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,160
What's wrong?

108
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,600
Nothing.

109
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,160
What?

110
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,240
I can't suppose I can't bear it.

111
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,240
Why did I take the whole dish away?

112
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,420
King of Tienjiang,

113
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,600
and everyone will have to struggle,

114
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,360
work,

115
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,760
and mingle.

116
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,740
Those who fear unsafe things

117
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,120
won't be able to pull themselves together.

118
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,120
Do you think it��ore

119
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,160
The

120
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:54,920
Lord.

121
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,480
You're back!

122
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,160
Yesterday this δεν

123
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,240
he even made a few pauses.

124
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,560
Lord, you don't have

125
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,680
you have the chance to get a reasonable look today.

126
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,280
Lord,

127
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,600
I won't do it anymore.

128
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Throw this away.

129
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
Teacher.

130
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,600
The execution of the Ministry of Justice has been settled.

131
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
The clothes and clothes in the house have been arranged.

132
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,600
These are not urgent.

133
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,600
I once thought that with your personality,

134
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,600
it would be hard to be in the Golden Tribe.

135
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,600
You have grown up a lot since you came back.

136
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,600
Let me ask you.

137
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,600
What do you think of Yan's case?

138
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
It's a little bit.

139
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
Whether it's a letter or a letter,

140
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,600
it's more like the disaster of the Xue family.

141
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
But if Yan's family is innocent,

142
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,600
the traitor who caught him in the Golden Tribe

143
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
must be someone else.

144
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
If Yan's family doesn't catch him,

145
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,600
it's hard to get rid of the crime.

146
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,600
You're right.

147
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,600
Yan Xue's grudge has nothing to do with the Ministry of Justice.

148
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
But the person who colluded with King Pingnan in the case

149
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
must be found out.

150
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Otherwise, the case will be closed for the next day.

151
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
If Yan's family is not in the Golden Tribe,

152
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,600
he must be very concerned about the progress of Yan's family.

153
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
Do you have any clues?

154
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
What's wrong?

155
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Someone indeed came to find the student for this case.

156
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
Who?

157
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,600
Crown Prince Shao Shi, Xie Ju An.

158
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,600
Zhang Zhen is in the Yan's family's office and is in the Palace of Justice.

159
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
But he can't find out the truth.

160
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
This person is very thoughtful.

161
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,600
He used his own words to cover up the crime.

162
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,600
And now Gu Chunfang is in the Golden Tribe.

163
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,600
You two should be careful.

164
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Yes.

165
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
Sir.

166
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Sir, you forgot your stuff.

167
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,600
I've prepared four cakes today.

168
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,600
Of course, I'll make it for you.

169
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,600
But can you please tell us about that girl?

170
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,600
What girl?

171
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,600
The one that Uncle Jian said is the one who is very kind.

172
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Old man.

173
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Thank you, sir.

174
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
Sir Zhou.

175
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,600
Sir Xie, I'd like to see you in the future.

176
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
Mr. Xie.

177
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Hello, sir.

178
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,600
I'm sorry, I'm late.

179
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
I'm just here to see you.

180
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,600
What would you like to see me in?

181
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
I'll see you in the future.

182
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Thank you, sir.

183
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
How are you?

184
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
I haven't seen you in a long time.

185
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,600
I'm fine, sir.

186
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Everything's fine.

187
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
You're fine.

188
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Your health is much better.

189
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
I've been in the hospital for so many years.

190
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,000
Goodbye.

191
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,320
Good night.

192
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,240
This is the whom Mr. Yan knows.

193
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,160
You're the only person I can count on now

194
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,840
I used to think

195
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,160
I'd just lost the map with her

196
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,720
no one would say anything

197
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,560
But it seems that the Yan family's view is not changing.

198
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,720
If you are in trouble...

199
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,120
No.

200
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,320
I'm not in trouble either.

201
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,520
The crown prince is in a serious condition.

202
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,320
And the most important thing in the man's life is the crown prince's position.

203
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,800
Marquis Chen Mo's eyes

204
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,000
have given this position to Xie Mo.

205
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,880
Xie Mo is just thinking

206
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,280
what position should I give to the crown prince?

207
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,920
Thank you, sir.

208
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,440
I will lend a hand.

209
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,960
No respect would be allowed.

210
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,160
Don't concern yourself with your senior,

211
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,840
where he'sCo o constantly

212
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,960
afraid that you will be�

213
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,160
the Us tribe.

214
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,760
There's no need for living,

215
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,080
Alright?

216
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,560
Enough, Master Xun.

217
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,560
Anything else besides the dishes?

218
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,560
No, sir. They're all there.

219
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,560
Anything else?

220
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,560
Since Mr. Zhou sent Zhou Yingzhi to the top,

221
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,560
the new position has been settled.

222
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,560
Now it's just an entry and exit.

223
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,560
Zhou Yingzhi isn't my person.

224
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,560
He arranged all these.

225
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,560
I didn't expect he would protect me.

226
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,560
Sir, have you been feeling better in the palace lately?

227
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,560
Do you still have him in your heart?

228
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,560
I still do.

229
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,560
What about the person he likes when he comes?

230
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,560
He must be more than a thousand times stronger than me.

231
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,560
As long as he likes me, that's enough.

232
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,560
If you say you're not sad, that's a lie.

233
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,560
But when you grow up,

234
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,560
you'll realize what love is.

235
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,560
What is not good for you.

236
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,560
I've been thinking about this for a long time.

237
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,560
I've been hesitating whether to give it to him.

238
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,560
Since Mr. Jinrui is here,

239
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,560
please take him back to the palace.

240
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,560
He's the one who's always there.

241
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,560
It's okay if he doesn't come.

242
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,560
Okay.

243
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,560
I'll definitely send you.

244
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,560
Thank you, sir.

245
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,560
Sister Ning, what are you thinking?

246
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,560
Do you think Mr. Xie is not right

247
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,560
to look at me in the class?

248
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,560
Did I offend him?

249
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,560
Thank you, sir.

250
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,560
What's wrong?

251
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,560
Sister Ning, you don't know.

252
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,560
The peach cake you gave me last time

253
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,560
was too late to keep it.

254
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,560
Who knows that the next day

255
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,560
I was hit by Mr. Xie when I stole it.

256
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,560
I asked him to try it.

257
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,560
He took it all away.

258
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,560
I didn't expect Mr. Xie to be like this.

259
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,560
He can't bear to eat it.

260
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,560
It's okay now.

261
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,560
You've taken mine and he's taken yours.

262
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,560
It's really hard to learn that word.

263
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,560
Mr. Xie, I didn't say you were bad.

264
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,560
I'm going to class.

265
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,560
So you're mad at me for stealing the peach cake.

266
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,560
I didn't mean it.

267
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,560
It's okay.

268
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,560
I shouldn't have told you about this.

269
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,560
You didn't have class today.

270
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,560
How could you come here?

271
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,560
I didn't want to open a shop.

272
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,560
I just wanted to talk something about my family.

273
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,560
See it.

274
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:15,660
Blend yourwo,

275
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,560
A kind of gold.

276
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:30,420
This埃蘭

277
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,960
Here you go.

278
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,960
Even if he doesn't love me, I must go.

279
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,960
It's just...

280
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,960
It's just that during the day, there are many people.

281
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,960
Although it's convenient to be careful,

282
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,960
if there are any small things that can cause trouble,

283
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,960
I'm afraid that there will be trouble.

284
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,960
Now that there are still a few days left in the temple,

285
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,960
I think that we should also be careful and make arrangements.

286
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,960
I'm quite worried.

287
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,960
Let's go to class first.

288
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,960
Yes.

289
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,960
You're done.

290
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,960
You're the one who can attend Yanling's wedding ceremony at the palace.

291
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,960
Unlike me,

292
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,960
I also received the invitation,

293
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,960
but I didn't have much confidence.

294
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,960
Is it Empress Dowager's permission to go?

295
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,960
Yes.

296
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,960
Brother Huang has already sent Second Brother to go.

297
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,960
My princess Consort said that I'm the princess.

298
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,960
I can't go with her.

299
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,960
Yanling's wedding ceremony is about the court.

300
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,960
Of course, it's not that easy.

301
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,960
Prince Ling and Yanling have the same intention.

302
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,960
It means that the royal family will be happy.

303
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,960
But the princess is not that happy.

304
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,960
But the princess is the one who has the most noble and noble ideas.

305
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,960
Empress Dowager and you don't want to interfere in these matters.

306
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
I know.

307
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
The management is all very good-looking.

308
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
Now that Yan family is in trouble,

309
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,960
no one is willing to go.

310
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,960
But Ning Ning,

311
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,960
I'm more interested in her because of that.

312
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,960
Yanling has been like this for the whole life.

313
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,960
If I don't give her a proper face,

314
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,960
what will others think?

315
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,960
You're smart and have a lot of tricks.

316
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,960
Help me think of a way.

317
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,960
You said that Prince Ling is going to go.

318
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,960
Yes.

319
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,960
If that's the case, I have a way to keep it.

320
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,960
Uncle?

321
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,960
You're going to Yanling's wedding ceremony?

322
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,960
Aunt, don't worry.

323
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,960
There's a reason for that.

324
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,960
His Majesty is not willing to give Yan family a punishment.

325
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,960
He needs to punish the official evidence.

326
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,960
Second, he's also fighting against the emperor for years.

327
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,960
He's in the court and is in a high position.

328
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,960
He's going to be in the court.

329
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,960
Since Yongyi's mansion was built,

330
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,960
there's a lot of people in the court who are in love.

331
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,960
He's been punished for not stopping.

332
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,960
I don't know what kind of confusion Yan Mu has with them.

333
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,960
So, the more you think about it,

334
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,960
the more you think about it.

335
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,960
And I heard that Prince Ling will go too.

336
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,960
Today, we're in a good relationship.

337
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,960
You know how to deal with it.

338
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,960
He'll definitely be nice to you.

339
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,960
But what are you going to do?

340
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,960
I'm going to let you go.

341
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,960
First, it's a graceful ceremony.

342
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,960
It's a great honor to be in the court.

343
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,960
Second, I'm going to be a prisoner.

344
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,960
I can go there in a good manner.

345
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,960
Then let's do it.

346
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,960
This time, I'll let them go.

347
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,960
Are all the hairpins and hairpins used in the coffin ready?

348
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,960
Don't worry. They're all ready.

349
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,960
How's the situation with the Yan family?

350
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,960
The Yan family is in a bad mood now.

351
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,960
There's not much people in the court.

352
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,960
As for the Xue family, they deliberately made the Xinwu Wei mess up.

353
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
They didn't let Su Ning go to the mansion with the wine and vegetables.

354
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,960
The Marquis was angry and made a big fire.

355
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,960
They'll be in trouble for a few more days.

356
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,960
The Xue family will pay the price sooner or later.

357
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,520
Little P cortar

358
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,800
Feels like my skin is burning.

359
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,960
I've prepared the你在家餐廳.

360
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,960
I've prepared the Whiteειςong.

361
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,240
Separating two of them in the morning,

362
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,640
do you see the meals?

363
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,640
Master Gao.

364
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,040
Miss Jiang is here.

365
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,040
Take Miss Jiang's sword out.

366
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,040
Coming.

367
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,840
Miss, you only kept an eye on this sword two months ago.

368
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,840
You finally went out yesterday.

369
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,840
Please take a look.

370
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,840
Two months of broken sword.

371
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,840
I didn't forget it.

372
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,240
It's indeed a sword of the soldiers.

373
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,840
Two months ago?

374
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,840
That's not your entry.

375
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,840
You're not going to enter the palace?

376
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,840
Didn't you already have it in your body long ago?

377
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,840
You've already prepared it for so long?

378
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,040
It seems that you've got a good gift today.

379
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,840
You must have got a good revenge.

380
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,040
Miss, this sword is for the delivery.

381
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,040
Yes.

382
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,040
I was worried that I wouldn't be able to catch it.

383
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,040
But why not?

384
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,040
This is a general delivery price.

385
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,040
It's worth a lot of money to pay attention to the gold.

386
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,040
But Miss, you're so good at making a cake like this

387
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,040
that you can buy a sandstone and a silver iron sword.

388
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,040
It's not good.

389
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,040
What should we do?

390
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,040
We can still get the money with the cake.

391
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,240
I'm afraid...

392
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,040
Okay.

393
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,240
Miss, do you like the city?

394
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,440
Of course.

395
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,440
There are many hidden нing' Poppy mart.

396
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,440
I must go and see it.

397
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,840
Why would you want to see it?

398
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,440
It's just a big cage.

399
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,240
What about you, Ye Lin? What do you want to do in the future?

400
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,440
Me?

401
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,440
Of course, it's like my father.

402
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,440
He's just a battlefield.

403
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,440
He uses half-body gold and iron horses to exchange for land.

404
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,040
Isn't this a good idea?

405
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,440
I don't think it's good to use this sword.

406
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,440
It looks good, but it's not very good.

407
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,440
It's not good to use it.

408
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,440
How about this?

409
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,440
I'll give you a new one when you get used to it.

410
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,440
Okay.

411
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,440
Then I want a sword with no trick and no power.

412
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,440
I'll fight with you.

413
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,440
That's a deal.

414
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,440
General Yan.

415
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,440
It's a deal.

416
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,440
It's a deal.

417
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,440
I need a knife.

418
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,440
I don't need it.

419
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,440
I'll go out to the door one day.

420
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,440
It won't take long to hide it in the knife.

421
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,440
I want a sword with a weapon that can be used to fight against enemies.

422
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,440
This is good.

423
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,440
It's late. We should go to the house.

424
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,440
Please.

425
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,440
Prince Yan.

426
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,440
We're here to fight with you.

427
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,440
We're here to fight with you.

428
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,440
We've been cooking for a long time.

429
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,440
Greetings, Your Highness.

430
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,440
Today is your turn.

431
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,440
I'm a guest.

432
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,440
I don't want to talk about it.

433
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,440
We're just doing this for the sake of the court.

434
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,440
I don't want to talk about it.

435
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,440
Don't put it on the heart.

436
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,440
It doesn't matter.

437
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,440
It's enough for you to come.

438
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,440
I'm afraid that what Brother Yan thinks is not just us.

439
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,440
Princess's poison?

440
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,440
Sister.

441
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,440
Miss Jiang, go in first.

442
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,440
I'll be there in a while.

443
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,440
Sister, why are you here?

444
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,440
Aunt asked me to come.

445
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,440
Yan family is the enemy of the Marquis's Mansion.

446
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,440
It's a matter of management.

447
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,440
The Marquis should have been in the palace.

448
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,440
I don't know what His Majesty thinks.

449
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,440
Your party also has to be in charge of management.

450
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,440
Father is a new guard.

451
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,440
He'll guard the Marquis's Mansion.

452
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,440
If they dare to move, I'll be very angry.

453
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,440
All right.

454
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,440
Although there aren't many people here today,

455
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,440
they are all from the same family.

456
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,440
You have to pretend to be like that.

457
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,440
Greetings, Your Excellency.

458
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,440
Please.

459
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,440
Thank you, Your Excellency.

460
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,440
Father, wait in the backyard.

461
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,440
Please go to Your Excellency.

462
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,440
Your Excellency, this way, please.

463
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,440
It's Yan Lin's birthday today.

464
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,440
Our child has finally grown up.

465
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,440
You should be at ease, too.

466
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,440
I'm sorry.

467
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,440
I don't know how to say this.

468
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,440
I don't know how to say this.

469
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,440
I'll put you in the position.

470
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,440
Don't worry.

471
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,440
I'll do it.

472
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,440
I'll do it.

473
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,440
Are you all right?

474
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,440
Please come in, Your Excellency.

475
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,440
The Marquis is inside.

476
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,440
Your Excellency,

477
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,440
the Marquis is here today.

478
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,440
The Yan family is in the Yingling.

479
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,440
They are here.

480
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,440
Could you please

481
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,440
give the Marquis a hand

482
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,440
and make him happy?

483
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,440
The Yan family is in the Yingling.

484
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,440
The Marquis is here.

485
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,440
Chang Jin.

486
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,440
Your wish has been fulfilled.

487
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,440
The night of the journey is back home.

488
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,440
The flowers in the yard

489
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,440
should be re-opened.

490
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,440
The Marquis is here.

491
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,440
Your Excellency,

492
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,440
the Marquis is here.

493
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,440
The Marquis is here.

494
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,440
The Marquis is here.

495
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,440
Please give him a hand.

496
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,440
Marquis,

497
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,440
I have a question.

498
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,440
Is Mrs. Yan

499
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,440
safe when she leaves?

500
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,440
The child of the bad girl in October

501
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,440
was killed by the rebels.

502
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,440
The husband of the executioner

503
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,440
was unwell.

504
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,440
How could he survive?

505
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,440
More than 300 lives

506
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,440
were burned to death.

507
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,440
He spent one night

508
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,440
in the ashes of his bones.

509
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,440
His eyes were almost blind.

510
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,440
But the blood of the dead

511
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,440
was on his own.

512
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,440
He was in the palace.

513
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,440
How much hatred did he have?

514
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,440
He and the blood of the blood

515
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,440
were on his own.

516
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,440
He was taken to the Marquis's Mansion

517
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,440
and left in a few months.

518
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,440
But at that moment,

519
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,440
he didn't give up

520
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,440
and look for the child.

521
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,440
No matter what difficulties he had,

522
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,440
he only hoped that the child could live

523
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,440
and live well.

524
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,440
Marquis Yan

525
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,440
is a good man.

526
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,440
He is a good man.

527
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,440
He is a good man.

528
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,440
He is a good man.

529
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,440
He is a good man.

530
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,440
He is a good man.

531
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,440
He is a good man.

532
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,440
He is a good man.

533
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,440
He is a good man.

534
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,440
He is a good man.

535
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,440
He is a good man.

536
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,440
He is a good man.

537
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,440
He is a good man.

538
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,440
He is a good man.

539
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,440
He is a good man.

540
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,440
He is a good man.

541
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,440
He is a good man.

542
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,440
He is a good man.

543
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,440
He is a good man.

544
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,440
He is a good man.

545
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,440
He is a good man.

546
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,440
He is a good man.

547
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,440
He is a good man.

548
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,440
He is a good man.

549
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,440
He is a good man.

550
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,440
He is a good man.

551
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,440
I'm sorry.

552
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,440
I'm sorry.

553
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,440
Yan Ling.

554
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,440
I'm here for you.

555
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,440
I'll take you there.

556
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,440
I thought you weren't coming.

557
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,440
How could I?

558
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,440
I'm coming for your wedding.

559
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,440
What is this?

560
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,440
I should have sent you the gift earlier.

561
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,440
Chen Mu Chen, let me do it.

562
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,440
You're not the first one to come in.

563
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,440
You're just taking the gift.

564
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,440
You're in a hurry.

565
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,440
If you don't take us in,

566
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,440
I'll wait for your wine.

567
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,440
Congratulations.

568
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,440
Congratulations to Mrs. Zhang.

569
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,440
You're welcome.

570
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,440
Here.

571
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,440
Yang Xin is so lively.

572
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,440
Sit here.

573
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,440
Here.

574
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,440
This wine is good.

575
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,440
Sir, I'll toast to you.

576
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,440
Don't bother me.

577
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,440
Everyone.

578
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,440
Today is Yan Ling's birthday.

579
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,440
Let's have a toast to you.

580
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,440
Okay.

581
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,440
I know how to speak.

582
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,440
I'll go first.

583
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,440
Yan, I wish you a good life.

584
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,440
You'll be more than a man.

585
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,440
I'm not a man of my word.

586
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,440
I can't afford you to drink like this.

587
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,440
What are you talking about?

588
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,440
You don't study well.

589
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,440
Mr. Xie is listening.

590
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,440
He's just angry.

591
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,440
Sit down.

592
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,440
I'll do it.

593
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,440
I'm in a hurry.

594
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,440
Like the moon, like the sun.

595
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,440
Like...

596
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,440
You've read so many books.

597
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,440
You're half a gold digger.

598
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,440
Forget it.

599
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,440
Why don't you...

600
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,440
Miss Jin'er, come.

601
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,440
I wish you...

602
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,440
Forget it.

603
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,440
If you can't remember,

604
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,440
I'll help you.

605
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,440
I'll be with you forever.

606
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,440
I'll be with you forever.

607
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,440
I'll be with you forever.

608
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,440
I'll be with you forever.

609
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,440
Okay.

610
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,440
Okay.

611
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,440
Okay.

612
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,440
I'm sorry.

613
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,440
I'm sorry.

614
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,440
Ningning, you can't remember.

615
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,440
The gift is ready.

616
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,440
Hurry up.

617
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,440
Show them.

618
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,440
What's this?

619
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,440
A sword?

620
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,440
A sword.

621
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,440
Good.

622
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,440
Good.

623
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,440
What's this?

624
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,440
Miss Jin'er,

625
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,440
isn't this sword good?

626
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,440
Someone said

627
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,440
the general's sword is good.

628
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,440
You still remember it?

629
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,440
The former Lord Yan

630
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,440
only said half a gold digger.

631
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,440
Today, I'll give you the second half.

632
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,440
The sword is made of magic.

633
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,440
It's your first day of the day.

634
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,440
You'll be here.

635
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,440
Lord Yan,

636
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,440
the sword is good.

637
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,440
The gold digger is good.

638
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,440
The general's sword is good.

639
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,440
Good.

640
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,440
Good.

641
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,440
Miss Jin'er, you're right.

642
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,440
I'll help Yanlin.

643
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,440
The sword will be made of stone.

644
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,440
The sand field will be filled with silver.

645
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,440
Come.

646
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,440
Bring them here.

647
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,440
Come.

648
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,440
Come.

649
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,440
Good.

650
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,440
Thank you for coming today.

651
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,440
Yanlin.

652
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,440
The sword is good.

653
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,440
Xun Ye.

654
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,440
What are you doing?

655
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,440
Don't blame me.

656
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,440
He drank too much.

657
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,440
I'm not guilty.

658
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,440
Lord Yan.

659
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,440
You've been pretending for so long.

660
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,440
You should have been drunk.

661
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,440
Xun Ye, what are you doing?

662
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,440
Princess, Prince Lin,

663
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,440
Prince Zi.

664
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,440
It's okay if you forget.

665
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,440
I'm telling you.

666
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,440
His Majesty has been in the imperial court.

667
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,440
Yong Yi's mansion

668
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,440
is not allowed to hide the soldiers.

669
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,440
Come.

670
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
Give me the sword.

671
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,440
Yes.

672
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,440
Stop.

673
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,440
Xun Ye.

674
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,440
What do you want?

675
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,440
Your Highness.

676
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,440
The Xue family is leading the new Wu Wei.

677
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,440
It's a good idea to lead the palace.

678
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,440
Xun Ye.

679
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,440
What do you want today?

680
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,440
Take it.

681
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,440
This sword

682
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,440
is not good.

683
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,440
Good.

684
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,440
Then you're against it.

685
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,440
Only you dare to fight.

686
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,440
Yan Lian.

687
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,440
You dare?

688
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,440
Don't talk nonsense.

689
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,440
Get out.

690
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,440
Xue Ye.

691
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,440
Don't be too much.

692
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,440
Prince Xue.

693
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,440
It's not your business to fight.

694
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,440
Besides, today...

695
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,440
Yan Lian.

696
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,440
Yan Lian.

697
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,440
Yan Lian.

698
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,440
Why did you hit him?

699
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,440
You dare to hit him?

700
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,440
I've killed 3,000 people.

701
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,440
It's not a good idea.

702
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,440
No one in the world can hurt him in front of me.

703
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,440
Yan Lian.

704
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,440
Are you all dead?

705
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,440
You need to kill him.

706
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,440
Yan Lian.

707
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,440
Stop.

708
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,440
Let them stop.

709
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,440
Stop.

710
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,440
Stop.

711
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,440
My lord.

712
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,440
My lord.

713
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,440
My lord.

714
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,440
Mr. Xing is here.

715
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,440
What's wrong?

716
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,440
The crown prince and Xing Wuwei are fighting over there.

717
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,440
What?

718
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,440
Xue Ye is so eager to fight with him.

719
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,440
If Yan Lian makes a mistake

720
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,440
and makes a mistake,

721
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,440
he can't let the time be at stake.

722
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,440
Yan Lian.

723
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,440
Stop fighting.

724
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,440
Yan Lian.

725
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,440
I'm fine.

726
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,440
Xing Wuwei is in a big trouble.

727
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,440
Especially today.

728
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,440
Xue Ye.

729
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,440
Today is Yan Lian's birthday.

730
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,440
Do you have to do this?

731
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,440
My lord.

732
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,440
Yan Lian is against the order.

733
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,440
If he doesn't teach him,

734
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,440
he will be punished by the State Government.

735
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,440
What order?

736
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,440
I don't know.

737
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,440
I don't know.

738
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,440
Where are you going?

739
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,440
What order?

740
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,440
Xue Ye.

741
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,440
Don't take the order from the emperor.

742
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,440
That sword was sent by me and Nianling.

743
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,440
Am I also against the order?

744
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,440
My lord.

745
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,440
Enough.

746
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,440
You two have seen it clearly.

747
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,440
You are so stubborn.

748
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,440
You are so stubborn.

749
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,440
You are so stubborn.

750
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,440
You are so stubborn.

751
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,440
How dare you do this?

752
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,440
Do you want to cover him up?

753
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,440
You are just a bunch of nonsense.

754
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,440
You are the one who did it.

755
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,440
Xue Ye.

756
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,440
You want this sword, right?

757
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,440
You don't have to use your fingers to cover me.

758
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,440
Now,

759
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,440
you are fighting with me.

760
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,440
If you win,

761
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,440
I will give you both my hands.

762
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,440
Do you dare?

763
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,440
Yan Lian.

764
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,440
My lord.

765
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,440
My brother's martial arts

766
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,440
are not as good as yours.

767
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,440
This sword is the gift

768
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,440
from Miss Jiang Er.

769
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,440
Please, my lord.

770
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,440
Please.

771
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,440
Listen to me, Yan Lian.

772
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,440
What are you doing?

773
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,440
Yan family is full of martial arts.

774
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,440
You deserve it.

775
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,440
Xue Ye.

776
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,440
What do you mean?

777
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,440
You are the one who wants to win.

778
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,440
You dare not to lose.

779
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,440
Now,

780
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,440
you are the one who doesn't deserve it.

781
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,440
I think you Xue family

782
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,440
will only get rid of the useless things.

783
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,440
Zhiyi.

784
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,440
Shen Yan.

785
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,440
I am right.

786
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,440
Your Highness, you are so mischievous.

787
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,440
Although Xue family has Xue Ye,

788
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,440
it's not like that.

789
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,440
If the crown prince of Ding Fei

790
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,440
is still alive,

791
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,440
he will never be so useless.

792
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,440
How dare you say that again?

793
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,440
How many times can I say that?

794
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,440
Everyone knows that

795
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,440
the crown prince of Ding family

796
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,440
is the son of the original match

797
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,440
of the wife of Yan family.

798
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,440
My cousin,

799
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,440
Xue Ding Fei.

800
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,440
Shut up!

801
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,440
The crown prince is so mischievous.

802
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,440
He is so mischievous.

803
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,440
I apologize for him.

804
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,440
I heard that

805
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,440
the eldest brother of Ding Fei is smart

806
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,440
and wise.

807
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,440
It's been twenty years since he died.

808
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,440
He has been dead for twenty years.

809
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,440
It's hard to find him.

810
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,440
Why do you need to

811
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,440
remind him again today?

812
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,440
Why do you need to remind him again?

813
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,440
If such a person

814
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,440
is still alive,

815
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,440
it's a terrible thing.

816
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,440
How many people should be

817
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,440
worried about him?

818
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,440
It's hard to find him.

819
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,440
Yan Lin.

820
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,440
My sister gave you a few thin noodles.

821
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,440
Don't be so bold.

822
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,440
Take them down.

823
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,440
Enough.

824
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,440
Enough.

825
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,440
What's wrong with the ceremony?

826
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,440
Is this how I teach you?

827
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,440
All right.

828
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,440
It's all for the sake of the child.

829
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,440
It's normal to have some conflicts.

830
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,440
Qing Feng.

831
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,440
The ceremony is coming.

832
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,440
Take Yan Lin to prepare.

833
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,440
Yes.

834
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,440
Yes.

835
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,440
For one more target,

836
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,440
take a turn.

837
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,440
And make some adjustments.

838
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,440
Hou Yan.

839
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,440
We should go too.

840
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:54,680
President Yuan, what is this about Bai Si?

841
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,480
You really thought because of this.

842
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,800
I lateral thought that too much to let Bai Si directly go to jailloud.

843
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:06,760
But

844
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,240
you don't really understand Me saved up too much.

845
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,040
From my point of view,

846
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,040
You two, don't worry.

847
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,040
It's good that you're fine.

848
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,040
I'm not busy these days.

849
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,040
I came late with Mr. Zhang.

850
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,040
Luckily, I didn't miss the right time.

851
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:25,040
That day, you came with snow.

852
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:33,040
I came to exchange the other half for the one I shared with you.

853
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:41,040
I thought I'd let go of the best choice in my memory.

854
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:59,040
After this romanticinder

855
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,040
I will never forget you

856
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,040
I will never forget you

857
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,040
I will never forget you

858
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,040
I will never forget you

859
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,040
I will never forget you

860
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,040
I will never forget you

861
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,040
I will never forget you

862
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,040
I will never forget you

863
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,040
I will never forget you

864
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,040
I will never forget you

865
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,040
I will never forget you

866
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,040
I will never forget you

867
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,040
I will never forget you

868
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,040
I will never forget you
