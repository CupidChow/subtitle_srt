109
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,810
Actually, there's a fixed style

110
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:50,870
for this third cap.

111
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,010
But His Lordship and I discussed it and

112
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,370
modified the cap.

113
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,980

As a son, a brother, and a junior,

129
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,789
you must perform filial piety and duty of obedience

130
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,710
before you can be a real adult,

131
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,429
after which, you can discipline others.

132
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,420
What's wrong?

133
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,140
Something's missing.

134
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,070
What's missing?

135
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:29,500
Lower your head.

136
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,670
Receive the cap.

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,150
Father.

Here comes His Majesty's edict.

139
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,260
The Yan family colluded with the rebels

140
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,890
with the intention of rebellion,

141
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,750
and instigated a riot in the army.

142
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,320
They shall be punished as rebels.

143
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,400
Everyone from the Yan family shall be arrested.

144
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,910
Anyone who dares to resist

145
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,600

00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,360
Our Yan family has been confined in the mansion.

150
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,890
How could we possibly collude with the rebels,

151
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,750
and how could we instigate a riot?

152
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,330
Yes, Duke.

153
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,540
Is there any misunderstanding?

154
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,940
The imperial edict has been issued.

155
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,070
Every word is valid.

156
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,680
If anyone dares to question the imperial edict,

157
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,080
he'll be questioning His Majesty's order.

158
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:45,800
Ning.

159
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,960
What are you doing?

160
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,570
There must be injustice here.

161
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,150
The Yan family could never collude with the rebels.

162

I know.

163
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,690
But this is Jie's order.

164
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,220
You will be executed if you dare to disobey the edict.

165
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,910
My son hasn't completed his coming-of-age ceremony.

168
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,300
Are you disobeying His Majesty's order?

00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,880
You're just like a dog raised by the Yan family.

173
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,010
How dare you bark in front of my father?

174
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,670
What's the rush?

175
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,330
Kneel still.

176
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,580
The heroes

177
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,330
must excel integrity.

178
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,920
Rising with a sword

179
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,650
and standing up to fight,

180
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,970
that's what a commoner would do when he's humiliated.

181
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,820
Don't be frightened when an accident suddenly approaches,

182
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,970
and don't be angry when faulted for no reason.

183
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:43,730
That's what

184
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,340
the greatest warrior in the world would do.

185
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,940
Don't panic, Your Highness.

186
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,100
And calm down.

187
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,620
Don't panic and calm down.

188
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,250
Xue Yuan is so aggressive,

189
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,190
but he may be forcible-feeble.

190
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,900
Xie Wei and I have made so many preparations.

191
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,450
Things must have changed.

192
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,310
As long as I calm down,

193
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,560
I'll find a way.

194
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:06,670
Your Highness.

195
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,340
If I remember correctly,

196
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,260
the edict that permits Yan Lin to have the coming-of-age ceremony

197
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,730
was also issued by His Majesty.

198
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:12,950
Since they're both imperial edicts,

199
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,630
they should be carried out in chronological order.

200
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,490
What do you think, Your Highness?

201
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:18,600
I agree.

202
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,250
Brother Jie did give the order.

203
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,810
Yan Lin should complete his coming-of-age ceremony without interruption.

204
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:22,260
Duke.

205
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,550
Please have mercy

206
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,480
and do not disturb the coming-of-age ceremony.

207
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Brother is right.

208
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:44,830
Father.

209
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,140
You're carrying out an imperial edict.

210
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,090
There's no rush.

211
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,460
Everyone is watching.

212
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,170
If we go too far,

213
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,190
it'll be bad for the Xue family.

214
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,600
Fine.

215
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,500
I'll wait here

216
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,700
until you complete the coming-of-age ceremony.

217
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,700
I'll see how long you can delay.

218
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:05,980
The caps have been bestowed and the outfit has been changed.

219
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,300
Junior Preceptor Xie.

220
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,360
Please bestow my son a courtesy name.

221
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,710
Life is unpredictable.

222
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,990
I meant to give him a name with two characters.

223
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,190
But it's not bad

224
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,660
to make it one.

225
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,800
The roc will take flight with the wind one day,

226
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,990
and soar 90,000 miles straightaway.

227
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,800
But the sky is not a shelter,

228
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,300
while the ocean is where the heart belongs.

229
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,330
May you get through the hardships

230
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,130
without changing your original intentions.

231
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,190
Therefore, the courtesy name I bestow you

232
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:05,940
is Hui.

233
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,710
[Hui]

234
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,540
It's like Mount Tai collapsed in front of him, yet he remains calm.

235
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,740
As expected from Junior Preceptor Xie.

236
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,340
I, Yan Hui,

237
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,120
thank you, Mr. Xie, for the courtesy name.

238
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,270
How long has

239
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,830
Duke Xue been gone?

240
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,780
Your Majesty.

241
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,030
It's been

242
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,450
almost an hour.

243
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,730
He should have arrived at the Yan Mansion.

244
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:58,570
Your Majesty.

245
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:09,030
You've been ill since winter came.

246
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,660
I don't understand

247
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,150
why Empress Dowager had to ask you to issue the edict today.

248
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,010
And about the troops in Tongzhou.

249
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,980
Did they really commit rebellion?

250
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,180
Even if Marquis Yan really wanted to rebel,

251
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,420
he wouldn't choose to do it today.

252
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,510
Something doesn't add up.

253
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,869
But if Marquis Yan

254
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:28,770
disobeyed the edict

255
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,390
and got into a conflict with Uncle,

256
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,100
he'll be convicted of the crime of disobeying the imperial edict.

257
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,150
So Uncle

258
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,590
will do everything he can

259
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,740
to force the Yan family to take action today.

260
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,330
Well,

261
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,800
what if Marquis of Yan is willing

262
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,050
to hand over the commander's tally according to the imperial edict?

263
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,200
The Yan family

264
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,050
has led their troops for generations.

265
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,470
Now half of his troops

266
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,800
are in Tongzhou

267
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,690
to suppress Jinling's forces,

268
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:56,820
while the other half

269
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,270
are guarding the border

270
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,720
against the State of Yue.

271
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,180
That so-called commander's tally

272
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,910
is the private seal passed down in the Yan family.

273
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,240
So, as long as

274
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,060
there's one person alive from the Yan family,

275
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,060
Yan's troops will never pledge allegiance to others.

276
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:12,920
So,

277
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,770
for Uncle,

278
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,100
what he wants

279
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,770
is to kill the entire Yan family.

280
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,830
Then why did you agree to the request of the Xue family and issue the edict, Your Majesty?

281
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,430
Have you forgotten, My Lady?

282
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:29,140
Xie Wei is the host of the coming-of-age ceremony today.

283
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,010
He is loyal to me.

284
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,650
With him there,

285
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,420
nothing will happen to the coming-of-age ceremony,

286
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,980
nothing will happen to the Yan family,

287
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,440
and nothing will happen to the State of Qian.

288
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,830
Only when the snipe and the oyster fight

289
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,760
can the fisherman reap the reward.

290
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,200
Since the ceremony is completed,

291
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,930
what are you waiting for?

292
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,660
Guards!

293
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,060
Arrest

294
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,060
all the rebels.

295
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,550
Wait.

296
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,200
What?

297
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,860
Are you going to defend the Yan family, Junior Preceptor Xie?

298
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,400
No.

299
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,860
You're carrying out His Majesty's order, Duke.

300
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,390
I have no objection to that.

301
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,450
But

302
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,660
I have something to ask you, Duke.

303
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,180
Since thousands of soldiers in Tongzhou rebelled,

304
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,380
have they arrived outside the city now?

305
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,650
Did they cause any casualties

306
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,080
on the way?

307
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:22,490
Why haven't we

308
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,620
received any news yet?

309
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,150
Right.

310
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,690
It was such an upheaval.

311
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,150
Why is there no news at all?

312
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,460
Could it be

313
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,840
Xue Yuan just found a random reason?

314
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:38,220
Xingwu Guards were ordered to monitor the Yan family's movements.

315
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,880
Therefore, I arranged my men to guard Tongzhou.

316
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,100
This morning,

317
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,140
there was a riot in Tongzhou Camps.

318
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,210
I received a letter delivered by a pigeon,

319
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,650
so I entered the palace immediately

320
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:48,760
to ask for an edict.

321
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,660
Junior Preceptor Xie.

322
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,550
Are you questioning me?

323
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,590
If the Yan family's conspiracy can't be stopped,

324
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,790
which causes chaos,

325
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,450
can you afford the consequences of it?

326
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,250
You're lying.

327
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,930
Yan's troops have always been disciplined

328
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:01,630
and loyal.

329
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,220
They would never do such a thing.

330
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:03,940
We'll know if they did it

331
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,650
after interrogating them in the prison of Xingwu Guards.

332
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,960
If anyone tries to stop us, he'll be standing against the court.

333
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,560
I'll see who dares to do that.

334
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,940
I'm Zhang Zhe from the Ministry of Justice.

335
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,880
Duke Xue.

336
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,260
May I ask if you know the laws of the State of Qian?

337
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,660
Of course I do.

338
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,750
What do you mean?

339
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,090
Since you know the laws,

340
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:25,950
you should know

341
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,050
when the imperial edict is announced,

342
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,220
you should read out the imperial edict for the receiver.

343
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,650
Since you're here with the imperial edict, Duke,

344
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,900
why are you arresting people without reading it?

345
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,990
You're just an official of the seventh grade.

346
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,180
Who do you think you are?

347
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,730
What is even the Ministry of Justice?

348
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,990
How dare you clamor in front of my father?

349
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,450
Mr. Xue, I don't think so.

350
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,350
In our country,

351
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,560
except the Emperor,

352
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,750
even if the noble officials from the Xue family

353
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,190
should abide by the laws of the State of Qian.

354
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,860
Although Mr. Zhang is only a seventh-grade official,

355
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,340
he still has the right to ask.

356
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,280
Jiang Xuening.

357
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,980
Why are you everywhere?

358
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:54,910
Ning is right.

359
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,180
If a seventh-grade official isn't qualified to ask,

360
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,980
I should be, right?

361
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,030
Please read the imperial edict out, Duke.

362
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,250
Father.

363
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,820
People are watching.

364
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,990
You may as well read it out for them.

365
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,610
Here comes the imperial edict.

366
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,920
By God's blessing, His Majesty now commands,

367
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,610
there was a riot in the military barracks.

368
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,010
This is a serious matter.

369
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,770
It concerns collusion with the rebels

370
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,740
to shake the foundation of the imperial court.

371
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,870
It's unforgivable.

372
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,960
I hereby order Duke Xue Yuan

373
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,750
to lead Xingwu Guards to confiscate the Yue family's property immediately,

374
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,080
deprive Yan Mu and Yan Lin of their titles,

375
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,910
and put them in prison for further interrogation.

376
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:57,960
Now you have it.

377
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,410
Have you heard it loud and clear?

378
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:02,860
Duke.

379
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:06,610
There's something wrong with the imperial edict.

380
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,100
Zhang Zhe.

381
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,510
Are you accusing me of faking the imperial edict?

382
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,920
Duke, you said the news you received from the military camp

383
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,380
was delivered by a pigeon.

384
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:17,220
Tongzhou is far from the capital.

385
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,270
Even a pigeon

386
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,270
has to fly 4 hours to get here.

387
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,300
The riot in the military camp broke out this morning.

388
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,460
Considering the distance,

389
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,350
that is to say

390
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,460
the time you received the news

391
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,650
was about 2 hours ago.

392
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,540
Right, Duke?

393
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,600
So what?

394
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:32,140
According to the imperial edict,

395
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,130
I hereby order Duke Xue Yuan

396
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,600
to lead Xingwu Guards

397
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,380
to confiscate the Yan family's property immediately.

398
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,280
That is to say,

399
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:40,310
you brought the news to His Majesty.

400
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,690
His Majesty stamped the royal seal on it,

401
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,620
and then you came here immediately,

402
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,100
right?

403
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,850
I have no time

404
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:48,060
to talk about these irrelevant things with you.

405
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,320
No need to hurry, Duke.

406
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,710
Let Mr. Zhang finish his words first.

407
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,060
Confiscating a family's property or executing them is the punishment for a major crime.

408
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,030
According to the law,

409
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,510
even after His Majesty stamped the royal seal,

410
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,810
the imperial edict should still get verified by the Hanlin Academy

411
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,330
and get their seal stamped before it's issued.

412
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,700
Today, the Ministry of Justice was having a regular meeting.

413
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,900
Minister Gu had some questions related to work

414
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,460
to ask Mr. Chu Xiyi, the seal holder of Hanlin Academy,

415
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,450
and found out that he was sick and didn't enter the palace.

416
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,460
Duke.

417
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,700
May I ask if there's a Hanlin Academy's seal

418
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,610
on this imperial edict or not?

419
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,960
Why don't you unfold it

420
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,110
and show us?

421
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,220
How dare you question

422
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,950
the imperial edict?

423
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,370
Zhang Zhe.

424
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,730
As a guest of the Yan family,

425
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,560
you keep obstructing my work.

426
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:36,910
I suspect

427
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:39,130
you've colluded with the Yan family

428
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,850
and defected to Lord Pingnan

429
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:43,260
in order to protect your accomplices.

430
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,840
If you don't step aside,

431
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,730
I will behead you.

432
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,290
I'll punish you as a rebel.

433
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,140
Duke, you should investigate

434
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,550
whether I'm a rebel or not first.

435
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,360
And then you should go to the imperial palace to ask for His Majesty's imperial edict

436
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,890
to interrogate me according to the law.

437
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:56,630
But now,

438
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,790
I can't back off.

439
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,510
Even if you kill me,

440
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,890
the imperial edict you have doesn't have a seal.

441
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,020
It's still invalid.

442
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:04,360
Fine.

443
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,700
Good for you, Zhang Zhe.

444
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,480
I am willing

445
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,300
to serve

446
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,000
His Majesty and the world.

447
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,700
I'm going to kill you today.

448
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,260
Let's see who can stop me.

449
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:49,980
Yan Mu,

450
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,470
you're asking for death.

451
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,500
Twenty years ago,

452
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,060
I failed to protect the one I wanted to protect.

453
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,670
But today, it's different.

454
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,430
Xue Yuan,

455
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,670
moral principles and humanity are long gone in you. But I have them.

456
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,520
I'm the master of the Yan family.

457
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,430
As long as I'm here,

458
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,080
you can't touch any of my guests

459
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,120
today.

460
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,690
In the battle with Lord Pingnan back then,

461
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,830
both our families were deeply harmed.

462
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,300
But now, the Yan family

463
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,980
has colluded with the rebels.

464
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,340
I'm just following His Majesty's order. Is there a problem?

465
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,280
How dare you say

466
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,530
the Xue family

467
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,100
was deeply harmed by the battle with Lord Pingnan?

468
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,630
Man works, heaven watches.

469
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,930
Your crimes

470
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,950
will come to light eventually.

471
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,540
On behalf of my sister,

472
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,270
I will see you

473
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,090
and the Xue family get what you deserve.

474
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,490
Unfortunately, you won't have the chance.

475
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:56,930
Yan Lin!

476
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:59,100
How dare you make the imperial edict fall on the ground!

477
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,830
Does everyone in the Yan family want to be a rebel?

478
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,950
He who has a mind to beat his dog will easily find his stick.

479
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,500
Since the Xue family wants to make trouble,

480
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,460
come at me.

481
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:08,680
Yan Lin,

482
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,230
you said it yourself.

483
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,880
Duke is just following His Majesty's order.

484
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,050
It's justifiable.

485
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,780
But something went wrong with the procedure of the imperial edict.

486
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,640
It's the fault of Hanlin Academy.

487
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,620
Duke, you just need to go back to the imperial palace to stamp a seal on it.

488
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,690
There is no need to kill anyone, right?

489
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,650
You even called them rebels.

490
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:31,140
Do you think all the guests in Yan Mansion today

491
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,000
have colluded with Lord Pingnan?

492
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,720
Mr. Xie, you are right.

493
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,100
On behalf of the Ministry of Justice,

494
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,600
I just came here with Mr. Zhang

495
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,060
to have a meal and watch the coming-of-age ceremony.

496
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,520
How could we have anything to do with rebels?

497
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,970
Today is the day of Viscount Yan's coming-of-age ceremony.

498
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,900
But he was forced to draw his sword.

499
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,920
We came with Royal Highnesses,

500
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,050
but we suddenly became rebels.

501
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,660
In Duke's eyes, why is everything

502
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,860
a crime that's serious enough to exterminate the whole family?

503
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,530
You just made an accusation against us.

504
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:03,990
What kind of logic is that?

505
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,000
That's right.

506
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,430
I'm also here for Yan Lin's coming-of-age ceremony.

507
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,730
I'm also on friendly terms with the Yan family.

508
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,470
Am I also

509
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,050
one of the rebels Duke just mentioned?

510
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,470
Duke, you came with an imperial edict.

511
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,290
You should be very careful

512
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,740
with what you say and what you do.

513
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,470
How could you just make a groundless accusation?

514
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,270
Duke, I took the risk to stop you today.

515
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,610
I didn't do it to protect the Yan family.

516
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,220
I did it

517
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,320
to make sure that His Majesty and Duke

518
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,120
won't be gossiped in the future.

519
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,600
It's His Majesty's order.

520
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,680
It's the Yan family that will be investigated.

521
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,140
As the middleman,

522
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,880
Duke, you should be cautious.

523
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:06,870
Fine.

524
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,140
I'll go to the imperial palace

525
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,730
to stamp a seal.

526
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,820
Xingwu Guards, listen!

527
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:14,430
Before I come back,

528
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,110
don't let anyone in the Yan Mansion leave.

529
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,310
Yes.

530
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,590
His Lordship, are you okay?

531
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,600
I'm fine.

532
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,850
The Xue family kept forcing us today.

533
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,650
They are determined to frame the Yan family.

534
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,150
I’m afraid it won't end well.

535
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:38,950
His Lordship,

536
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,810
after what happened at the coming-of-age ceremony today,

537
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:42,770
you must be tired.

538
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,370
Go back to your room and rest.

539
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,360
The real storm

540
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,330
is yet to come.

541
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,400
There was an accident

542
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,460
at today's coming-of-age ceremony.

543
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,280
I'm sorry

544
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,180
you've been disturbed.

545
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,110
But don't worry.

546
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,330
This is the Yan family's business.

547
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:00,190
We will never get you implicated.

548
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,810
Since you can't leave now,

549
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,520
please take a rest first

550
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,500
and have some tea and wine.

551
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,640
You can rest assured.

552
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,330
Father,

553
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:31,990
Yan Lin is so arrogant.

554
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,930
You must take it out on him for me.

555
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,540
Brat!

556
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,060
What are you thinking under this circumstance?

557
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,320
You've really disgraced the Xue family.

558
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,310
Father has always been cautious.

559
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,230
How come the imperial edict

560
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:48,360
doesn't have a seal of Hanlin Academy?

561
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:50,690
Tongzhou just intends to rise in revolt.

562
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,260
I'm afraid something might go wrong if I don't take action now.

563
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,400
So I hurried here.

564
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,380
I didn't expect to meet Zhang Zhe here.

565
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,890
Father, you are unwise.

566
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,050
If Tongzhou doesn't rise in revolt in the end,

567
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,070
what should we do?

568
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,570
No need to worry about that.

569
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,650
The Yan family has fought back today.

570
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:08,130
It's against the imperial edict.

571
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,700
After I stamp a seal,

572
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:12,270
I'll put them in jail and search their house.

573
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,380
I will find evidence

574
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,260
to exterminate the Yan family.

575
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:16,690
Alright.

576
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,620
Go back.

577
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,660
Leave the rest

578
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:19,810
to me.

579
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,120
Junior Preceptor Xie.

580
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,190
Mr. Zhang.

581
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,420
You spoke in defense of justice today.

582
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,510
I thank you on behalf of His Lordship.

583
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,260
No need.

584
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,440
As an official,

585
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,340
of course I should uphold the law strictly.

586
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,060
No matter who is involved today,

587
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,130
I will do the same.

588
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:56,280
Mr. Zhang is really admirable.

589
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,100
You are upright

590
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:59,680
and unbiased.

591
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,360
No need to flatter me.

592
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:02,830
Mr. Xie,

593
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,660
I want to ask you something.

594
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,360
Mr. Xie has never meddled in the party conflict.

595
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,010
You are deeply trusted by His Majesty.

596
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:11,530
But today, you helped the Yan family again and again.

597
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:14,170
What you said at the coming-of-age ceremony is really suspicious.

598
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,010
No offense.

599
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:17,350
Junior Preceptor Xie, please explain.

600
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,190
Explain what?

601
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,870
According to the Book of Rites,

602
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,650
a son should be filial,

603
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,210
a younger sibling should be fraternal,

604
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,900
an official should be loyal,

605
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,250
and a junior should be respectful.

606
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,720
But at the coming-of-age ceremony just now,

607
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,270
you mentioned all of them

608
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,360
except officials and their loyalty.

609
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,680
Why?

610
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,310
Maybe I panicked

611
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,330
and forgot to mention it.

612
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:44,140
You were so calm when facing the turmoil just now.

613
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,540
You really didn't look like you panicked.

614
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,130
Maybe

615
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,650
there is another reason

616
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,780
why you defended the Yan family.

617
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:06,280
Sir.

618
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:09,940
Mr. Zhang, you're here too.

619
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,060
Mr. Zhang is a man of moral integrity.

620
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,050
You think for State of Qian and uphold justice.

621
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,850
Maybe I'm the same as you, right?

622
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,370
Still,

623
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:20,680
thank you

624
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,200
for what you did today.

625
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:23,670
Goodbye.

626
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,350
Sir,

627
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,340
you must have a way to save the Yan family.

628
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:49,850
Right?

629
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,860
The imperial edict has been issued.

630
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,320
Yan Lin did do it.

631
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,110
I'm not a god.

632
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,690
If you are not confident,

633
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:59,420
why did you say that to send Duke Xue away just now?

634
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,880
You must have other plans.

635
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,840
Do you trust me that much?

636
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,480
Yes.

637
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:05,680
Ning'er,

638
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,080
I'm not a good person.

639
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:10,940
All this time,

640
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,770
you and I have worked together

641
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:14,100
to fight against the Xue family.

642
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,290
The students were watching every move

643
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:16,820
of what you did.

644
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,430
The good and bad in this world

645
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,590
cannot be easily explained.

646
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,330
But I know,

647
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,390
you will be able to achieve

648
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,070
whatever you want to do.

649
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:03,940
Xingwu Guards are attending to official business.

650
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,940
Get out of the way!

651
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:06,950
I'm sorry, Sir.

652
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,150
I don't know why these logs

653
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,260
have spilt all over the floor.

654
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:09,719
Enough.

655
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:10,909
Don't bother with him.

656
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:11,679
Let's turn around.

657
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,080
Yes.

658
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,030
What's the point of sending someone

659
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,590
to stop Xue Yuan from entering the palace?

660
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,889
Even at night,

661
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,350
he will come back with the imperial edict.

662
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,110
The result will still be the same.

663
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,940
The only crime mentioned in the imperial edict

664
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,600
is the rebellion in Tongzhou.

665
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:36,400
What if there was no rebellion in the army?

666
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,150
By then,

667
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,830
what will His Majesty think of what happened today?

668
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,170
What will all the court officials

669
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:43,230
think of the Xue family's intention?

670
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,260
So,

671
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:47,179
exactly what happened in Tongzhou?

672
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,790
The Xue family has gone too far.

673
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,050
Enter the capital to save His Lordship.

674
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,040
Yes.

675
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:59,470
Save His Lordship! Save His Lordship!

676
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,420
Shut up!

677
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:01,340
Save His Lordship!

678
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,410
I have already told you.

679
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,110
Up till now,

680
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,420
we don't know what's going on in the capital.

681
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,410
Without any order,

682
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,530
leaving the camp without permission

683
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:09,040
would be considered as treason.

684
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,510
You are all loyal to His Lordship.

685
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,730
But doing this

686
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,420
is creating trouble for His Lordship.

687
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,220
Be dismissed!

688
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,250
A few hours ago,

689
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,410
General asked us to wait.

690
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:17,330
But now,

691
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,770
if His Lordship hadn't been killed,

692
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,370
how could there be no letter?

693
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,530
First it was Zhao Xin,

694
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:23,780
and now it's Zhao Guang.

695
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,840
If we keep waiting,

696
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,310
the Xue family will eat us up sooner or later.

697
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,600
We are going to the capital

698
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,730
to meet His Majesty.

699
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,740
Yes, that's right.

700
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:36,580
We're going to the capital to meet His Majesty.

701
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:39,110
His Lordship's official seal is here.

702
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,370
Yan's troops, listen.

703
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,350
Stand down now!

704
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,820
Don't make any trouble.

705
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:46,300
Is that really His Lordship's official seal?

706
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,580
Yes. Who is this person?

707
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,910
I've never seen him before.

708
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:49,690
That's right.

709
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,900
Why would His Lordship give his official seal to someone else?

710
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,520
Am I right?

711
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,480
We'll know whether it's true or not

712
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,480
once General Yan Liu verifies.

713
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:11,890
That's right.

714
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,270
It's indeed the official seal passed down from generation to generation within the Yan family.

715
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:21,000
His Lordship will never give it to outsiders.

716
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:24,100
Is that really His Lordship's official seal?

717
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,330
May I ask

718
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,070
how is His Lordship now?

719
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,510
His Lordship is safe now.

720
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,430
But the premise is that

721
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,640
Tongzhou Camps

722
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,140
must not wreck havoc.

723
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,000
This should be obvious

724
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,280
to everyone.

725
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:41,370
Great.

726
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,450
His Lordship is safe.

727
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,370
He is safe!

728
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:47,300
His Lordship is safe.

729
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,670
He will be fine.

730
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,420
That's great.

731
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,490
That's a relief.

732
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,730
You mean

733
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,120
the ones who instigated the rebellion within the military camps

734
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,520
were Lord Pingnan's men?

735
00:36:58,770 --> 00:36:59,580
Yes.

736
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,570
As I have guessed before,

737
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,940
Lord Pingnan has a stronghold in Tongzhou,

738
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,140
and has already infiltrated the camps in Tongzhou.

739
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:06,900
A few days ago,

740
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,860
I've sent Dao Qin to Tongzhou secretly

741
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,720
to monitor the situation in the military camps.

742
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,520
This morning,

743
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,260
there was sudden movement in the military camps.

744
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,460
Dao Qin sent a letter to me immediately.

745
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,580
I'll send Lyu Xian to Tongzhou immediately

746
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,710
to stop the turmoil.

747
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,270
If we count the time,

748
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,800
he should be there by now.

749
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,740
First, it was the Ruyi jade case,

750
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:26,140
then it was the half-letter to Duke of Xue.

751
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,220
Now, it's the military camps.

752
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,870
If the Yan family is overthrown,

753
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,330
Tongzhou will be in chaos.

754
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,400
Jinling's troops

755
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,380
can then march straight into the capital.

756
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,100
Turns out, there are still so many people

757
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,360
who are behind the Yan family's affairs.

758
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,320
Are you scared?

759
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,010
No.

760
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:41,810
I came here

761
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,690
to change my fate.

762
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,450
No matter how many people want to harm the Yan family,

763
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:48,050
I will make them all my enemy.

764
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:03,380
Sir.

765
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,570
What happened?

766
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:06,010
Why is the rebellion still not happening?

767
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:07,010
Mr. Gongyi.

768
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,670
It's really you.

769
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:11,540
It's him.

770
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,180
He stopped the rebellion.

771
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:17,540
Mr. Gongyi,

772
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,200
we are all friends of Xie Ju'an after all.

773
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:21,140
Well...

774
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:23,070
we don't have to do this, do we?

775
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:23,990
Lyu Zhaoyin,

776
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,060
Xie Wei betrayed Lord Pingnan.

777
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,990
Are both of you not afraid of death?

778
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:29,010
Sir,

779
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,290
worry about yourself first.

780
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:32,930
Today,

781
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:34,950
you, you....

782
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:36,310
you, you, and you.

783
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,320
Not one of you can leave.

784
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,230
With just you?

785
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,420
With just...

786
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,160
the guy above me.

787
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,200
Dao Qin has been in Tongzhou for some time.

788
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,220
He's getting bored out of his mind.

789
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,620
He's been looking for someone to practice.

790
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:13,850
But,

791
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,200
this little army of yours

792
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,800
may not be able to fulfil him.

793
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,760
You ruined Lord Pingnan's plans today.

794
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:25,830
If Lord Pingnan finds out,

795
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,360
you will be rebels of the imperial court,

796
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,470
and traitors of Jinling.

797
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,490
You all will die without a resting place.

798
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:34,090
You don't have to worry about that, Mr. Gong Yi.

799
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:34,740
Dao Qin.

800
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,080
Do it!

801
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,200
Be careful.

802
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:51,690
Brothers,

803
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,660
pledge your loyalty to Lord Pingnan.

804
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,860
[Tai'an Hall]

805
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,540
Are we really putting this imperial edict aside,

806
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,220
just because Chu Xiyi is sick?

807
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,300
Your Majesty,

808
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:08,280
I feel that

809
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,900
the imperial edict

810
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,750
should follow its own will.

811
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,310
The seal from Hanlin Academy

812
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,500
is just a formality.

813
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,470
But what's bad

814
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,370
is the law itself.

815
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,760
According to the law,

816
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,780
the seal from Hanlin Academy

817
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,770
must be approved by Chu Xiyi.

818
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:24,620
But His Majesty has taken the medicine and slept.

819
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,260
I did not manage to get His Majesty

820
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,150
to summon Chu Xiyi to the palace.

821
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,090
Therefore,

822
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:31,400
please make a decision about this,

823
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,260
Your Highness.

824
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,250
What time is it?

825
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:36,980
Is there any news about the rebellion

826
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,410
from Tongzhou?

827
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:40,890
Well,

828
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:43,020
although Chu Xiyi is not here,

829
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,770
the official seal is in the palace.

830
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:46,190
Take my written instruction

831
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:48,190
and get it sealed at Hanlin Academy.

832
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,530
Even if we can't punish the Yan family for instigating the rebellion,

833
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:53,810
we can still arrest them for disobeying the imperial edict.

834
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:54,410
This time,

835
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:57,340
we must find the Yan family's evidence of crime.

836
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

837
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,380
Today is

838
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,350
the coming-of-age ceremony for my son,

839
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:09,800
and it has nothing to do with any other matters.

840
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,060
Since you are all here,

841
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,980
it's only right that we as the Yan family

842
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,280
hold a banquet.

843
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,490
Duke Xue hasn't returned yet,

844
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,090
but the banquet

845
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:20,530
should continue.

846
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,260
How can I eat this?

847
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:24,860
Why not?

848
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,720
Yan Lin did nothing wrong.

849
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:27,930
We should drink wine merrily

850
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:29,110
on this important day

851
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,370
and celebrate for him.

852
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,020
The imperial edict

853
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,650
has been stamped.

854
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:04,840
Everyone,

855
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:07,450
have you seen it clearly?

856
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:08,820
May I ask

857
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:11,270
how are things

858
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,260
in Tongzhou's military camps?

859
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,780
No matter what happens in Tongzhou's military camps,

860
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,040
the Yan family had disobeyed the decree.

861
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:18,910
Everyone,

862
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,950
can see it clearly.

863
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:23,060
I am just doing things by the book.

864
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,720
I should take all of you with me

865
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:25,940
to investigate.

866
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:27,930
The Duke has already committed to incriminating us

867
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:29,130
to such an extent.

868
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,600
How can I refuse?

869
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:32,540
Yan Lin,

870
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:36,100
come with me.

871
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:38,540
Let's see what Duke Xue

872
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:39,980
can find out.

873
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:40,940
Yes.

874
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:42,160
Guards!

875
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,070
Arrest Yan Mu

876
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,430
and Yan Lin.
