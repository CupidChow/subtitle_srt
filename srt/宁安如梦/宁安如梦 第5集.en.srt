I once was indebted to a lot of people.

10

Zhang Zhe, help me.

11

22
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,100
Mr. Zhang, do you believe in predestination from the previous life?

23
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,500
I'd rather believe in what's in front of me.

But in the unfathomable,

29

there's always an invisible hand

that puts everything back to its original place.

Why are you still in the palace?

39
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,910
The palace gate won't be closed for a while.

This is your first time entering the imperial palace.

I'm really worried.

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,730
I heard that Matron Su is very strict.

43

She even flogs people.

44
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,960
I specially got the medicine from the Imperial Hospital

just in case.

I'm grateful.

But the more you did for me,

55
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,330
the more I feel guilty.

By the way,

65
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,640
Mr. Xie told me something

00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,600
about you today.

67
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,829
What did he say?

68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,670
He asked me

69
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,310
if I taught you the method

70
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,690
of using a fake ledger

71
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,220
to discipline the disobedient servants in the mansion.

72
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:27,800
I thought

73
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,800
he wouldn't have asked me about that for no reason.

74
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,790
And since it's not bad,

75
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,590
I admitted it.

76
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,340
I only passed the buck to you

77
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,910
because I knew you would cover for me.

78
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,840
But I didn't expect

79
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,970
Mr. Xie would come to my house that day.

80
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,220
Then tell me,

81
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,900
who taught you that?

82
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,400
I figured it out myself.

83
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,210
My dear Ning

84
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,760
has her own secret now.

85
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,210
I told you,

86
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,579
people grow up.

87
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,190
I will change too.

88
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,540
I don't care.

89
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,260
No matter what you become,

90
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,920
I will be good to you.

91
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:06,970
Promise me.

92
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,170
No matter what secret you have,

93
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,430
as long as you want to talk about it,

94
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,890
I'll be the first person in the world to know.

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,420
OK?

96
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:18,690
OK.

97

Sister Yao.

98
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,220
I just mentioned the Ministry of Justice casually.

99
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,620
Why did you start crying?

100
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,870
All right.

101
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,220
We are in the imperial palace.

102
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,280
If people hear it and spread the word,

103
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,370
it will be bad.

104
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,659
Sister Yao.

105
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,020
We are sisters.

106
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,990
If you have any difficulties, just tell us.

107
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,320
We can figure out a solution together.

108
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,080
It's just I heard Baoying talk about the Ministry of Justice,

109
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,610
and I couldn't help thinking about Zhang Zhe.

110
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,980
That's why I cried.

111
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,050
He's only a seventh-ranked Supervising Secretary for the Division of Criminal Justice.

112
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,310
He doesn't deserve me.

113
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,810
Is Zhang Zhe the one

114
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,670
who offended the Xingwu Guards?

115
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,600
You two were talking about getting married?

116
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,130
He wasn't selected by a proper imperial examination.

117
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,460
He passed the exam as a civil servant

118
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,730
and became an official in the imperial court.

119
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,590
He only has a vulgar widow mother.

120
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,390
It's my father who thought highly of him.

121
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,110
He said that although his rank is not high,

122
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,380
he is capable

123
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,790
and has a bright future.

124
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,560
That's why I agreed when Father went to discuss our marriage with the Zhang family.

125
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,310
But now?

126
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,390
He offended the Xingwu Guards.

127
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,920
Even His Majesty got angry.

128
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,460
I wanted to break off the engagement,

129
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,860
but Father didn't agree.

130
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,820
Sister Xue.

131
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,920
What should I do?

132
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,550
But the marriage has already been discussed,

133
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,909
and your age cards have been exchanged.

134
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:41,470
That's why I'm sad.

135
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,550
If I want to break off the engagement,

136
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,940
people will say that the Yao family is snobbish.

137
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,100
It's so awkward now.

138
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,070
It's not good either to get married

139
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,159
or not.

140
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,180
Besides,

141
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,510
Zhang Zhe had had two engagements before.

142
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:56,620
One was engaged to someone else and broke off the engagement.

143
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,840
The other one died

144
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,010
before they could get married.

145
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,660
Now, he finally got the chance

146
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,110
to seek connections with the Yao family.

147
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,500
Of course he won't take the initiative to break off the engagement.

148
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,170
My father is a first-ranked official in the imperial court.

149
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,870
As the legitimate daughter of a noble family,

150
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,470
how can I marry such a person?

151
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,770
If you ask me,

152
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,140
Sister Yao,

153
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,020
you are a little bit too stubborn.

154
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,670
There are so many roads in the world.

155
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,930
There are so many ways.

156
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,420
Why must Zhang take the initiative to break off the engagement?

157
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,060
It's alright if your family take the initiative.

158
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,190
As long as you have the right reason,

159
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,620
no one can say anything about it.

160
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,220
Do you have any suggestions?

161
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,110
If what you said is true,

162
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,540
that Zhang Zhe really failed his two engagements,

163
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,460
it means that he's meant to have no wife in his life.

164
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,930
Also, his second wife-to-be died

165
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:36,920
before they could get married.

166
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,030
What is this called?

167
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,560
Isn't it his fate to bring bad luck to his wife?

168
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:42,480
But it was

169
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,630
his fiancee who had been weak and sick since childhood.

170
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,020

00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,600
I'll take the whole batch.

339
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,300
Your color looks...

340
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,230
We've been doing business for years.

341
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,300
Don't you trust me?

342
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,350
Right? Well...

343
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,280
Lower the price.

344
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,140
This pattern should work.

345
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,070
This color is good.

346
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,270
Look at the accounts.

347
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,040
In two days,

348
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,380
make a trip to Wanlai Guildhall in the east market.

349
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,140
It was founded by the merchant guild

350
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,700
for merchants from other regions to stay

351
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,760
and talk business.

352
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,870
There will be a merchant named Xu Wenyi there,

353
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,150
selling a batch of raw silk.

354
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,170
Buy his silk with this money.

355
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,640
The price will be multiplied soon.

356
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,460
Sir.

357
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,780
Excuse me,

358
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,470
is there a merchant named Xu Wenyi?

359
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,730
Xu Wenyi?

360
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,660
Over there.

361
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,400
Please have mercy, okay?

362
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,530
Please.

363
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,480
We've been doing business for years.

364
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,570
The batch I brought here

365
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,590
is the result of the silkworm raisers' hard work for a year.

366
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,500
You promised you would take as much as we have last year.

367
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,140
[Silk merchant Xu Wenyi]

368
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,780
That's why we made usurious loans

369
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,110
to raise more silkworms.

370
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,720
Now you simply say you don't want it anymore.

371
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,360
What should we do, Mr. Wang?

372
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,790
-It's just… -Xu.

373
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,680
I've made myself clear.

374
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,200
The price of raw silk keeps getting lower and lower this year.

375
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,800
I don't know when it will hit the bottom.

376
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,000
Our boss has decided not to buy any silk.

377
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,760
Don't make it difficult for me.

378
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:53,720
Mr. Wang.

379
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,880
Are you Mr. Xu?

380
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,500
I want to buy silk.

381
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,030
[Seller, Xu Wenyi]

382
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,030
[Buyer, You Fangyin]

383
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,830
Here's 400 taels.

384
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,700
Please keep it.

385
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,080
As for the raw silk,

386
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,240
keep it in your warehouse for now,

387
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:29,690
OK?

388
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:33,700
Your 400 taels

389
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:37,000
will really help me and the silkworm raisers out.

390
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,170
But Miss,

391
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,810
the price of raw silk is so low right now.

392
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,670
And according to the market situation,

393
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,400
the price may continue to fall.

394
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,110
You've stored so much of it.

395
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,400
Aren't you afraid of losing money?

396
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,850
If you can't sell it this year,

397
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,090
it may go mouldy and get bitten by worms

398
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,270
by next year.

399
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:53,780
No.

400
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,580
Boss said the silk price would rise.

401
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,240
I trust her.

402
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,470
Since I couldn't make use of Matron Su,

403
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,660
if I keep pretending,

404
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,460
I'll only be asking for trouble.

405
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,270
Forget it.

406
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,880
I'd better save my energy.

407
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,770
You are so thoughtful

408
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,100
as to notice such a detail as the direction of the flower.

409
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,100
You are indeed a pure and elegant person.

410
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,030
Miss Jiang

411
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,930
should be the first place of incense making today.

412
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,190
Of course I'm thoughtful.

413
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,400
I was maltreated by you a lot

414
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,360
because of such details back then.

415

Mr. Wang.

416
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,510
I have copied the exam paper six times.

Please have a look.

[Teacher of Hanlin Academy, Wang Jiu]

The exam

423
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,660
is a mere formality.

424
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,400
There's no need to

425
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,770
take it too seriously.

426
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,380
I remember you said

427
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,710
the exam questions are all quite simple

this time.

430
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,160
If His Majesty gets to know about this,

431
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,109
won't he think it's a little perfunctory

432
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:22,990
since it can't show the knowledge of the study partners?

433
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:26,180
Her Highness insisted on studying,

434
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,320
so His Majesty had no choice.

435
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,190
Logically speaking,

436
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,930
a girl should

437
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,090
listen to her parents at home,

438
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,580
obey her husband after getting married and then her son if the husband passes away.

439
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,110
It's fine to read The Classic of Filial Piety and Lessons for Women.

440
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,110
Why did she have to make such a scene?

441
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,140
Exactly.

442
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,660
The etiquette training is over for now.

I wanted to review a bit more last night,

450

as soon as I started reading.

452
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,260

I could tell you had connections.

455
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:33,830
I heard that

456
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,110
your father is familiar with Mr. Xie.

457
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:39,710
I wonder if he ever gave you instructions on your studies?

458
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:40,600
Look.

459
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,810
Can you tell me a little bit about

460
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,620
the books Mr. Xie likes?

461
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,430
Does he have any preference

462
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,830
grading the exam papers?

463
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,090
Not many of them are really knowledgeable.

464
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,800
If they can answer the questions better than me,

465
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,860
wouldn't it make me seem more uneducated

466
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,060
and incapable of being a study partner?

467
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,670
Since you asked,

468
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,460
I have to tell you something.

469
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,320
Mr. Xie is knowledgeable,

470
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,220
but he won't make the exam too difficult for us.

471
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,680
The 20 Classics of Confucianism is a must read,

especially Article Three and Article Six.

473
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,840

Mr. Xie is fond of neat handwriting.

No matter how good the answers are,

if the handwriting is not neat and clear,

477
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,930
he won't let you pass the exam.

Really?

485
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,420
If my handwriting is bad, will I really be eliminated?

486

Baoying.

487
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,030
Don't listen to her nonsense.

488
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,360
I'm afraid Jiang Xuening can't even read.

489
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,910
How can she understand

490
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,360
someone so knowledgable as Mr. Xie?

491
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,960
Let's just wait to laugh at her this afternoon.

492
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:52,880
Miss Jiang.

493
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:54,700
Wait.

494
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:56,990
What's up?

495
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,970
About last night...

496
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,690
Don't worry, Miss Yao.

497
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,440
I may not be a good person,

498
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,370
but I'll say it to your face

499
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,860
if there's any hard feeling between us.

500
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,840
I won't do anything like

501
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,740
talking behind people's back and slandering them.

502
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,130
So you don't need to worry

503
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,530
if I'll spread any rumor.

504
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,740
I don't think I have any grudge against you.

505
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,660
But your reaction last night

506
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,320
seemed to be a little too over.

507
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:17,610
Miss Jiang.

508
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,600
May I ask

509
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,270
what your relationship with Zhang Zhe is?

510
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,530
I was just taking up the cudgel

511
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,620
for Mr. Zhang.

512
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,870
And you already thought there's something between us?

513
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,070
If there is really something,

514
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,140
you will use it

515
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,720
as a reason to break off the engagement, right?

516
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,440
If there's really nothing between you and him,

517
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,600
why do you care so much about my marriage?

518
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,260
Mr. Zhang Zhe is upright

519
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,440
and virtuous.

520
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,820
He is a gentleman.

521
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,200
I'm just a nobody.

522
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,360
I dare not get involved with him.

523
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,790
However, a gentleman should be treated

524
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,090
in a gentleman's way.

525
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,860
People all tend to seek benefits and avoid harm.

526
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,260
Miss Yao, if you think this marriage is not good for you,

527
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,020
it's understandable that you want to break it off.

528
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,410
But if you go too far,

529
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,660
it will be no good.

530
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,490
You want to break off the engagement,

531
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,550
and you don't want to take on any harm,

532
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,700
there is no such good thing in the world.

533
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,860
You're just talking like this because it's not about you.

534
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,650
If something like this happens to you,

535
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,030
if you are appointed to marry someone like him,

536
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,820
I'm afraid you might not be any better than me.

537
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,080
If I were you, Miss Yao,

538
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,910
I would be so happy

539
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,160
to marry such a good man like him.

540
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,630
Why would I break it off?

541
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,120
Even if I have to,

542
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:17,880
I won't sling mud

543
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,210
at innocent people.

544
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,980
I would tell the Zhang family frankly and openly.

545
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,800
If I'm determined not

546
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,270
to be called a snob,

547
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,460
and I still want to break off the engagement,

548
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,720
I'll simply do nothing

549
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,380
and just wait at home.

550
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,370
What do you mean?

551
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,980
Do you know something?

552
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,360
The exam is starting soon.

553
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,370
Instead of pestering me here,

554
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,690
you may want to use the time to study more.

555
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,590
Thank you for your help.

556
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,140
I'm very grateful.

557
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,300
Don't mention it.

558
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,230
You're very knowledgeable, Miss Xue.

559
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,810
There was no need to do this.

560
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,310
But His Lordship

561
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,950
considers it very important that you become a study partner.

562
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,520
That's why he asked me to do this just for sure.

563
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,770
But the questions of this exam

564
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,820
were set by Mr. Xie himself.

565
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,710
The questions are mainly

566
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,850
about politics.

567
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,920
If you have The 20 Classics of Confucianism,

568
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,580
you may want to take it out and read it more.

569
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,080
It's really The 20 Classics of Confucianism?

570
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,280
Miss Xue, you...

571
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:23,710
It's nothing.

572
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,900
Thank you, Sir.

573
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,930
You're welcome.

574
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,420
Please sit down.

575
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,990
The literature exam

576
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,400
begins now.

577
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,220
The duration

578
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,320
is two hours.

579
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,180
Within the time limit,

580
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,390
please answer the questions carefully.

581
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,220
[An army can conquer a general, but no man can rob one of his ambition.]

582
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,220
[Please explain why it is important for a man to have ambition.]

583
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,700
It's indeed almost the same as the last exam.

584
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,670
Article Three of The 20 Classics of Confucianism.

585
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,230
Isn't this...

586
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,030
Silence!

587
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,740
Start writing already.

588
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:42,620
Wait.

589
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,370
Mr. Xie.

590
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,700
What's wrong?

591
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:50,380
From now on, if there's no strong wind, rain, or sunshine,

592
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,620
please keep the windows at the east corner open.

593
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,020
Yes.

594
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,090
Start writing.

595
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,270
Opening the window.

596
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,340
He's obviously suspecting me of cheating in the dark.

597
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,520
Rebels are rebels.

598
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,120
With his own mean measure.

599
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,860
Wait and see how I'll surprise you

600
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,520
with my great score this time.

601
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,460
♫We made a promise♫

602
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:19,220
♫Yet we are only left with our memory♫

00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:22,410
♫Flowers bloom in the street♫

00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:26,760
♫Without you♫

605
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,130
♫Watching the cloud, waiting for winter to come♫

606
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,790
♫Keep the memories slowly♫

607
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:40,360
♫I've forgotten about the four seasons without you by my side♫

608
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,750
♫Wind blows gently♫

♫Your whisper under the moonlight sounds beautiful♫

612

613
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,390
Time is up.

614
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,660
Everyone, stop writing.

615
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:16,930
Gentlemen,

616
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:19,220
do you want to grade the papers together?

617
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:19,690
No need.

618
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,930
It's up to you, Mr. Xie.

619
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,840
It's my turn.

620
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,110
Oh no.

621
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,390
Could it be

622
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,290
I put too much effort into it?

623
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,800
Why is he staring at me?

624
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,920
Is he going to pick on me

625
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,070
besides chasing me out of the palace?

626
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,410
Miss Jiang.

627
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,130
Why do I feel like

628
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,570
Mr. Xie has been reading this paper

629
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,290
for a much longer time than others?

630
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:34,900
Besides,

631
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,750
he seems to be glaring at you.

632
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,610
Don't you know?

633
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,080
He has an eye sickness.

634
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,120
Just now,

635
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,310
I've graded the exam papers,

636
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,920
and the result is out.

637
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,990
Xue Shu from Mansion of Duke of Xue,

638
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:50,610
top level.

639
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,670
Yao Xi from Mansion of Minister Yao,

640
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:54,590
above average.

641
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,410
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

642
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,060
Fang Miao from Mansion of Supervisor Fang,

643
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:01,870
your answers

644
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:03,180
are average.

645
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,420
However,

646
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,590
since your handwriting is neat

647
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:07,820
and clear,

648
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,220
I can see that you are sincere about studying.

649
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,150
You can stay too.

650
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:12,770
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

651
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,390
You Yue and Zhou Baoying,

652
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,720
you need to study harder

653
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,880
from now on.

654
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,360
But you can also stay this time.

655
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,060
Yes.

656
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,610
As for

657
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:28,210
Jiang Xuening from Mansion of Vice Minister Jiang,

658
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,530
you are top level in regard of exam grade.

659
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,310
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

660
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,320
After I go back home, I'll definitely…

661
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,050
You can stay.

662
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,800
How is that possible?

663
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,250
Look.

664
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,520
Miss Jiang is so happy

665
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,640
that she even started talking nonsense.

666
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:45,960
No.

667
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,610
I can't stay in the palace no matter what.

668
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,810
Not to mention becoming Xie Wei's student.

669
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,410
That'll be asking for death.

670
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,150
Mr. Xie.

671
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,710
I have something I don't understand

672
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,710
that I want to ask.

673
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,800
I know I'm not knowledgeable,

674
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,530
but I was graded top level.

675
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,270
I'm afraid those who are graded average low will be confused.

676
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,500
Why don't you hand out the students' exam papers

677
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,300
so that we can be more convinced?

678
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,000
Are you

679
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,360
questioning my justice?

680
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:14,870
I dare not.

681
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,210
Fine.

682
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,450
In that case,

683
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:20,350
I'll take out your exam papers

684
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,200
and comment on them one by one,

685
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,210
so that you can know

686
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,580
what your shortcomings are.

687
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,220
I don't need it.

688
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:29,890
Sir.

689
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,840
I'm indeed unknowledgeable.

690
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:32,870
I admit that.

691
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,070
Yes.

692
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,470
If he comments on them in detail,

693
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,310
it equals whipping our dead bodies in public.

694
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,520
Jiang Xuening.

695
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,200
You're always competitive.

696
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,520
It's fine for you to get top level.

697
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,050
Why do you have to pick on us?

698
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:45,860
Sister Xue

699
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,330
also got top level.

700
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:48,970
But she didn't say anything.

701
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:50,900
In this case,

702
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:54,180
it seems that Miss Jiang is the only one who doesn't understand.

703
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,030
We are convinced.

704
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,430
We've got your instructions,

705
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:59,690
and we don't want to trouble you anymore.

706
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:00,940
That's good.

707
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,920
Miss Jiang, do you mind staying behind after this?

708
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,650
I can explain it to you alone.

709
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,230
No need.

710
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,460
I must be strict in teaching.

711
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,240
As a teacher,

712
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,340
I should resolve your doubts.

713
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,010
But since Miss Jiang has made it into the palace,

714
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,520
you'll have plenty of time

715
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,870
to learn it slowly.

716
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,440
Am I right?

717
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:26,210
All right.

718
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:29,040
Go back to your mansions and get ready.

719
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:32,670
After that, you will officially enter the palace and be study partners.

720
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:33,610
We shall

721
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,340
call each other teacher and student from now on.

722
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,340
And I'll teach you

723
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,230
for six months.

724
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,130
Please study hard

725
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,580
and don't let us down.

726
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,980
You can leave now.

727
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,240
I have something

728
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,360
to discuss with the two teachers.

729
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,610
Yes.

730
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,220
My goodness.

731
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,360
I passed it.

732
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,910
And Mr. Xie is not

733
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,490
that cold and strict as Father said.

734
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,460
His voice is gentle and nice.

735
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,350
It's all Father's fault for scaring me.

736
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,600
That's because you've never seen him being scary.

737
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,580
He can easily scare people to death.

738
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,460
My father said

739
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,590
Mr. Xie behaves and conducts himself perfectly.

740
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,490
He's never careless in teaching.

741
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,320
He also said

742
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,200
if I could learn at least something,

743
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,530
I wouldn't have come to the palace in vain.

744
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,170
It's all thanks to

745
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,830
the kind lady here, Miss Jiang.

746
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,010
Without your instructions,

747
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:34,190
I would have failed.

748
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,510
Miss Jiang is indeed somebody.

749
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:40,130
She seemed to know what the exam would be about.

750
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:40,740
From the questions

751
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,200
to Mr. Xie's preferences,

752
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,280
she knew it all.

753
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,510
Who knows what you did behind our back?

754
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,110
I don't care about others,

755
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,820
but Mr. Xie is upright

756
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,830
and virtuous.

757
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,020
Everyone in the court knows that.

758
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,590
How would a saint like that care about you?

759
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,500
Dream on.

760
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,250
You also think Xie Wei is a good man?

761
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:02,490
Everyone knows Mr. Xie is a good man.

762
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,990
He's an official but he never formed any clique.

763
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:07,060
He has always been devoted to teaching, and he's honest and upright.

764
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,520
He's loyal to His Majesty.

765
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,760
How is a man like this not good?

766
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,320
At this moment,

767
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,020
Xie Wei has nothing to do

768
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,280
with the rebels yet.

769
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,930
Everyone thinks he's a good person,

770
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,360
respecting and thinking highly of him.

771
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,920
If I act differently,

772
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,790
wouldn't it be revealed that

773
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,520
I know more than everyone else?

774
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,800
What's wrong?

775
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,450
I need to go back to see Mr. Xie.

776
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,070
Miss Fang.

777
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,740
If I'm not back in two quarters,

778
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,940
please come to Fengchen Hall to save me.

779
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:37,980
Why are you going there?

780
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,960
[Four years ago]

781
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,270
There are traps set by the hunters in the mountain.

782
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,610
There must be a village nearby.

783
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,880
We can get out soon.

784
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,830
Wake up. You can't die.

785
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,170
What are you doing?

786
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,360
The doctor told me

787
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,170
you were suffering from evil coldness.

788
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:23,310
Only by feeding you blood can I save you.

789
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,000
However,

790
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,380
you have no idea what's good for you.

791
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,770
Xie Wei, are you crazy?

792
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,620
Don't come over.

793
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,520
It's not me.

794
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,530
I'm not him.

795
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,770
His eyes are red,

796
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:21,080
and there are red spots on his body.

797
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,150
He's distracted, addicted to blood,

798
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,210
and out of control.

799
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,190
This is

800
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:27,880
schizophrenia.

801
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,670
Ordinary people are human,

802
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,210
and His Majesty is also human.

803
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:40,350
How could they?

804
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,600
How could they?

805
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,230
Kill!

806
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,030
Kill them all!

807
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,540
Kill!

808
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,110
Mother.

809
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:57,480
I'm so cold.

810
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,780
I want peach kernel slice cakes.

811
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,150
Xie Wei tested and warned me several times.

812
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,659
He did it partly for Yan Lin,

813
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:13,719
but also for what happened back then.

814
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:15,000
He has schizophrenia.

815
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,540
He becomes bloodthirsty on a snowy day.

816
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,909
His so-called

817
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,130
treacherous words

818
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,969
are also related to His Majesty.

819
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,429
No matter what other secret Xie Wei is hiding,

820
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,760
in the imperial palace,

821
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:27,100
it's too easy for him

822
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:28,090
to get rid of me.

823
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:30,820
At this point,

824
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,699
I have to take a risky move

825
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,409
to survive.

826
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:55,670
You know I don't want to enter the palace, Mr. Xie.

827
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,000
Why did you make me stay?

828
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,160
Miss Ning'er, so you're done pretending?

829
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,760
I know I'm unknowledgeable.

830
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,040
My answers were just a bunch of nonsense.

831
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,960
But I got good grades from you and got to stay in the palace.

832
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,070
After thinking about it repeatedly,

833
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,750
there is only one explanation.

834
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:10,510
Are you suspecting that

835
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,780
I haven't forgotten about what happened on our way to the capital,

836
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,310
and you are afraid that I would leak it out,

837
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,780
so you wanted to keep me by your side

838
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,910
and keep an eye on me?

839
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:17,950
If I make any move,

840
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,310
you'll kill me immediately.

841
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:20,130
Am I right?

842
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,890
Since you came to me,

843
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:23,570
the answer is obvious.

844
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,960
I don't want others

845
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,570
to know what happened back then.

846
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,460
You were not wrong about that.

847
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,130
However,

848
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,080
you are not

849
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:33,750
a threat yourself.

850
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:35,300
But

851
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,510
I do have something

852
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:39,480
to ask you, Miss Ning'er.

853
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,610
What's your relationship

854
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,160
with Yan Lin?

855
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,970
He is my best friend.

856
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:48,160
He's the one who treats me the best in the capital.

857
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,250
That's all?

858
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,560
What do you mean?

859
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,110
Rumor has it that

860
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,120
you and Yan Lin are deeply in love.

861
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,540
It is said that after the coming-of-age ceremony,

862
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,140
Viscount Yan will marry you.

863
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,060
I've said

864
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,280
Yan Lin is my best friend.

865
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,490
Our relationship is truly deep.

866
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:06,350
But it's not that kind of love between men and women.

867
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,430
Miss Ning'er, your paper

868
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,100
was different from others'.

869
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,030
I'm unknowledgeable,

870
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,500
but I found that you have

871
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,970
indeed read a lot of books.

872
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,260
This sentence

873
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,510
is from Story of Marquis of Liu.

874
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,930
And this sentence

875
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,820
is from Stratagems of the Warring States.

876
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,750
They are not from

877
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,420
the books that ordinary girls read.

878
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,750
All these years,

879
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,580
I've never heard that you're devoted to studying.

880
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,650
Then why do you

881
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:34,630
have such an accumulation of knowledge now?

882
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:39,760
If it's not that

883
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:42,590
I don't believe in supernatural things,

884
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,380
I'm afraid

885
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,150
I'd think you're reincarnated,

886
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,460
Miss Ning.

887
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,650
I did hide my talent.

888
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,970
But that was for staying away from the palace

889
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,150
and court disputes.

890
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,090
Please let me

891
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:03,650
leave the palace, Sir.

892
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,540
Don't waste your time.

893
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:06,590
First,

894
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,050
your father asked me to take good care of you

895
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,950
in the palace several days ago.

896
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,420
Second,

897
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,450
Yan Lin also asked me

898
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,990
to help you.

899
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,890
Third, as the saying goes,

900
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:20,540
a drop of water in need

901
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,540
shall be returned with a spring in deed.

902
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,370
Haven't you heard that

903
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,120
although the list of study partners entering the palace

904
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,250
was selected by the Ministry of Rites,

905
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,210
in the end,

906
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,460
they had to run it by me

907
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:35,100
before it was released.

908
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,840
I've already marked your name

909
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,780
a while ago

910
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,420
so that you could enter the palace.

911
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,540
How could I

912
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,570
let you leave so easily?

913
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,660
So you were behind it, letting me in the palace?

914
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,970
Turns out it's not someone who's messing with me,

915
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,900
but everyone wants to mess with me.

916
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,470
Instead of leaving you outside the palace,

917
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:57,220
I'd rather keep you under my nose

918
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,070
and watch you.

919
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,210
You don't want to enter the palace.

920
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,040
Is it because you're afraid

921
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,320
I'll kill you?

922
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,200
Mr. Xie.

923
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,780
I'm just a girl.

924
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,500
I have no power

925
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,120
nor ambition in the imperial court.

926
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,940
To you,

927
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,900
I'm just a little ant

928
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,160
that can be killed by some simple tricks.

929
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,450
If I tell you

930
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,270
I have no intention to tell on you

931
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:25,080
or harm you from beginning to end,

932
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,210
will you believe me?

933
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,000
If you were me,

934
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,400
would you believe it?

935
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:36,010
I dare not.

936
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,400
So,

937
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,860
if you were me,

938
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:54,330
this person...

939
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,380
Would you get rid of her

940
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:57,770
or not?

941
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,190
But Sir,

942
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,680
I don't want to die.

943
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:10,100
You're not a threat to me.

944
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,270
The real threat is that

945
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,640
I dare not believe you,

946
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,390
but I want to.

947
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:18,870
I'm not an ungrateful person.

948
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:21,470
I don't want to hurt my savior.

949
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:23,890
But what matters is

950
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,140
whether you'll obey me or not.

951
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,510
Ning'er.

952
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:30,830
Have you ever experienced

953
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:32,750
keeping a secret in your heart

954
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,340
and not being able to tell anyone?

955
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,070
Walking at night in finery,

956
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,630
and feeling especially lonely

957
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:43,830
with all the money and status?

958
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,650
You are a smart person.

959
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,010
With you as a study partner in the palace,

960
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,200
the life in palace

961
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,850
will become more interesting.

962
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,100
But I don't want to.

963
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:57,060
What you're hiding

964
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,290
is what I want to see.

965
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,110
So, Jiang Xuening,

966
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,370
in the next six months of being a study partner in the palace,

967
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:05,430
please behave yourself under my nose

968
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,070
like an ordinary lady.

969
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,240
Don't get involved with Yan Lin

970
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:11,200
or

971
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:14,690
do anything that may harm Mansion of Marquis of Yan.

972
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,390
Don't push me

973
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,040
or make me angry.

974
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:21,330
Otherwise...

975
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:35,740
There's no need for a wolf to deceive an ant.

976
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,250
I managed to escape from death

977
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,660
and survive for now.

978
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,390
Half a year.

979
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,390
I can't avoid it.

980
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,000
I have to deal with whatever comes my way.

981
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,380
I didn't expect

982
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,150
you to be good at archery too.

983
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,170
I'll send someone to ask for a leave for you.

984
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:00,700
Let's have a drink tonight.

985
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,860
Your Highness.

986
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:04,110
I don't think it's a good idea.

987
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,050
Listen.

988
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,330
Tomorrow,

989
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,550
I'm inviting a girl over

990
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,080
who's very important to me.

991
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,350
Speaking of which,

992
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:11,750
you two are old acquaintances.

993
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:12,970
I'll take you to see her.

994
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:17,150
You are not talking about the Second Young Lady from Mansion of Vice Minister Jiang, are you?

995
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:17,570
Yes.

996
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,330
It's her.

997
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:19,630
Let me tell you.

998
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,370
This girl

999
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,070
is the most important person

1000
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:22,990
to me in this world.

1001
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:23,520
Let's go.

1002
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,040
Why is Yan Lin with a Xingwu Guard?

1003
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,640
I was negligent.

1004
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,800
I'll investigate it immediately.

1005
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,320
My Lord. My Lady.

1006
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,330
Miss Ning is back.

1007
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:48,180
Ning is back.

1008
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,570
Ning.

1009
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,310
You're back.

1010
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:57,380
How have you been in the palace these days?

1011
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:00,030
We've heard the news.

1012
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,090
Our Ning is so capable.

1013
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:04,460
You passed the exam successfully.

1014
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,080
Congratulations, Ning.

1015
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:10,350
I thought

1016
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,180
you could't pass it given your ability.

1017
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,970
I didn't expect you to get to stay.

1018
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:16,840
I was thinking

1019
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,820
whether

1020
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:21,490
it's because of luck,

1021
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,950
or was there someone there to help you?

1022
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:25,600
Right.

1023
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:27,200
In your eyes,

1024
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:29,200
I'm just ignorant and incompetent.

1025
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,060
Since I passed,

1026
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,050
there must be something behind it.

1027
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:33,820
Am I wrong?

1028
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,850
You appeared on that list for no reason

1029
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,690
instead of your sister that day.

1030
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,340
I couldn't figure it out.

1031
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:43,150
Then I thought

1032
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,870
it must be Viscount Yan who helped you.

1033
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,870
I'm afraid it's the same

1034
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:48,670
this time.

1035
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,450
If you think so, I have nothing to say.

1036
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,150
So you admit it?

1037
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,790
You are admitting that

1038
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:58,230
you took away your sister's chance to enter the palace?

1039
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:00,140
If your sister got to enter the palace,

1040
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:02,000
those who go to study in the palace

1041
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:04,650
will all be young talents from noble families.

1042
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:07,830
Your sister will surely find a good match.

1043
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:09,430
It's not impossible for her

1044
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:10,560
to become a consort.

1045
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,410
On the contrary,

1046
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:14,180
you are stubborn and disobedient.

1047
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,480
You always cause trouble.

1048
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,210
Not to mention being a consort,

1049
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,070
even if you become the empress one day,

1050
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:20,060
you won't be able to enjoy it.
