If Jiang Xuening didn't say anything to you,

after you talked to each other in the palace?

103

But from the beginning to the end,

107
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,700
I never wanted to marry you.

108
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,060
It all started because

109
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,550
your loving father

110
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,409

00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,490
Who knows what he's up to now?

173
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:25,910
Mr. Lyu.

174
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,600
I think

175
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,850
people should trust...

176
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,900
Each other.

177
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,590
Ren's salt farm has been passed down for 100 years.

178
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,110
Besides, we have a contract.

179
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:38,710
Right?

180
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,370
If a person

181
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,740
is determined to break his promise,

182
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,010
what can a contract do to stop him?

183
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,670
I've sent someone to keep an eye on him in Shudi.

184
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,710
If he dares to play any tricks,

185
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,190
I'll kill him.

186
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,020
But...

187
00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,990
Tell me honestly.

188
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,710
Why did Jiang Xuening

189
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,260
invest her money in the salt well business?

190
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,220
Did she get hold of some secret intel?

191
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:09,880
I don't know.

192
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,500
Are you trying to fool me?

193
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,320
Fine.

194
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:13,970
I understand.

195
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,290
How about this?

196
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,210
Give me a price.

197
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,480
From now on, tell me

198
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,970
whatever she tells you.

199
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,240
We are all in the same circle.

200
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,710
I know this much.

201
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,190
No way.

202
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,870
Miss Jiang trusts me so much.

203
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,930
I can’t betray her.

204
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,350
Isn't this enough?

205
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,760
Don't be too demanding.

206
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,930
I can give you another...

207
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:40,970
100 taels at most!

208
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,370
Why are you suddenly angry at me?

209
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,370
Hey, calm down...

210
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,020
Calm down and talk to me!

211
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,390
Red with green?

212
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,590
What a terrible idea!

213
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,030
Isn't there anyone useful in my palace?

214
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,770
I just came back from my break,

215
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,470
and you're already so angry, Your Highness.

216
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,610
I was so scared that I was about to run back home.

217
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,830
You're finally back.

218
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,120
I thought you had

219
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,910
forgotten about me after your break.

220
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,100
How could you say such harrowing things?

221
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,560
I brought you delicious food

222
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,860
and fun toys from outside the palace.

223
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,660
Even if I forget everyone else, I cannot forget about Your Highness.

224
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,840
A shadow puppet.

225
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,550
My favorite!

226
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,900
I knew it, you treat me the best.

227
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,430
Let's go.

228
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,270
You may leave.

229
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:33,890
Yes.

230
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,460
Your Highness,

231
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,500
I didn't give you this gift for free.

232
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,740
I have a favor to ask of Your Highness.

233
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,470
You don't need favors for me to help you.

234
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,150
Tell me, did someone

235
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,160
upset you again?

236
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,200
I'll punish them for you.

237
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:53,660
That's not the case.

238
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,720
But

239
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,650
I still have a lingering fear

240
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,610
about the jade ruyi scepter case.

241
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,730
My family said

242
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,840
I've been ignorant since I was young.

243
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,330
I'm not suitable for the palace.

244
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,950
I just hope Your Highness can make the order

245
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,550
and expel me from the palace.

246
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,820
You want to leave?

247
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,360
Ning.

248
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,920
I treat you so well.

249
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,270
Why do you want to leave?

250
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,220
If you leave, what should I do?

251
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,100
Your Highness, you're royalty.

252
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,830
You don't lack someone like me...

253
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,250
No.

254
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,750
Don't even think about it. Next request.

255
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:27,960
Fine.

256
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,230
Then...

257
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,070
You know

258
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,110
I really don't like playing the qin.

259
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,300
Can you help me and spare me

260
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,710
from practicing qin at Wenzhao Pavilion?

261
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,100
Mr. Xie gave the order himself.

262
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,550
Your Highness, are you afraid?

263
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,440
How is that possible?

264
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,180
I’m a princess. I’m not afraid of Mr. Xie.

265
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,290
But I spoke for the Yan family a few days ago

266
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,020
and offended Mother.

267
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,350
If Brother Jie also...

268
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:00,840
Anyway,

269
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,010
I can't grant this one either.

270
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:02,810
Next request.

271
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,940
That's all.

272
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,710
Think of one.

273
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,470
Make a different request.

274
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,800
I'll definitely grant your next request.

275
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,510
Then, Your Highness,

276
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,590
please summon my elder sister to the palace.

277
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,590
With her here,

278
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,270
I'm sure my family can rest assured.

279
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,960
No problem. I'll grant your request.

280
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,270
It's just another study partner.

281
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,070
It's not hard.

282
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,100
Thank you, Your Highness.

283
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,440
These are all rewards from Her Highness?

284
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,710
They are so beautiful.

285
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,050
Ning, Her Highness treats you so well.

286
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,280
I'm so jealous.

287
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,710
Her Highness treats all of us the same.

288
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,810
I received more rewards today.

289
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,290
It will be your turn in the future.

290
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,880
Don't forget me then.

291
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,040
It's too expensive.

292
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:43,850
Take it.

293
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,160
This looks nice too.

294
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,320
It's just an ordinary reward,

295
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,140
nothing rare or special.

296
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,920
Why are you so angry?

297
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,080
I used to think You Yue was dumb

298
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,250
for always going against Jiang Xuening.

299
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,260
Now I see her getting her way at everything

300
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,660
and I don't get it either.

301
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,230
Why does it seem that everyone dotes on her?

302
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,200
We are from different backgrounds.

303
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,460
We can't learn to be obsequious like her.

304
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,160
You just need to know that

305
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,510
a person who fools others with her beauty

306
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,590
will never last long.

307
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,120
They will see her true colors sooner or later.

308
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,140
Now, my marriage is canceled.

309
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,970
Shu, you're a few months older than me.

310
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:38,040
Did your family say anything about marriage?

311
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,000
I...

312
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,410
I'll do as my elders say.

313
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:46,130
This is a new batch of tea. Have a taste, Aunt.

314
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,350
Why is Mother suddenly interested in a game of pitch-pot?

315
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,820
Was it you who wanted to play?

316
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,650
Don't you know

317
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,340
why we're playing pitch-pot?

318
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,920
I was forced to come here because of you.

319
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,670
All right.

320
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,510
No need to keep me company and chat with me.

321
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,580
Go and play.

322
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,200
I'm not good at pitch-pot.

323
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,980
It doesn't matter if you're not good at it.

324
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,110
We have an expert with us here.

325
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,360
Jie,

326
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,430
go play with Shu.

327
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,090
Don't bully her.

328
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,410
You stay.

329
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:42,970
[Yingchun Pavilion]

330
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,730
How about

331
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,110
I try again?

332
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,410
Thank you, Your Highness.

333
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,160
I've been weak since childhood,

334
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,880
so I didn't like playing these games.

335
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,010
I missed the target.

336
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,590
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

337
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,900
It doesn't matter.

338
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,030
Actually, I didn't like to play it before.

339
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,830
It was Yan Lin who influenced me.

340
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,610
Unfortunately,

341
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,690
he can't enter the palace anymore.

342
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,440
Don't worry, Your Highness.

343
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,380
The innocent will always be innocent.

344
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,510
Viscount Yan will eventually be fine.

345
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,040
Do you really think so?

346
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,180
Your Highness, do you also think that

347
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,580
the Xue family has a grudge against the Yan family,

348
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,720
and will never stop fighting against each other?

349
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,050
That's not what I meant.

350
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,270
I can't interfere in

351
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,100
the family's decisions.

352
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,400
But I can at least control my heart.

353
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,030
I have no hostility towards Viscount Yan.

354
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,630
In fact, I envy him for being so free-willed.

355
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,850
It's rare for you

356
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,140
to think that way.

357
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,240
Aunt wants to set us up.

358
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,550
I know you don't like it,

359
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,890
but I have no choice.

360
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,160
I dare not ask you to let go of your grudges.

361
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,340
But at least,

362
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,790
I don’t want to be a burden to you.

363
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,960
Actually, it's not like that.

364
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,110
We've known each other since childhood.

365
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,040
It's not a burden

366
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,640
for me to play with you.

367
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,660
But when one

368
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,300
forces certain things to happen,

369
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,030
it becomes very uncomfortable instead.

370
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,380
I should have handled myself better too.

371
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,890
Please don't take it to heart.

372
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,470
Matron Su.

373
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,300
It's you.

374
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:42,710
Matron Su.

375
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,320
Jiang...

376
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,520
Why is she in the palace?

377
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,090
Your Highness,

378
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,600
Miss You from the Mansion of Earl of You suddenly got sick.

379
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,790
She couldn't be a study partner anymore.

380
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,190
Her Highness is missing one study partner.

381
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,870
This is also the daughter of Minister Jiang.

382
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,600
She's here to fill the vacancy.

383
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,470
That's great.

384
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,150
I mean,

385
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,550
Zhiyi likes liveliness.

386
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,810
She will be very happy.

387
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,500
You met her so soon?

388
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,300
I'm afraid Miss Xue is

389
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,800
in a bad mood right now.

390
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:37,960
Ning,

391
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,570
why did you summon me

392
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,810
into the palace?

393
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,350
The Xue family wants to marry their daughter to Lord Linzi.

394
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,950
You must have heard about it.

395
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,230
Because of this handkerchief,

396
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,630
Xue Shu mistook me for you

397
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,990
and used the means meant for you

398
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,040
on me instead.

399
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,070
I don't want to take the blame for you anymore.

400
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,270
So I brought you here.

401
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,800
You're not angry?

402
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,910
I implicated you in the first place.

403
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:06,860
If anything,

404
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,720
I should apologize to you.

405
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,070
Besides, after you found out the truth about the handkerchief,

406
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,350
you didn't have to tell me how His Highness felt.

407
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,410
You could have told Miss Xue instead.

408
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,820
But you didn't.

409
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,710
You took care of my feelings

410
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,880
and arranged for me to meet His Highness.

411
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,080
Why should I be angry?

412
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,700
Don't flatter yourself.

413
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,120
I was just afraid that you'd resent me

414
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,670
after you entered the palace.

415
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,130
It's fine if you're not on my side,

416
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,190
but you might even stab me in the back.

417
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,390
Anyway,

418
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,260
you chose your own path.

419
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,350
If you want to marry Lord Linzi and be a princess,

420
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,150
you'll have to rely on yourself.

421
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,100
Alright, I'm tired.

422
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,700
I've said what I should.

423
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,710
Please leave.

424
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,140
I stole your marriage last time.

425
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,520
I don't owe you anything this time.

426
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:05,040
[Mansion of Marquis of Yan]

427
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,590
The physician said

428
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,150
you can stop taking medicine

429
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,760
after you finish these two portions.

430
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,630
But you still need to take good care of yourself.

431
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,770
Don't worry too much.

432
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,150
Last night, your room was lit until midnight.

433
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,270
How could you stay up so late?

434
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,830
Now it's your turn to nag at me?

435
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,680
Did Xingwu Guards cause any more trouble lately?

436
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,950
They tried twice to stir trouble.

437
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,920
Later on, Zhou Yinzhi did something,

438
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,160
and now they're more well-behaved.

439
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,490
But Mr. Xie sent someone

440
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:33,090
to ask about your health several times at night.

441
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,150
I must repay Mr. Xie

442
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,080
for his kindness someday.

443
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:37,760
Report!

444
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,830
My Lordship.

445
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,490
Young Lord.

446
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,390
The invitation letters we ordered for the young lord's

447
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,210
Coming-of-Age Ceremony have been delivered.

448
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,240
The butler is at the mansion entrance,

449
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,530
checking them with the Xingwu Guards.

450
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,020
So he sent me to ask about it.

451
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,550
Should we still distribute

452
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,350
these invitations?

453
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,420
Why not?

454
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,900
Given the current situation of the Yan Mansion,

455
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,850
even if we send out the invitations,

456
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,250
few would dare to turn up.

457
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,600
Why bother?

458
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,980
Junior Preceptor Xie once taught me that

459
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,380
people's true nature can

460
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,160
only be revealed amid a crisis.

461
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,550
Now Heaven has given us a chance to see clearly.

462
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,290
Why should we

463
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,280
let this chance go to waste?

464
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,710
Go back to the butler.

465
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,760
If the Xingwu Guards refuse to let the invitation senders go,

466
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,560
tell them that

467
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,480
His Majesty only asked the Yan family to cooperate with the investigation.

468
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,210
The Coming-of-Age Ceremony is a duty of courtesy.

469
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,810
Ask them who dares to stop it.

470
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:32,820
Yes.

471
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,770
An exception was made for Mr. Zhang to attend the court.

472
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:51,500
It must be Mr. Xie who advised His Majesty to do so.

473
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,260
I wonder what he's planning.

474
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,820
Do you have anything else to report?

475
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,200
Your Majesty, I have something to report.

476
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,380
Ministry of Rites, what is it?

477
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,180
Your Majesty.

478
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,890
The Yan Mansion has been surrounded by Xingwu Guards for days.

479
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,930
Now that Viscount Yan's Coming-of-Age Ceremony is approaching,

480
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,660
by right, the Ministry of Rites should hold the ceremony.

481
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,660
Your Majesty, please give the order

482
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,460
to lift the Yan Mansion's house arrest

483
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,340
so that we can hold the Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

484
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:28,950
Your Majesty,

485
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,620
until the Rebels Case is thoroughly solved,

486
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,680
the Yan family will remain suspects.

487
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:35,590
At a time like this,

488
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,180
how can they hold a Coming-of-Age Ceremony?

489
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,950
It's not reasonable.

490
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,280
Your Majesty.

491
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,440
His Grace the Duke is right.

492
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,980
But the Rebels Case

493
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,620
is now collaborated by the Ministry of Justice and Xingwu Guards.

494
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,680
But the Yan Mansion

495
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,640
is only guarded by Xingwu Guards.

496
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,310
Even if we want to investigate,

497
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,640
it's hard for us to do so.

498
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,380
Are you implying that

499
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,740
I'm interfering with the Ministry of Justice's investigation?

500
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,800
I wouldn't dare to.

501
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,500
I just think that

502
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,390
the Coming-of-Age Ceremony is an important matter.

503
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,910
It's not something we can delay.

504
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,270
If we miss the date due to delay,

505
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:15,390
the Ministry of Justice can't afford to be responsible.

506
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,440
All right.

507
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,420
It's just a Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

508
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,550
Just hold it for him.

509
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,310
The Xingwu Guards will guard the door

510
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,050
and search through any supplies needed for the ceremony.

511
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,310
Nothing will go wrong.

512
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,010
As for the Rebels Case,

513
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,040
I see you pushing responsibilities around

514
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,030
and making little actual progress.

515
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:31,630
Zhang Zhe.

516
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,840
Yes, Your Majesty.

517
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,270
Before Gu Chunfang returns to the capital,

518
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,720
you'll be in charge of this case.

519
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,100
I'll grant you the authority.

520
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,870
You have the right to investigate any of the

521
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,220
six ministries in the capital.

522
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,080
You must give me an explanation as soon as possible.

523
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

524
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,090
Miss Xue, you're still young,

525
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,900
yet you are so talented.

526
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,690
It seems that you've worked hard in music.

527
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,040
Thank you, sir.

528
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,070
Elder Miss Jiang is new here.

529
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,920
She's not familiar with the class.

530
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,650
The teachers don't know your skill level either.

531
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,510
When teaching and learning are concerned,

532
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,830
it may be inconvenient for both parties.

533
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,370
Why don't you play us a song?

534
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,440
Well then, Elder Miss Jiang, please play us a song.

535
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,890
Although I'm not good at music,

536
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,660
I'd like to give it a try.

537
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,260
Please excuse my

538
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,750
mediocre skills.

539
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,130
This is considered not good?

540
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,940
Then what are we?

541
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,190
Ning.

542
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:50,950
Is she really your elder sister?

543
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,480
You two aren't alike at all.

544
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,900
Sister has been smart since she was young.

545
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,140
I can never compare myself to her.

546
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,820
One has to be blind to

547
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,650
think we're the same.

548
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,470
Elder Miss Jiang, you're too modest.

549
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,460
Your skills

550
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,490
are too good

551
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,410
for you to say that you're not good.

552
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,940
You played a very nice tune.

553
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,390
The rest of you should study hard.

554
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,560
Especially you,

555
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:25,510
Miss Ning'er.

556
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,030
Since you know you're not good at playing qin,

557
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,360
you have to work harder.

558
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,560
Memorize these qin scores

559
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,630
[Qin Scores]

560
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,610
when you go back.

561
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,530
I'll test you irregularly.

562
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,510
Yes.

563
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,180
Jiang.

564
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,850
Jiang, try some.

565
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,610
The layered walnut cake made by my cook

566
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:57,690
is delicious.

567
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,030
Thank you.

568
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:00,830
Baoying,

569
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,070
why are you willing

570
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,870
to take your treasure out today?

571
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,400
Didn't you only give it to Xuening in the past?

572
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,450
Well, I like the elder Jiang too.

573
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:21,940
Greetings, sir.

574
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,360
Don't mind me.

575
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,360
I just left my qin scores here

576
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,620
and came back to get it.

577
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,730
What are you waiting for?

578
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,620
Go to Wenzhao Pavilion with me to practice qin.

579
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,330
Let's call it a day.

580
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,350
I'll give you some when I go back.

581
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:49,850
Sure.

582
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:53,970
I've long heard that

583
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,570
you're talented.

584
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:57,260
But I didn't expect you to be so brilliant.

585
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,920
Compared to Young Miss Jiang,

586
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,320
you're so much better.

587
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,740
You flatter me, Miss Yao.

588
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,250
I just feel sorry for you.

589
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,120
You are the elder daughter of the family.

590
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,340
But I heard that

591
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,580
you had to endure her bullying at home.

592
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,800
If I were you,

593
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,520
I would have severely punished

594
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,850
someone unruly like her

595
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,890
who brings shame to the family.

596
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,180
Otherwise,

597
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:31,530
the reputation of your family will be ruined by her.

598
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,490
Although my sister is lacking in academic knowledge,

599
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,350
she's not terrible to the point of

600
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,790
disgracing our family's reputation.

601
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:45,130
Although our family is not as good as those of high-ranking families,

602
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,890
our family is strict.

603
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:49,450
If my sister makes any mistakes,

604
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:51,420
Father and Mother will surely address it.

605
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,750
You need not make any redundant comments.

606
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,270
If there's nothing else,

607
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,180
I'll leave now.

608
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,030
Poor thing.

609
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,110
What are you referring to, sir?

610
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,370
It was originally a treasured and top-quality qin.

611
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:40,900
But it fell into your hands.

612
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,140
How pitiful.

613
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,940
How can you play the qin well when you're distracted?

614
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,060
Come and have a cup of tea

615
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:52,990
and some snacks.

616
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,720
Layered walnut cake?

617
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,470
It's from the Imperial Kitchen.

618
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,470
You don't like it?

619
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,790
Actually, I don't like sweet food.

620
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,710
Baoying's cook is from Yuhang.

621
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,430
He's famous in the capital.

622
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,290
Their layered walnut cakes are too sweet.

623
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,090
The Imperial Kitchen's cooking is similar.

624
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,800
They are not as good as yours back then...

625
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,930
You still remember it.

00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,740
You were the one who caught the rabbit.

Now you're also the one who can't bear to eat it.

629
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,260
I told you

630
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,460
I can get another one.

631
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,690
Are you sure you could bear to eat

632
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:05,540
the other one?

633
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,900
We met bandits on our way to the capital.

634
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,180
What kind of ill fate is this?

635
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,300
I shouldn't have escaped with you.

636
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,150
Not only did I get separated from everyone,

637
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,010
but we also ran into the wilderness.

638

Now we're lost and trapped here.

639

There's nothing to eat or drink.

640
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:24,800

during court today,

680
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:14,840
His Majesty allowed the Yan family to hold the Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

681
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,040
He also told Zhang Zhe

682
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,670
to take over the case

683
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,810
between the Yan family and the rebels.

684

Mr. Zhang?

685
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,470
That's great.

686
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,360
With Mr. Zhang on the case,

687
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,490
the Yan family's name will be cleared.

688

You trust him so much?

I trust you.

690
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,590
Every time the Xue family takes a step,

691
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,450
you can block their next step.

692
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,270
I'm sure the events of the court today

693

must be of your design.

694

I admire you.

695
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,200
I hope the Coming-of-Age Ceremony

696
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:51,120
won't become a disaster again.

697
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,030
I'm sure it won't.

Are you tired?

701
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,630
Do you want some tea?

702
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,120
Why are you suddenly calling me Ning'er?

703
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:16,100
We've discussed it.

704
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,880
Now that we have two Miss Jiang,

705
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,020
it may cause confusion.

706
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,080
So we'll follow Mr. Xie's example

707
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,540
and call you Miss Ning'er.

708

Follow Mr. Xie's example?

709
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,470
Doesn't Mr. Xie usually

710

call you Miss Ning'er?

711
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,200
I know he calls me Ning'er.

712
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,470
So what?

713
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,540
But only he calls you Ning'er.

714

Only him?

715

Look.

Some of us call you Miss Jiang.

719
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,450
Some call you Xuening or Ning.

720
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,630
But only Mr. Xie

721
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,990
calls you Miss Ning'er.

722
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:46,110
It's all just a matter of formality.

723

I bought a fresh fish today.

I also bought a few catties of glutinous rice and a catty of walnuts.

Have you heard about the lesson on the Book of Poems this morning?

My good sister

got more than 20 questions right in one go.

But after I was in danger,

you stopped calling me Miss Jiang

796
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,720
It distinguishes me from the others.

797
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,910
You saw my complications with my family

798

so that I can feel better,

800
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:48,360
right?

801
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,740

It's not easy to really see through someone.

who do you think is better?

810
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,230
Be it the past or the present,

811
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,020
it is all you.

812
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,420
You're the one and only Miss Ning'er.

813
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,090
Besides, the present exists because of the past.

814
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:21,000
Just face it as it is.

815
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,960
But if we have to make it clear,

816
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:25,830
I think

817
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,990
if the present Miss Ning'er

818
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,190
knows what she wants,

819
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:30,760
she will be well.

820
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:33,590
And she'll be even better in the future.

824
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,540
nor so wary of her?

825
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,120
You're willing to get to know me

826
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,780

Thank you, Mr. Xie.

831
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:56,700
Don't worry.

832
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,190
As long as you don't want to kill me,

833
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:00,120
I'll listen to everything you say.

834
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,680
You were gone for so long for a mere qin lesson.

835
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,280
Did Mr. Xie punish you again?

836
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,610
I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you.

837
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,470
Mr. Xie complimented me just now.

838
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:24,290
I will continue to work hard.

839
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,280
I won't disappoint him.

840
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:59,440
Worry all you want, I'm not giving it back.

841
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:04,040
You struck without knowing who the handkerchief

842
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,260
actually belonged to.

843
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,120
You made enemies with Jiang Xuening for no reason,

844
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,980
and now Jiang Xuehui is involved.

845
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,820
So she's the one Jie loves.

846
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,210
I don't even know how to reprimand you.

847

You're right to reprimand me, Aunt.

848
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:16,650
I've let you down.

849
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,490
A few days ago,

850
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,880
His Majesty rejected your father because of the Yan family's matter.

851
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,550
Now,

852
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,770
we need to confirm Jie's title

853
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:25,900
as the Crown Prince as soon as possible

854
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,670
in case something bad happens.

855
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,360
Who is there?

856
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,010
I'll go take a look.

857
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,760
[Yangzhi House]

858
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,690
Hello, Sister Xue.

859
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:07,680
Baoying.

860
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:10,150
Didn't Sister Yao take this with her?

861
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,700
Why is it in your hands now?

862
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,010
Doesn't this sachet belong to Jiang Xuening?

863
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:36,790
Miss Xue.

864
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:40,730
I found this sachet in the Imperial Garden.

865
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:41,850
It looks familiar.

866
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,720
It belongs to you, right?

867
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,140
It is mine.

868
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:47,640
But I've never been to the Imperial Garden.

869
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,270
I know.

870
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,620
Not only that,

871
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,720
I also know

872
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:53,940
Yao Xi left this in the Imperial Garden on purpose

873
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,520
to make the Empress Dowager and I think it was you.

874
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,180
Miss Xue, didn't you and Yao Xi

875
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,760
grow up together?

876
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,700
Aren't you and Elder Miss Jiang siblings?

877
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:04,710
But I asked around.

878
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,670
Not only are you not close,

879
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,620
but you are more like enemies.

880
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,800
Even when she was first chosen as a study partner,

881
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,730
you were the one who took her place.

882
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,980
Miss Jiang, you're a smart person.

883
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,600
It's not fun to beat around the bush

884
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,330
when talking to a smart person.

885
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,110
I was behind the search and seizure of Yangzhi House.

886
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,970
But it was not meant to target you.

887
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,620
I misunderstood you because of a small mistake.

888
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,890
I feel guilty about it.

889
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,100
You must be joking.

890
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,070
Although it was a misunderstanding,

891
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,690
I almost lost my life.

892
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:35,510
I can't afford

893
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,130
to be labeled a rebel.

894
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:39,060
I know you won't forgive me easily.

895
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:42,440
But you will leave the palace sooner or later.

896
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,750
Although I have the advantage over you,

897
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,800
it comes at a heavy cost.

898
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,340
Besides, I still have to deal with your sister.

899
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,340
If I'm willing to show my sincerity,

900
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:53,810
can we let bygones be bygones?

901
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,010
Xi comes from a rich family.

902
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,390
If you go against her,

903
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,280
it'll likely not end well.

904
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:04,710
I don't like having such a petty clown by my side either.

905
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:05,790
It annoys me.

906
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,570
Why don't I

907
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:10,310
teach her a lesson for you

908
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,590
so you can have peace in the future?

909
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,420
Thank you, Miss Xue.

910
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,120
But I don't like

911
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,320
getting others to do the deed for me.

912
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,520
Neither do I have the habit of involving innocent people.

913
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:24,450
I hope you can keep thinking that way.

914
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,040
But my sincerity

915
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,760
will always be there.

I called you here because I have good news for you.

Zhang Zhe's investigation of the rebels was effective.

921
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,400
He has already dug out

922
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,800
a few rebel hideouts in the capital.
