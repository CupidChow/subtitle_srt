1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
As long as I can enter the Ning'an Palace

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,200
and pay all the price

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,600
I will be willing to do so

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,400
The End

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,800
The End

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,800
Everything seems to be a dream

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,400
I have owed a lot of people

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,800
Chaozhe, help me

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,600
I will be a good person after this

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
The End

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
I will be the one to take the throne

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,800
There are some things you can't give me

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
But what about them?

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,000
The life you chose is for Mr. You

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,400
In this world, everyone has the right to escape

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,000
But I can't

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,000
I want to regret it

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,400
and do the wrong thing

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,200
and try my best to return

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Does Mr. Zhang believe that everything is decided?

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I am more willing to believe in the future

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,000
Your Highness

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,800
Your Highness

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,200
The End

26
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,000
Ning'an, what are you doing?

27
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,000
In the Ming Dynasty

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,600
there is a pair of hands

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,600
that can break everything

30
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,400
The revenge is long

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,600
Who are you in the end?

32
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,600
The Emperor of the mortal world is so long

33
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,000
and he is so ridiculous

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,600
and so strong

35
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,600
The End

36
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,200
Yanling, you will be safe

37
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,200
This is the smallest army in the world

38
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,600
If you have this

39
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,200
you will be a emperor

40
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,000
even if you want to be a emperor

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,800
Please have a look at Ning'an

42
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,200
The child doesn't like to eat, doesn't like to eat

43
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,000
and uses the cage-like bone-like

44
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,800
Please have a look at Ning'an

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,800
Thank you, Your Excellency

46
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,600
I have sent hundreds of people

47
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,000
to find this

48
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,600
How did you know?

49
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,000
I have seen it from the beginning

50
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,400
and I know it

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,400
and I will tell the people

52
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,600
to appreciate it

53
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
and appreciate it

54
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,000
Thank you for your words

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,400
I can't believe it

56
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,600
If the seal is on Marquis Yan

57
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,600
why didn't you find it out

58
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,600
when the seal was in the prison?

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,400
The seal is important

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,200
Marquis Yan hid it in the prison

61
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,000
and the seal was not in the prison

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,400
so he couldn't find it

63
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,800
But now Marquis Yan

64
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,800
is deeply impressed by Your Majesty

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,200
so he will tell you the seal

66
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,200
Your Majesty

67
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,600
Now the seal is in the prison

68
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,200
and the seal is safe

69
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,600
Yan family has proved

70
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,000
that the seal is not in the prison

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,600
Marquis Yan has been imprisoned for a long time

72
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,200
so he can't be a emperor

73
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
The Ministry of Justice

74
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,600
has already set a case

75
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,000
but the crime of counter-claim

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,400
is too broad

77
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,600
How can we deal with it?

78
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,400
Please, Your Majesty

79
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,000
Thank you for your thought

80
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,200
Your Majesty

81
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,600
I have been thinking about it

82
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,400
since the ceremony

83
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,200
On the ceremony

84
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,600
Marquis Zhou is back

85
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,200
Marquis Yan is in the prison

86
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,000
Although he hasn't changed

87
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,520
but if he doesn't

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,800
and doesn't force himself to the world

89
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,000
everyone will be in a disarray

90
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,200
Didn't you just say

91
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,800
the seal is the one Yan Mu gave to His Majesty?

92
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,600
I thought that

93
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,200
you believed Yan family

94
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,600
I did

95
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,200
but I was also worried

96
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,600
The letter that the Minister of State Xue gave to His Majesty

97
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,400
is indeed the one Yan Mu wrote

98
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,000
Although he hasn't found the letter

99
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,600
but he is lucky

100
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,600
and the man is not under threat

101
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,000
If Yan family really has a reaction

102
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,800
and the official's position

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
will be ruined by the imperial court

104
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,600
It's reasonable to be honest

105
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,600
Lord Guo

106
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,000
I don't know

107
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,400
how to judge the case

108
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,200
Your Majesty

109
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,600
The case has been solved

110
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,800
and we are guilty

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,600
but we have a clear plan

112
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
Your Majesty

113
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Now that Noble Consort is pregnant

114
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,600
she is a national official

115
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,200
Since you have the will to rule the world

116
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,400
why don't you

117
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,000
take the Yan family as a punishment

118
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,600
and not pursue the nine tribes

119
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,800
as long as Yan Mu and Yan Ling are together

120
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,200
and send the imperial family to the imperial court

121
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,200
The imperial family?

122
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That's right

123
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,000
The emperor of the imperial family is in the north of the country

124
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,200
and he lives in the north of the country

125
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,000
and he lives in the same country with the imperial family

126
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,200
In this way

127
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,800
even if the imperial guards are in trouble

128
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,800
they can't be in the north

129
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,200
Thank you for your consideration

130
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,800
You can do as you wish

131
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Lord Guo

132
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,400
You heard it clearly

133
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,400
I understand

134
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,200
The matter is in the jade palace

135
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,600
Lord Xie said it clearly

136
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,600
Don't you think there is a problem?

137
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
How about this?

138
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,600
Let the student go back to the emperor

139
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,400
You are too stubborn

140
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,000
Today, Lord Xie will find the soldiers

141
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,600
and the imperial guards will be in the imperial palace

142
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,600
You are the one who is in the imperial palace

143
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Lord Xie

144
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,600
you are the one who is in the imperial palace

145
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,600
You are the one who is in the imperial palace

146
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
You are the one who is in the imperial palace

147
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,200
Do you believe it?

148
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,200
It should be the imperial office of Duke Xue

149
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,800
but His Majesty gave it to Xie Wei

150
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,200
Duke Xue turned into something that the imperial family couldn't find

151
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Xie Wei is the one

152
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,800
No matter what method he used

153
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,200
it all shows that His Majesty is in the lower class

154
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,400
and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the emperor is Xie Wei

155
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,400
Yan Shi clearly didn't commit a crime

156
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,000
but he sent people to the imperial palace

157
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,200
to the place of the imperial mausoleum

158
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,600
Xie Wei is not in the right mind

159
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,000
Do you really want to leave him with His Majesty?

160
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,200
I can't remember this

161
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,800
I must catch him to the crime

162
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,000
to convince His Majesty

163
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,000
Hurry up

164
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,400
Put it there

165
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,400
Give it to me

166
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,400
All of you, lock it up

167
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,200
His Majesty ordered to investigate the fall of Noble Consort

168
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,800
to show some of the misdeeds

169
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,800
Yan Zaiyao is the daughter of the imperial mausoleum

170
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,200
who has committed a crime

171
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,800
but is only being punished

172
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,200
You can't go with Miss Jiang Er

173
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,200
She is being driven out of the palace

174
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,600
First, she is in the prison

175
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,600
Now, she is in the prison

176
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,000
It seems that Miss Jiang Er is a person who is a person of the future

177
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,000
No wonder they say that Miss Xue is lucky

178
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,600
Every time she is in the dark

179
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,000
she always has someone else to carry her

180
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,800
Congratulations

181
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,200
You have been hidden for once

182
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,800
As you know, it's me

183
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,000
So what?

184
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,400
Do you have any evidence?

185
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,000
You guys

186
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,600
You guys, put down the things

187
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,800
What are you doing?

188
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,200
I am the daughter of the imperial mausoleum

189
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,800
How dare you?

190
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
Miss Yao

191
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,600
The rules in the palace

192
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,400
are all over the line

193
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,600
If someone is greedy

194
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,400
and takes out the royal household's stuff

195
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,000
I can't afford to take it

196
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
His Majesty just asked Miss Yao to go out of the palace

197
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,400
and didn't order her to be punished

198
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
I will ask the Princess tomorrow

199
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
to see if there are any rules like this

200
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,800
Let's go

201
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,800
You are so fake

202
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,600
Are you happy now?

203
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,000
I was kicked out of the palace like this

204
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I can't take the blame anymore

205
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,600
I thought you could have improved

206
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,200
Don't talk nonsense

207
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,800
What's so good about you?

208
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,400
When the Yan family is sentenced to death

209
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,600
Yan Ling is dead

210
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,800
What do you think?

211
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,200
You worry about me

212
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,400
Why do you think

213
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,200
you will be so weak?

214
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,600
Everything has its cause

215
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,000
It's the same for this time

216
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
Why do you

217
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,240
go to Zhehua to��

218
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,000
You don't change your thought

219
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,580
But there's no weaving

220
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:57,300
You only make す Peninsula

221
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,260
Fe III

222
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,340
Su!

223
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,680
Su!

224
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,040
Su!

225
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,300
I have work better to do before I leave the palace.

226
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,640
Take care of yourself.

227
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,520
I didn't advance to the noble consort.

228
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,860
Why did you need to try so hard to harm me?

229
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,020
Why did you harm me?

230
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,880
What is it?

231
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,380
Stop pretending!

232
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,380
I grew up together.

233
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,380
You don't care about love at all?

234
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,380
Xi,

235
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,380
what did you throw Jiang Xuling's fragrance

236
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,380
in the garden?

237
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,380
You want to use me as a knife

238
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,380
to deal with her?

239
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,380
Let's do it.

240
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,380
So you know everything.

241
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,380
Why didn't you say it?

242
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,380
You've been learning it.

243
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,380
You know many others don't know

244
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,380
what to say

245
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,380
and what not to say.

246
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,380
You want to take over the Noble Consort

247
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,380
and deal with Jiang Xuling

248
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,380
but you don't know

249
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,380
you've had a bigger chance.

250
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,380
I'm not afraid of letting people know

251
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,380
my plan

252
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,380
and I'm not afraid of letting them know

253
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,380
what I've done.

254
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,380
But the fake thing,

255
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,380
the Empress Dowager's thing,

256
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,380
you should have told me.

257
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,380
This time, the whole town

258
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,380
is just being attacked.

259
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,380
You should be at ease.

260
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,380
But if the Noble Consort

261
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,380
really left the palace,

262
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,380
I would have died.

263
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,380
Look,

264
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,380
you've had a chance again.

265
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,380
The Empress Dowager has been waiting for this for a long time.

266
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,380
How could you say that?

267
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,380
You're not smart.

268
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,380
Shut up.

269
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,380
Don't say anything.

270
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,380
Don't let the Minister Yao

271
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,380
get tired of you.

272
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,380
You want to leave the palace?

273
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,380
Why?

274
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,380
But someone bullied you again?

275
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,380
I'm not coming back.

276
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,380
I just have to go out for some business.

277
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,380
It's been raining for several days.

278
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,380
I don't know what's going on.

279
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,380
I want to visit Yier.

280
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,380
Okay.

281
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,380
I'm in a good mood

282
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,380
these days.

283
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,380
I'll go to the imperial court

284
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,380
and ask for your permission.

285
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,380
I'll let you go out for some business.

286
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,380
Speaking of this,

287
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,380
I heard that Prince Ling

288
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,380
was punished for the marriage of Yanling.

289
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,380
How is it now?

290
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,380
Do you still remember

291
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,380
Lord Zhang Zhe and Lord Zhang?

292
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,380
A few days ago,

293
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,380
he gave my second brother an idea.

294
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,380
He asked people to come to the Duke of Ding's palace.

295
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,380
The three of them

296
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,380
asked the Emperor

297
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,380
about the case of Yan family.

298
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,380
You know

299
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,380
my uncle is a martial artist.

300
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,380
He's never told Lord Zhang

301
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,380
that he was angry and lying down all day.

302
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,380
He didn't even eat.

303
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,380
I'm afraid Duke of Ding

304
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,380
will hate Lord Zhang.

305
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,380
Who said it's not true?

306
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,380
I didn't realize it.

307
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,380
Although Lord Zhang is a little older,

308
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,380
he's not as good as he looks.

309
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,380
He's so capable.

310
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,380
Now that he's divorced,

311
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,380
I don't know who can fool him.

312
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,380
You two can come back safely.

313
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,380
I'm relieved.

314
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,380
Fortunately, my son is very wise.

315
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,380
Otherwise,

316
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,380
the little prince wouldn't know

317
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,380
what to do.

318
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,380
Our family now

319
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,380
is more than a family

320
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,380
compared to the emperor.

321
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,380
It's more than a family.

322
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,380
It's so lively these days.

323
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,380
Many people come to our family

324
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,380
to propose to marry.

325
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,380
What's wrong?

326
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,380
Mother,

327
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,380
I don't want to marry for now.

328
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,380
What nonsense are you talking about?

329
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,380
How can a girl

330
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,380
not marry at the age of marriage?

331
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,380
It's okay. Don't worry.

332
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,380
Our family is not

333
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,380
a family that is willing to marry.

334
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,380
The most important thing is to treat you well.

335
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,380
So you must choose a decent person.

336
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,380
It's okay to be low-ranked.

337
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,380
You can come back home

338
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,380
to see your marriage later.

339
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,380
I'm happy.

340
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,380
I think

341
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,380
you're a little different.

342
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,380
I always thought of

343
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,380
finding a good husband

344
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,380
for you two from the top door.

345
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,380
Now I think

346
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,380
you're a little different.

347
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,380
As long as you're a good person.

348
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,380
So many things have happened

349
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,380
in these days.

350
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,380
I'm afraid you're scared.

351
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,380
You're lucky.

352
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,380
But Miss,

353
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,380
although you've done your best

354
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,380
this time,

355
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,380
it's a good thing.

356
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,380
But in her yard,

357
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,380
you're like this now.

358
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,380
You're looking at people with your nose.

359
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,380
Why are you so small-minded?

360
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,380
Jiang Xiu Kui is kind-hearted.

361
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,380
I'm not bad at all.

362
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,380
You're different now.

363
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,380
People are more stable now.

364
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,380
What else?

365
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,380
Do you want to

366
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,380
get rid of

367
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,380
all these trivial things?

368
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,380
Besides,

369
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,380
you're always so strong.

370
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,380
You're not waiting

371
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,380
to be cleaned up, are you?

372
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,380
Miss.

373
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,380
Miss.

374
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,380
Someone came to look for you outside.

375
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,380
He said he's Zhang Zhe.

376
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,380
How come

377
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,380
you're looking for me today?

378
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,380
I'm sorry to bother you.

379
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,380
I wanted to ask you in the palace,

380
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,380
but I went to the palace

381
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,380
and I just found you

382
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,380
were gone.

383
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,380
It's okay.

384
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,380
Mr. Zhang is a benefactor of Xue Ning.

385
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,380
If you have anything to ask,

386
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,380
just tell me.

387
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,380
I saw

388
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,380
Miss Jiang and Miss Xie

389
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,380
were very close in the manor.

390
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,380
To be honest,

391
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,380
I've been

392
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,380
using the internet

393
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,380
to record

394
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,380
Miss Xie's scientific journey.

395
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,380
I found out

396
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,380
she came to the south

397
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,380
four years ago

398
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,380
with you.

399
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,380
I wanted to ask you in person.

400
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,380
Do you really know

401
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,380
Miss Xie's whereabouts?

402
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,380
My father and I

403
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,380
were close

404
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,380
so we got married.

405
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,380
But why did Mr. Zhang

406
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,380
ask her?

407
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,380
His Majesty has already announced

408
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,380
that Marquis Yongyu

409
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,380
and his son Liu Fang were in the royal family.

410
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,380
This is

411
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,380
Miss Xie's idea.

412
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,380
Liu Fang?

413
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,380
How could it be?

414
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,380
The secret has been changed.

415
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,380
Why is it Liu Fang again?

416
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,380
Miss Jiang,

417
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,380
Miss Xie is a kind-hearted person.

418
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,380
I think

419
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,380
she's still

420
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,380
a good person.

421
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,380
Mr. Zhang,

422
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,380
maybe you don't know

423
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,380
that Miss Xie is...

424
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,380
She has

425
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,380
a hard time explaining herself.

426
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,380
But I've come

427
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,380
to know her.

428
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,380
She's not that kind of person.

429
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,380
The one who knows the tiger

430
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,380
is the one

431
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,380
who's aggressive and

432
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,380
unruly.

433
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,380
Miss Jiang,

434
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,380
the tiger is a bit

435
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,380
fierce today.

436
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,380
She's trying to avoid the tiger.

437
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,380
You understand

438
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,380
this point.

439
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,380
Let it go.

440
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,380
Keep it.

441
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,380
You're going to go down

442
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,380
tonight?

443
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,380
Are you sure

444
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,380
you're going to act today?

445
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,380
I have a lot of dreams.

446
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,380
It's better

447
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,380
to deal with this matter

448
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,380
sooner or later.

449
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,380
How's the news about the Wuwei?

450
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,380
Xue Yuan is still

451
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,380
not getting anything

452
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,380
after the investigation.

453
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,380
And Yan family

454
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,380
is just

455
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,380
being released.

456
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,380
They're not willing to take it.

457
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,380
But the court has already

458
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,380
followed your plan

459
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,380
and made a lot of

460
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,380
controversial and controversial

461
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,380
decisions.

462
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,380
Now,

463
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,380
they're not sure

464
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,380
about it.

465
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,380
They're going to deal with

466
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,380
Marquis Yan again.

467
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,380
That's good.

468
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,380
I'm not at home these days.

469
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,380
There's something

470
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,380
that might be delayed.

471
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,380
Take care of it.

472
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,380
I'm just hoping that

473
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,380
before the year ends,

474
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,380
there's nothing else to do.

475
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,380
If you get sick

476
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,380
and get sick like this,

477
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,380
you'll have to get sick sooner or later.

478
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,380
You sent a message

479
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,380
from the people

480
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,380
who were watching the fire.

481
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,380
What?

482
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,380
Did this man

483
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,380
go to the year-end?

484
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,380
Can you think about it?

485
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,380
His plan

486
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,380
has been successful.

487
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,380
Now, the production has increased

488
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,380
by tens of millions.

489
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,380
Many people are chasing

490
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,380
the ball to fight.

491
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,380
First, he's thinking about it.

492
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,380
Then, he's thinking about it.

493
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,380
What's the real

494
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,380
thing

495
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,380
Jiang Xuening is doing?

496
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,380
No one else

497
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,380
can see my business.

498
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,380
He's the first one to do it.

499
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,380
Are you busy today?

500
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,380
I have to ask

501
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,380
this oil-based man

502
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,380
about it.

503
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,380
Where does Jiang Xuening

504
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,380
come from?

505
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,380
How is it?

506
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,380
What did you ask?

507
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,380
I followed your order

508
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,380
and went to the new house

509
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,380
to search for Mr. Zhou in the yard.

510
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,380
Mr. Zhou said

511
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,380
the Yan family

512
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,380
was really betrayed by Liu Fang.

513
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,380
He was going to die a year ago.

514
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,380
How could this happen?

515
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,380
Are you sure

516
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,380
the person who went to the funeral

517
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,380
is Xianwei?

518
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,380
This...

519
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,380
Miss,

520
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,380
this matter is very clear.

521
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,380
The head of the front yard

522
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,380
is very clear.

523
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,380
We can't let him

524
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,380
go to the funeral.

525
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,380
We can't let him go.

526
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,380
The head of the front yard

527
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,380
is often served by the master.

528
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,380
He told me personally

529
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,380
that all the cases are spread now.

530
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,380
The last time

531
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,380
Mr. Xie went to the Marquis's Mansion

532
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,380
to be the official,

533
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,380
he just wanted to help the emperor

534
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,380
to find the Xia Luo of the Manor.

535
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,380
After I became the empress,

536
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,380
I wanted to let Shen Jie

537
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,380
rescue Yan Ling.

538
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,380
But he was already in the imperial palace

539
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,380
and was unable to get off the throne.

540
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,380
He was in the wrong.

541
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,380
When Xianwei was in the palace

542
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,380
and was in a mess,

543
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,380
I wonder how he

544
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,380
got involved with Yan Ling.

545
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,380
Did Yan Ling become a thief?

546
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,380
It was all planned by Xianwei.

547
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,380
That's why

548
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,380
he purposely asked her to go to the imperial palace.

549
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,380
Miss,

550
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,380
the imperial decree is now in place.

551
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,380
Everything has been decided.

552
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,380
You'd better think of something.

553
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,380
How can I think of anything?

554
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,380
I spent so much effort

555
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,380
to change this ending.

556
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,380
Xianwei,

557
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,380
how could he lie to me?

558
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,380
Miss! Miss!

559
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,380
Miss!

560
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,380
Miss!

561
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,380
It's snowing outside. Where are you going?

562
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,380
I'll go and ask around.

563
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,380
Miss!

564
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,380
Sir.

565
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,380
You're not welcome to the imperial palace.

566
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,380
You may leave.

567
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,380
Don't let others

568
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,380
disturb us by drinking tea.

569
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,380
This...

570
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,380
Yes.

571
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,380
An respectively person?

572
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,380
Say whatever you want.

573
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,380
Who will change it up

574
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,380
for anらlien?

575
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,380
Keep an eye on him.

576
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,380
Everything is well.

577
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,380
Keep an eye on him.

578
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,380
Just wait till I know

579
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:11,380
Who even with you …

580
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:17,660
Don't ask why did you get out of this?

581
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,980
I ride the horse.

582
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:27,180
The more I ride the horse, the narrower myido warps.

583
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,780
Enough in your talk, Castellan.

584
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,420
How much did we waste?

585
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,140
That's why we set up a branch in Tongzhou.

586
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,380
How many people were left?

587
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,340
That's why we sent Yan's army.

588
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,420
But all of this...

589
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,060
You ruined it all.

590
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,620
You're not the Xie Shao Shi of the court.

591
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,580
You're the mastermind of Jinling.

592
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,300
Don't forget

593
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,580
who killed you and left you behind.

594
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,460
Who...

595
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,540
has kept you alive?

596
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,540
Now this all is yours.

597
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,100
Take it back to the imperial town.

598
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:08,700
Take it back to the imperial town!

599
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,060
No!

600
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,100
I never saw that.

601
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,780
Four years ago, Shangjing...

602
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,780
was destroyed by the Xue clan.

603
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,780
This day,

604
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,780
I haven't changed.

605
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,780
But you've thought about it.

606
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,780
If Tongzhou really turns out to be a change,

607
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,780
how many innocent people will die because of it?

608
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,780
Then what?

609
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,780
Wei Cheng is a great man.

610
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,780
What can these people who are not enough to fight for him,

611
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,780
even count as?

612
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,780
We all killed him!

613
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,780
Wei Cheng!

614
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,780
In this mess,

615
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,780
the Holy Man can only be a useless person.

616
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:16,780
Only the weak can be the father of the world!

617
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,780
Since you started this path, you can't go back.

618
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,780
You helped Yan Mu,

619
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,780
but you dare to let him know

620
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,780
that you did those things for the king?

621
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,780
You don't want to be my useless person,

622
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,780
but the king can tell the court your identity anytime.

623
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,780
At that time, how can you be the leader?

624
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,780
You thought you were standing at the top of the mountain to do everything?

625
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,780
But all of this is just a waste of time.

626
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,780
You can't be the father of the world!

627
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,780
I can give you another chance.

628
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,780
Don't interfere with the affairs in the capital.

629
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,780
As for the king...

630
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,780
You...

631
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,780
Where did you take Mr. Gong Yi?

632
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,780
Why are you in a hurry?

633
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,780
You can see him very soon.

634
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,780
Brothers, fight him!

635
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,780
Brother!

636
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,780
You're right.

637
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,780
The Holy Man is a big deal.

638
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,780
What the world wants is to be a hero.

639
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,780
People who follow the rules

640
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:49,780
will go to the south.

641
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,780
Don't follow the rules.

642
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,780
What others can do

643
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,780
can be done by me.

644
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,780
Don't worry.

645
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,780
You're the only one who can do it.

646
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,780
I won't let you go!

647
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,780
Those people in the capital

648
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,780
will come back to you sooner or later.

649
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,580
General.

650
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:10,620
We can do this with both Close

651
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:16,780
Now, the victim can go to prison.

652
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,780
Xiao.

653
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,780
Don't get on my shoulders.

654
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,780
It's fine.

655
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,400
Bye.

656
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,660
That's right.

657
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,180
Xiu,

658
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,380
linked together,

659
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,340
they can both rebel.

660
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,700
Similarly,

661
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,640
a girl knows

662
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,260
that she.

663
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,180
Cleared the trap for Xiu.

664
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,620
So we have a good pair together.

665
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,700
We can make any pair.

666
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,940
I need to make an excuse.

667
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,140
I don't want to trick her.

668
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,500
Xiu.

669
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,900
Yeah.

670
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,140
What's your .

671
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,140
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away with it.

672
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,140
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away with it.

673
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,140
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away with it.

674
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,140
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away with it.

675
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,140
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away with it.

676
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,140
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away with it.

677
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,140
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away with it.

678
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,140
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away with it.

679
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,140
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away with it.

680
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,140
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away with it.

681
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,140
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away with it.

682
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,140
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away with it.

683
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,140
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away with it.

684
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,140
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away with it.

685
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,140
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away with it.

686
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,140
Hua Je et좀

687
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,420
I

688
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,980
I

689
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,080
I

690
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,280
Into the

691
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,260
What's this?

692
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,140
Princess incubation.

693
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,060
Who's the one who made you come?

694
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,540
Master.

695
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,860
The rock Doctor makes is...

696
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:21,980
Get out.

697
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,780
Get out!

698
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,900
Get out!

699
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,340
Let's move on!

700
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:30,940
I'm sorry.

701
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,500
Let's move on!

702
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,620
Above,

703
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,180
cut it off.

704
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,580
Okay.

705
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,800
Hurry!

706
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,760
Master!

707
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,740
Are you all right?

708
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,740
Take care, sir.

709
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,960
Master, we're getting there.

710
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,580
Jin Shisan, what should we do?

711
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,580
Although Jin Shisan can keep her innocence,

712
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,580
she can even threaten the life of a lifeguard.

713
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,580
She can't use this medicine.

714
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,580
Take it!

715
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,580
The wound on the previous day is so deep.

716
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,580
What if she can't play the piano anymore?

717
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,580
What about the medicine?

718
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,580
I know what I can do.

719
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,580
I know what I can do.

720
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,580
Miss, what's wrong with you?

721
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:26,580
Why did you become like this after you went to the Young Master's manor?

722
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,580
It's okay.

723
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,580
You can leave.

724
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,580
I want to stay alone for a while.

725
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,580
The smoke is still being released.

726
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,580
The evil spirit is still the criminal who killed the manor.

727
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,580
I've tried so hard to get rid of him.

728
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,580
But everything will never change.

729
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,580
What should I do?

730
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,580
Miss Jiang, why are you here?

731
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,580
Young Master, Yan Ling is innocent.

732
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,580
Please save her.

733
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,580
Just let her live.

734
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,580
I know.

735
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,580
But she is my best friend.

736
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,580
The only one who hasn't lied to me is you.

737
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,580
In the capital, everyone is a good friend.

738
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,580
Everyone is doing their own thing.

739
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,580
But Yan Ling never passed.

740
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,580
Why did you have to let her bear the war?

741
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,580
Why did I come back so easily?

742
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,580
I changed everything.

743
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,580
And everything went back to the original point.

744
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,580
Why didn't I even make a good person

745
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:35,580
and make up for her?

746
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,580
I didn't even have the chance to make up for her.

747
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,580
I'm sorry.

748
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,580
I should say that I'm the one who should be sorry.

749
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,580
I'm just angry with myself.

750
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,580
I shouldn't have been angry with you

751
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,580
in this unfair world.

752
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:00,580
Actually, this matter has nothing to do with you.

753
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,580
I shouldn't have come to find you.

754
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,580
Miss Jiang and Master Yan grew up together.

755
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,580
Your friend is about to leave the place of suffering.

756
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,580
You're so sad and also in love.

757
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,580
I know.

758
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,580
The result is the result.

759
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,580
I can only accept it.

760
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,580
Thank you, Master Zhang.

761
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,580
I'll go back first.

762
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,580
Miss Jiang.

763
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,580
The Marquis's Mansion is closed.

764
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,580
But I'll find out the truth.

765
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,580
If something happens,

766
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,580
I'll find out the truth and go back.

767
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,580
I believe you.

768
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,580
Sir.

769
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,580
Jiang said that Miss Jiang left the house early.

770
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,580
She's not in the house now.

771
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,580
Sir, you're not feeling well.

772
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,580
Let's go back to the mansion.

773
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,580
Go to the old bridge.

774
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,580
Maybe it's there.

775
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,580
Yes.

776
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,580
The weather is getting cold.

777
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,580
This is the winter clothes for you.

778
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,580
If you need anything else, just go to Master Zhou's house.

779
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,580
Don't waste your time.

780
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,580
I don't need anything.

781
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,580
The boss often gives me things.

782
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,580
Miss, you're not in the right mood today.

783
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,580
Did something happen?

784
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,580
You can see it.

785
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,580
I heard from Master Zhou that

786
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,580
the court sent the Yan Prince to stay.

787
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,580
But for this matter...

788
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,580
I wanted to go to see Yan Ling today.

789
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,580
But she was so stubborn.

790
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,580
She was so impulsive.

791
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,580
Fang Yi.

792
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,580
I really think I'm incompetent.

793
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,580
The self-discipline in the past

794
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:48,580
seems to be a joke now.

795
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,580
I thought I could save Yan Ling.

796
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,580
But in the end, it's still the result.

797
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,580
I thought I helped you to escape the suffering.

798
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:00,580
I just locked you up in another prison.

799
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:03,580
No, no, no. Fang Yi likes the life now.

800
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,580
If it weren't for you,

801
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,580
I might have died in the You family.

802
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,580
Look at me now.

803
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,580
I've learned how to calculate and do business.

804
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,580
I've also made friends.

805
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,580
You brought all of these to me.

806
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,580
You changed all of this.

807
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,580
I'm not a good reader.

808
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,580
I don't know how to say something reasonable.

809
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,580
But my mother once told me

810
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,580
that life is like a matter of life.

811
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,580
The result is always the same.

812
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,580
But the process is always different.

813
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,580
Fang Yi is the happiest person

814
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,580
to meet you.

815
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,580
Just like Yan Ling.

816
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:41,580
She was still released in time.

817
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,580
But this time, the process is different.

818
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,580
She won't leave that path again.

819
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,580
I don't understand what you're saying.

820
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,580
But look at me.

821
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,580
Although I'm still here,

822
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,580
I'm not as smart as you.

823
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,580
But I'm different from before.

824
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,580
Am I?

825
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,580
Mr. Xie.

826
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,580
Mr. Xie.

827
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,580
You're here to see Miss Jiang, right?

828
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,580
I'll take my leave then.

829
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,580
Take care.

830
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,580
I haven't gone to find you.

831
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,580
You came to me by yourself.

832
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,580
You have something to say to me.

833
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,580
I have nothing to say to you.

834
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,580
But don't you think

835
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,580
I owe you an explanation?

836
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,580
I didn't expect you to come back last night.

837
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,580
I mean Yan Ling.

838
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,580
If I don't go,

839
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,580
when will you tell me

840
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,580
that you're the one who saved Yan Ling

841
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,580
and pushed her to stay?

842
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,580
If you're here to threaten me,

843
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,580
I'm not interested in your secret.

844
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,580
I don't want to tell others.

845
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,580
If you promise me before you go,

846
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,580
and save Yan Ling,

847
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,580
we'll see

848
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,580
what happens.

849
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,580
Miss Jiang Er.

850
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,580
Do you have any conscience?

851
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,580
You won't know what happened to you.

852
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,580
If you didn't break into her,

853
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,580
why did she hurt herself?

854
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,580
She came out to find you today.

855
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,580
Stop.

856
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,580
Ling Er.

857
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,580
If you really care about Yan Ling,

858
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:27,580
and want to know the future of Yan's family,

859
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,580
come with me.

860
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,580
Last night,

861
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,580
I won't mention it to anyone.

862
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,580
Don't worry.

863
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,580
The person who died last night is Gong Yi Cheng.

864
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,580
He's a model of the Imperial Guards in the south.

865
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,580
In the imperial court,

866
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,580
the imperial guards are in the imperial palace.

867
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,580
The Marquis is poisoned by the Marquis.

868
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,580
He's a secret agent.

869
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,580
He's a soldier of the Tongzhou Army.

870
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,580
He's the one who did it.

871
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,580
If he doesn't get rid of it,

872
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,580
I'll take the blame for Yan's family's troubles.

873
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,580
I'll handle it.

874
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,580
When Yan's family was released,

875
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,580
I was the one who was involved in the case.

876
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:23,580
I was the one who was responsible for the military power.

877
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,580
But it wasn't what you thought.

878
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,580
Yan's family was in the capital.

879
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,580
They were facing internal and external troubles.

880
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,580
They couldn't change the situation at all.

881
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:35,580
Only by breaking into the family

882
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,580
can I break into this area.

883
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,580
Do you know where the imperial palace is?

884
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,580
Do you know?

885
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:46,580
The wind and the sun are always cold.

886
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:49,580
And the danger of the Great Moon people being killed at any time.

887
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,580
If Yan Lin goes to that place,

888
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,580
he'll be crazy.

889
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,580
I know.

890
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,580
If the sword is sealed and the magic power is out,

891
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,580
if it can stop this,

892
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,580
it can really become the general of the Zhu Lu Si Feng.

893
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,580
If you're telling the truth,

894
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,580
why can't you tell me in advance?

895
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,580
You asked me many times.

896
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,580
What's the relationship between me and Yong Yi's Mansion?

897
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,580
Do you have an answer?

898
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,580
I guess a little.

899
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,580
Guess what?

900
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,580
Every time you go down the snow, you'll be out of control.

901
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,580
Only those who have experienced the danger of life and death

902
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,580
will be infected with this disease.

903
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,580
When you're born,

904
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,580
you'll be a noble family member.

905
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,580
Where will you go to experience those?

906
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,580
Besides, the capital is difficult.

907
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,580
You can never go down.

908
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,580
There are always miracles in this.

909
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,580
So?

910
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,580
When the imperial decree was issued last time,

911
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:45,580
I heard you and that eunuch mention Gong Yi Cheng.

912
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:48,580
It means you have a relationship with the rebel party.

913
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,580
You have the power to build a sword and sword,

914
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,580
and the ability to travel.

915
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:56,580
In a short time, you'll be able to have faith in the emperor.

916
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,580
You'll be able to hold a war.

917
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:02,580
So your identity must be fake.

918
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,580
Why are you laughing?

919
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,580
From the start of the palace,

920
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,580
I was watching you, and you were watching me.

921
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:15,580
We already know each other the best.

922
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,580
But someone told me that

923
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,580
everything I have now

924
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:22,580
is a long and long journey.

925
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,580
But it doesn't seem like that now.

926
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:28,580
You know everything about it.

927
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,580
But you still believe me.

928
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,580
That's enough.

929
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,580
I told you in a short time.

930
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,580
I still believe you.

931
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,580
You can even get injured by the illness.

932
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,580
How can I believe you?

933
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:43,580
Next time, don't go into my body.

934
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,580
Ling'er,

935
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:50,580
I don't want to regret it.

936
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,580
Don't worry.

937
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,580
I'll keep away from you

938
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,580
from Yanling's matter.

939
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,580
Father.

940
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,580
Why are you here today?

941
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,580
I have something to ask you.

942
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,580
Oh?

943
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,580
These are the things

944
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,580
Yanling gave me as a gift.

945
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,580
I've been talking about it all year.

946
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,580
Now that Yan's family is in trouble,

947
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,580
I'm thinking about

948
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,580
taking them out to sell them

949
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,580
and making money.

950
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,580
I'm afraid that Yanling will be in trouble.

951
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,580
I'm afraid that Yanling will be in trouble.

952
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,580
I have to use it to cook the hueh to buy some dishes.

953
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,580
It would be any solution if he asks for them,

954
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:40,580
and you treat me to the bad magic in Yanling Village.

955
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,580
That thing is quite nothing.

956
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:50,580
If we treat it too badly,

957
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:53,580
we will surely meet troubles.

958
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,580
I'm afraid that

959
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:57,580
you might scream into the relief.

960
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,580
People aren't inBut what power does this thing mean?

961
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,580
It's not a good thing to confuse your family now.

962
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,580
I'm afraid it's also a matter of time.

963
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,540
How about this?

964
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:09,860
Tomorrow, I'll let the管dome

965
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,660
pick some unsealed and printed ones

966
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,780
to sell them out.

967
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,580
Then, some of the precious ones

968
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,580
will be put in our store.

969
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,860
We'll get some cash from our account first.

970
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,860
This will make things faster.

971
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,340
This is not a small sum.

972
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,260
His family is an old family.

973
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,980
Although there are some things

974
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,580
that my father has done,

975
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:35,580
but I have to help him.

976
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,500
Moreover,

977
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,300
this is what I want to do.

978
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:45,300
I must support this father.

979
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:01,620
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
