1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
As long as I can enter the Ning'an Palace

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,200
and pay all the price

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,600
I will be willing to do my best

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,400
The End

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,800
The End

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,800
Everything seems to be a dream

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,400
I have owed a lot of people

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,800
Chaozhe, help me

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,600
I will be a good person after this

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
The End

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
I will be the one to take the favor

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,800
There are some things you can't give me

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
But what about them?

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,000
The life you chose is for Mr. You

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,400
In this world, everyone has the right to escape

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,000
But I can't

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,000
I want to regret it

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,400
and do the wrong thing

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,200
and try my best to return

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Does Mr. Zhang believe that everything is decided?

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I am more willing to believe in the future

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,000
Your Highness

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,800
Your Highness

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,200
The End

26
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,000
Ning'an, what are you doing?

27
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,000
In the Ming Dynasty

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,600
there was always a pair of invisible hands

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,600
to break everything back to the original position

30
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,400
The revenge is long and the wish is long

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,600
Who are you in the end?

32
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,600
The Emperor of the mortal world is so long

33
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,000
and he is so ridiculous

34
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,360
They alltid�

35
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,000
The End

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,880
Do you want to vote?

37
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,440
Zeng Li weighs 60 to 70kg.

38
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,800
Now it will be 19kg.

39
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,160
15kg,

40
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,740
children's weight fairies хорошing.

41
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,100
You all should wait a little bit.

42
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,740
I'll be waiting.

43
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,160
W pseudo,

44
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,000
do you dare to tend to children,

45
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,240
my lord?

46
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,860
I've tried.

47
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,580
Princess is talented.

48
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,540
She is the most important pearl of the world.

49
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,060
What's your opinion?

50
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,140
I don't deserve to be a daughter.

51
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,780
I thought Yan Lin would like it.

52
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,580
I didn't expect it to be so hypocritical.

53
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,660
No.

54
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,860
If it goes on like this,

55
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,180
I'm afraid Shen Zhi Yi will hate me.

56
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,420
I'm truly sorry.

57
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,740
I'mOS,

58
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,180
but why did you not laugh at me?

59
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,620
King, we've sold them.

60
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,300
Your Highness.

61
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,260
You've returned?

62
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,540
I wanted to see your splendid face.

63
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,540
Come.

64
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,540
Come.

65
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,540
Don't eat too much.

66
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,540
The baby is still in the baby's room.

67
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,540
She's still in the room.

68
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,540
She's still in the room.

69
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,540
The baby is still in the room.

70
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,540
This is the baby's room.

71
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,540
Let's go to the room.

72
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,540
This is the baby's room.

73
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,540
This is so beautiful.

74
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,540
This is so beautiful.

75
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,540
This is so beautiful.

76
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,540
This is so beautiful.

77
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,540
This is so beautiful.

78
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,540
This is so beautiful.

79
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,540
This doctor is really a good doctor.

80
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,540
Fortunately, he's not in a bad mood today.

81
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,540
He won't fall into the trap again.

82
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,540
He's so beautiful.

83
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,540
He's so beautiful.

84
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,540
He's so beautiful.

85
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,540
Some scars.

86
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,540
If you care too much about the person in front of you,

87
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,540
you'll be punished for being so soft.

88
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,540
You can use your knife to hurt the person in front of you.

89
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,540
But if you care about the person in front of you,

90
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,540
you don't care about the person in front of you.

91
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,540
You don't know the shortcoming of the person in front of you.

92
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,540
You can't hurt the person in front of you.

93
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,540
Your scar is left in the mess of the King of Pingnan in the 1920s.

94
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,540
The rebel army has been defeated long ago.

95
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,540
The evil spirit is also a common thing.

96
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,540
The imperial court is in danger.

97
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,540
Your scar is the glory of the royal court.

98
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,540
Why do you keep it?

99
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,540
Is this familiar look?

100
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,540
Its U Having Outits

101
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,540
Couldn't let you like your esteemed business.

102
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,540
No wonder Y Es wont appreciate you.

103
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,540
It neither good nor evil but I can't help you.

104
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,540
I'm done with Lying in the wilderness.

105
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,540
Forgive me, your highness.

106
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,540
We should stop.

107
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,540
Didn't we said please go home yourself.

108
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,540
Auntie is still waiting for you in the mansion.

109
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,620
That's right.

110
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,300
It's not good for you to be here today.

111
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,620
I'll come to play with you another day.

112
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,540
Greetings, Your Highness.

113
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,460
It's not good for you to be here another day.

114
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,100
You're so naughty.

115
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,180
Miss.

116
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,180
You're so good at acting.

117
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,580
You scared me to death.

118
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,940
My mouth...

119
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,980
You're hurting me badly.

120
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,660
Madame Shao Shi, glad to see you.

121
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,340
The late Prince already did a miss.

122
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,700
My lord is really admirable.

123
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,220
Why do you need to be so modest?

124
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,420
The case of the rebel king of Pingnan is a hot-headed mountain jade.

125
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,300
Now the Ministry of Justice has taken the power of the new Wu Wei.

126
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,700
Isn't this the face of the State?

127
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,580
Your Excellency, you're joking.

128
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,180
Isn't it just the rebel king who was arrested by a few?

129
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,860
It's not difficult for the Ministry of Justice.

130
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,660
Your Excellency, don't pretend to be silly.

131
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,700
Who knows that Duke Xue has arrested the military officials of Yan family

132
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,140
to investigate the crimes of the rebel king of the State in the head of Yan family.

133
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,980
Now that the people have arrived at the Ministry of Justice,

134
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,900
how should I interrogate them?

135
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,620
How should I interrogate them?

136
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,940
How should I interrogate them?

137
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,380
If you interrogate them, wouldn't you offend Yan family?

138
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,220
If you can't, you'll offend the Xue family.

139
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,540
You're still a criminal who's been in front of His Majesty.

140
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,340
You're both not good.

141
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,820
His Majesty is now angry.

142
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,660
He's easily guilty.

143
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,020
Only His Excellency trusts him the most.

144
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,300
Please give him a lesson.

145
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,300
Minister Chen,

146
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,820
the Ministry of Justice is the oldest.

147
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,660
You're just a father.

148
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,900
Why are you afraid of me?

149
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,060
What you mean is...

150
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,260
The rebel king who was arrested is a criminal.

151
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,140
But the rebel king is always cunning.

152
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,380
Even if he can't get the result,

153
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,940
it's normal.

154
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,740
Besides, even if he can't get the result,

155
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,340
others will be in charge of the court.

156
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,580
In the meantime,

157
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,860
the Ministry of Justice is punished by Zhang Zhe.

158
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,260
Minister Chen, why are you worried?

159
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,340
Thank you, Minister Chen.

160
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,340
I'll take my leave.

161
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,860
Sir, you can take a break.

162
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,340
You can't take a break.

163
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,300
I'm afraid Yan family will find out sooner or later.

164
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,660
Do you think Marquis Yan will collude with you?

165
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,940
Of course not.

166
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,420
Marquis Yan is a loyal official. He won't do that.

167
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,500
Even if it's not Chen Ying,

168
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,460
there will be others.

169
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,580
As long as His Majesty wants to lose Yan family,

170
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,020
he will lose Yan family sooner or later.

171
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,380
Oh.

172
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,460
Sir, your order is here.

173
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,620
Where did we order it from?

174
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,140
That man just ordered it from you.

175
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,780
Wait.

176
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,620
Wait.

177
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,380
Wake up.

178
00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:22,820
【The

179
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,380
Go!

180
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,460
Don't move!

181
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,620
Let's kill her!

182
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:39,980
Miss Nian?

183
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,620
She's nervous to be consequences.

184
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,340
I mustn't go there

185
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,820
on the tiny troops of easy labor.

186
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,820
Xie… Xie Dairou is in a pot of safe water!

187
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,940
I don't know who is in charge of the palace.

188
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,580
I just passed by this place.

189
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,860
Please don't be impulsive.

190
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,020
I can give you all the money.

191
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:57,540
Shut up.

192
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,220
Miss Ning'er is grateful to you.

193
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,500
She is a savior.

194
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,300
And her father is close to me.

195
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,620
Since you are not satisfied with my heart,

196
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,900
why do you hurt Wugu?

197
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,100
Listen up.

198
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,700
You are the emperor of the dog court.

199
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,780
You hurt me a lot.

200
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,540
Are you not hurt by Wugu?

201
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,340
You are indeed a man of peace.

202
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,980
I am so unlucky.

203
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,220
Why did I meet him several times?

204
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,900
Xie Wei is cold-blooded and ruthless.

205
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,860
I just want to test him.

206
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,460
I am afraid he will not live up to my life.

207
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,660
King Pingnan's power is not in the capital.

208
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,700
But today,

209
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,060
Xie Wei has been in the capital for several times.

210
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,540
Is there anyone in the court who is in charge of the palace?

211
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,380
And secretly instigated the leader of the Maoist Party to force the Marquis's Mansion.

212
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,380
What do you want?

213
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,660
Xie Wei,

214
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,740
when is the time?

215
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,140
You still want to take the rebellion?

216
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,620
I am envious of taking the rebellion

217
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,980
between the people of Jiuwen.

218
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,660
Of course, I choose to wait.

219
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,740
I don't want to die here.

220
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,980
If you are willing to let go of that girl,

221
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,100
Xie Wei can ask someone to take the rebellion.

222
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,340
Open the gate and send the rebellion to Anran.

223
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,500
Do you think so?

224
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,660
Xie Wei is so kind.

225
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,100
If you want to save his life,

226
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,500
you can change it yourself.

227
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,380
I think you are better off in the capital.

228
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,500
Otherwise, I will kill him now.

229
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,340
Doctor, doctor, you...

230
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,700
I...

231
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,980
I can give you a condition.

232
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,140
He is the crown prince of the court.

233
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:18,980
He will do it for me.

234
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,700
Stop talking.

235
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,500
I will tell you the truth.

236
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,420
If you still don't think it through,

237
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,340
No need to tell me.

238
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,300
Please send him here.

239
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,060
I will do it.

240
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,740
He is willing to save me?

241
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:32,980
No way.

242
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,260
Xie Wei is not a person with a plan.

243
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,300
He can't escape from the rebellion.

244
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,340
He must...

245
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,700
He must be waiting.

246
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,180
Oh, no.

247
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,460
Xie Wei is really not my type.

248
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,220
He doesn't want to kill the girl

249
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,260
and kill her.

250
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,620
Can't believe you.

251
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,580
No wonder I have lost everything.

252
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,140
Bai Xiao Xu,

253
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,680
This is Launch Clan.

254
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,380
This is the Cond allí Sang Moh.

255
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,860
This status has beenskined by warrantier labor leaders.

256
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,020
One,

257
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,380
Duke of Xianjing wants an assortment of helper arapeides.

258
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,580
Don't worry about it.

259
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:19,820
Yes, sir.

260
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,380
You can't sleep.

261
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,380
My mother said that you can't wake up.

262
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,380
You can't sleep.

263
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,380
Wake up.

264
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,380
Please.

265
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,380
I'll take you to a very remote place.

266
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,380
I can't take you.

267
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,380
Let go.

268
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,380
I'll take you to a remote place.

269
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,380
Don't worry about it.

270
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,380
I'll take you to a remote place.

271
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,380
I'm going to die.

272
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,380
Don't worry about me.

273
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,380
You don't deserve to be a living man.

274
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,380
A living man.

275
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,380
I'm afraid I'm too bold.

276
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,580
It's a pity that I used the wrong place.

277
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,180
Come with me.

278
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,380
What a pity that you have such a good heart.

279
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,380
I just made Miss Ning'er lose her mind.

280
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,380
What do you mean?

281
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,380
I'm lucky to have you.

282
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,380
I know you must have a way to save her.

283
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,380
So I'm glad.

284
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,380
Really?

285
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,380
I didn't know what you were saying.

286
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:38,380
You didn't want to get involved with me.

287
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,380
I was too bold?

288
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,380
The assassin asked me.

289
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,380
I was too bold.

290
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,380
I was afraid that you would be in trouble.

291
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,380
So I can only say it out.

292
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,380
Did Xue Ning say something wrong?

293
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:53,380
Usually, you use this trick to trick Yan Ling.

294
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,380
I don't know what you're talking about.

295
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,380
You were smart just now.

296
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,380
You know everything.

297
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,380
I was so scared just now.

298
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,380
I didn't hear anything.

299
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:07,380
I didn't understand what the King of Pingnan and the Nidang were.

300
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,380
Please let me go home.

301
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,380
I promise I won't mention it again.

302
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,380
Okay?

303
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,380
Yan Ling is my disciple.

304
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,380
It's hard to break the promise.

305
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,380
Ning'er, you're a smart person.

306
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,380
You know that you're not a good person.

307
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,380
If you're not, you can't be a good person.

308
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,380
If you really like him, you shouldn't have lied to him.

309
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,380
If you don't like him, you don't need to be in trouble.

310
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,380
I'm not a good person.

311
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,380
I'm not a good person.

312
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,380
My disciple is a mysterious, not dumb person.

313
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,380
I trust you.

314
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,380
It's okay that you don't trust someone else.

315
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,380
Leave some reason for him.

316
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,380
It's wrong to do anything for him.

317
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,380
Bye.

318
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,380
Wait for me.

319
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,380
Let me alone.

320
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,380
My friend VIN civilized her actions.

321
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,940
You will really kill me

322
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,900
if you kill that assassin.

323
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,340
You will change your mind.

324
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,420
What do you think?

325
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,540
Since you know I want to kill you,

326
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,100
I should know

327
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:23,820
what to do and what not to do.

328
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,780
Uncle.

329
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,660
Sir.

330
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,940
Lord Yan is in the street.

331
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,140
He is going to break in.

332
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,980
We really can't stop him.

333
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,060
What's wrong?

334
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,620
It's nothing.

335
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,340
Send Ning'er and her to the street.

336
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,460
Yes.

337
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:54,980
I've asked.

338
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,900
Lord Yan has indeed

339
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,020
asked Miss Jiang here.

340
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,460
The assassin is buried

341
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,740
in the city.

342
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,940
It's all a coincidence.

343
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,060
Well...

344
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:04,900
Shuang.

345
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,740
The architecture wants to know.

346
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,100
Sir.

347
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,420
Why don't you explain to Miss Jiang?

348
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,380
You don't want to kill her.

349
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,700
She is afraid of me?

350
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,740
I dare not do anything.

351
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,500
Ningning.

352
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,340
Ningning, you scared me.

353
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,140
They told me.

354
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,060
I didn't expect

355
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,660
that the day of the day

356
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,860
can also meet the assassin of the rebel party.

357
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,220
Are you okay?

358
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,420
Don't worry.

359
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,540
I'm fine.

360
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,700
Don't be afraid.

361
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:43,820
I'm here.

362
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,660
I can't hurt you anymore.

363
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:46,980
It's my fault.

364
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,500
I shouldn't have

365
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,620
given the people in the manor

366
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,420
and let you

367
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,380
wait for me in the alley alone.

368
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,820
I wouldn't have met the assassin.

369
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,380
I'm not afraid of the assassin.

370
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,100
Yan Li.

371
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,500
I don't know

372
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,060
you and Lord Xie are so close.

373
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,020
Mr. Xie is the crown prince.

374
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,740
He is close to us.

375
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,180
But if he is so close,

376
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:05,980
he can't talk.

377
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,540
What's wrong?

378
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,300
But he is hard on you.

379
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,340
Their relationship

380
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,740
will never be so simple.

381
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,860
But Lord Xie is not

382
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,260
the enemy of the rebel party.

383
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,020
It's a good news.

384
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,020
Don't think about these things.

385
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,020
Didn't you say

386
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,100
you want to take me to the lantern party?

387
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:31,780
Let's go.

388
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,220
But you just got scared.

389
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,580
It's the same tomorrow.

390
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,100
No.

391
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,500
I want to go.

392
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,100
But you said you want to go.

393
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,940
But Tang Er...

394
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,500
I've made up my mind

395
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,260
with the car.

396
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,420
Don't let anyone

397
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,380
disturb your temper tonight.

398
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:46,940
Let's go.

399
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,260
Come on!

400
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,340
Watch.

401
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,180
I didn't lie.

402
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,180
It's so hot this year.

403
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,180
This is the soup I mentioned earlier.

404
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:47,180
You two, just look. It's all just made.

405
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,180
This is it.

406
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,180
Thank you.

407
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,180
Congratulations. You got it right.

408
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,180
There's a rice bowl over there.

409
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,180
Congratulations.

410
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,180
Congratulations.

411
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,180
Good.

412
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,180
Next question.

413
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,180
Which word is the word?

414
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,180
Open it.

415
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,180
The word is right.

416
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,180
I know.

417
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,180
Heng.

418
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,180
Correct.

419
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,180
Great.

420
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,180
Great.

421
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,180
Come on.

422
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,180
Open it.

423
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,180
Next question.

424
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,180
What is it?

425
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,180
What's wrong?

426
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,180
Let's go, let's go.

427
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,180
I'm coming.

428
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,180
I'm so afraid.

429
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,180
A very punishment.

430
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,180
Good.

431
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,180
You won.

432
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,180
We won.

433
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,180
I am giving you this ball.

434
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,300
No, no!

435
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,800
Is this gum?

436
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,000
Young master So butcher.

437
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,560
We just found out lard in Suzhou two days ago.

438
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,980
That's some hard work.

439
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,680
Why haven't people uithält it been while in the company?

440
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,060
How could challenge it in Suzhou?

441
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,720
There is no immediate yield in 8ι ligths.

442
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,560
I am suspicious about the work of the Xiaomi.

443
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,500
It's somebody else's god,

444
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,800
but they didn't come from Suzhou.

445
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,720
Please.

446
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,720
I'll take you to the market.

447
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,720
Is it good?

448
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,720
Then give me all these lotus seeds.

449
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,720
Thank you, sir.

450
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,720
I'll take your reward.

451
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,720
Thank you, sir.

452
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,720
Let's go.

453
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,720
This private room is over. Where else are you taking me?

454
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,720
This is where I chose.

455
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,720
Come here.

456
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,720
Look.

457
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,720
You're indeed beautiful.

458
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,720
Come.

459
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,720
Here.

460
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,720
Why are you still the same as before?

461
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,720
You're a little coward.

462
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,720
Is it bad to go to the toilet?

463
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,720
Yes, of course.

464
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,720
But, Ning Ning,

465
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,720
I'm going to close the door soon.

466
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,720
Yan Ling,

467
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,720
you're so nice to me.

468
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,720
What do you like about me?

469
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,720
I saw you in the first sight.

470
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,720
I knew you were different from the girls in the capital.

471
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,720
You had eyes,

472
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
and you looked so serious.

473
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,720
You had a secret hidden behind your eyes.

474
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,720
I remember when I first saw you,

475
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,720
you were so serious at that time.

476
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,720
You wanted to be a thief,

477
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,720
but you didn't want to give anyone a good face.

478
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,720
You were happy,

479
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,720
but you were so sweet.

480
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,720
You were sad,

481
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,720
but you wanted to hide yourself from the crowd.

482
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,720
At that time, I thought

483
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,720
you were a person who was loved by others.

484
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,720
But I never thought that

485
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,720
you were the best.

486
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,720
I know you didn't sleep well.

487
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,720
Jiang Xuan,

488
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,720
you're so mean.

489
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,720
But everyone doesn't like me.

490
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,720
My mother doesn't like me.

491
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,720
My mother doesn't like me.

492
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,720
The servants in the mansion don't like me.

493
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,720
And the people in the capital don't like me either.

494
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
So,

495
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,720
you never thought that

496
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,720
you liked the wrong person.

497
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,720
Nonsense.

498
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,720
Think about it.

499
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,720
Your mother didn't need to let Jiang Fu know.

500
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,720
You changed your sister.

501
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,720
As long as she doesn't say,

502
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,720
your sister will always be the only Miss Di in Jiang Fu.

503
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,720
She went to the mansion.

504
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,720
She secretly followed her and buried the land.

505
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,720
But she knew that

506
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,720
even before she died,

507
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,720
she risked her own life to suffer.

508
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,720
She told the truth and sent you back to Jiang Fu.

509
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,720
She thought that

510
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,720
she didn't love you.

511
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,720
My Ning Ning is the best love in the world.

512
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,720
But I will never be the one

513
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,720
who was buried in your hand

514
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,720
and buried Miss Di.

515
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,720
I will grow up.

516
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,720
I will change.

517
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,720
You won't.

518
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,720
Ning Ning is always the best.

519
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,720
I'm not the best.

520
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,720
It's you.

521
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,720
But Jiang Xue Ning

522
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,720
doesn't deserve you to treat her like this.

523
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,720
Is it worth it?

524
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,720
I said it.

525
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,720
In my eyes,

526
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,720
you are the best.

527
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,720
How much love is left?

528
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,720
It's worth the silence.

529
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,720
I can't lose it.

530
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,720
Stop crying.

531
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,720
I feel hurt.

532
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,720
The young man is not ugly.

533
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,720
The hair is short, the moon is small.

534
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,720
I saw the flowers yesterday.

535
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:35,720
I think the flowers tomorrow are still young.

536
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,720
Something happened in the mansion.

537
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,720
I must go.

538
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,720
But Ning Ning,

539
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,720
wait for me.

540
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,720
One day,

541
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,720
I will sacrifice the wrongs of the Marquis.

542
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,720
I will definitely come back to marry you.

543
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,720
But Yan Ling,

544
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,720
I want to marry Shen Jin.

545
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,720
I want to be the empress.

546
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,720
You can't give me something.

547
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,720
But what about her?

548
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,720
She is the empress.

549
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,720
It's your fault.

550
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,720
It's your fault.

551
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,720
Sorry, I am sorry.

552
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,720
Thank you for your kindness.

553
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,720
It's okay.

554
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,720
But I know you are my best friend.

555
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,720
I am sorry.

556
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,720
I...

557
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,720
Forget it.

558
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,720
It's too late.

559
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,720
I am going back.

560
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,720
Ning Ning.

561
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,720
When I am done with the ceremony,

562
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,720
marry me.

563
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,720
I am afraid.

564
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,720
Miss.

565
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,720
Miss.

566
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,720
Ge Sang is back.

567
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,720
She is worried about me.

568
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,720
Where is Mr. Tang?

569
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,720
It's nothing.

570
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,720
I am fine.

571
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,720
Miss,

572
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,720
Mrs. Tang found you.

573
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,720
They know I am not well?

574
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,920
Minister Xie's men said that they had to thank me today.

575
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,320
I didn't dare to tell my husband.

576
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,920
It seems that there is something else.

577
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,520
Gui Er.

578
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,520
Madam, you are not allowed to do anything.

579
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,520
You don't have to make a move.

580
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,520
Gui Er has the guts. Don't give him any idea.

581
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,920
You must rely on him. What will you do with this?

582
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,320
Mother, look. I said that you must be so filial.

583
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,320
Father.

584
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,120
You are back, girl.

585
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,120
You are playing hard tonight.

586
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,120
I heard that father has something to tell me.

587
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,520
That's right.

588
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,920
I heard that the eldest princess went to the oil house, right?

589
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,920
And she also said something to you.

590
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,920
I think you must have known something.

591
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,320
Father wants to talk about the entry into the palace.

592
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,920
Yes.

593
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,920
Father and mother didn't mean to hide it from you.

594
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:32,920
You know that in the palace, you must be careful.

595
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,520
It doesn't suit your temperament.

596
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,920
So, you should let your sister go.

597
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,320
Of course, you will be in trouble.

598
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,120
If you don't have the guts, that's normal.

599
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,320
I have no idea.

600
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,320
After all, this is an official matter.

601
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,320
What did you say?

602
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,320
I don't have the guts to go to the palace.

603
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,320
Really?

604
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,720
Sister Ning, you...

605
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,320
If there is nothing else, I will leave first.

606
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,320
Girl, take a good rest.

607
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,320
This girl has really grown up.

608
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:19,920
She has grown up and is more and more sensible.

609
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,320
Look, she already knows what's going on.

610
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,920
And she knows that she has let her sister go.

611
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,920
Why don't I think that this is a real thing?

612
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,520
You...

613
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,720
How could it be?

614
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,520
I have checked over there.

615
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:41,120
The killer today has a criminal case against the imperial court.

616
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,720
The weapon used is also used to beat the King of Pingtang.

617
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,720
It is indeed a criminal case.

618
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,720
These days, in the capital, many officials have caused the assassination of the criminal.

619
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,920
No wonder this bloodshed is going to be a threat to the King of Yong Yi.

620
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:58,320
But, the people in the capital have always been in our hands.

621
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,120
The assassin today, I don't know your identity.

622
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,720
This is too strange.

623
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,520
It seems that King of Pingtang has already suspected me.

624
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,120
Dao Qing, write a letter to the capital.

625
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,320
Ask and see what the assassination is about.

626
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,320
Yes.

627
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,120
Sir, is this too risky?

628
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,120
You lead the Pingtang King to the capital to order you to come here.

629
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,720
Now, the bloodshed is fighting against each other.

630
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,320
It is what the King wants to see.

631
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,320
But what about you?

632
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,920
If you are stopped by the King of Yong Yi again and again,

633
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,320
and you are being attacked by the King of Yong Yi, the imperial court will not let you go.

634
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,920
I...

635
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,720
I will make a promise.

636
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,720
I will do it.

637
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,120
Lei Lushan!

638
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,520
Go.

639
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,920
Yesterday,

640
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,120
Shen Xun's face?

641
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,480
What do you think we should do?

642
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,960
Aunt, we've tried our best

643
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,480
during Shen Xun's time.

644
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,160
The rebels are not clear.

645
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,360
Especially the military officials.

646
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,680
They can't tell us

647
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:26,920
how we're going to force them.

648
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,000
They're the masterminds in the capital.

649
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,240
I said you're a fool.

650
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,000
I've already made my statement.

651
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,200
We're not doing it because we're taking the test.

652
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,000
I want you to

653
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,320
ask the criminal of the Yiong Yi's Mansion

654
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,200
in the court.

655
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,560
We've done nothing.

656
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,120
If Chen Ying finds out my plan,

657
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,440
do you know

658
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,920
what the result is?

659
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,080
It's...

660
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,120
It's a terrible thing.

661
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,160
It's a terrible thing.

662
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:58,760
Enough.

663
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,000
I don't need you to be a terrible person.

664
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:04,880
Anyone?

665
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,560
Looks like we're on another level.

666
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,160
What's Wear on?

667
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,760
Who gives you permission for this rumour?

668
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,040
The Seven Halles

669
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,000
Yammer Procession

670
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,280
for the duke of the human family.

671
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,720
We have decided.

672
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,840
Is this the final innocent?

673
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,280
Insulting me!

674
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,160
eggplant

675
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,760
It's him, Acid!

676
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,680
I thought the situation now was not well-known.

677
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,720
Everyone knew that I was in a bad relationship with Yan.

678
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,640
Now, the Ministry of Justice has taken over the investigation.

679
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,040
No matter what the result is,

680
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,800
we have all avoided the public's opinions and guesses.

681
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,600
Yan is a general and a very strong man.

682
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,600
It's just that His Majesty is suspicious.

683
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,320
The State's public is in great danger.

684
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,920
He is finally lacking a lot of power.

685
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,720
These years, the old man in Yan Mu

686
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,920
has been against me a lot.

687
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,920
Since we can't find the evidence,

688
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,760
then let's just give him the evidence.

689
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,040
You go to the Ministry of Justice to find someone who can do it.

690
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,120
Let him find a way to get close to Yan.

691
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:22,040
I will get the notes and the seal of Yan Mu.

692
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,680
Yes.

693
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,240
Go.

694
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:29,920
Kya.

695
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,200
Distinguished then.

696
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,440
Come here to my office and search the dirty bathroom.

697
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,000
Useless defend this place.

698
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,600
Your Majesty is right.

699
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,060
I have made düny's arrangements

700
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,640
to know the duties shall be dressed up

701
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,300
by the new five.

702
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,160
Are these the duties approved by the Stateες?

703
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,100
My lord,

704
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,800
you can't talk trash about it.

705
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:17,160
ButCómo

706
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,880
I'm notensed even in this moment.

707
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,180
I'm afraid ko in the entire Dhaing

708
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,940
do we get anything done?

709
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,120
You bastard.

710
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,000
I won't fight.

711
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:34,420
Seems to be theisolation inJames are available mid barrels calm as long as there is you

712
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,860
Do not kill

713
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,580
Kill

714
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,080
kill

715
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,360
ambitious

716
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,680
Nice

717
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,600
You...

718
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,080
My lord.

719
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,280
Zhou Yuzhi, what are you doing?

720
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,640
The imperial court said that we were investigating.

721
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,520
It's not a search.

722
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,360
These soldiers are all soldiers of the people.

723
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,960
Why do you have to see them with such a sword?

724
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,960
Look!

725
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,040
You're not only a monster,

726
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,640
but also a scoundrel in the cultivation.

727
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,840
You can't fight anymore.

728
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,320
Stop fighting.

729
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,520
Right.

730
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,200
Obviously, this wasn't the end.

731
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,760
Let's try it.

732
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,160
Come here.

733
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,960
Hey.

734
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,960
Hey.

735
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,040
Take your hand.

736
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,600
The army is weak and the army is weak.

737
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,280
Don't worry about me.

738
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,360
Get out!

739
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,360
My lord.

740
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,520
Then wait for me, my lord.

741
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,680
I think you are a good man.

742
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,720
You are a master of the house.

743
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,600
Why don't you come to my house?

744
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,080
I am a master of the house.

745
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,080
I am Zhou Yanzhi.

746
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,080
I am used to being in the family.

747
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,080
I won't be a coward.

748
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,000
You don't want to.

749
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I am not a coward.

750
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,960
But I think you are good at it.

751
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,960
If you have the time, you can come to the camp to cut the grass.

752
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,320
Yes.

753
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:56,320
Yanling, Xie Wei, Yanjia, Xue Shi.

754
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,320
Although I want to save Yanjia,

755
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,320
I am not a coward now.

756
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,320
Who else can I use?

757
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,320
Zhou Yanzhi?

758
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,320
After Wei Wengguo died,

759
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,320
I was a little bit worried.

760
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,320
I was afraid that I would be killed.

761
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,320
I had to use him to do something for me.

762
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,320
He is not a good man.

763
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,320
But he is the only one

764
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,320
I can use.

765
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,320
He is the only one.

766
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,320
When Yongyi's family joined the peace and peace,

767
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,320
it was Xinhu Wei who sent the investigation.

768
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,320
Now, it is Xinhu Wei who should be the one to protect him.

769
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,320
Maybe he can help me to find out.

770
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,320
Wait.

771
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,320
Protect him?

772
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,320
In order to keep Yanling safe,

773
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,320
I gave Zhou Yanzhi the key to know him.

774
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,320
Before Yanjia was born,

775
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,320
Zhou Yanzhi became a father and a nurse.

776
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,320
He also became a witness after Yanjia was born.

777
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,320
I always thought that he was a good man.

778
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:55,320
But did Yanjia have anything to do with him?

779
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,320
Coming.

780
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,320
Coming.

781
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,320
Are you...

782
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,320
Are you at your master's house?

783
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,320
Yes.

784
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,320
I went to the police station early in the morning.

785
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,320
I didn't know when I could come back.

786
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,320
If you have something to do with him,

787
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,320
you can do it first.

788
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,320
I will ask someone to send me to the camp.

789
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,320
Don't mention me.

790
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,320
You just tell the people to send you to the camp.

791
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,320
I am afraid that Ai Ju will die soon.

792
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,320
I will come back to see him.

793
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,320
I will come back and see myself once more.

794
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,320
adi.

795
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,320
Very good.

796
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,320
Wait for me.

797
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,320
quickly.

798
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,320
Father.

799
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,320
Right away.

800
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,120
You're back quite soon.

801
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,520
I haven't been back to Miss Er for a long time.

802
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,720
I have some business to attend to.

803
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,080
I'm still tired today.

804
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,320
Please run away.

805
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,320
I'm still sorry for you.

806
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,120
Actually, if you don't come to me today,

807
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,120
I have to find you.

808
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,120
Find me?

809
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,320
You've been in the capital for four years.

810
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,320
Can you remember me

811
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,320
as a servant

812
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,320
from our house?

813
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,320
Can you remember

814
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,120
my little Jiang Fu, Miss Er?

815
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,320
Miss, what are you talking about?

816
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,320
If it weren't for you,

817
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,320
I'd still be in the village

818
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,320
and feed horses.

819
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,320
I can't remember.

820
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,320
If it weren't for you,

821
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,320
I'd still be in the village

822
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,320
and feed horses.

823
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,320
I can't remember

824
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,320
your kindness.

825
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,320
I can't remember it in my life.

826
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,320
You don't have to say anything.

827
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,320
In the past few days,

828
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,320
the Ministry of Justice, Zhong Zhang Zhe,

829
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,320
has been talking about your top priority.

830
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,320
And the time when Lv Lv appeared

831
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,320
to assassinate the officials of the court.

832
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,320
If you want to ask for the title of

833
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,320
the new position of the new position,

834
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,320
I'm afraid that your days

835
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,320
won't be better than yours.

836
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,320
You're always

837
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,320
thinking about living

838
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,320
and wanting to be a disciple.

839
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,320
But you have no money.

840
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,320
You have more people to sell.

841
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,320
That's why you think of me.

842
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,320
You're making me guess it right.

843
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,320
It seems that if you want to hold it,

844
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,320
you have to be a soldier.

845
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,320
You have to be considerate of it.

846
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,320
Mr. Zhou,

847
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,320
I'd rather guess it down.

848
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,320
I'm just a woman of the rules.

849
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,320
I can let you see it.

850
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,320
It's just my relationship with Yan Ling.

851
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,320
But you don't find a big tree in the new position.

852
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,320
But you keep an eye on the dead enemy of the new position.

853
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,320
I'm afraid that

854
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,320
you have another plan.

855
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,320
I'm caught again.

856
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,320
It seems that Yan's family is really related to him.

857
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,320
You're afraid that

858
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,320
I'm the one who guessed it right.

859
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,320
I also want to remind you

860
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:38,320
not to delay the two-finger war.

861
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,320
No matter what task the Xue family gives you,

862
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,320
if you succeed,

863
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,320
you may be able to live a peaceful life

864
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,320
and live a happy life.

865
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,320
But if you die, you'll be killed.

866
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,320
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger

867
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,320
sooner or later.

868
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,320
You'll die in the end.

869
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,320
I'm afraid that

870
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,320
you'll be killed.

871
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,320
I'm afraid that

872
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,320
you'll be killed.

873
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,320
I'm afraid that

874
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,320
you'll be killed.

875
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,320
I'm afraid that

876
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,320
you'll be killed.

877
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,320
I'm afraid that

878
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,320
you'll be killed.

879
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,320
I'm afraid that

880
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,320
you'll be killed.

881
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,320
I'm afraid that

882
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,320
you'll be killed.

883
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,320
I'm afraid that

884
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,320
you'll be killed.

885
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,320
I'm afraid that

886
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,320
you'll be killed.

887
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,320
I'm afraid that

888
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,320
you'll be killed.

889
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,320
I'm afraid that

890
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,320
you'll be killed.

891
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,320
I'm afraid that

892
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,320
you'll be killed.

893
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,320
I'm afraid that

894
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,320
you'll be killed.

895
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,320
I'm afraid that

896
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,320
you'll be killed.

897
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,320
I'm afraid that

898
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,320
you'll be killed.

899
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,320
I'm afraid that

900
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,320
you'll be killed.

901
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,320
I'm afraid that

902
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,320
you'll be killed.

903
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,320
I'm afraid that

904
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,320
you'll be killed.

905
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,320
I'm afraid that

906
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,320
you'll be killed.

907
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,320
I'm afraid that

908
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,320
you'll be killed.

909
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,320
I'm afraid that

910
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,320
you'll be killed.

911
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,320
I'm afraid that

912
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,320
you'll be killed.

913
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,320
I'm afraid that

914
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,320
you'll be killed.

915
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,320
I'm afraid that

916
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,320
you'll be killed.

917
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,320
I'm afraid that

918
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,320
you'll be killed.

00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,320
I'm afraid that

920
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,320
you'll be killed.

921
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,320
I'm afraid that

922
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,320
you'll be killed.

923
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,320
I'm afraid that

924
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,320
you'll be killed.
