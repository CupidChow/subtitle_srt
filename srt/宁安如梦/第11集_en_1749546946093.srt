1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
As long as I can enter the Ning'an Palace

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,200
and pay all the price

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,600
I will be happy and happy

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,400
The End

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,800
The End

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Everything seems to be a dream

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,600
I have owe many people

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,000
Chaozhe, help me

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,800
I will be a good person after this

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
The End

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
I will be the one to take the throne

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,800
There are some things you can't give me

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
But what about them?

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,000
The life you choose is for Mr. You

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,400
In this world, everyone has the right to escape

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,000
But I can't

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,000
I want to regret it

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,400
and do the wrong thing

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,200
and go back in time

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Does Mr. Zhang believe that everything is decided?

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I would rather believe in the future

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,000
Your Highness

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,800
Your Highness

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,200
The End

26
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,000
Ning'an, what are you doing?

27
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,000
In the Ming Dynasty

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,600
there is a pair of hands

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,600
that can break everything

30
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,400
The revenge is long

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,600
Who are you?

32
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,600
The Emperor of the mortal world is so long

33
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,000
and he is so ridiculous

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,560
He wasso lousy

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,200
XZ series is based on mobile phone, demon-like sight, and peace and sound.

36
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,480
If you're hungry, eat good-hearted bread.

37
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,200
Good-hearted bread, demon-like sight, and peace and sound.

38
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,680
The exclusive development patent is 9.1.

39
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,800
The design of the best doctor's doctor, Aitamei Zhuo.

40
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,320
Demon-like sight, demon-like sight, and peace and sound.

41
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,800
The beauty of beauty, a piece of paper.

42
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,880
Use the treasure.

43
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,400
The good-hearted treasure of the bad guy, demon-like sight, and peace and sound.

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The evidence is true.

45
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,800
Now you tell me,

46
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,720
where's the one that's missing?

47
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,160
***

48
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,380
Relax, Your Highness.

49
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,880
Now Madame Abbeじゃない.

50
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,440
請Natural Betterment...

51
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,040
Spread the message to all the executives

52
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,040
What is he to ya?

53
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,960
Now I understand really you

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,500
It's very difficult for a high school to handle

55
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,420
Imagine Jiang Er's true intention

56
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,620
Second, it's possible that the person in the team has a problem.

57
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,720
Speak clearly.

58
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,820
The person in the team who pointed out the suspect

59
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,220
should have been informed of my intention.

60
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,720
If there really is someone who has been trying to harm Miss Jiang,

61
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,820
even if they forgot the matter of the tree,

62
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,020
they will surely steal the paper and hide it in the forest.

63
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,420
And that person must follow the person who was in charge of the murder.

64
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,720
The Cangsu family will surely not be able to get the paper back.

65
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,220
Please give the order to search them one by one.

66
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,020
If the person who was in charge of the murder is suspected,

67
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,620
Miss Jiang Er will be the one to blame.

68
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,820
Zhang Zhe, you already have a plan.

69
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,820
You intentionally tried to hide the person and make the person do it, right?

70
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,820
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

71
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,820
Official Zhang just thinks that the person behind the scene

72
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,220
is willing to use the Imperial Eunuch to hide the person who was in charge of the murder

73
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,420
and surely has a plan.

74
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,620
You are afraid that the whole city will not dare to go out and block the way.

75
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,820
You should search outside the store.

76
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,820
I didn't expect that Official Zhang still has the Lotus Robe Knight.

77
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,820
I thought it was for Miss Yang's reputation and consideration.

78
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,020
Master.

79
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,020
Master.

80
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,220
The second Bai is the most right-wing person. He is just like that private friend.

81
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,020
He has always been fighting for his own money.

82
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,420
I am not a slave!

83
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,820
I am not a slave!

84
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,220
I am not a slave!

85
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,020
Master, this...

86
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,420
Official Zhang.

87
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,580
Your Majesty.

88
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,820
The Empress Dowager.

89
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,620
This person is the submitter who współfe Evidence of Yang Zhi Zhai.

90
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,540
When I was found on her, I had found this Ayat Graf.

91
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,300
Your Highness,

92
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,900
the letter on this paper

93
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,100
is written by the Chen girl.

94
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,780
It seems that she could only help

95
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,180
and didn't have the chance to use it.

96
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,780
So she hit this paper

97
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,100
from the corner

98
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,660
and just proved that

99
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,700
it was all written by Chen girl.

100
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,140
It's not like that.

101
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,020
It's not like that, Your Highness.

102
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,660
I was just cleaning the room.

103
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,660
I found that the paper was damaged.

104
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,940
Because of the paper,

105
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,340
and Miss Jia'er's life is not going to be used,

106
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,460
I wanted to keep it secretly

107
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,700
and practice the words.

108
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,180
I thought that the paper

109
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,020
was damaged and then put it back.

110
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,380
It's no one knows.

111
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,780
Who is the boss of Chen girl today?

112
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,500
I'm really anxious.

113
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,580
I just dare not say it.

114
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,380
Since you said you wanted to practice the words,

115
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,820
it must be the word.

116
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,260
Why don't you read

117
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,940
what's written on it?

118
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,260
Mr. Zhang has the habit of

119
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,100
writing in the palace with the letter.

120
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,980
It must be the palace of the Ministry of Justice.

121
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,880
The awr 1000 dead

122
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,580
seemed to be drawn in it.

123
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,100
Is the memorial Algiris

124
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,500
written on it?

125
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:51,580
actions Mohammedou

126
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,800
How did Mo Chou

127
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,820
close the door?

128
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,180
What do you mean she committed suicide?

129
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:06,900
How dare you!

130
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,900
What kind of master are you?

131
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,180
You are just a little poison.

132
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,100
Who will harm you in the new strategy?

133
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:15,940
Your Majesty,

134
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,100
it's my fault.

135
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,340
It's more important to keep the secret.

136
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,700
It's important for the court to design it.

137
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,260
Please make a clear investigation.

138
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,420
The person who is behind the interrogation

139
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,780
will be the main justice for me.

140
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,620
You get up first.

141
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,500
Yes.

142
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,660
Good.

143
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,220
You don't remember the words.

144
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,780
You don't recognize the words.

145
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,980
It's impossible that you love yourself.

146
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:34,980
Say it.

147
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,820
Who fed you this?

148
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,740
There is no one behind the interrogation.

149
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,540
I am with you.

150
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,660
I also Nhach shaving for him

151
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,060
so sauce for you to feed the princess.

152
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,580
And I hear others say

153
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,340
the crowning of Rourou was not your business,

154
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,140
so I don't catch a rain-back.

155
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:00,900
Don't talk nonsense.

156
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,380
And now you will die in real!

157
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,380
I'll tell the people to stop her from going to the palace.

158
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,380
I'll tell them to tell the truth.

159
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,380
No, no.

160
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,380
Fan'er.

161
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,380
Mother, what's the difference?

162
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,380
This time,

163
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,380
you're so quiet when you're outside the palace.

164
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,380
You should be at ease.

165
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,380
I didn't notice anything about you.

166
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,380
It's not easy to get out of the line

167
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,380
and get a good touch.

168
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,380
You're still in good health.

169
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,380
You're in a hurry.

170
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,380
I'm not in a hurry.

171
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,380
I'm not in a hurry.

172
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,380
I'm in a hurry.

173
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,380
I forgot my mother's illness.

174
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,380
I'll take her to the capital.

175
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,380
I'll ask Wang Xinyi to take her to the Immortal Formation.

176
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,380
I'll ask her to take her to the Immortal Formation.

177
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,380
Okay.

178
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,380
It's been a long night.

179
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,380
It's almost dawn.

180
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,380
I'm tired.

181
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,380
You can go back.

182
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,380
We'll talk about it another day.

183
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,380
No, no.

184
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,380
Your Majesty, Mother.

185
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,380
No.

186
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,380
Isn't this the day

187
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,380
when the sun rises and sets in the temple?

188
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,380
It's so scary.

189
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,380
But you're so amazing.

190
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,380
It's death if you step in or out.

191
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,380
You have to be careful.

192
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,380
But you're a good man.

193
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,380
You're a good man.

194
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,380
You're not good at doing things.

195
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,380
Who would dare to do this to you?

196
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,380
If you didn't care about

197
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,380
my sister,

198
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,380
you wouldn't have been in trouble.

199
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,380
Okay.

200
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,380
Let's talk about it when you're back.

201
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,380
Why do you look at me like this?

202
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,380
I'm just surprised.

203
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,380
Why did you help me

204
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,380
in the temple last night?

205
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,380
I'm just a commoner.

206
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,380
Shouldn't I?

207
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,380
Miss Jiao.

208
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,380
Your Majesty,

209
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,380
I've made a promise to the court

210
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,380
that I'll do my best to serve you.

211
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,380
I'm sorry

212
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,380
for making you suffer today.

213
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,380
Your Majesty will make a serious investigation.

214
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,380
I'll definitely give you a justice.

215
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,380
Thank you for your concern.

216
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,380
But

217
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,380
even if it's difficult for you,

218
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,380
I can always get back to you.

219
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,380
Sure.

220
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:45,380
One should think wondering

221
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:49,380
why I'll let you off in sp dirtsl.

222
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:55,380
How did we know

223
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,620
Even if it's really you who is doing this,

224
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,020
you don't have to be so polite.

225
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,740
You are right.

226
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,460
But this Miss Jiang is not an ordinary person.

227
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,100
What do you mean?

228
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,780
It's rare.

229
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,100
Lord Zhang has come to ask about something.

230
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:15,820
Lord Zhang.

231
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,820
My lord, thank you for your hard work last night.

232
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,700
I don't trust you.

233
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,320
What happened?

234
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,860
Just in case Lord Zhang is a老ذian,

235
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,420
I'm afraid just to do our best.

236
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,940
Your beginning thank is all my fault.

237
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,020
I'll go to thank it to when you guys go back.

238
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,180
When will he close the case?

239
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,900
He is an imposter.

240
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,040
Take a look, please.

241
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,980
Please wait, my mistery.

242
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,180
Thank you all for saving Mingzhi or my code will go to left.

243
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,780
I do not think you came here ...

244
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,180
Or is it just for Magistrate Jiang to take care of it?

245
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,640
Oh, thanks.

246
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,540
That is my fault, my mistery.

247
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,240
Magistrate Jiang will have a chat now, count me in front.

248
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,860
I understand where 선물

249
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,180
is

250
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,780
The leaks from yesterday

251
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,100
were good news

252
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,860
But I'm sorry

253
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,940
If I stayed up late

254
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,420
so You wouldn't be punished

255
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:41,860
Because I punished her

256
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,780
with my BIll本

257
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,380
In my heart, I'm wronged

258
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,460
Thank you forroz

259
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,180
You're bandag

260
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:49,540
No need to emphasize

261
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,500
the labor

262
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,500
I'm not a part of this.

263
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,500
The palace is in a bad mood.

264
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,500
The situation is a bit strange.

265
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,500
Even Lord Chen is just a hypocrite.

266
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,500
Lord Zhang is willing to investigate the truth.

267
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,500
The bloodline is also white.

268
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,500
The world is much better than the food and food.

269
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,500
You can be the bloodline.

270
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,500
I'm just an outsider.

271
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,500
But Miss Jiang Er is in the middle of it.

272
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,500
Be careful.

273
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
Of course.

274
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
I still have to stay in the palace for a while.

275
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
I'm afraid that I'll die.

276
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Please let them harm me.

277
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,500
Miss Jiang Er, you can go to your room.

278
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,500
I can't stay in the palace for long.

279
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,500
I'll take my leave.

280
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,500
Lord Zhang.

281
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,500
Miss Jiang Er and Miss Yao

282
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,500
have been together to lead the princess.

283
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,500
I heard that you have never supported the imperial decree.

284
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,500
Miss Yao once retired and thought about many tricks.

285
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,500
I don't know the truth.

286
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,500
I understand. Thank you.

287
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,500
But Miss Yao is no longer so young.

288
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,500
Lord Zhang should have known

289
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,500
why he still wanted to ask.

290
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,500
Retreat.

291
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,500
What?

292
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,500
I will retire from the Yao family.

293
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
He wants to retire?

294
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,500
He doesn't like Yao Xi?

295
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,500
Why don't you tell new cook uncle Ying diagnosis?

296
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,500
It's a good thing.

297
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,120
Xin Safe

298
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,500
No problem

299
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
butMing Er.

300
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,500
Howodifreg

301
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,500
It's a life-threatening disaster.

302
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
I can't laugh at it.

303
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,500
You know it all?

304
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,500
The gate is sealed.

305
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,500
I don't know where it is.

306
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Why are you still standing there?

307
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,500
You're still wandering around.

308
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
You're too long to live.

309
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,500
I...

310
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,500
Aren't we going to Yangzhi's?

311
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,500
Is Brother Wen Zhao there?

312
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,500
How is the Tai'an Hall today?

313
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,500
Did anyone want to harm you?

314
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,500
There's a girl who's a bit of a nuisance.

315
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,500
But I don't think it's that simple.

316
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
When the Empress Dowager was interrogating me,

317
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
she was trying to find out what was going on.

318
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,500
But she ended up in the Palace Lady's room.

319
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,500
It's really weird.

320
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,500
Who are you not suspecting?

321
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,500
I do have a guess.

322
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,500
But I think the person who killed her

323
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,500
shouldn't be the one who did it.

324
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,500
But from the overall view,

325
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,500
she has the ability to sell the palace maid.

326
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,500
This way, she has the ability to balance and work,

327
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,660
and before goes to see high into officialbroke with one of the noble

328
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,500
already confirmed, she must be shrewd before her set foot.

329
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,500
Exactly across the field.

330
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:31,540
But I didn't make any

331
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,260
He can't stand such a mess.

332
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,980
He might be the one who he wants to protect.

333
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,380
Since you have an answer,

334
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,220
how are you going to deal with it?

335
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,900
I'm not guilty of anything else.

336
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,380
He wants to harm me.

337
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,020
If he doesn't suspect the color,

338
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,460
maybe he thinks I'm a good man and you're a good bully.

339
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,460
Since he dares to make me unhappy,

340
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,060
I'll make sure he's not a bad guy.

341
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,540
It's only a matter of time.

342
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,860
Although Gu Yong is good,

343
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,780
if he can't do anything,

344
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,820
he'll be in trouble.

345
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,460
Don't be anxious.

346
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,900
Think about it before you do it.

347
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,900
Thank you for your advice.

348
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,420
By the way,

349
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,380
what were you doing here?

350
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,500
I was searching for the inside of the house

351
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,300
to find out the truth.

352
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,580
I was looking for the thread.

353
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,020
Zhang Zhe?

354
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,260
You know him.

355
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,140
What's the relationship between you and him?

356
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,180
Nothing.

357
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,580
I'm just a newbie.

358
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,020
Newbie?

359
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,540
You're a good man.

360
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,860
You're a real good man.

361
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,020
Only he

362
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,100
can help me when I'm in danger.

363
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,300
I appreciate him and thank him.

364
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,860
You like Zhang Zhe?

365
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,740
When did you start?

366
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,300
Did you know Yan Ling?

367
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,460
I'm just a friend of Yan Ling.

368
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,460
So Zhang Zhe is a man and a woman.

369
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,180
This is my own business.

370
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,540
If I were Yan Ling,

371
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,380
I'd take your skin

372
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,340
and take your life.

373
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,100
I'll take you as my past.

374
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,580
I'll ask Zhang Zhe

375
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,700
to take care of you.

376
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,420
I've met him today.

377
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,420
But I'm not sure

378
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,140
if he's your lover.

379
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,380
You like him.

380
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,660
But he's not sure

381
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,020
if he can be your lover.

382
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,100
You're the lover.

383
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,340
What are you talking about?

384
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,300
I said Zhang Zhe on purpose.

385
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,860
You were so anxious.

386
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,260
You said it in a word

387
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,500
to expose your weakness.

388
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,020
You think I'm a good man

389
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,180
and I'm a good man.

390
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,900
Or you think I'm a good man

391
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,420
and I don't treat anyone well.

392
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,700
If I were you,

393
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,820
I'd hide my feelings in the heart.

394
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,660
I won't tell others

395
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,220
if I don't tell anyone.

396
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,780
You're the one who's been in trouble.

397
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,220
I won't do anything to you.

398
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,260
If you meet someone else

399
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,420
and want to deal with you,

400
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,220
you'll be caught.

401
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,220
First, you should take care of Zhang Zhe.

402
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,100
You should see

403
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,300
how I can

404
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,860
kill four people.

405
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,460
Lord Zhang.

406
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,420
Why do you come back so early?

407
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,100
Aren't you teaching your Murderer class?

408
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,620
It's off Duty.

409
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,060
You check Zhang어도 kowtoon?

410
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,340
It's an impodent trade.

411
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,740
Why review this?

412
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:21,700
If I were you

413
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,100
I'd just go there.

414
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,600
Let me do it yourself, come

415
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,140
Kneel down

416
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,900
Last night when I saw that palace girl

417
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,100
we went to the Garden which means

418
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,300
that you did this

419
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:55,780
dichot corporate

420
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,740
They've lied to me

421
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,280
Aunt's fault

422
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,520
That Jiang Xue Ning, besides her color,

423
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,520
is very outstanding and has a good education.

424
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,000
You are the daughter of Xue family.

425
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,200
How could you be so ungrateful to her?

426
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,920
I have no idea.

427
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,720
Jiang Xue Ning is not only a concubine to Her Highness,

428
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,120
but also to Prince Ling that is familiar with her.

429
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,760
I was worried that Her Highness might be deceived

430
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,360
and wanted to take this matter out of the palace.

431
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,600
Jie Er? How is that possible?

432
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,960
I saw it with my own eyes. How could it be fake?

433
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,560
Then why did you talk to her later?

434
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,480
Didn't I teach you to cut grass and remove roots?

435
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,760
Last night, Lord Zhang had already found out the key to the case.

436
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,360
I was afraid that if I didn't do this,

437
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,640
I would be caught by the Shen Teng Moga and found out by my aunt.

438
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,120
I was also afraid that Prince Ling would know

439
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,040
that the evil aunt helped Xue family to settle down.

440
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,280
That's why I wanted to keep my eyes on her and wait for the day.

441
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,400
Get up.

442
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,400
Since you can't remember,

443
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,880
you must not use the grass to remove the roots.

444
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,280
Jiang Xue Ning, Zhang Zhe,

445
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,600
and that Yan Jian are all here to ruin my business.

446
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,480
As long as you are here, I will surely find a way.

447
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,940
Okay.

448
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,060
Quickly!

449
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:45,120
Leave lock under my shoulder!

450
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,400
This is not for you.

451
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,880
This is for you to wear.

452
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,480
You said you were framed last night.

453
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,720
It means that no one put my words in your eyes.

454
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,600
And you thought you were a useless person.

455
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,280
Come.

456
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,600
I said I would take care of you in the palace.

457
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,440
Then I can't let anyone bully me.

458
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,920
I'll give you a massage first.

459
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,320
Aunt Su.

460
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,160
Yes.

461
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,200
Send someone to the police station.

462
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,920
As long as the girl in the car is looking for the person behind her,

463
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,320
I'll know it first.

464
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,560
Yes.

465
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,120
Your Highness, you're so sweet.

466
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,400
I'm not afraid of anything.

467
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,760
I'm really guilty.

468
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,920
But this matter is not so simple.

469
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,000
Your Highness, don't be too kind.

470
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,760
Your Highness, you know my kindness.

471
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,440
I know it in your heart.

472
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,720
But I'm so blinded by you.

473
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,880
It's hard to make people jealous.

474
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,960
Just like the emperor and the harem.

475
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,320
You have to be careful in the capital.

476
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,400
You know to push me away.

477
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,840
When I'm back to the other side,

478
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,200
you can't be jealous.

479
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,520
Then I can only be like those concubines.

480
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,800
You're crying.

481
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,160
You're the princess.

482
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,360
You can't be so mean.

483
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,960
Your Highness.

484
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,960
I think there's a letter from Wang Xun.

485
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,200
Are you two...

486
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,200
What are you thinking?

487
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,840
The letter is very ordinary.

488
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,200
You can buy it anywhere.

489
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,120
Yes.

490
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,800
But how do you know

491
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,480
Prince Ling has a letter?

492
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,640
It's the day of the capital transfer.

493
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,760
I was afraid that I would be wronged and I would be caught.

494
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,760
I saw Wang Xun on the way.

495
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,880
I haven't heard of Wang Xun like that girl.

496
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,600
I asked him. He didn't say anything.

497
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,520
So Miss Xue saw that handkerchief?

498
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,800
So I didn't ask him much.

499
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,160
He doesn't feel bad.

500
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,920
After all...

501
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,320
I'm telling you.

502
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,120
I'm so worried about Wang Xun and Prince Ling.

503
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,240
So what happened last night was caused by death.

504
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,360
After we capture this British country,

505
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,960
we can make sure that the person behind it is Uncle Xue.

506
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,480
The reason for the fight is just to save the empress.

507
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,400
Who wants to be the emperor this time?

508
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,520
I don't care.

509
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,040
When Mr. Zuo met with the emperor last night,

510
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,400
His Highness already knew.

511
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,880
He invited you to his mansion today

512
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,080
to express his gratitude.

513
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,120
But I don't know if you came at this time.

514
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,120
You're full.

515
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,920
His Highness is too worried.

516
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,840
He was too busy last night.

517
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,360
By the way,

518
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,040
I heard that you went after assassins last night.

519
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,920
Did you get any goods?

520
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,360
Qing Feng didn't use them.

521
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,600
I'm sorry.

522
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,720
The assassins are so complicated.

523
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,920
I can't do it.

524
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,360
Don't blame yourself.

525
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,160
Your Highness.

526
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,120
Your Highness.

527
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:08,840
Your Highness.

528
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,680
Your Highness just recovered.

529
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,480
Why are you out?

530
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,400
It's okay.

531
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,080
Your Highness.

532
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,920
Your Highness.

533
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,320
You should go in.

534
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,720
Otherwise, His Highness will know.

535
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,920
You're so filial.

536
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,040
You must go to the prison for me.

537
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,360
Go and help him.

538
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,480
I'll talk to Mr. Xie.

539
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,720
Yes.

540
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,360
Your Highness.

541
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:37,960
Your Highness.

542
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,160
I'm not willing to take it.

543
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,560
How can I not take it?

544
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,960
When I first met you,

545
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,920
I felt close to you.

546
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,400
Later,

547
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,560
you became Mr. Yanlin's husband.

548
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,640
You took care of him.

549
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,360
Yanlin also said to you.

550
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,200
I think

551
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,520
this may

552
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,600
be just a fate between people.

553
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,760
But last night,

554
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,600
I was so lucky to be alive.

555
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,160
Why?

556
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,920
Is it because Yanlin's husband?

557
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,400
My Lord.

558
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,720
You're the master of the ancient palace.

559
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,840
I shouldn't have been calculated by others.

560
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,800
I'm sorry for the emergency.

561
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,960
I should have helped.

562
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:46,960
My Lord.

563
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:47,960
It's cold outside.

564
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,400
You should go back to your room and rest.

565
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,200
I was so worried about you last night.

566
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,880
I was so worried.

567
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,360
I felt like I saw many things in my dream.

568
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,000
I thought of the battle in my life.

569
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,880
I thought of Yanlin's mother.

570
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,520
I also thought of Zhang Jie

571
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,720
and Ding Fei.

572
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,240
This precious tree

573
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,640
was planted by my sister Zhang

574
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,720
a few years ago.

575
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,240
It's been 10 years.

576
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,920
She was

577
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,040
the most naughty and naughty girl.

578
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,800
I still remember once.

579
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,560
She made a ladder

580
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,160
from nowhere.

581
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,040
What are you doing?

582
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,960
Come down.

583
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,080
Mother and father had a fight again.

584
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,040
They didn't laugh for a few days.

585
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,360
Mother loves the smell of roses.

586
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,520
I want to take some of them

587
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,400
and make her happy.

588
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,160
Nonsense.

589
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,840
I think

590
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,400
your son is so naughty.

591
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,840
Your mother and your father

592
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,000
had a fight for six times last month.

593
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,280
Last time you had a fight when you stole the sugar.

594
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,400
Last time you stole my wine.

595
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,560
You had a fight.

596
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,880
And that time...

597
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,960
Uncle, you're a scholar.

598
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,240
I don't dare to lie to anyone.

599
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,880
How can you trust me?

600
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,680
Enough.

601
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,240
A man and a big husband

602
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,600
are crying.

603
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,600
What are you looking at?

604
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,080
If you really want it,

605
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,400
I'll take it for you.

606
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,160
Thank you, uncle.

607
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,720
Hurry up.

608
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,160
What are you doing?

609
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,400
You brat.

610
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,680
I'll catch you

611
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,840
and chop your skin off.

612
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,800
I'll kick you out.

613
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,480
What are you doing?

614
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,600
Come back here.

615
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,400
Here we go.

616
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,040
Uncle.

617
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,600
Are you all right?

618
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,200
Thank you for your sharp禀多.

619
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,880
I have nothing to do with your mother.

620
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,040
Next time,

621
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,160
Look in the video

622
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,440
about Prince Consort Ding's death

623
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,840
the lives were asked by Right Trans Stellen

624
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,520
My Lord

625
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,280
Femalepassage

626
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,320
Sister Zhe's eunuch

627
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,040
I've never even been to the capital.

628
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,040
That winter was so cold.

629
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,040
I wonder if there's anyone in the palace

630
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,040
who would have the heart to

631
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,040
give it a life in the dark.

632
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,040
Will there be anyone

633
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,040
who would have the heart to

634
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,040
give it a life in the dark?

635
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,040
That's why I want to kick him out.

636
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,040
My Lord.

637
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,040
Back then, I was a senior.

638
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,040
I never wanted to believe that child

639
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,040
was buried in the chaos of the King of Pingnan.

640
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,040
Han Tong is a man of the people.

641
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,040
He's a man of the people.

642
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,040
It's a pity that he's not a man of the people.

643
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,040
Everyone thinks that

644
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,040
he's just a mother.

645
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,040
They don't want to believe that child.

646
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,040
But if he's a man of the people,

647
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,040
he's a man of the people.

648
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,040
He's a man of the people.

649
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,040
He's a man of the people.

650
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,040
What does he look like

651
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,040
when he's not open to the world?

652
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,040
Since there's a world,

653
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,040
even if it's a man of the people,

654
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,040
it should be a good and simple world

655
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,040
that's easy to deal with.

656
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:27,040
I really think that I will defeat the world sooner or later.

657
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,040
If that child is really alive,

658
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,040
and still lives in the world,

659
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,040
why don't we meet each other sooner or later?

660
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,040
Maybe he has his own reason.

661
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,040
Okay.

662
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,040
Okay.

663
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,040
Let's start to progress.

664
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,040
Let's go.

665
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,040
Okay.

666
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,040
Let's go.

667
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,040
Okay.

668
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,040
Okay.

669
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,040
Okay.

670
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,040
Okay.

671
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,040
Okay.

672
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,040
Okay.

673
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,040
Okay.

674
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,040
Okay.

675
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,040
Okay.

676
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,040
Okay.

677
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,040
Okay.

678
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,040
It's time to end this.

679
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,040
Feng Xian.

680
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,040
Mr. Xie.

681
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,040
Qing Feng said you came to blow the wind.

682
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,040
How can you do this?

683
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,040
Go back to the room and drink the medicine.

684
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,040
This kid.

685
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,040
He has been supporting me now.

686
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,040
I care about you.

687
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,040
But if you don't persuade Mr. Xie,

688
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,040
I will kill Xue Jia.

689
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,040
Mr. Xie is right.

690
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,040
Xue Yuan won't be a traitor.

691
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,040
The evidence of the firecrackers

692
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,040
is gone.

693
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,040
Now we can't prove it.

694
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,040
We need to be careful.

695
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,040
My Lord.

696
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,040
It's getting cold.

697
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,040
Let's go back to the room and drink the medicine.

698
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,040
If you don't mind, I'll leave first.

699
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,040
Mr. Xie.

700
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,040
Yes.

701
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,040
This tree hasn't bloomed for years.

702
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:11,040
But I believe it hasn't died.

703
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,040
If it blooms again,

704
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,040
I'll ask Mr. Xie to close it.

705
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,040
Okay.

706
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,040
Did you ask Mr. Xie?

707
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,040
Why did he drink this?

708
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,040
I always think he's not nice to me.

709
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,040
All these years,

710
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,040
how Xue Jia has been doing this,

711
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,040
he's been watching it all.

712
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,040
Mr. Xie is a highly-rated man.

713
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,040
He's just a good man.

714
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,040
He's a man of integrity.

715
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,040
He's a man of integrity.

716
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,040
He's a man of integrity.

717
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,040
He's just kind.

718
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,040
You just need to thank me.

719
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,040
I need to think about it.

720
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,040
Yes.

721
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,040
Mr. Xie.

722
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,040
The people from the East Zhou Camp

723
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,040
have been eliminated.

724
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,040
Our men have also moved

725
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,040
the church outside the city to a secret place.

726
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,040
There's nothing left to do with the soldiers.

727
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,040
Nothing?

728
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,040
If I hadn't reacted in time,

729
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,040
things would have been in vain.

730
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,040
The Empress Dowager and His Majesty would have gone there.

731
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,040
I'm sorry, Mr. Xie.

732
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,040
Yan'er, last night,

733
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,040
I asked you to bring Xing Wei

734
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,040
to the city to search for the people of the Nidang.

735
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,040
He's been in the trouble of Yan's family.

736
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,040
But why didn't Yan's family

737
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,040
tell us anything today?

738
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,040
Father,

739
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,040
that old man is a regular man.

740
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,040
He's not that easy to die.

741
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,040
This time, we let him get sick.

742
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,040
He's always in good health.

743
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,040
He doesn't even dare to fight with his life.

744
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,040
He must be afraid of him.

745
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,040
Don't worry too much, Duke.

746
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,040
We'll take the assassins' lives

747
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,040
and put them on the Nidang's head.

748
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,040
We'll find out

749
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,040
who can't find our fault.

750
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,040
That's a good idea.

751
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,040
But Yan Mu's old man

752
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,040
is that easy to forget?

753
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,040
It's always strange to think about it.

754
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,040
Yan'er,

755
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,040
you didn't find anything

756
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,040
that's abnormal?

757
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,040
What's abnormal?

758
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,040
There's one.

759
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,040
Last night,

760
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,040
no one came to the city.

761
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,040
But Xing Wei said

762
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,040
he met Xie Shao Shi

763
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,040
near the hospital nearby.

764
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,040
Xie Wei?

765
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,040
He was the chief of the medical department.

766
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,040
Then it was the time of Cao Yun's survival.

767
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,040
Then it was Han Lin Yuan's man.

768
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,040
Now, he's even caught the Nidang

769
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,040
and his wife.

770
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,040
What's the purpose of this?

771
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,040
What's the purpose?

772
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,040
Father,

773
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,040
he's just a scholar.

774
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,040
He's just a scholar.

775
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,040
He's just a scholar.

776
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,040
Let's ask him

777
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,040
what's the purpose of this.

778
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,040
Then we'll know.

779
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,040
Duke,

780
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,040
I think you're right.

781
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,040
Xie Shao Shi is a good man.

782
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,040
But he's not a real man.

783
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,040
He's a good man.

784
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,040
But he's not a good man.

785
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,040
If we can deal with him,

786
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,040
there's nothing to blame

787
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,040
in the country or city.

788
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,040
Keep talking.

789
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,040
Thanks to paltry着一心,

790
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,040
he's not just good person

791
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,040
I hope We can

792
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,240
cherish male част кам

793
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,040
and purify our past.

794
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,040
Let's wait for the gives

795
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,040
to begin his journey.

796
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,760
Help him

797
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,040
while he can get himself to normal.

798
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,040
Doesn't it always happen

799
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,480
when we have time

800
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,040
but to get a piece of it?

801
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,040
His Majesty 들어�ards him

802
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,240
It's because he never fights for power.

803
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,960
But if His Majesty also doubts him,

804
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,320
then it's different.

805
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,600
What?

806
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,680
Let me see.

807
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,280
Just look at...

808
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,240
Ah...

809
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:34,840
No.

810
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,280
No way!

811
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,040
Don't move the whole plate.

812
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,640
Why?

813
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,280
It's not good.

814
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,920
Xing, here.

815
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,640
ばい

816
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,160
It's said

817
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,120
that you haven't seen Master Xie for days

818
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:55,840
Yes

819
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,000
He doesn't even teach you

820
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:12,840
Although Xב', you are full of excellent

821
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,240
Maybe that's the reason.

822
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,400
Tomorrow, you'll be going out to the palace to rest.

823
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,680
You can't see him for a few days.

824
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,400
Why don't we go to the garden to make some fruit tea?

825
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,600
How about having some at night?

826
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,960
Okay.

827
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,840
But you can arrange it.

828
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,680
Thank you, Qing.

829
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,800
Don't you know that I'm very serious?

830
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,880
Your Majesty loves me.

831
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,160
It's because I've never been so suspicious of you.

832
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,680
If you just want to win,

833
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,440
I can change the person to be with you.

834
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,640
I heard that

835
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,880
you've seen Zhang Zhe's behavior.

836
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,440
You didn't even invite him to the wedding.

837
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,760
But he's been doing well.

838
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,160
He's getting married in a few days.

839
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,040
You're making trouble for him.

840
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,600
I appreciate that someone likes you.

841
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,200
Thanks, Your Majesty.

842
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,440
But I realised

843
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,000
if I go to the East's world,

844
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,200
it'll not let me down forever.

845
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,720
He's very així.

846
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,600
No one knows what's in his mind every day.

847
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,400
You're so old that you don't even take care of your family.

848
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,560
What did he take onto himself?

849
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,160
He was born before my parents.

850
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,720
We all live in a stony family.

851
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,920
Even if the General has been hypnotized, he won't be able to save her.

852
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,320
Maybe...

853
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,920
I'm afraid that you might have trouble.

854
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,120
I can't believe that

855
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,520
Xie Qing has learned to joke around.

856
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,920
Miss Fang, give it to me.

857
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,520
I'll climb over there.

858
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,920
Don't run away.

859
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,320
Greetings, Your Highness.

860
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,320
Greetings, Your Highness.

861
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,920
Sir.

862
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,520
I thought it was a cold illness.

863
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,920
So you had time to drink tea, but you didn't have time to class.

864
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:38,120
Zhan Ting's uncle said that you wanted to enter the palace a few days ago.

865
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,920
You also met the new guard of the search department.

866
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,920
Yes.

867
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,120
A few days ago, I left the Qin in the palace.

868
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,920
I wanted to come back and get it.

869
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,720
But on the way, I forgot the time to get the song.

870
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,720
I came here after dawn.

871
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,120
Xie Qing loves Qin so much.

872
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,720
Guo Zhen is a lover.

873
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,520
Miss Jiang.

874
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,120
Zheng Bao?

875
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,120
Why are you here?

876
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,920
Miss Jiang, the maid who married you to the Tai An Palace is dead.

877
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,320
I want to see you.

878
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,920
Dead?

879
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,320
They just want to keep my mouth shut and make things worse.

880
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,920
It's a good idea.

881
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,320
This is what Eunuch Wang should have told you.

882
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,120
But I'm worried that you might not be able to do it.

883
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,320
So I'm here to take the risk.

884
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,920
Miss, please listen to me.

885
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,120
What do you mean?

886
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,720
Since the crime of the night,

887
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,920
Empress Dowager is always talking about you in front of His Majesty.

888
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,920
She said that you were in a bad mood.

889
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,920
But His Majesty thinks that you were the one who was guilty.

890
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,520
He ordered the Immortal Star Bureau to investigate.

891
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,320
That night was a risk.

892
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,920
I couldn't offend Empress Dowager to beg for mercy.

893
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:56,120
It's not surprising that Empress Dowager treats me like this.

894
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,320
Don't worry. I know how to deal with this.

895
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,520
I won't take the risk and offend His Majesty.

896
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:07,320
You were the one who invited me that night?

897
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,720
Thank you.

898
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,920
Miss, I'm not to be polite.

899
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,320
By the way, Miss Jiang,

900
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,720
there's one more thing I need to tell you.

901
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,720
Today, Duke Ding often comes to the Imperial Library.

902
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,920
Yan Yu has the intention of meeting with the Immortal Star Bureau and His Majesty.

903
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,520
Xie Wei?

904
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:29,520
Did you notice him?

905
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,520
Get up.

906
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,920
Yes.

907
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,520
I promised to give you an explanation.

908
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:44,920
It's just that this person is not able to handle the case without committing suicide.

909
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,520
But the Immortal Star Bureau has been investigating something a few days ago.

910
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:54,520
This palace maid should be the one who was in the palace secretly.

911
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,920
secretly?

912
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,120
What? What do you mean?

913
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,520
Replying to the Emperor, I just didn't expect

914
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,920
that Yang Zhi Zhai would actually have a rebellion.

915
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,720
Luckily, this person is dead.

916
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,920
Otherwise, I'm afraid that it will be hard for them to treat him well.

917
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,520
You are in the palace.

918
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,720
It's a rebellion. What's the fear?

919
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,520
Thanks to the Emperor's tolerance for the female host,

920
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,720
if I were a weak woman, I would have to ruin their plan.

921
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,720
This crisis won't be caused by the rebellion and the family.

922
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,920
This is not good.

923
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,920
The Emperor's rule in the previous court was also a matter of design and court.

924
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,820
It was a total failure.

925
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:32,720
Miss Jiang Er also suffered a lot of grievances in this matter.

926
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,920
How about this? Tomorrow, I will ask Wang Xin Yi to go to the Inner Affairs Bureau

927
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,720
and ask her to give the reward for Miss Jiang Er's favor.

928
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,320
Thank you, Your Majesty.

929
00:45:53,720 --> 00:46:01,120
I thought that letting go is the best choice to make.

930
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:08,720
I was in the wind, but I was chasing after the dream that I couldn't open.

931
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:18,520
But I was drifting away in the snow.

932
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:34,520
I was drifting away in the snow.

933
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:50,520
I was drifting away in the snow.
