00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
As long as I can enter the Ning'an Palace

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,200
and pay all the price

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,600
I will be willing to do so.

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,400
The End

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,800
The End

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,800
Everything seems to be a dream.

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,400
I have owed a lot of people.

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,800
Chaozhe, help me.

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,600
I will be a good person after this.

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
The End

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
I will be the one to take the favor.

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,800
There are some things you can't give me.

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
But what about them?

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,000
The life you chose is for Mr. You.

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,400
In this world, everyone has the right to escape.

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,000
But I can't.

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,000
I want to regret it.

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,400
I will do my best to return.

20
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,400
Does Mr. Zhang believe that everything is decided?

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,200
I would rather believe in the future.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,200
Congratulations, Your Highness.

23
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,000
Congratulations, Your Highness.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,400
We are all in the same boat.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,200
Ning'an, what are you doing?

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,200
In the end,

27
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,800
there is a pair of invisible hands

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,800
that can break everything.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,600
The revenge is long.

30
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,800
Who are you?

31
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,800
The Emperor of the mortal world is so long-winded.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,200
He is so absurd.

33
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,800
A rapist that can defeat you.

34
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,800
Congressman

35
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,900
Episode 23

36
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,800
Please enjoy沒事 Like a dream

37
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,840
Children don't like food

38
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,280
Do not可以用龍睦壯鼓顆粒

39
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,480
Dragon睦壯鼓顆粒

40
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,160
Welcome to enjoy没事

41
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,160
You're still in good health. Can't you take a rest for a few more days?

42
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,160
You still have a lot of things to do, so you can't wait.

43
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,160
Sir, Baigu Temple has already followed your orders.

44
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,160
It's not good.

45
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,160
It's time to enter the palace.

46
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,160
Why would he die in the back of Baigu Temple?

47
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,160
It seems that he died a few days ago.

48
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,160
The dead monk found him in the grass.

49
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,160
He immediately reported to the government.

50
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,160
But there's no suspicious person around.

51
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,160
Did the identity match? Are you sure it's the rebel?

52
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,160
We caught the rebel before and found a lot of things.

53
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,160
Including their appearance.

54
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,160
We matched those corpses with the image.

55
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,160
It's really the rebel.

56
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,160
And the one with the Pingnan King's weapon, the jade pendant,

57
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,160
is the justice doctor.

58
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,160
We made a big contribution.

59
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,160
The dead monk is on the third floor.

60
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,160
It looks like he's buried by the army.

61
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,160
But I feel that there's something strange about it.

62
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,160
Let's take a look at this.

63
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,160
This is the evidence of the attack on the city.

64
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,160
The records are all the evidence of the rebel in the capital.

65
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,160
We found the same evidence.

66
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,160
But the Ministry of Justice is investigating the rebel.

67
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,160
He immediately sent the dead to the door.

68
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,160
It looks like someone did it on purpose.

69
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,160
Why do you care so much?

70
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,160
We just need to find out the evidence.

71
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,160
We'll know what's going on.

72
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,160
Oh, right.

73
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,160
You're not from the capital.

74
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
Maybe you don't know that this place

75
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,000
is the place where the Pingnan King buried the dead

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,160
for 300 years.

77
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,160
There were people who came to worship earlier.

78
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,160
Look, it's all gone.

79
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,160
Only the dead monks come here to get grass.

80
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,160
Let's go back.

81
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,160
The evil sects are all here.

82
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,160
What a bunch of impulsive bandits.

83
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,160
They're so reckless.

84
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,160
They're really rich.

85
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,160
Okay, okay.

86
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,160
If we can get rid of the local area,

87
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,160
we'll have no chance to get rid of the Pingnan King.

88
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,160
Your Majesty,

89
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,160
it's not long before Mr. Zhang's case is over.

90
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,160
But he's so skilled and capable.

91
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,160
Besides, the case of the rebel

92
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,160
needs Mr. Zhang to continue to work on it.

93
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,160
Why don't we add the confession to this attack?

94
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,160
You're right.

95
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,160
I'll now give the letter to Mr. Zhang

96
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,160
to clean up the case.

97
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

98
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,160
What a pity.

99
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,160
What we got here is just the information

100
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,160
from the nearby capital.

101
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,160
If we can capture the city,

102
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,160
we'll definitely find out more about it.

103
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,160
You're the one who should be the next.

104
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,160
If we can capture this person, it's good.

105
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,160
But if he dies,

106
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,160
we might not be able to send him to the court.

107
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,160
What do you think, Mr. Xie?

108
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,160
I didn't say anything just now.

109
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,160
But I have a point when you said it.

110
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,160
It's just a bit risky.

111
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,160
What's your point?

112
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,160
Only the court and the government know

113
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,160
about the news about the death of Gong Yicheng.

114
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,160
If we pretend that Gong Yicheng is dead,

115
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,160
the court will arrest him and interrogate him.

116
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,160
They're afraid that the secret leak will send people to rescue him.

117
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,160
So we just need to send people to bury him

118
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,160
and then we can go to the court.

119
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,160
Or we can make it more risky.

120
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,160
What's more risky?

121
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,160
I don't know if you've heard of the name of Du Junshan.

122
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,160
What Mr. Xie said is the name of the head of the Pingnan King.

123
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,160
Yes.

124
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,160
The court has arrested some rebels.

125
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,160
The officials mentioned Du Junshan.

126
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,160
They said the secret leak was very risky.

127
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,160
But the King of Pingnan and his men are very happy.

128
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,160
The rebels haven't seen him.

129
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:02,160
So I think if we send someone to kill Du Junshan

130
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,160
and wait for him to rescue Gong Yicheng,

131
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,160
then we can find more details.

132
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,160
Xie Qing is very clever.

133
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,160
The rebels are so cunning that they can't do anything.

134
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,160
But the people who pretend to be the enemy are very dangerous.

135
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,160
They want to find out the people and find the evidence.

136
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,160
It's not a matter of consciousness.

137
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,160
If we think of it as Mr. Xie's idea,

138
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
we should take it as a first step.

139
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,160
If Mr. Xie's life is in danger,

140
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,160
the court will know the truth.

141
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,160
If we pretend to be the enemy,

142
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,160
we will be in a lot of trouble.

143
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,160
I have a choice.

144
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,160
This person is very clever.

145
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,160
Maybe he is useful to know more about the rebels.

146
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,160
Who is the man in the letter?

147
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,160
Zhang Zhe.

148
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,160
I am willing to accept this.

149
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,160
I am willing to accept this.

150
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,160
Today, I suddenly asked you to take the opportunity

151
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,160
to pretend to be Du Junshan.

152
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,160
I didn't discuss it with you.

153
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,160
You can take it as a suggestion.

154
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,160
Mr. Xie can't predict anything today.

155
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,160
Of course, he can't do it.

156
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,160
Everything can only be changed randomly.

157
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,160
It's a good thing if we can find out everything.

158
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,160
I have no other suggestions.

159
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,160
I was thinking about why he proposed this plan.

160
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,160
It was planned according to your plan.

161
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,160
The execution is not easy.

162
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,160
The execution is not easy.

163
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,160
Then, we can follow the person who sent the men to rescue the Prince

164
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,160
and follow the location of Tongzhou.

165
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,160
Then, we can eliminate the Prince.

166
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,160
We can also take the credit of the court.

167
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,160
We can take the letter from Marquis Yan

168
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,160
to take the men from Tongzhou.

169
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,160
Now, it's good.

170
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,160
Zhang Zhe is so close to the middle.

171
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,160
I'm afraid he is in a bad mood.

172
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,160
Mr. Xie,

173
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
he is so loyal to the imperial family.

174
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,160
He is so loyal to the imperial family.

175
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,160
He is so loyal to the imperial family.

176
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,160
I don't know what he is thinking.

177
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,160
But this time,

178
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,160
I will deceive you.

179
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,160
I am sorry for your indifference.

180
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,160
I am serious.

181
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,160
But I am afraid you will be deceived.

182
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,160
I will take the credit of the court.

183
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,160
Otherwise, we can give him to you.

184
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,160
No.

185
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,160
Why?

186
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,160
If you let him do this again,

187
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,160
it will be a threat.

188
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,160
He will be helpless.

189
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,160
It's my fault.

190
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,160
The interrogation will make me take the control.

191
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,160
Zhang Zhe is the official of the imperial family.

192
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,160
If he is not in the hands of the people,

193
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,160
I will be responsible for him.

194
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,160
Let's take a look.

195
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,160
Let's see what he can find.

196
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,160
No.

197
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,160
You let him do the same.

198
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,160
This is not your style.

199
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,160
No.

200
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,160
You.

201
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,160
You keep talking.

202
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,160
Don't hide it.

203
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,160
You need me to do something.

204
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,160
You should give me an explanation.

205
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,160
Be careful.

206
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,160
Be careful.

207
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,160
Be careful.

208
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,160
Be careful.

209
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,160
Be careful.

210
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,160
Be careful.

211
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,160
Be careful.

212
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,160
Be careful.

213
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,160
Be careful.

214
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,160
You can see it clearly.

215
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,160
It's really the royal money.

216
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,160
It's a thousand thousand.

217
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,160
They are now in the Qing House in the south of the corner.

218
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,160
I followed the royal money in the dark to investigate.

219
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,160
I heard that they have surrounded several rooms.

220
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,160
The people who came will not be in the operation.

221
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,160
The royal money is the guard who the prince arranged.

222
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,160
Ping Su will never leave Jinling.

223
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,160
He came to the capital at this time.

224
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
Unless...

225
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,160
He is also here.

226
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,160
I am worried about

227
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,160
how to send out the news about Gong Yi Chen's trap in the prison.

228
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,160
He is here.

229
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,160
He is sleeping.

230
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,160
He is almost late.

231
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,160
Uncle Jin.

232
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,160
Get the car and go out.

233
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,160
Yes.

234
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,160
You were so good last night.

235
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,160
I was so heartless.

236
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,160
How about we go eat something first?

237
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,160
How to eat?

238
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,160
I hate it.

239
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,160
It's okay.

240
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,160
Old Huang.

241
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
You can knock the door.

242
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
Wait for me.

243
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,160
Childe Ding Wei.

244
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,160
Childe Ding Wei.

245
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,160
The prince asked us to do the mission.

246
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,160
You are making a fool of yourself.

247
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,160
What's the use of it?

248
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,160
Why are you making a fool of yourself?

249
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,160
It's a serious matter.

250
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,160
Besides, you won't do the external affairs.

251
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,160
I will do it myself.

252
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,160
Why do you bring me here?

253
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,160
Do you understand?

254
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,160
The prince has orders.

255
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,160
Stop.

256
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,160
Don't be so busy every day.

257
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,160
It's useless to me.

258
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,160
Xian Xian, let's go.

259
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,160
You don't want to go?

260
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,160
Fine.

261
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,160
I will go.

262
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,160
Yan Da.

263
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,160
Yan Da.

264
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,160
Yan Da.

265
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,160
Xiaowen.

266
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,160
Xiaowen.

267
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,160
Xiaowen.

268
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,160
Let's go.

269
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,160
Don't touch me.

270
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,160
Don't touch me.

271
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,160
Don't touch me.

272
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
Sir.

273
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,160
We are old friends.

274
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,160
We meet each other every time.

275
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,160
We are in love.

276
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,160
Come here.

277
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,160
But you are a courtier.

278
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,160
You come here to be a witness.

279
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,160
Is it inappropriate?

280
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
Why are you here?

281
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
It's not what I want.

282
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,160
It's the prince.

283
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,160
I have seen you for a long time.

284
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,160
I'm afraid you will betray me.

285
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
He asked me to come to Qingcheng to check your identity.

286
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
He said if you really betray me,

287
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,160
I will take your identity as the heir.

288
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,160
I told you that

289
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,160
there will be one person who will be the heir.

290
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
If my identity is taken as the heir,

291
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
how long do you think you can live?

292
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,160
That's right.

293
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,160
I'm your heir.

294
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,160
I'm like you.

295
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,160
You are old now.

296
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,160
You are so young.

297
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,160
You are not in good health.

298
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,160
I'm so rich.

299
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,160
I'm looking forward to you.

300
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,160
Don't talk to me like that.

301
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,160
If you want to take me,

302
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,160
write a letter to the courtier.

303
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,160
You need to send your signature to me.

304
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,160
I'm not loyal.

305
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,160
But the most worried thing for you is

306
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,160
the place of the contest.

307
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
Oh, right.

308
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,160
The king also gave me a letter.

309
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,160
He said he would take Yanling's life.

310
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,160
Where is the letter?

311
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,160
I lost it.

312
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,160
Uncle Jian.

313
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,160
Don't.

314
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,160
Miss Jiang.

315
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Don't talk too much.

316
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,160
You came to me so late.

317
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,160
What happened to Yanling?

318
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,160
Why didn't you tell me

319
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,160
about sogar for me?

320
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,160
That's right.

321
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,160
When I fez it tonight,

322
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,160
I found someone

323
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,160
smashed by the gate of Xiumen.

324
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,160
I took it back.

325
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,160
It's always in Pingnan King's tomb.

326
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,160
The prison guards.

327
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,160
The prison guards?

328
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,160
He is...

329
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,960
You should have brought back the five-star healing device.

330
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
Why did you come to look for me?

331
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,560
Yeah, that's what you should do.

332
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,560
But I just...

333
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,360
This person told me

334
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,960
that he had the key to the secret room

335
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,760
and the key to the secret room of Pingnan King.

336
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,760
Did you get the key?

337
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,360
No.

338
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,360
I just came to pick up the key.

339
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,560
I didn't bring anything.

340
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,960
Where is he?

341
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,960
Take me to see him.

342
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,560
Why did you come back?

343
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,160
I was not in a good mood.

344
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,360
I'm afraid that it's not good for others to hear it.

345
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,360
I saw Miss.

346
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,360
Your Highness,

347
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,160
there's nothing for you here.

348
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,960
You should go back first.

349
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,560
Okay.

350
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,560
I'll send you to the interrogation room.

351
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,160
I'll make sure that the information is leaked.

352
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,560
And their plan.

353
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,360
Okay.

354
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,960
I've told you everything.

355
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,360
You're not here.

356
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,560
What else do you want?

357
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,360
You're in the capital and you're still open.

358
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,960
But you must have a connection.

359
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,760
Two things.

360
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,960
First, your party is there.

361
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,960
Second,

362
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,760
the new subordinate is there.

363
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,960
I'll keep you alive

364
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,360
if I make it clear.

365
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,160
I don't understand.

366
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,560
Xing Wei has a way to make you guilty.

367
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,960
I'm just a thief.

368
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,560
I don't know anything else.

369
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,360
They only told me to pick up the news from Xing Wei.

370
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,360
Then,

371
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,760
they put the information that the interrogation room was in

372
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,160
the Bikers Street.

373
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,760
They didn't know anything else.

374
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,160
If they only sent you to the interrogation room,

375
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,160
why do you need to tell them the details?

376
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,560
If you still want to lie,

377
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,960
aren't you afraid of death?

378
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,360
You're still taking it?

379
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,760
Please forgive me.

380
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,360
Please forgive me.

381
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,960
It's really not my fault.

382
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,160
His Highness doesn't trust you.

383
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,560
He doesn't trust Gong Yi Cheng.

384
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,160
Only Shang Man Feng is the one who gave Gong Yi Cheng the heart.

385
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,560
It's been a long time since he's been in the war.

386
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,160
That's why he pushed me out.

387
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,560
I know you want to protect Yan family.

388
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,560
So I don't dare to take this letter.

389
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,760
Then?

390
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,560
Then I gave this letter to someone else.

391
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,360
I'm not just pretending.

392
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,760
Even if I make a mistake,

393
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,560
it won't be on my head.

394
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,960
But I didn't expect

395
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,360
that the person who took it was Gong Yi Cheng's subordinate.

396
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,960
He didn't listen to me at all.

397
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,960
I guess he wanted to take the thing

398
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,960
and go to Gong Yi Cheng's palace.

399
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,360
So he ran away.

400
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,760
You're smart.

401
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,160
But you have to know that

402
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,160
if His Highness knows this,

403
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,760
he will be dead many times.

404
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,960
Sir,

405
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,560
my few bullets are about to be killed.

406
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,760
I didn't even dare to kick Huang Qian's ass.

407
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,960
Sir,

408
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,560
I beg you to save me.

409
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,360
As long as you can keep my head

410
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,160
and let me do anything,

411
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,160
I want to come to the capital to find Gong Yi Cheng.

412
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,360
Then I'll give the letter to the Duke of Xue.

413
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,960
But after I enter the capital,

414
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,160
I can't contact the Duke of Xue.

415
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,560
I can't give the letter to Duke of Xue.

416
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,560
We have a very unfamiliar life.

417
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,760
We're afraid that we'll cause trouble

418
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,160
if we act rashly.

419
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,560
We have to be careful.

420
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,160
So I'll go to the Duke of Xue.

421
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,760
Then I'll find a suitable opportunity

422
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,360
to hand the letter to him.

423
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,760
If you don't need to say it,

424
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,560
the letter should be in your brother's hands.

425
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,960
As long as you tell them

426
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,160
to find out the Duke of Xue's whereabouts,

427
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,560
they'll give you the letter, right?

428
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,360
This...

429
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,160
I'm just asking you.

430
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,160
That's not true.

431
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,960
Yes.

432
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,160
Then it's better.

433
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,360
Mr. Zhou,

434
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,560
according to what I said,

435
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,760
you want him to write a letter

436
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,360
and send it to the White Fruit Temple tonight.

437
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,560
To clean the spirit.

438
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,760
No! No!

439
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,160
I know it.

440
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,960
I'm not sure.

441
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,960
Miss,

442
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,560
why don't you

443
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,560
go back to your room?

444
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,960
Miss,

445
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,760
please be quiet.

446
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,960
Be careful.

447
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,160
If there's any trouble,

448
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,360
come to me immediately.

449
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,360
Mr. Zhou,

450
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,960
when you reported to Duke of Ding

451
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,560
that it was about the Yan family,

452
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,560
it was reported that it was unwell.

453
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,360
But this letter

454
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,760
can't be done.

455
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,760
I understand.

456
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,760
Mr. Zhou,

457
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,760
who are we going to catch?

458
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,760
We've been hunting for two days.

459
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,760
Is there any big problem?

460
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,760
Don't ask if you shouldn't.

461
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,760
It's all the arrangement.

462
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,360
If we're caught,

463
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,360
we'll have to keep going.

464
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,360
What's the big deal?

465
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,160
Don't ask if you shouldn't.

466
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,960
It's all the arrangement.

467
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,360
If we're caught,

468
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,960
we'll have to keep going.

469
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,360
If we ask the other people to go out and enabled us

470
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,360
to go on and garden,

471
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,360
whoever we stole from,

472
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,960
and remain silent.

473
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,360
Let's leave now.

474
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,960
Both of you,

475
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,360
calm down.

476
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,960
Let's stay here a while more.

477
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,360
What did you say?

478
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,760
This poor girl...

479
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,760
I'm so happy.

480
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,760
I'm lucky.

481
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,760
I'm not worthy of your action.

482
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,760
But the one you took away

483
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,760
is a white paper.

484
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,760
If I die today,

485
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,760
I'm afraid you won't be able to see

486
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,760
what I have in my hands.

487
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,760
How did they find out?

488
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,760
The letter written by the rebel Qi Xian

489
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,760
didn't add their return to the letter.

490
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,760
They knew it was a trap.

491
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,760
But these people

492
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,760
haven't been in the capital for a long time

493
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,760
and can't reach the public.

494
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,760
They even have a plan to make a fortune.

495
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,760
How much do they want?

496
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,760
50,000 taels of silver.

497
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,760
They'll pay for it in three days.

498
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,760
If we don't buy it,

499
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,760
they'll knock down the country's main office.

500
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,760
These rebels are so stubborn.

501
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,760
It's my fault.

502
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,760
I couldn't have made these people

503
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,760
lose their chance earlier.

504
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,760
It's better now.

505
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,760
They'll get their nose stuck.

506
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,760
It's not easy.

507
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,760
Tang Er,

508
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,760
you took this sedan

509
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,760
and sold it to the Yuhuang House.

510
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,760
Did you sell it too?

511
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,760
You're not going to keep it for a few years?

512
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,760
We'll talk about the future

513
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,760
when we get to the point.

514
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,760
Remember,

515
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,760
no matter what,

516
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,760
you must go to the Yuhuang House.

517
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,760
Sell it to the Yuhuang House.

518
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,760
Got it?

519
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,760
Is there any news from Xue Dingfei?

520
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,760
I didn't find the letter.

521
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,760
But

522
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,760
there's a message.

523
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,760
What's going on?

524
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,760
It's from Jiang's maid.

525
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,760
She took it and sold it.

526
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,760
I think

527
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,760
you should

528
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,760
give it to Xia Zheng.

529
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,760
He won't learn it from you.

530
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,760
This is Yan Ling's gift.

531
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,760
Even if he's a little girl,

532
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,760
he can't sell it to her.

533
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,760
What's going on?

534
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,760
Isn't it the most clear news?

535
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,760
What?

536
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,760
After that night,

537
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,760
she didn't tell you anything?

538
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,760
You're so smart.

539
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,760
Why did you get a little girl

540
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,760
to sell it?

541
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,760
I'm not a girl.

542
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,760
I'm not a girl.

543
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,760
Why did you get a little girl

544
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,760
to sell it?

545
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,760
Fine.

546
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,760
I won't say it.

547
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,760
I won't say it.

548
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,760
You and You Fangying

549
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,760
went to the Yuhuang House to find out.

550
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,760
If she really uses money,

551
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,760
she'll use the money of Yan Jing.

552
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,760
My Xie Shaoshi,

553
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,760
you're asking me to do something.

554
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,760
If you don't want to,

555
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,760
how about the money from the other few?

556
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,760
I do.

557
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,760
We're the same.

558
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,760
I don't want anything.

559
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,760
Let's go.

560
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,760
You!!

561
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,760
You really have no money left.

562
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,760
Leave it to me.

563
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,760
No way.

564
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,760
She said

565
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,760
it was our晚上 responsible for

566
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,760
the external money.

567
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,760
Aren't you sure

568
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,760
if you're doing business.

569
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,760
Because of the hardware,

570
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,760
how did you get under?

571
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,760
I can help you to manage your business.

572
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,760
You mean I'm an old folks.

573
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,760
Please, let me see it.

574
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,760
This way.

575
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,660
Needless to help you,

576
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,060
They are all outsiders.

577
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,260
Boss Li, I am grateful to you.

578
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,460
But I am entrusted with the fate of the people.

579
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,060
If you get the money today,

580
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,660
then what if someone makes me disobey Boss Li?

581
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,460
What should I do?

582
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,660
I said one thing.

583
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,460
You even said you are stupid.

584
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:13,460
I think you are the most clever.

585
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,660
You...

586
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,260
Let me tell you the truth.

587
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:27,260
Jiang Fu took out many things and sold them to the first family.

588
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:30,860
Even Yan Lin gave her a piece of money and sold them.

589
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,660
I am afraid that Miss Jiang will encounter something difficult this time.

590
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,060
It's not easy for us to talk about it.

591
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:41,060
I know you really care about her.

592
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,660
But I am not in the same position as Xie Wei.

593
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,460
How about this? I can not read the account book.

594
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:51,060
But you must tell me what happened to her.

595
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,860
Father, did I do anything wrong the other day?

596
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,060
Those things are very expensive.

597
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,660
But we are too anxious.

598
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:06,460
It's not good to be taken advantage of by others.

599
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,460
But it's good.

600
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,860
It's only 25,000 taels.

601
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,060
They are all here.

602
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,460
There are so many?

603
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,060
Yan Lin, these years,

604
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:23,060
he has been so kind to you.

605
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,860
If it weren't for the people in the Zohua, you would have married now.

606
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:33,260
I only have friends in Yan Lin.

607
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:37,660
I only hope that these silver can really help him.

608
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,460
This morning, Miss Jiang went to the prison.

609
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:52,060
She stole 20,000 taels from the watch in the oil-resistant film.

610
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,260
I heard that the spirit of the god is still very cold.

611
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:58,860
Not only that, I also heard from some friends in the Zohua store.

612
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:04,460
Jiang Jiang, she took out something that was almost 20,000 taels recently.

613
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,660
She is still not willing to pay for it.

614
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:16,460
Sir, don't you want to be a god for others' sake?

615
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,060
Only a Xue Ding Fei and a jiaofei of the court

616
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,660
have enough to make you feel guilty.

617
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,860
Miss Jiang is not a beast. Why are you...

618
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,060
Sir, how is it?

619
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,660
The person who stole the letter hasn't found it yet.

620
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,860
I said another one.

621
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,460
These days, Miss Jiang and Zhou Ying Zhi have met frequently.

622
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,260
It seems that they are having a conversation.

623
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,660
Please, Uncle Jin.

624
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,860
You two are looking for Jiang Fu and Zhou Ying Zhi.

625
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,060
Especially Zhou Ying Zhi.

626
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,860
What do you want to do?

627
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,660
You must go through her hand.

628
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,660
Yes.

629
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,260
Yes.

630
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,860
There are 50,000 silver tickets here.

631
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:02,860
When you go to pay for the money tonight, you must lower the situation.

632
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,860
Now the Yan family is being sentenced to release. If this is a big deal,

633
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,260
you must reconsider and make a crime of killing.

634
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,860
Second, after you get the letter, you must be careful with the inspection.

635
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:15,860
If they teach you to seal the copy, you must immediately put it down and come to me.

636
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:20,260
Remember, the content of the letter must not be given to others anymore.

637
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,660
Yes, I know that.

638
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,260
These are for you and your brothers.

639
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,860
I know that you are not doing anything wrong.

640
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,260
You must be more careful with this big deal.

641
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,260
Then, thank you, Miss Jiang.

642
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:39,260
After tonight's trial, will you continue to keep an eye on those scams?

643
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,060
You just do what I tell you.

644
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:44,060
I will arrange the rest later.

645
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,660
Okay.

646
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,660
Here you are.

647
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,460
Check it.

648
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:55,860
Me, too.

649
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,860
Never mind it.

650
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,460
I can't control myself but you should be kind to me.

651
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,160
Master Zhou?

652
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,260
Why have you chosen hands with money?

653
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,460
Don't getélirl.

654
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,060
Just get back and pay for your until death.

655
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,260
I'm not saying that.

656
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,060
The people in the capital are rich.

657
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,460
They're worth 50,000 taels.

658
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,460
We're not that good. Let's go down and drink.

659
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,460
Let's go.

660
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,060
Brother, please save me.

661
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,860
Who are you? What are you doing?

662
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,460
My master has something to ask you.

663
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,460
Please take me for a walk.

664
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,060
Mr. Wei, I've already thought about what's going on.

665
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,460
What's going on?

666
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,460
These people are not very good.

667
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,460
They're the ones who have the letter in Mr. Ding Fei's hand.

668
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,460
Where's the letter?

669
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,460
We've searched everywhere.

670
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,660
We haven't found any letters.

671
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,860
We've searched all the money.

672
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,060
The leader said that the letter was given to a man named Wei.

673
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,660
It's a matter of money.

674
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,460
The money is the money that the other person bought him.

675
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,460
That's right.

676
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,260
The things we can't find

677
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,260
are all in his hand.

678
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,060
He bought the letter

679
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,660
with Zhou Ying's support.

680
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,460
He's still young.

681
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,460
He's not a man.

682
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,060
If you didn't do it,

683
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:30,060
I don't know what those rebels would do.

684
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,660
Good boy.

685
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,660
What are you laughing at?

686
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,660
Look at it yourself.

687
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,660
What are you doing?

688
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,060
You said that you don't know how to be a man.

689
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,060
I think he's already calculated you and me.

690
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:08,060
I think he's already calculated you and me.

691
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:11,060
I think he's already calculated you and me.

692
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:14,060
I think he's already calculated you and me.

693
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:17,060
I think he's already calculated you and me.

694
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,860
Then we're going to kill each other.

695
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,860
What do you mean?

696
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,260
He deliberately took the money to the kindergarten.

697
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,660
We suspect that he really did something.

698
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,860
If it wasn't for him following the lead of the oil-firing camp,

699
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,660
and the letter in the oil-firing camp,

700
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,460
how could you tell him?

701
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,160
And the action of Zhou Ying Zhi's action,

702
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,660
the sword-sharing of the knife,

703
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,460
the sword-sharing of the knife,

704
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:45,860
I'm afraid, are all in his calculation.

705
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,860
Let's not talk about it.

706
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,260
Can we take this 50,000 taels of silver for such a short time?

707
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,660
Who knows if these rebels will take the letter

708
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,660
and sell it to others?

709
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:57,260
So we must not let them leave the capital.

710
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,260
We must make up for it.

711
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:03,260
I've already chosen the most reliable brother in the country.

712
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:06,460
But if we kill these rebels,

713
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,260
we won't be able to face a disaster.

714
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,460
The army is going to be in big trouble.

715
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,660
Last time, we had some leftover money from the oil-firing camp.

716
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,860
We took it to this man first and put it back.

717
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:20,660
We told him that I would make up for the remaining money in three days.

718
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:23,660
As for the kitchen and kitchen,

719
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,260
I have an idea.

720
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:28,460
Maybe we can let others help us with this.

721
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,460
No.

722
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,060
He's a daughter of the rule.

723
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,660
How could he be so powerful?

724
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,060
Is he powerful?

725
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,060
We can ask him tomorrow.

726
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:41,860
Uncle Jin, you should go to Jiangfu early.

727
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,660
Ask him to learn the Qin.

728
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,660
Yes.

729
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:49,060
Also, the few men from the public prison will be able to solve it quickly.

730
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:54,060
The most important thing in the time of the commemoration is to let Yan family's security be in the capital.

731
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:58,460
In the meantime, even if they have the means to make it through,

732
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,860
it's hard to break through.

733
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,060
What did you bring here?

734
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,060
You're so sad.

735
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:17,060
I want to get everything.

736
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,060
All right, you can leave.

737
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,660
We have to leave early tomorrow.

738
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,660
Yes.

739
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:36,060
The report of Consort Ding's death caused the two of them to meet.

740
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,660
The chaos that year was already over.

741
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,460
Consort Ding was the one who broke it.

742
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,660
The wife and the emperor were both dead.

743
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:47,660
This is a matter of increasing the difficulty.

744
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:51,260
I don't think it's the same as you.

745
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:54,660
But you must have known about Consort Ding's death.

746
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,860
You also said that there was still internal affection.

747
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,260
You said that everything was going to be fine.

748
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,060
In this way, you believe that

749
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,260
the power of Jinling will be in the army.

750
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,860
How can you know?

751
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,660
No wonder the Nidang would think that

752
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,660
the letter of the subordinate was holding Yan family's life.

753
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,660
In order to stabilize Prince of Pingnan,

754
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,460
the Yan family asked Consort Ding about the whereabouts of Consort Ding.

755
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,460
They wrote some fake words in the letter.

756
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:25,460
If others saw it, they would be really afraid of being the evidence of colluding with Nidang.

757
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:28,260
But with Consort Ding's kindness,

758
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:32,860
if Yan family saw it, they would think that it's better to not find it.

759
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:36,460
Your Majesty,

760
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,660
they found it.

761
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,360
Spill the soup of Puff in using your nose and go your own way.

762
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,660
You're trapped toelli.

763
00:35:55,660 --> 00:36:00,260
Why would you do none of this 수 In your mind?

764
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,860
Who would say you use that kind of gaze to lower me?

765
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,660
Your Highness, don't be angry.

766
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,460
I was just looking at you.

767
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,460
I thought you were a fairy.

768
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,860
You were so strong.

769
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,460
I thought you were my sister.

770
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:17,260
I didn't expect there to be a woman like Her Highness the Empress.

771
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,860
Shut up! How dare you offend Her Highness?

772
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,260
Her Highness the Empress, forgive me.

773
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,860
This is the crown prince who just returned from the Duke of Ding.

774
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:29,260
Today, His Majesty just gave the crown prince a title.

775
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,260
Please let Her Highness the Empress have a look.

776
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,060
Please forgive her this time.

777
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,660
It turns out to be Noble Consort Xue's brother.

778
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:42,060
It's indeed a house of pure and uneducated people.

779
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,260
Your Highness, you're right.

780
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,460
This Xue family is full of people.

781
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,660
It's really not a good thing.

782
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,060
Where did she get it from?

783
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,700
Jiang Xue Ning,

784
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,860
what else do you remember from the last time you became the Empress?

785
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,860
Forget it.

786
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:06,260
In another two years, that Xue Consort will naturally return.

787
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,460
This time, Marquis Yan is still alive.

788
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,860
There will always be a chance to meet him.

789
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,060
Xiao Ge, my daughter is asking for an introduction.

790
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,660
Please let me know.

791
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,460
Greetings, Sir.

792
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,860
Where's the letter?

793
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:44,460
Such a precious thing, you won't have it with you.

794
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,060
Then what are you doing here?

795
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,060
I'm worried that you might have something to ask.

796
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,460
You came early.

797
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,660
Didn't you even bring tea for me?

798
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,860
I think what you want isn't tea.

799
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:57,860
It's a 50,000 taels of taels.

800
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,860
And the courage of the Nidang people to exchange it.

801
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:04,060
Ning'er, you really have the ability.

802
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,660
This ability is also learned from you.

803
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:11,260
It's also good to let you taste the taste of being blinded by people in the valley.

804
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,860
That half-heartedness is important.

805
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,060
It's not that you can bring the child's blood.

806
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,060
If you plan to fall into the air,

807
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:20,760
what if Nidang or Hou Zhao will be the one to do it?

808
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,560
Ning'er, the words I told you before,

809
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,660
you forgot everything, right?

810
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,860
I...

811
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:31,660
That's why I let you know.

812
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:35,060
I told you that I'm not a God.

813
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,260
I can't talk about everything.

814
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,360
What if I do?

815
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,660
This time, I was the one who was the one who was the one to do it.

816
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,160
I also used you.

817
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,460
I apologize to you.

818
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:49,160
But Sir, you forgot some words.

819
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,660
You and I once said that we should trust each other.

820
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,560
We can communicate and have a good relationship.

821
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,560
Didn't I explain the last time?

822
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,660
What else do you want?

823
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,060
Students hope that from now on,

824
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:02,360
there will be discussion and conversation.

825
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,360
Aren't you afraid that

826
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,060
the more you know, the faster you die.

827
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,260
If I'm afraid of dying, I won't be with you for so long.

828
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,460
You can agree.

829
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,260
Give me your letter.

830
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:27,760
Actually, I can handle that letter myself.

831
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,860
I'll give it to you.

832
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,860
From now on, if you wait for the day to come,

833
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,160
and think of what Yang Feng should do...

834
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,160
I understand.

835
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,560
I will remember your teachings.

836
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,860
Thank you, Sir.

837
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,260
I'll go back now.

838
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,960
Feelings of all of it will be furthered.

839
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,560
accept you to give me some further teachings.

840
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,560
What do you see me not see?

841
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,560
I really don't understand.

842
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,560
All my всех skills are uns machten.

843
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,840
This spite-strung force,

844
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,660
weak-ное, unbe después

845
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,960
was an entirely unusual thread.

846
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,960
You're so different.

847
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,960
You're so tender.

848
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,960
He must be in a hurry.

849
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,960
Think about it.

850
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,960
Xie Juan has experienced so many things.

851
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,960
Now he has so many secrets.

852
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,960
He even writes them on the knife every day.

853
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,960
Xie Juan has been so much.

854
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,960
If you need to be clear,

855
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,960
you can't be me.

856
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,960
You can't be Dao Qing's man.

857
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,960
You?

858
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,960
We can't be you.

859
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,960
We have a high status.

860
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,960
But Jiang Xue Ning is different.

861
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,960
She is not that old.

862
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,960
But she is close to him.

863
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,960
They seem to be cold-hearted.

864
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,960
They are all affectionate people.

865
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,960
They are close to each other.

866
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,960
Maybe Xie Juan didn't know

867
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,960
what feelings she had for him.

868
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,960
But you see,

869
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,960
they will be together one day.

870
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,960
Xie Wei is so strange

871
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,960
when she meets Yan Jia.

872
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,960
They are all strange.

873
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,960
The rumors are not the truth.

874
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,960
Marquis Yan knew about it.

875
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,960
But he didn't tell the Xue family.

876
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,960
Is he the one who killed Xue Ding Fei?

877
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,960
Xie Wei killed Huang Cheng.

878
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,960
He was so close to the Xue family.

879
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,960
If Yan Lin is responsible for father and aunt,

880
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,960
what role does Xie Wei play in this?

881
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,960
Where is he?

882
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,960
Fang Xiaxin has gone.

883
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,960
He is afraid that he will be punished.

884
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,960
He doesn't dare to meet him.

885
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,960
I see. You can leave now.

886
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,960
Yes.

887
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,960
Sorry, His maid.

888
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,960
I shouldn't have been kita.

889
00:42:42,960 --> 00:43:04,080
It depends on how much they sulfate on my

890
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:08,080
My mother said that we can't cry when we're tired.

891
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,080
What do you know?

892
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,080
The rebels are outside.

893
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,080
They will kill us.

894
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,080
What are you doing?

895
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:23,080
These are the tiger shoes my uncle brought from the border.

896
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:29,080
My uncle said that all the heroes who can fight tigers are heroes.

897
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,080
His Highness and I are one.

898
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,080
In this way, we won't be afraid.

899
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,080
We can't cry.

900
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,080
My mother said that we can't cry when we're tired.

901
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,080
This is what I want.

902
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,080
We can't cry when we're tired.

903
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,080
My mother said that we can't cry when we're tired.

904
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,080
I'm not scared.

905
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,080
I'm scared.

906
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,080
I can't cry when we're tired.

907
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,080
Your Highness,

908
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,080
she has never cried since she was seven years old.

909
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,080
My son is a king.

910
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,080
She is a minister.

911
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,080
A minister died.

912
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,080
Tianjin is the capital city.

913
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,080
Mother!

914
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,080
I'm afraid I'll be late.

915
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,080
I'll be late.

916
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,080
I'll be late.

917
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,080
I'll be late.

918
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,080
I'll be late.

919
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,080
I'll be late.

920
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,080
I'll be late.

921
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,080
I'll be late.

922
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,080
I'll be late.

923
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,080
I'll be late.

924
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,080
I'll be late.

925
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,080
I'll be late.

926
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,080
I'll be late.

927
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,080
I'll be late.

928
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:09,080
I thought I'd let go of the best choice of memories.

929
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:16,080
I'm going to chase after the dream that I can't untie.

930
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:26,080
But I'm going to fall apart at the moment of snowfall.

931
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:43,080
I'm going to fall apart at the moment of snowfall.

932
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:05,080
Love is a dream.
