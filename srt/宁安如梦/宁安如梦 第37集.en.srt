2
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,520
As long as I can take over Ning'an Palace,

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,420
I'm willing to pay any price.

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,500
Cleanse the court of traitors and sycophants.

5
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,590
The cinnabar imperial brush determines one's life and death.

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,660
Everything

7
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,420
is like a dream.

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,560
I once was indebted to a lot of people.

9
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,870
Zhang Zhe, help me.

10
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,050
I'll be a good person after this.

11
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,510
I'll marry the one I spoiled.

12
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,200
There are things

13
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,850
you can't give me.

14
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,320
But he can.

15
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,130
To keep my life,

16
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,010
only you, Sir, can help me.

17
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,300
Everyone in the world is entitled to escape.

18
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,260
But I'm the only one who can't.

19
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,490
I want to do my best to make up for

20
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,750
my past regrets and wrongdoings.

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,000
Mr. Zhang, do you believe in predestination from the previous life?

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,400
I'd rather believe in what's in front of me.

23
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,170
Welcome, Your Highness.

24
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,979
Welcome, Your Highness.

25
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:48,470
Congratulations on returning to the capital of our homeland.

26
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,080
Ning'er, what are you afraid of?

27
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:53,410
But in the unfathomable,

28
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:56,150
there's always an invisible hand

29
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,710
that puts everything back to its original place.

30
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,600
You've taken revenge and paid your debts.

31
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,490
At the end of the day, who are you?

32
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,770
A bustling place, or a battleground.

33
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,380
A life of absurdity, a story of mistakes and regrets.

34
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,780
[Story of Kunning Palace]

35
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,660
[Episode 37]

36
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,370
Are you angry?

37
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,270
If it were you, you'd be angry too.

38
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,330
What are you hiding from?

39
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,390
You didn't answer me yesterday.

40
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,340
So,

41
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,740
you avoided me because you didn't want to

42
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,490
hear an answer you didn't like?

43
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,230
My plan was

44
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,060
to calm down a bit more

45
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,380
and think carefully

46
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,610
before talking to you about the future.

47
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:22,540
Look at you.

48
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,430
You ran away early in the morning.

49
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,540
I haven't figured out

50
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,730
whether I'm more at a disadvantage

51
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,829
or you.

52
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,200
So,

53
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,890
do you have the answer today?

54
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,530
Love is one thing.

55
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,690
Marriage is another thing.

56
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,440
I'm not prepared

57
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,800
to be in a marriage with you.

58
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,420
What do you need to prepare?

59
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,050
A marriage is a promise for a lifetime.

60
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,710
It's responsibility, a bond, and restraints between two people.

61
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,290
How could I forget

62
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,370
that people like you

63
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,520
yearn for a life of freedom?

64
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,710
How can you be bound?

65
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,380
That's not what I meant.

66
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:05,690
I just

67
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,400
need time to think it through.

68
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,730
Let's wait until you've made up your mind.

69
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,880
Mr. Zhang has arrived in Yuzhou.

70
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:23,360
His Majesty's decree has also been delivered.

71
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,010
If Xie Wei and Yan Lin really return to the capital,

72
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,740
what do you plan to do with them?

73
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,820
If everything goes well,

74
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,250
they will return to the capital to admit their fault

75
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,250
and give the people an explanation,

76
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,630
and I will pardon them.

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,920
Your Majesty, you are truly magnanimous.

78
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,490
Are you really not afraid

79
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,610
of Xie Wei's deviant behavior?

80
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,330
After all, what the court needs now

81
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,170
is someone who can really do things.

82
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,720
As long as he can continue to be loyal to the State of Qian,

83
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,370
why can't I

84
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,270
use him?

85
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:11,960
I don't know why

86
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,490
I've been feeling unwell

87
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,960
and coughing non-stop recently.

88
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,640
I think I can only

89
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,550
rest a little when I’m with you.

90
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,970
This means you trust me.

91
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,530
Rest assured.

92
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,540
I'll accompany you.

93
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,510
Throw away these desserts.

94
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:01,910
Also,

95
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,140
bring a message to Duke Xue.

96
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,700
Tell him we can't wait any longer.

97
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,290
It's time.

98
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,150
Yes.

99
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,650
Madam Lyu.

100
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,710
We are like old friends.

101
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:35,930
Don't be nervous.

102
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,730
You see it too,

103
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,210
but

104
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,380
I really don't want to hurt you.

105
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,640
How about this? Tell me

106
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,440
what Miss Jiang has told you about Xie Wei.

107
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,409
What's the plan?

108
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,380
I'll send you home as soon as you tell me.

109
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
How can you do this

110
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:54,930
to the lady?

111
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,320
Why are you talking about this?

112
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,900
Yes, I admit

113
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,090
that I have been indebted to the Second Young Lady,

114
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,290
but isn't everything

115
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:09,010
about using each other to get what we want?

116
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,960
I know you've been through a lot,

117
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,650
so I sincerely advise you

118
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:16,430
to choose a path that will benefit yourself.

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,860
Don't go against the Xue family.

120
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,710
Don’t protect those rebels.

121
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,970
If they are rebels,

122
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,990
then you can detain me in prison and interrogate me

123
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,960
according to the law.

124
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,840
Why are you hiding me in the Xue family for interrogation?

125
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,510
It's clearly a conspiracy.

126
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,020
Madam Lyu, you are quite smart this time.

127
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,770
I'll be frank then.

128
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,960
Duke Xue wants to find incriminating evidence of Xie Wei's side.

129
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,060
if you can provide anything,

130
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,270
I'll keep you alive.

131
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,400
I said

132
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,510
I know nothing.

133
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,620
Why can't you understand?

134
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,780
It doesn't matter whether you know or not.

135
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,620
It doesn't matter whether you're telling the truth or not.

136
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,550
As long as you're willing to say it,

137
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,250
as long as you're willing to testify,

138
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,940
you can make up any crime

139
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,010
with your status as Jiang Xuening's best friend.

140
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,070
Do you understand?

141
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,540
You won't cooperate if I speak nicely to you, right?

142
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,070
Let's try another way.

143
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,020
Don't force me.

144
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:45,030
Have you really decided to return to the capital?

145
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,960
I arranged for the Yan family to be exiled before

146
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,360
to help them avoid the scheming.

147
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,510
I sent them to the border to take over the military power

148
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,650
to save the princess and pacify the State of Yue,

149
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,440
preventing Xue Yuan from stirring trouble.

150
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,780
Fighting Lord Pingnan

151
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,300
was also to prevent Lord Pingnan

152
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,130
from cunningly escaping again.

153
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,840
Only then did I decide on the roundabout plan to pretend to attack the city.

154
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,570
This was just a temporary plan.

155
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,300
The Yan family can't and shouldn't

156
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,920
carry a criminal name forever.

157
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,850
Only by going back as soon as possible

158
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,380
can everything be settled.

159
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,830
That's all?

160
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,430
It has nothing

161
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,240
to do with Miss Jiang?

162
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:31,960
it's not fair to her

163
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,460
for us to loiter here.

164
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,490
She shouldn't be mistaken as a rebel

165
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,770
with us.

166
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,370
If we can send her home secretly,

167
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,710
she and the Jiang family will be safe.

168
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,070
Your You Fangyin too.

169
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,810
If my relationship with you

170
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,680
and her relationship with Ning'er are exposed,

171
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,010
it won't be safe either.

172
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,170
Sir,

173
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,320
there's a problem.

174
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:54,680
What happened?

175
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,400
I received a message from the spies in the capital.

176
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,800
Miss You was captured by the Xingwu Guards.

177
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,700
What happened?

178
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,080
According to the spy,

179
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,880
Zhou Yinzhi took people to Lyu Mansion.

180
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,050
They didn't report a crime

181
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:08,980
or show a warrant

182
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,660
and just took her away.

183
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,080
After investigation,

184
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,880
Miss You

185
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,130
wasn't taken to the prison.

186
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,250
Instead, she's imprisoned in the Mansion of Duke Xue.

187
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,320
It's my fault.

188
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,130
I should have brought her out that day.

189
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,000
Instead of blaming yourself,

190
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,730
you should think of a solution.

191
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,500
Let's go back to the capital first.

192
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,650
The battle with the Xue family has begun.

193
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,520
I’d like to see

194
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,280
who will live

195
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:34,980
and who will die.

196
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,690
Mr. Zhang,

197
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,930
I’ve decided to go back to the capital to see His Majesty.

198
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,650
Please send a letter to the capital

199
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,490
and inform His Majesty.

200
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,420
That's great.

201
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,690
How will you go back to the capital?

202
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,240
We will split up into three groups.

203
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,520
One will return to the border,

204
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,450
one will stay in Yuzhou with Marquis Yan,

205
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,340
and the third

206
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,550
will return with Viscount Yan and I.

207
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:17,820
This is the bottom line.

208
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,620
Junior Preceptor Xie, you should know

209
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,320
that even if one group returns to the capital with you,

210
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:23,930
the army

211
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,780
can't enter the capital according to the law.

212
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,690
This is also the bottom line of the imperial court.

213
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,720
I know.

214
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,010
Okay.

215
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,310
I’ll write a letter to report to His Majesty now.

216
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:43,460
-Mr. Zhang and I...
-You are not my caged bird.

217
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,150
You don't have to explain to me,

218
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,150
even if you purposely came to see him.

219
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:47,800
Don't...

220
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,290
You Fangyin is in trouble.

221
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,130
Zhou Yinzhi.

222
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,730
It’s my fault.

223
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,140
I knew his temperament.

224
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,100
I should have gotten rid of him.

225
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,000
Then this problem wouldn't exist today.

226
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,860
Ning'er, you're not a bad person.

227
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,530
Because of this,

228
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,590
you wouldn't have removed someone

229
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,260
for the mistakes he may make in the future

230
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,060
before he made them.

231
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,960
This is an unsolvable problem.

232
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,220
Does Lyu Xian know? What did he say?

233
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,540
We've discussed it.

234
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,320
I planned to return to the capital in a few days.

235
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,360
Since this incident has occurred,

236
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,410
we'll depart tomorrow.

237
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,360
After entering the capital,

238
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,340
Yan Lin and I will tell His Majesty

239
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,890
everything that happened.

240
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,580
As for You Fangyin,

241
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,440
I'll ask Dao Qin to accompany Lyu Xian

242
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,630
to the Xue family.

243
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:50,550
-As for you, go back first.
-I’ll go with them to the Xue family.

244
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,400
You know how important Fangyin is to me.

245
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,010
I'll go with them.

246
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,730
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

247
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,410
You, on the contrary...

248
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,350
The palace will be full of danger.

249
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,250
Yan's troops are all outside the city.

250
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,250
They might not be able to send reinforcements in time.

251
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,580
You need to bring something to protect yourself.

252
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,710
I don't want anything to happen to you.

253
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,670
Is this how badly you want to return this to me?

254
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,270
I have no reason to take back

255
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,000
what I gave away.

256
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,840
Stop being petulant.

257
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,270
Ning'er,

258
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,370
you're the one who said I'll never lose,

259
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,000
but you're also the one who worries about me now.

260
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,330
You're the one who promised me the future,

261
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,210
but you're also the one who can't give me an answer now.

262
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,540
What do you want me to do?

263
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,390
We're here to bid farewell to His Lordship.

264
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,560
You're busy. There's no need to see us off.

265
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,620
You must be careful

266
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,420
in the capital.

267
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,890
Don't worry, General Yan.

268
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:11,750
This time,

269
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,830
His Majesty will first summon Junior Preceptor Xie and Viscount Yan

270
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,210
to ask about everything before discussing with the officials.

271
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,210
He won't let you all be wronged.

272
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,210
It's getting late.

273
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,420
Let's go.

274
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:36,980
Ju'an.

275
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,190
You've always been smart.

276
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,330
These words should be unnecessary,

277
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,090
but I thought about it for a long time last night.

278
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:50,010
Your path has been difficult

279
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,500
for the past 20 years.

280
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,990
Now,

281
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,180
we're only one step away from revenge,

282
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,320
but

283
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,880
if your mother were still alive,

284
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,410
she wouldn't want to see you

285
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,120
be blinded by hatred.

286
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,670
Do you understand?

287
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,130
Don't worry, Uncle.

288
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:10,730
I understand.

289
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,580
At the time, His Majesty

290
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,070
was only a child.

291
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,890
He didn't know about many things.

292
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,090
Since the beginning,

293
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,520
my target

294
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,490
has only been Lord Pingnan and the Xue family.

295
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,870
Returning this time

296
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,670
is also for the sake of the world.

297
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,950
The Xue family is ambitious.

298
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,290
Sooner or later,

299
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,270
they will harm His Majesty.

300
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,720
If something happens, the world will be in chaos.

301
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,240
War will be everywhere and the people will suffer.

302
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,160
No matter what,

303
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,920
you must keep the situation under control.

304
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:44,450
Of course,

305
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,080
you must also protect yourself.

306
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,670
Okay.

307
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,990
But Uncle,

308
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,210
Yan Lin and I will return to the capital,

309
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,750
while you will stay here alone to guard Yuzhou.

310
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,950
You must be careful.

311
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,940
The Xue family also has private soldiers.

312
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,950
You must be careful of their surprise attacks.

313
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,880
When everything is settled in the capital

314
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,650
and the Yan family's name is cleared,

315
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:06,240
I will

316
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,900
welcome you back to court.

317
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,610
This farewell...

318
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,600
Uncle,

319
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:12,880
take care.

320
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,740
Take care.

321
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,900
Your Majesty,

322
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,569
I have received a message from Zhang Zhe

323
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,270
saying that Xie Wei

324
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,609
and Yan Lin have left the military camp

325
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,849
and will escort the princess to the capital according to your order.

326
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:28,900
Yan Mu is staying in Yuzhou with Yan's troops for now.

327
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,180
Nothing unusual has happened.

328
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:32,990
Zhang Zhe did his job well.

329
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,740
I see now.

330
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,850
After he returns...

331
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:41,960
Reward him.

332
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,700
Your Majesty,

333
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,790
what should we do with this group?

334
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:46,930
Your Majesty,

335
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:48,830
have you made up your mind?

336
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,380
Although Xie Wei forged the imperial edict,

337
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,920
this action

338
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,450
pacified the State of Yue

339
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:59,050
and eliminated Lord Pingnan,

340
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,780
a long-time concern of the court.

341
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,810
He made great contributions,

342
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:07,490
while I'm afraid that the Yan family's crime

343
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,080
of going against the imperial decree

344
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,240
may have been reported by the Xue family for private reasons.

345
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,170
On the contrary,

346
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,280
with all the evidence of guilt found in the Xue family,

347
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,830
the Mansion of Duke Xue

348
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,920
might have long become corrupt.

349
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,850
External troubles have just been settled and internal troubles are about to begin.

350
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,240
It's easy to punish Xie Wei and Yan Lin,

351
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,410
but

352
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,070
what should we do with tens of thousands of Yan's troops?

353
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,240
What should be done

354
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,160
with the Xue family in the court?

355
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,380
I understand what you mean.

356
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,610
During my years as the emperor,

357
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,570
there have been few achievements,

358
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,430
but I've tolerated the Xue family

359
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,330
because of the unrest when I was young

360
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,030
and Mother's mutual protection.

361
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,990
This is what led to today’s disaster.

362
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,580
Now,

363
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,160
if this incident

364
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,740
causes unrest again,

365
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,460
I'm afraid

366
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,750
I won't be able to face

367
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,800
the ancestors of the Shen family in the afterlife.

368
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:04,770
Your Majesty.

369
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,880
Forget it.

370
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:11,300
As long as Xie Wei and Yan Lin are loyal to the court,

371
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:14,630
why can't I tolerate them?

372
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,840
Your Majesty is benevolent.

373
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,070
Your Majesty.

374
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,450
Eunuch Wang, summon the Imperial Physician.

375
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,970
His Majesty had already recovered,

376
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,650
and he has been in your palace these days.

377
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,580
Do you dare say it has nothing to do with you?

378
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,410
Aunt, what do you mean?

379
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,700
I'm just a consort.

380
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,010
I'm not a physician.

381
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,220
How would I know how exactly His Majesty's health is?

382
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,490
Didn't you tell me

383
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,770
that when I'm by His Majesty's side, I only have to make him happy

384
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:03,730
and I shouldn't say or ask anything extra?

385
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,800
How dare you talk back?

386
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:06,820
Guards!

387
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,930
Slap her!

388
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,030
Your Majesty.

389
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,910
You came at the right time.

390
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,590
Take a look at your good daughter.

391
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,490
I will take my leave now.

392
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,480
Your Majesty,

393
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,920
the Imperial Study sent news

394
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,590
that His Majesty is fine now.

395
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,530
However, His Majesty

396
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,330
is weak inside and his strength has been exhausted.

397
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,590
I'm afraid he won't live for much longer.

398
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,790
You did it?

399
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,120
Xue Yuan,

400
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,990
I warned you

401
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,010
that you must not do this.

402
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,040
You are assassinating the emperor.

403
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,840
Your Majesty,

404
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,250
His Majesty has not

405
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,380
been in good health for a long time.

406
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,800
I'm just helping His Majesty

407
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,220
be free from sickness as soon as possible.

408
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,780
This has nothing to do with you.

409
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:36,320
You...

410
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,980
Guards!

411
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:42,330
Your Majesty,

412
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,310
the imperial guards have been replaced with my men.

413
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,640
Do you know what the consequences would be

414
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:50,390
if you spread this news?

415
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,480
Are you threatening me?

416
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:57,680
I dare not.

417
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,620
Your Majesty and I were born from one mother.

418
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,060
We are related by blood.

419
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,080
Others may harm you,

420
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,160
but I would never,

421
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,270
so please listen to me.

422
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,130
You've committed the serious crime of assassinating the emperor.

423
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,270
What’s there to say?

424
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,490
Xue Yuan,

425
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,780
are you going to rebel?

426
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,780
Your Majesty, you are wrong.

427
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,020
It is only a rebellion when you change

428
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,450
the dynasty and empire,

429
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,330
but everything I am doing is for the Xue family.

430
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:24,570
Do you know

431
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,330
who Junior Preceptor Xie Wei

432
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,270
truly is?

433
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,740
I was only suspicious of him,

434
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,060
but

435
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,810
I happened to receive a secret letter from Lord Pingnan.

436
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:37,910
Only then did I know

437
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:39,810
that Xie Wei

438
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,880
is the real Xue Dingfei.

439
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,170
Isn't he...

440
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,800
The one who came back is fake.

441
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,090
Xie Wei is the real Xue Dingfei.

442
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,840
He hid his identity for 20 years,

443
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,810
bewitched His Majesty in court,

444
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,340
and secretly helped the Yan family

445
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,720
to fight against the Xue family.

446
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,220
Now, His Majesty is obedient to him

447
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,890
and even wants to forgive a heinous crime

448
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,230
like forging the imperial decree.

449
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,980
If he returns to the palace,

450
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,040
please think about

451
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,640
who the tens of thousands of Yan's troops

452
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,420
will aim their swords at.

453
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:17,380
Even so,

454
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:20,340
you shouldn't have hurt Lang.

455
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,710
He’s my son.

456
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:24,160
Your Majesty,

457
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,270
you're being too kind.

458
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,240
There are no true fathers and sons in imperial families.

459
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,250
Your Highness,

460
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,660
your hesitation now

461
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,730
will lead to

462
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,850
the future death of the Xue family.

463
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,830
So,

464
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,820
I will have soldiers lay in ambush.

465
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:44,210
When Xie Wei returns to the capital to meet His Majesty,

466
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:46,940
he and Yan Lin will be killed within the palace.

467
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:48,840
Twenty years ago

468
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,590
and 20 years later,

469
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,780
I'm even willing

470
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,960
to sacrifice my own son for the Xue family.

471
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,160
Why can't you?

472
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,620
You're assassinating the emperor.

473
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,510
If others find out—

474
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,260
Then, you must not let anyone know.

475
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:15,150
Anyway, it's Consort Xian who who did it.

476
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,690
She's no longer a member of the Xue family.

477
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,240
After the princess returns to the capital,

478
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,610
you can issue an imperial decree

479
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,210
to let Ye marry the princess.

480
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:27,700
At that time, His Majesty will die of illness.

481
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,160
Noble Consort Qin will hold vigil for His Majesty

482
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,090
and I will help Lord Linzi ascend the throne.

483
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,670
By then,

484
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,540
no matter if it's the palace, the capital,

485
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,590
or the world,

486
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:43,690
all of it would be under your control.

487
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,850
[Long History]

488
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,290
Empress Dowager has agreed

489
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,240
not to interfere with our plan.

490
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,890
Before Xie Wei and Yan Lin enter the palace,

491
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,950
we must set up an ambush in the palace.

492
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,610
We trained our troops just for this one moment.

493
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:13,960
The success and failure of the Mansion of Duke Xue

494
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:15,740
depends on this.

495
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,200
Ye,

496
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:20,860
give the orders.

497
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:21,880
Yes.

498
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,110
Duke.

499
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:27,610
Xie Wei and Yan Lin

500
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,150
will arrive in three days.

501
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,180
According to the law,

502
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,440
their army can only wait outside the city.

503
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,600
This is good for us,

504
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,440
but to make sure nothing goes wrong,

505
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,900
we still need Consort Xian

506
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,800
to stop the news from His Majesty.

507
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,590
Don't worry.

508
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,770
The medicine has been taken.

509
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,490
His Majesty won't last three days.

510
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,820
When the matter is settled,

511
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,660
I need a justifiable reason

512
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:54,030
that can appease the public.

513
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,420
So,

514
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,240
create incriminating evidence of Xie Wei's group as soon as possible.

515
00:25:59,240 --> 00:25:59,970
Understand?

516
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,220
Yes,

517
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,590
I understand.

518
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,650
Greetings, Your Highness,

519
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,330
Mr. Xie, Mr. Zhang, and General Yan.

520
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,770
His Majesty knew you all would arrive today,

521
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,770
so he ordered me to wait for you here.

522
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,210
Thank you.

523
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,960
The Empress Dowager is at Tai'an Hall.

524
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,620
She wants to see the princess.

525
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,370
As for the two sirs and General Yan,

526
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,250
His Majesty has ordered

527
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,290
for you to go to the Imperial Study.

528
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,760
We will do as His Majesty says.

529
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,560
It is forbidden

530
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,420
to bring weapons into the palace.

531
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,320
This is the rule of the palace.

532
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,820
General Yan, you should know that, right?

533
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:12,170
Inform the Duke and Mr. Xue immediately.

534
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,090
My Lady, Xie Wei and the others have entered the palace.

535
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:25,040
The princess has gone to Tai'an Hall.

536
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,020
Mr. Zhang Zhe

537
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:28,920
is taking Xie Wei and Yan Lin to the Imperial Study.

538
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,880
His Majesty has taken the medicine.

539
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,030
He won't last long.

540
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,130
Bring some men to guard the Imperial Study.

541
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,180
Once the poison takes effect,

542
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,280
bring His Majesty to Jingyue Hall immediately.

543
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,120
Tell him

544
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:43,210
that Jingyue Hall is the closest to the Imperial Hospital.

545
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,010
It's so he can be treated in time.

546
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:45,920
Yes.

547
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,600
Have Xie Wei and the others arrived?

548
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,550
Your Majesty,

549
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,480
Mr. Zhang has brought Junior Preceptor Xie

550
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,140
and General Yan to the palace.

551
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,130
I think they will arrive soon,

552
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:02,830
but

553
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,710
your health is not well.

554
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,820
You should take a rest.

555
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,640
Did you have a relapse after the long trip?

556
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,580
Why don't we go to the Imperial Hospital first?

557
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,380
It's nothing.

558
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,130
We are returning to the capital by His Majesty's order.

559
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,930
We should see His Majesty first.

560
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,000
Official Gu,

561
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,440
they are still waiting for a meeting in Taiji Hall.

562
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,770
I will only rest assured

563
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,010
after seeing Xie Wei

564
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,160
and asking him.

565
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:38,470
Your Majesty.

566
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,000
Your Majesty!

567
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,050
Help! Help!

568
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:44,980
Help!

569
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,090
Mr. Xue,

570
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,490
His Majesty summoned us to meet him.

571
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,740
What are you doing?

572
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,440
You still want to see His Majesty?

573
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,640
Try in your next life.

574
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,050
Arrest them all!

575
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:32,780
Xue Ye!

576
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,050
You're brandishing weapons in the palace.

577
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,110
Are you rebelling?

578
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,290
His Majesty is in critical condition.

579
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:42,650
My father has received the will to pass on the throne to Lord Linzi.

580
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,910
He is now going to Taiji Hall to discuss with the officials.

581
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,290
The Xingwu Guards are protecting the palace.

582
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,490
How is it a rebellion?

583
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,640
The Xue family dares to assassinate the emperor?

584
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,890
How dare you!

585
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,970
Junior Preceptor Xie, you are wrong.

586
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:56,730
After everything is settled,

587
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,260
the Yan family

588
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:01,160
will be the one who attacked His Majesty and started the rebellion,

589
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,290
while the Xue family

590
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,750
are the loyal ministers who came to save His Majesty.

591
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,460
Guards!

592
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,790
Arrest these rebels.

593
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,200
If they dare resist,

594
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,180
just kill them.

595
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:10,900
Yes.

596
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:21,830
Jian Shu,

597
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,420
take Mr. Xie and Mr. Zhang away.

598
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,400
Be careful. Don't linger in battle.

599
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,030
Jian Shu,

600
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:26,810
let's go.

601
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:27,250
Yes.

602
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,650
Let's go.

603
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,260
Don't let them escape.

604
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,570
Kill him!

605
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,720
Mr. Gu,

606
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:35,420
something is wrong.

607
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:39,060
I'm afraid a crisis will happen in the palace.

608
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,060
Sirs,

609
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,440
His Majesty had an emergency

610
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,260
and has passed away.

611
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:56,930
This...

612
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,100
Before he died,

613
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:01,280
he left a will to pass on the throne to Lord Linzi

614
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,010
and sentence

615
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:06,020
Xie Wei and the Yan family to death for treason.

616
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,730
Here is the imperial edict.

617
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,500
Aren't you going to accept the edict?

618
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,010
Nonsense!

619
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,700
Although His Majesty is unwell,

620
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,820
the Imperial Physician has been taking care of him.

621
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,660
How could he suddenly pass away?

622
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,060
Besides,

623
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,930
if anything happened to His Majesty,

624
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:28,430
why are you the one reporting it,

625
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,840
instead of the imperial court?

626
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,430
A few days ago, His Majesty said

627
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:38,130
that Xie Wei and the Yan family can be pardoned.

628
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,480
How could he have issued such an imperial edict?

629
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,220
Xue Yuan,

630
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,710
what are you up to?

631
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,700
Minister Gu is correct.

632
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,590
We want to see His Majesty.

633
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,400
We want to see the Empress Dowager!

634
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:58,290
See the Empress Dowager and His Majesty.

635
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,220
Charge!

636
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,330
What are you doing?

637
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:04,460
Mr. Gu.

638
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:06,830
This is...

639
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,570
Sirs,

640
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:10,500
the Empress Dowager is in grief

641
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,500
and mourning for His Majesty.

642
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,219
Why are you all

643
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,780
still being unreasonable?

644
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:18,409
I was authorized by His Majesty's will

645
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,170
to be the auxiliary minister.

646
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,679
I am responsible for handling the court

647
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:26,239
and stabilizing the palace.

648
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:29,650
Before everything is settled,

649
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,270
no one

650
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,790
is allowed to leave Taiji Hall.

651
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:38,969
He won't let us leave.

652
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:41,489
What is this?

653
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:49,360
You stay here

654
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,860
and watch over the sirs.

655
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,600
The rest, follow me.

656
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:03,320
Looks like this conspiracy has been planned for a long time.

657
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:07,920
What do you want?

658
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,900
Hand You Fangyin over.

659
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,020
Who is You Fangyin?

660
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,690
I've never heard of her.

661
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,810
This is the Mansion of Duke Xue.

662
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:17,740
How dare you!

663
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,160
Guards! Arrest them!

664
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,370
Let's see who dares to move.

665
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:28,960
I am the wife of a first-rank official.

666
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,010
What do you want?

667
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,290
You know the answer.

668
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,530
Where is You Fangyin?

669
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:34,920
If you harm me,

670
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,540
the Duke will never forgive you.

671
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,620
I took the life of Lord Pingnan.

672
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,620
I can even kill a prince and royalty.

673
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,660
So what if I add you to the list?

674
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,190
I'll ask you one last time.

675
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,380
Where is You Fangyin?

676
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,220
It says that your husband

677
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,800
helped Xie Wei and the Yan family collude with Jinling.

678
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,850
All these years,

679
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:18,220
he used his powers for personal gains and rebellion.

680
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,650
Put your fingerprint here

681
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,740
and come with me to the Ministry of Justice to testify.

682
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,340
I'll set you free right away,

683
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:26,940
okay?

684
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,940
Madam Lyu is not afraid of death.

685
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,450
I admire you,

686
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,260
but I'm afraid.

687
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,170
I'll die if I can't get the evidence.

688
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,570
Since you don't want to testify,

689
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,190
I'll have to trouble you some more.

690
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,250
Don't come over.

691
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:17,140
Zhou Yinzhi!

692
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,880
-Fangyin.
-Let her go.

693
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,240
Everything is up for discussion.

694
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,320
I've heard about

695
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,710
the martial arts skills of Junior Preceptor's guard.

696
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,550
If I let her go,

697
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,400
I'm afraid I'll be dead, right?

698
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,730
I don't have to kill you.

699
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:29,590
Let her go.

700
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,200
I don't trust anyone at a time like this.

701
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,500
I only trust myself.

702
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:34,750
I just want to live.

703
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,210
Don't force me.

704
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:37,890
Move!

705
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:41,440
Fangyin.

706
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,550
Move!

707
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,420
Let her go!

708
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,330
Calm down.

709
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,040
Don't come over!

710
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,540
Stop! Don't come over!

711
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:32,470
Fangyin.

712
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:34,690
-Don't think about leaving.
-Fangyin.

713
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,220
-Fangyin.
-Fangyin.

714
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:56,070
Fangyin.

715
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:58,960
Fangyin.

716
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,190
Fangyin.

717
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:04,840
Fangyin.

718
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,310
Miss,

719
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,790
I'm sorry.

720
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,430
In the end,

721
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,770
I still failed to stop Zhou Yinzhi.

722
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,160
I didn't want someone like him

723
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:18,960
to escape.

724
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:21,900
Stop talking, Fangyin.

725
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:24,960
You'll be fine.

726
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,660
You can't die.

727
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:29,680
Fangyin.

728
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:31,560
You're not allowed to die.

729
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,990
Miss, don't cry.

730
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,820
If you hadn't saved me back then,

731
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:43,190
I would have already died in the lake in Mansion of Earl You.

732
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:46,920
No, you're the one who saved me.

733
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:49,590
It was true before

734
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:52,340
and it's still true now.

735
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,890
You're the only one always by my side.

736
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:58,420
You are the best person.

737
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,140
Better than that person?

738
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,250
Sometimes,

739
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,970
although you look at me,

740
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:10,920
you seem to be looking at someone else

741
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,070
through me.

742
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,160
I always felt like

743
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,640
I stole the spot next to you from that person.

744
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,940
I was afraid I couldn't compare to her

745
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:23,230
and couldn't help you.

746
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:25,030
Miss, I was so scared

747
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:27,300
that you wouldn't want me anymore.

748
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:28,670
Silly Fangyin.

749
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,730
You are the only Fangyin.

750
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,170
You are the best Fangyin.

751
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:43,800
I can't be by your side you anymore.

752
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,720
You must take good care of yourself.

753
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:54,440
Mr. Lyu.

754
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,540
I'm here.

755
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,530
Thank you

756
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,940
for taking care of me these days.

757
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:04,460
Unfortunately,

758
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:08,010
there's no time to sign the divorce agreement now.

759
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:11,650
I'm sorry for making you carry

760
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,500
the reputation of being a widower.

761
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,350
You Fangyin, listen.

762
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,280
I forbid you to say sorry.

763
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,820
From beginning to end,

764
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,160
I never wanted to divorce you.

765
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,320
I tricked you into being my wife.

766
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:25,990
I wanted you to stay by my side,

767
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,540
because I knew

768
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,880
that one day,

769
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,330
you would understand my feelings.

770
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,400
I've always known

771
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,730
your feelings.

772
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,560
I believe that

773
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,690
we will be together someday.

774
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,040
We will.

775
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:49,770
Yes.

776
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,320
-Fangyin.
-Fangyin.

777
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,410
Fangyin,

778
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,440
please be fine.

779
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,690
I won't let anything happen to you.

780
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,370
Our happy days haven't started yet.

781
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:02,290
For yourself,

782
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,540
for Miss Jiang,

783
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:04,230
for me,

784
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,050
I beg you to hold on.

785
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,690
Please don't leave me, okay?

786
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,990
Then I'll...

787
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:13,840
-I'll hang in there.
-Hang in there.

788
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,970
I'll take you to the physician.

789
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,810
Hang in there.

790
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:17,720
Fangyin.

791
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,880
Hang in there, Fangyin.

792
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:21,430
Fangyin.

793
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,320
I'll hold...

794
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,990
Fangyin.

795
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,110
Fangyin.

796
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:59,310
Fangyin.
