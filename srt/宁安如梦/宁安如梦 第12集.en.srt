Actually, I also feel that

The so-called official examination

00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,150
has sharp eyes.

171
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:01,510
He loves Zhang Zhe's talent,

172
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,370
made an exception and recommended him to the court.

173
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,660
Gu Chunfang is not only

174
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,240
a talent scout to Zhang Zhe,

175
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,030
but he also helped him clear his father's name.

176
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,330
The relationship between these two is nothing casual.

177
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,430
So Mr. Gu assigned Zhang Zhe to the Ministry of Justice

178
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,740
on purpose?

179
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,330
Mr. Gu has been working outside the capital for many years.

180
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,260
He will return to the capital soon,

181
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,920
and the position of the Minister of Justice has been vacant for years.

182
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,120
Does His Majesty intend to let Mr. Gu...

183
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,169
Mr. Xie, you're so observant.

184
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,789
You even know so well about a low-ranking official.

185
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,159
It's really admirable

186
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,390
that you think 10 steps ahead when you take one step.

187
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,190
You're flattering me, Mr. Chen.

188
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,270
It's only because I'm also quite curious

189
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,450
about Mr. Zhang.

190
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,150
If you have any news about Mr. Zhang in the future,

191
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,260
please also exchange information

192
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,950
with me, Mr. Chen.

193
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,240
No problem, Sir.

194
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,420
I, Chen Ying, am willing to do anything for you, Sir.

195
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,150
Miss. Miss.

196
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,640
Miss, you're finally back.

197
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,910
What's wrong? Did someone treat you badly?

198
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,710
This morning,

199
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,670
a lot of rewards were sent from the palace.

200
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,680
His Lordship asked someone to inquire about it

201
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,640
and got to know that you suffered a lot in the palace.

202
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,300
Lian'er is worried about you.

203
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,470
I'm back safely, right?

204
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,650
Let's go. I'll greet father

205
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,040
so that he doesn't have to worry anymore.

206
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,380
Greetings, Father and Mother.

207
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,930
I'm your daughter Xuening.

208
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,480
It's good that you're back.

209
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,160
What exactly happened in the palace?

210
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,630
Tell us about it.

211
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:49,740
Look at you.

212
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,550
You should have informed us

213
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,350
about such an important matter.

214
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,110
Do you know

215
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,290
how worried your mother, your sister and I

216
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,240
have been?

217
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,490
I just don't understand.

218
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,410
There are so many study partners in the palace.

219
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:05,030
Why do you have to be the one that causes trouble?

220
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,360
Maybe you should ask her

221
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,170
what she has done herself.

222
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:09,660
-Alright.
-Mother.

223
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,260
I am asking, aren't I?

224
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,780
I knew it.

225
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:14,970
Back then,

226
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,620
I didn't agree when you wanted to enter the palace.

227
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,660
With your temper,

228
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,360
you'll only cause trouble by acting recklessly.

229
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:22,890
Look.

230
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,020
Now that something happened, you finally learned your lesson.

231
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,070
I've always been reminding you

232
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,060
to follow the rules in the palace.

233
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,730
But you

234
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,800
never took it seriously.

235
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,870
Xuening.

236
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:37,030
Can't you take care of your own life

237
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,590
and stop letting the whole family worry about you?

238
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,520
Save me some trouble, okay?

239
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,040
So in your eyes,

240
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,360
everything is my fault, Mother?

241
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,470
You never fail

242
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,630
to surprise me.

243
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,600
How can you talk to me like that?

244
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,910
-Alright. Alright.
-What kind of attitude is that?

245
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,990
Stop it. Enough.

246
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,830
Ning, you just came back from the palace.

247
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,560
You must be tired.

248
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,720
Go back to your room and have a rest.

249
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,380
Come on. Take her back to rest.

250
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,550
Look at her.

251
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,480
How can she be like this?

252
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,290
Alright. Leave her alone.

253
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:06,870
Look.

254
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,060
Look at them.

255
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,460
Was that a cat seeing a mouse

256
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,020
or a tiger seeing a pig?

257
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,670
Do they have to eat each other alive or what?

258
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,630
Mother.

259
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,050
You're here.

260
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,430
Are you still angry?

261
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,600
I heard a saying.

262
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,850
It goes, "Love well, whip well."

263
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,270
I don't understand what it means.

264
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,560
Can you explain it to me, Mother?

265
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,640
You've learned how to

266
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,110
beat around the bush.

267
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,590
Mother.

268
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,860
Actually, we only heard about

269
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,990
what happened to Ning in the palace.

270
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,590
We didn't see it with our own eyes.

271
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,880
So it might not be Ning's fault.

272
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,560
I know it might not be her fault.

273
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,430
But don't forget,

274
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,260
that is the royal palace.

275
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,370
What kind of place is that?

276
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,040
That's a place where

277
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,590
your life is at risk all the time.

278
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,920
If anything goes wrong,

279
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,700
you may get executed.

280
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,750
But look at her temper.

281
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,170
If she were half as disciplined and steady as you,

282
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,120
I wouldn't have to be like this.

283
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,440
Actually, Ning is becoming more sensible

284
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,510
as she gets older.

285
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,420
I think maybe you should worry less.

286
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,390
Since you brought the matter of age up,

287
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,850
you're right on the point.

288
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:50,820
Come here.

289
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,780
Since you two have both grown up,

290
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,860
it's time to start thinking about your marriages.

291
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,620
But look at her temper.

292
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:01,960
I'm so worried.

293
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:04,870
What kind of family would want her?

294
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,020
Mother, don't worry.

295
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,470
Father has made a lot of friends in the court.

296
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,400
He will find someone nice for Ning.

297
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,070
Don't worry too much.

298
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,820
Alright, let's not talk about her for now.

299
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,020
Let's talk about you.

300
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,610
Given your condition,

301
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,360
it shouldn't be hard for you

302
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,190
to marry into a good family.

303
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,330
But now,

304
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,260
you're more or less affected by your sister Ning.

305
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,960
What should I do?

306
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,940
Marriage is predestined. It can't be forced.

307
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,640
What's coming will come.

308
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,750
Look at you. You're always like this.

309
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,920
People will take advantage of you.

310
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,070
When everything's perfect, that's when losses come. But when you're at a loss, that's when opportunities come.

311
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,270
Losing is a blessing.

312
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,120
Look at you.

313
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,950
You're even more eloquent than me.

314
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,460
[Caution]

315
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,220
Father.

316
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,560
I knew you'd come to see me.

317
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,620
Come here.

318
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,140
Caution means worry.

319
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,850
Father, are you worried about the relationship between the Jiang family and the Yan family?

320
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,150
As for the case of rebellious phrases in the palace,

321
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,150
Empress Dowager Xue did try to use me

322
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,790
to frame the Yan family.

323
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:55,950
Fortunately,

324
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,240
Mr. Zhang from the Ministry of Justice

325
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,860
has cleared my name.

326
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,920
The matter in the palace have been solved.

327
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,030
But a few days ago,

328
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,770
something happened to the Yan family as well.

329
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,700
Did you hear about it in the palace?

330
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,670
From my point of view,

331
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,520
although it's unknown why Marquis of Yan got hurt,

332
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,960
the Xue family locked down the city that very night to search.

333
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,470
That means the relationship between the two families

334
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,840
has become as incompatible as water and fire.

335
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,860
You've grown up even more after going to the palace.

336
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,590
You can see around corners and find out the truth.

337
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,600
The grudges between the Yan and Xue families

338
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,030
have been accumulated for 20 years.

339
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,390
There's a lot of bad blood between them.

340
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,190
I'm afraid it's hard to resolve.

341
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,030
Besides...

342
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,230
Father, you're talking about

343
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,690
Viscount Dingfei, right?

344
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,950
I heard the story of 300 Loyal Souls.

345
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,270
It's said that the Yan and Xue families broke up after this.

346
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,370
But I think

347
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,630
many of the details are unreasonable.

348
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,620
Do you know what happened exactly back then, Father?

349
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,770
Back then,

350
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,200
Lord Pingnan

351
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,850
massacred the palace

352
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,550
when the former emperor was critically ill.

353
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,590
Many stories were told

354
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,840
by the only survivors.

355
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,330
You know.

356
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,020
Many things people say are untrustworthy.

357
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,300
Later, as erroneous information spread,

358
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,690
the truth got totally mixed up with the rumors.

359
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,320
It's hard to tell the truth.

360
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,270
What we know is that

361
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,200
the former emperor died of severe illness.

362
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,310
The young emperor ascended the throne and the Empress Dowager became the regent.

363
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,910
She assisted the Xue family.

364
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,190
It was only a few years ago when His Majesty got married that he got his rule back.

365
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,060
And these are the only facts

366
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,570
we can see with our own eyes.

367
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,020
Now the Xue family's forces are everywhere.

368
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,550
Is there really no solution

369
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,230
to the Yan family's plight?

370
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,920
Yan Lin

371
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,950
is your childhood friend.

372
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,170
Although every time he came here,

373
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,660
he'd climb over our wall

374
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,859
and I'd scold him every time I saw him.

375
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,970
But in fact, I quite like him.

376
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,470
He's good at both literature and martial arts.

377
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,470
He's different from those playboys

378
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,510
in the capital.

379
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,490
I thought you would get married sooner or later.

380
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,200
But now it seems

381
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,329
this marriage is not going to happen.

382
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,950
I'm worried that you'll take it too hard

383
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,630
and you'll be sad.

384
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,510
But I promise you.

385
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,260
If you are willing,

386
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,290
I'll find you someone new.

387
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:39,060
I won't let my daughter suffer.

388
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,650
No matter what happens in the future,

389
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,200
you won't get involved again.

390
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,100
Father, don't worry.

391
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,880
I only take Yan Lin as a friend.

392
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,400
We're not in love.

393
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,650
And I definitely don't want to get married hastily because of this.

394
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,000
I beg to ask you a favor, Father.

395
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,550
I'm indebted to Yan Lin.

396
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,820
If the Yan family really gets in trouble,

397
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,560
I want to do my best to help.

398
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,830
I won't get our family implicated.

399
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,630
Please agree to my unreasonable request, Father.

400
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,420
Good.

401
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,860
Good.

402
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:21,780
I thought

403
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,560
you were still that thoughtless little girl.

404
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,190
I didn't expect you to become so sensible

405
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,960
and grateful.

406
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,260
I'm really glad.

407
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,760
I promise you.

408
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,760
If I have a chance to speak

409
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,210
in the court,

410
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,790
I'll choose to side with the Yan family.

411
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:52,950
Duke.

412
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,070
Who's that?

413
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,250
Over there.

414
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,160
Go after him!

415
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,220
Yes.

416
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,360
Go after him!

417
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:12,840
Duke.

418
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,720
[Dear Lord Pingnan]

419
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,250
God is indeed on my side.

420
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,300
Guards. Into the palace.

421
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,020
Yes.

422
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,710
[Imperial Study]

423
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,690
Greetings, Your Majesty.

424
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,480
Duke.

425
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,650
Official Xie, take a look at this.

426
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,610
Duke of Xue received a secret report today.

427
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,710
Someone handed in this half of a letter

428
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,560
between Marquis of Yan and Lord Pingnan.

429
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,830
This is a crime of treason.

430
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,830
What do you think is the appropriate punishment for this, Official Xie?

431
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,360
In my opinion,

432
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,610
we don't know where this half letter came from.

433
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,210
And according to the letter,

434
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,240
it's just someone asking Lord Pingnan

435
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,100
about Viscount Xue's premature death.

436
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,670
There's no Yan family's official seal

437
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,070
or words of treason in it.

438
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,480
It shouldn't be regarded as solid evidence.

439
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,970
If someone with ulterior motives

440
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,430
says this letter was written by Duke of Xue,

441
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,720
it also makes sense.

442
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,380
Are you suspecting that the Xue family colluded with the enemy, Junior Preceptor?

443
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,840
Or are you suspecting that

444
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,360
I'm framing the Yan family?

445
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,240
Everyone knows how loyal you are, Duke.

446
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,180
What I meant is that

447
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,370
since there's a first half of this letter,

448
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,030
there should be a second half.

449
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,350
Why don't we give the Ministry of Justice more time to search?

450
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,300
When they find the second half of the letter

451
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,020
with the Yan family's official seal or the signature of Marquis of Yan,

452
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,460
we can convict the Yan family more justly.

453
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,120
Everyone knows Yan Mu is full of wild ambitions.

454
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,470
Why do we need more evidence?

455
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,550
Your Majesty.

456
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,580
The Ministry of Justice has been in charge of the Rebels Case for a long time.

457
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,440
There has been no progress at all.

458
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,900
And now there's a fuss

459
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,240
over Ruyi jade in the palace.

460
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,280
It shows that

461
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:27,920
the rebels have infiltrated the palace with the Yan family's help.

462
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,430
If this goes on,

463
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,090
I'm afraid

464
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,150
it will cause great trouble.

465
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,060
Your Majesty.

466
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,790
You've waited for 20 years.

467
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,210
It'll just take a few more months. There's no need to hurry.

468
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,270
Why should we wait?

469
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,630
If Yan's troops

470
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,880
join forces with Lord Pingnan's army to attack the capital,

471
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,940
it will be too late.

472
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,430
Alright.

473
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,170
Official Xie is right.

474
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,060
To shut people's mouths,

475
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,910
we need a justifiable reason.

476
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,230
But since it concerns the foundation of our country,

477
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,690
I can't make any mistakes.

478
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:00,970
From now on,

479
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,740
the Yan family will be confined in their mansion

and cooperate with the investigation of Xingwu Guards.

481

we can't allow any threat.

the remaining half of the letter as soon as possible

00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,170

505
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,210
only requested the Yan family to cooperate with the investigation,

506
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,290
and it did not convict the Yan family of any crimes.

507
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:39,510
[Mansion of Marquis of Yan]

508
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:37,280
The Yan family has been innocent and loyal for generations.

509
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,480
The truth will eventually be revealed.

510
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,410
Before that,

511
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,450
I will not tolerate

512
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,060
you guys wrecking havoc under my family's roof.

513
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,060
Alright, Yan Lin.

514
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:50,310
Don't you dare think that I'll let you go so easily.

515
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,570
All of you in the Yan family

516
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,100
are just barely surviving.

517
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,570
When Xingwu Guards find the evidence,

518
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,170
I'll kill your whole family.

519
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,740
Well then, let's wait until Xingwu Guards find the evidence.

520
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,540
Before that,

521
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,520
the Yan family is still innocent and loyal.

522
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,510
No one can slander us.

523
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,900
Keep an eye on them.

524
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,650
Not even an ant shall escape.

525
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:10,840
Yes.

526
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:21,950
Why did he suddenly

527
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,720
pass an order?

528
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,510
We've been investigating the rebels for so long.

529
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,300
I don't know if we'll be implicated.

530
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,730
It's really a fight between the immortals,

531
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,390
but you and I suffer in the end.

532
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,710
Mr. Zhang, say something.

533
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,560
I am just in charge of investigating the case.

534
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,960
I have nothing to do with any other matters.

535
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,320
You still want to continue investigating the case?

536
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,310
Didn't you hear from His Majesty?

537
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,400
The Yan family is under the jurisdiction of Xingwu Guards.

538
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,240
Besides, it's not easy for you to be summoned by His Majesty today.

539
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,510
Your career looks promising.

540
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,320
You need to stop investigating any further.

541
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,230
No way.

542
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,720
The investigation into the rebels is already showing some clues.

543
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,990
Wouldn't it be unfavourable for the case if we hand it over to others now?

544
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,250
It seems like Mr. Zhang

545
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,160
is blaming His Majesty?

546
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,260
It seems that you guys at the Ministry of Justice is dissatisfied with the imperial edict.

547
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,730
Mr. Yao, you must have been mistaken.

548
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:03,330
We were just talking about official matters.

549
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,650
Please be generous,

550
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,390
and not take issue with our words.

551
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:09,090
I've been in charge of the Ministry of Personnel for decades.

552
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,140
I know how to differentiate between personal and official matters.

553
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:12,740
Mr. Zhang,

554
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,190
you might think that you are talented.

555
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:18,010
But if you want to have a real foothold in the court,

556
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:18,980
I'm afraid

557
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,790
you need more practice.

558
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:22,330
Yes, yes.

559
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,740
He has always been acting arbitrarily.

560
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,360
I don't know how many people he has offended.

561
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:31,750
Last time, His Majesty blamed us for the Xingwu Guards incident.

562
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,260
It was resolved all thanks to your kind words.

563
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,090
All of us at the Ministry of Justice were very thankful.

564
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,290
Am I right, Zhang Zhe?

565
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:44,550
Thank you.

566
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,600
Thank you.

567
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:48,600
You are welcome.

568
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:51,900
Look at you.

569
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,790
What a good marriage it could have been,

570
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,400
alongside a great official career.

571
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,230
You just have to ruin it for yourself, don't you?

572
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,530
I work with my heart.

573
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,080
I intend to work hard and pursue a career in this position.

574
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,290
I will continue to investigate the rebels.

575
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,820
As for my personal matters,

576
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,680
please don't mention it again,

577
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,970
so as not to ruin a girl's reputation.

578
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,150
Okay, I'm just being nosy.

579
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,760
Why are you still investigating?

580
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,360
Zhang Zhe.

581
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:20,990
A letter?

582
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,800
Where is this letter from?

583
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,270
Wasn’t it forged by the Xue family?

584
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:24,820
No.

585
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,100
Up to now,

586
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,910
I have never stolen His Lordship's official seal.

587
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:30,910
That half of the official seal

588
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,900
was shot at the Duke's Mansion with an arrow.

589
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,970
As for who was behind it,

590
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,830
even the Duke himself has no idea.

591
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,270
If your previous investigations were correct,

592
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:41,080
and Marquis of Yan had indeed corresponded with Lord Pingnan,

593
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,310
then this half of the seal

594
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,760
would naturally be from the rebels.

595
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,750
Yes, I think so too.

596
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,650
It's useless to say anything now.

597
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,810
Someone in the shadows is trying to stir up the capital.

598
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,470
It's hard to guard against it.

599
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,770
Marquis of Yan is still recuperating.

600
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,660
If Xingwu Guards continue to attack,

601
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,530
I'm afraid it'll affect his health.

602
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:00,990
Do you have any solutions?

603
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:04,510
Mr. Zhou,

604
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,350
people who waver never end well

605
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,750
since the ancient times.

606
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,580
Now that you're on my boat,

607
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,670
you should walk with me till the end.

608
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,620
Isn't it too late for you

609
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,200
to turn to the Xue family?

610
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,010
You worry too much.

611
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:21,160
We've been on the same boat for a long time.

612
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,390
You steer the ship while I'm the oar.

613
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:26,430
But the only reason the oar can still carry the boat

614
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,540
is because it's not broken.

615
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,970
Since investigating the Yan family,

616
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:33,500
the Duke has repeatedly pressed me.

617
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,410
If I don't get any more reliable information,

618
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:37,140
the Duke will definitely suspect me.

619
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,260
When it comes to a suspicious piece of trash,

620
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,120
the Duke will not only discard it,

621
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,490
but will also get rid of it.

622
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,310
Without me as the oar,

623
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,150
who will be the next one?

624
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,610
Are you trying to say that

625
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,910
without the oar, the ship will go astray?

626
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,190
And without you,

627
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,350
I may not be able to

628
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,140
control whoever comes next?

629
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,550
You're exaggerating.

630
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,760
That's not what I meant.

631
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,570
Then tell me,

632
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,260
what are your plans?

633
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,070
From today on,

634
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,460
if there's any information that I have managed to find out about the Yan family,

635
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,180
I will also present it to the Duke,

636
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,010
after informing you about it.

637
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:19,870
Mr. Zhou,

638
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:23,300
I heard there is the role of a banker in the casino.

639
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,250
This person is observant and alert,

640
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,780
and likes to take advantage of everybody.

641
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:30,430
I admit that

642
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:34,890
Zhou Yinzhi is a person who is greedy for wealth and power.

643
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:36,980
But I dare not,

644
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:39,560
and I don't have what it takes to be the banker.

645
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,390
Today, I promise you that

646
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,280
you will be the first to know

647
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,830
any information regarding the Yan family, ahead of the Duke.

648
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,160
Then I ask that Mr. Zhou,

649
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,810
you remember your promise.

650
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:07,840
Zhou Yinzhi.

651
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,370
This time,

652
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,250
don't let me down again.

653
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,780
Miss, are you moving?

654
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,730
Why are you packing things up?

655
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,110
You guys came at the right time.

656
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:37,040
How much cash do we currently have?

657
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,000
Including your monthly salary

658
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:41,520
and His Lordship's allowances over these few years,

659
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,750
as well as the gifts sent to you

660
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,550
during festivals and your birthday,

661
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,700
and then deducting the 400 taels you took the last time,

662
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,360
there is about 300 taels left.

663
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:49,440
So little?

664
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,260
What about these?

665
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,660
How much would these be worth

666
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,800
if we pawned or sold them?

667
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,540
Miss, what are you talking about?

668
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,950
How can a lady from a rich family

669
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,430
sell away her jewelry and treasures?

670
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:03,760
Not to mention, most of these are given to you by His Lordship and Madam,

671
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,160
or Viscount Yan.

672
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,250
Even if you were to pawn it,

673
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,540
no one will accept

674
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:10,070
so many at once.

675
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,380
Miss, are you in some trouble lately?

676
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,120
Maybe you can ask His Lordship for help.

677
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,780
He's always loved you. He won't leave you alone.

678
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,610
It's not yet the time to alarm Father.

679
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,220
How about this, Tang.

680
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,450
You secretly go to You Mansion,

681
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,380
give some money to the servant at the back door,

682
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,000
and ask him to send a message to Fangyin.

683
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,530
Tell her I will be waiting for her at Julai Inn.

684
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,690
Sir, you haven't slept all night.

685
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:07,190
How about you get some rest first?

686
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:07,750
No need.

687
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,610
Tell Chen Ying

688
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,980
to arrange a banquet for his colleagues at a restaurant.

689
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,310
I want to meet Zhang Zhe.

690
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:13,880
Yes.

691
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:16,990
By the way,

692
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:19,180
Have you found Gongyi Cheng?

693
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,600
We've searched the capital.

694
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,930
There is no trace of him.

695
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:25,560
Then search along the water and land, towards the perimeter.

696
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,750
It took him so much effort.

697
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,150
He won't leave so easily.

698
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:28,970
Yes.

699
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:32,230
What about Ning'er? Any news about her?

700
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,270
She's fine.

701
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,550
She went home yesterday on her day off.

702
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,000
She then went to meet Zhou Yinzhi today.

703
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,410
She's busier than an official.

704
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:38,330
Zhou Yinzhi?

705
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,670
It looks like she already knows about the Yan family.

706
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:44,600
Tell the doorman

707
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,820
not to stop her if she comes to look for me.

708
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,170
Yes.

709
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:54,590
[Julai Inn]

710
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,120
Take a look.

711
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,630
With a capital of only 400 taels,

712
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:10,350
even if you managed to earn four times more, that's just 1,600 taels.

713
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,840
At maximum, you should only have 2,000 taels if we include your capital.

714
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,360
Where did you get these 2,500 taels?

715
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,150
I only earned 1,600 taels from selling my accessories.

716
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,280
But after I sold the silk,

717
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,720
Mr. Xu insisted on giving me a bit more no matter what.

718
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,420
So...

719
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,890
Xu Wenyi gave you money?

720
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,430
Mr. Xu was afraid that I would be taken advantage of as an outsider to the industry,

721
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,230
so he only gave me 30% of his silk.

722
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,700
He sold the rest

723
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,030
to someone surnamed Lyu

724
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,890
at last year's market price.

725
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,470
Then, the price of silk shot up.

726
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,510
They managed to sell

727
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,610
all the silk back in their hometown,

728
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:37,870
and made a lot of money.

729
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:40,190
The sericulturists and him were very happy.

730
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,800
At first, he actually insisted on giving me an additional 1,000 taels.

731
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,880
I wouldn't change my mind,

732
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,150
and I persuaded him for a long time,

733
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:47,810
before he finally agreed to give only 500 taels.

734
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,950
Actually, they want to thank you.

735
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,920
The way you are now,

736
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,670
you seem to be doing well.

737
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:54,830
But,

738
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,700
you told Xu Wenyi that the silk price would rise?

739
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,150
When I first went there,

740
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,180
I knew nothing,

741
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,270
so I told him.

742
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:02,670
But don't worry,

743
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,190
I didn't mention your identity.

744
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,260
He asked me who you are,

745
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,050
but I didn’t tell him a single word.

746
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,710
You asked You Fangyin to buy Xu Wenyi's raw silk.

747
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,640
Was it also for the Yan family?

748
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,070
But I am more interested to know

749
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,270
why you so firmly believe that

750
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,670
the price of raw silk will definitely rise?

751
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,250
Is that how he knew?

752
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,530
You said

753
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,710
the person who bought the silk with Xu Wenyi is called Lyu...?

754
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,470
Lyu...

755
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,960
Lyu Xian! Lyu Xian!

756
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,390
It's that unscrupulous businessman, Lyu Xian.

757
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,990
He's in cahoots with Xie Wei?

758
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,830
Miss,

759
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,370
did I cause you trouble?

760
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,350
If this news gets out,

761
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,320
it will indeed cause trouble.

762
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,970
But this time, fortunately,

763
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:46,970
only he found out.

764
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:48,190
He...

765
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,840
Don't worry, it's over.

766
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,770
Let's consider 500 taels as your capital.

767
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,720
We'll split the rest evenly between the both of us.

768
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,610
Take this 1,500 taels.

769
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,480
What are you doing?

770
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:04,980
I know I'm stupid.

771
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,590
I dare not bother you.

772
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,350
But, you were the one who came up with this money-making idea.

773
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,469
Even if you want to send me away,

774
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:12,000
I will not accept the money.

775
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,739
What are you thinking?

776
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:19,920
I gave you money,

777
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:22,710
because I want you to have an easier life in the You family.

778
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,679
You Yue will be returning home in a few days.

779
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,060
If you don't have a bit of money,

780
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,520
I'm afraid you can't even come out to meet me.

781
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:31,310
Well,

782
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,389
I'll take just one piece.

783
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:36,050
You should take the rest back.

784
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,100
That won't do.

785
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,650
Then you're going to lose your capital.

786
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:40,110
Take it.

787
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,610
The capital is yours too.

788
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,630
Next time.

789
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,650
I'll try harder next time,

790
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:55,100
and make a lot of money for you.

791
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,550
Silly girl.

792
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:58,760
Fangyin,

793
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,830
I don't want to stand on ceremony with you.

794
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:01,740
This time,

795
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,510
it's true that I urgently need money to settle a matter.

796
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,370
But this matter

797
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,140
is not something that can be settled with 1,000 or 2,000 taels.

798
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,440
I asked to meet you here today,

799
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,270
because I would like you to help me with another deal.

800
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:12,200
Are you willing?

801
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,700
But this time,

802
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,800
can you share with me the secrets of buying and selling?

803
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,780
I've been learning accounts from Mr. Xu for a long time.

804
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,420
Perhaps, I can offer some advice.

805
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,680
[Yao Mansion]

806
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,350
Take them away.

807
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:51,940
Father,

808
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,650
are all these from the Zhang family?

809
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,370
Father, are you angry

810
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:03,700
because the Zhang family's betrothal gifts are not enough?

811
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:05,870
The Zhang family is poor.

812
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,930
The betrothal gifts are just a formality.

813
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:09,120
I don't mind.

814
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:11,010
I hope Father you can...

815
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,030
Shut up!

816
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,800
Open your eyes and look carefully.

817
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,590
This is the engagement letter returned by the Zhang family.

818
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,580
Now, they have also returned

819
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,090
all the engagement gifts.

820
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,600
Break off the engagement?

821
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,480
How is this possible?

822
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,680
How is this possible?

823
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,180
Tell me,

824
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,290
what did you say and do in the palace?

825
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,950
How dare you try to ruin a man's honor

826
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:36,920
and reputation?

827
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,860
What have I taught you

828
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,150
growing up?

829
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,670
Have you lost all your upbringing?

830
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,630
It's not me.

831
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,920
Mr. Zhang already knows

832
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,940
what you've been up to.

833
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:49,680
He said nothing about you

834
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,880
only because he wanted to preserve your dignity.

835
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,670
I only learned of what you did

836
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,450
from someone else.

837
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,680
How could you do

838
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,860
such a stupid thing?

839
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:03,070
Zhang Zhe has been holding back for so long.

840
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,030
Before this,

841
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,870
I was so hard on him.

842
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,070
I really shouldn't have.

843
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:08,700
Father...

844
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,430
Don't call me Father!

845
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,820
You've thoroughly disgraced

846
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,560
the Yao family.

847
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:18,880
Father!

848
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,590
Please.

849
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,730
A toast to you, alright.

850
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:40,950
Mr. Li, let me pour it for you.

851
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:41,400
Here.

852
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,980
Come on, don't be shy.

853
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,560
Come on. Drink!

854
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,850
It's good wine. Let's eat.

855
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:48,940
Come on.

856
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:52,940
Good food with good wine.

857
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,110
Let's not talk about official matters.

858
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:55,910
Let's just eat.

859
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:56,510
Mr. Zhang.

860
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,950
Come, let's have a drink.

861
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,080
-Come on.
-Mr. Chen.

862
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,490
I have something to do at home.

863
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:01,420
I will get going.

864
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,470
Mr. Zhang,

865
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,720
you don't have your own family. What can happen?

866
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,670
Our colleagues from the Ministry of Justice are all here.

867
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,330
We rarely come out for a drink.

868
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,290
Don't spoil the mood.

869
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,100
Come on, cheers to Mr. Zhang.

870
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,030
Here, Mr. Zhang.

871
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,430
Mr. Zhang, a toast to you.

872
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,360
I never drink.

873
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,690
Drink it by yourselves first.

874
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,490
Just do me a favor.

875
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,190
Stay for another hour.

876
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,970
Tomorrow, I'll write your warrants,

877
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:32,890
and let you continue investigating the case on the rebels.

878
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:33,890
What do you think?

879
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,060
I don't like this place.

880
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,230
I will wait outside.

881
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,060
He's going out for a moment.

882
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,390
It's okay. Let's drink.

883
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:42,950
Here.

884
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:43,280
Okay.

885
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,010
It's suddenly raining so heavily.

886
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,190
It's raining.

887
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,160
I don't know where the carriage is.

888
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,250
Please wait here.

889
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:53,940
I'll be right back.

890
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,450
[Julai Inn]

891
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,430
[Liuxi Pavilion]

892
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,020
Zhang Zhe, Vice Minister of Justice.

893
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:34,780
You are the one who has been

894
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:37,100
making things difficult for Zhou Yinzhi in court,

895
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,590
and said that I colluded with the officials.

896
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:52,930
We are just avoiding the rain.

897
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,100
Why don't you dare to face me?

898
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,380
Are you afraid I'll eat you up?

899
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,190
Forgive me, Your Highness.

900
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,390
I'm just an outsider.

901
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:01,610
I dare not offend you.

902
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:05,040
Please look after yourself, Your Highness.

903
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,680
Why are you still here?

904
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,570
I thought you'd rather get wet

905
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,970
than

906
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,650
be under the same roof as me?

907
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,180
I wouldn't dare to ask Your Majesty to move.

908
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,510
But I also have a message for Your Majesty.

909
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:34,320
You must know that a man who is greedy for his own profit, and who seeks the skin of a tiger,

910
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,450
does not know that the tiger is a tiger.

911
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:39,730
That's because he's born with a vicious nature that doesn't change.

912
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,350
If you seek a tiger's skin today,

913
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:43,550
you will be devoured by a tiger someday.

914
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,400
Your Majesty, take care.

915
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:59,230
Hurry up.

916
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,930
What a heavy rain.

917
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:02,370
♫We made a promise♫

918
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,860
♫Yet we are only left with our memory♫

919
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,970
Miss, are you okay?

920
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,470
The carriage is over there.

921
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:09,130
♫Flowers bloom in the street♫

922
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,430
The rain is getting heavier.

923
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,430
Let's go back.

924
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:13,520
♫Without you♫

925
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,570
♫Watching the clouds wait anxiously for winter♫

926
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:21,630
♫Keep the memories slowly♫

927
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:28,110
♫I've forgotten about the four seasons without you by my side♫

928
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,930
I heard she's been going out a lot lately.

929
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:42,190
What has she been up to?

930
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,370
I am not sure either.

931
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:48,800
What's the point of raising you if you don't know anything?

932
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,230
I'd like to see what that bitch

933
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:54,080
is up to.

934
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,320
Come here.

935
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,310
I'll take you to a nice place.

936
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,170
Sit down.

937
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:10,660
Let me introduce.

938
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:13,460
This is the most trusted person of His Majesty,

939
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,940
Xie Wei, Mr. Xie.

940
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:16,530
I know.

941
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,970
But I am sorry Mr. Xie,

942
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:21,580
I can't help you with your request.

943
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,150
I didn't say anything.

944
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:27,770
Xie Ju'an, from Jinling.

945
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,770
Five years ago, he won three consecutive awards at the imperial examinations.

946
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:33,150
When he entered the palace, he took the position of the Crown Prince's Junior Preceptor.

947
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,690
He's been in court for four years,

948
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:36,360
and has made friends with the Ministry of Justice.

949
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,960
The recent case of the rebels

950
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,240
took a turn for the worse last night to this morning.

951
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:43,330
Then you asked Mr. Chen

952
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:44,150
to meet me.

953
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:48,170
There's no need to say anything more about how it all connects.

954
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,120
It is said that

955
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:53,110
Mr. Zhang is very capable in solving cases.

956
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:56,200
You live up to your name indeed.

957
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,220
Mr. Xie, no need to flatter me.

958
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,900
If you want to get something from me,

959
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:03,290
or you want me to do something,

960
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:05,430
you should say no more.

961
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:08,040
The only thing that

962
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,450
I believe in is justice.

963
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:13,430
With these words from Mr. Zhang,

964
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:14,690
I’m relieved.

965
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,010
The Ministry of Justice and Xingwu Guards

966
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:19,010
are all involved in the Rebels Case,

967
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,710
and there are interdependent trade-offs.

968
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:23,940
I’m just worried that the truth

969
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:25,930
will get foggy and be lost.

970
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:28,330
Mr. Xie, you seem convinced that there is injustice in this case?

971
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:31,060
That is what you, Mr. Zhang, should investigate.

972
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:32,280
I just know

973
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:36,590
the rebels committed crimes repeatedly in the capital.

974
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:38,250
Although it seems unrelated,

975
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,750
there must be some cause and effect.

976
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:43,020
If the plan succeeds,

977
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,520
I'm afraid it'll be a repeat of the Lord Pingnan's case from 20 years ago.

978
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,450
That is not what I would like to see,

979
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:52,500
and I am sure that's not what you want either.

980
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,670
I will investigate the case,

981
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,230
but it has nothing to do with others.

982
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:58,110
Junior Preceptor Xie, you don't have to look for me anymore.

983
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:58,640
Goodbye.

984
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:00,930
You...

985
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:03,350
I have told you before.

986
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:04,790
He's a cesspit of a rock.

987
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:05,990
If it was not for the fact that Mr. Gu

988
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,150
is about to take office,

989
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:09,730
I would have kicked him out of the Ministry of Justice.

990
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:10,730
A sharp sword

991
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:13,110
will have its time and place to prove its worth.

992
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:13,790
Besides,

993
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:16,720
doesn't the court need people

994
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:18,080
who don't form cliques?

995
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:19,800
Yes.
