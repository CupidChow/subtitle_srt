00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,440
let Jiang Xuening go back to the past

173
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,380
with her memories of this life

174
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,160
and experience everything again.

175
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,450
Let her know what she did wrong

176
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,050
and what she neglected,

177
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,290
so she can make up for them.

178
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,840
It'll also let her figure out

179
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,430
what she really wants.

180
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,830
So, she won't repeat the same mistake.

181
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,980
If I knew this would happen,

182
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,200
I would not have wasted my life

183
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,500
chasing after fame and power.

184
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,250
I should have traveled far and wide.

185
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,330
To see the vast land and waters,

186
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,700
to be free like the birds.

187
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:08,970
This time,

188
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,360
Jiang Xuening

189
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,040
will never enter the palace again.

190
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,590
How dare you!

191
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,670
[Lord Linzi, Shen Jie]

192

[Viscount of Yan Mansion, Yan Lin]

194
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,650
What did you do to her?

195
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:26,850
What can I do?

196
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,090
We're both men.

197
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,140
What's going on?

198
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,630
I was in Ning'an Palace just now.

199
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,360
Why did I suddenly appear here?

200
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,350
It seems

201
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,130
Shen Jie hasn't ascended the throne yet,

202
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,230
and the Yan family hasn’t been killed yet.

203
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,350
What's wrong?

204
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,340
No.

205
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,010
This happened when I was 18.

206
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,850
What year is it this year?

207
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:15,670
Who am I?

208
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,830
This year is the 20th year of Wanzhen.

209
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,500
What's wrong, Ning?

210
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,460
Why are you talking nonsense?

211
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:24,920
Yan Lin.

212
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,550
I have something to do. I have to go.

213
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,360
Shen, my friend.

214
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,310
That was rude of me.

215
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,910
I'll make a toast to you next time as an apology.

216
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,350
Ning!

217
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,950
-Ning! -Jiang, my friend!

218
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,010
You drank so much. I'll take you home.

219
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,870
You're only going to make a toast?

220
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,300
See?

221
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,380
It's just a misunderstanding.

222
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,580
Jiang is still drunk.

223
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:40,460
Besides,

224
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,110
we grew up together.

225
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,290
If I had any ideas,

226
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,090
I would have targeted you first.

227
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,310
Your Highness, mind your words.

228
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,640
Even if I did offend him,

229
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,360
what can you do? Chop my hands off?

230
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:51,860
I will.

231
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:52,740

Oh no.

Mr. Xie is holding a lecture in Wenhua Hall today.

234

We'll be punished if we're late.

Yes.

239
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,160
I'm just as confused.

240
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:01,760
How could something so ridiculous happen in this world?

241
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:03,850
Hurry.

242
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,040
I'm late.

243
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,900
Please punish me, teacher.

Forget it.

You were in such a rush.

259
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,700
Did you come from some tavern?

260
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,990
It's fine that you lack discipline.

261
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,480
But you even implicated His Highness, Lord Linzi.

262

Xue Ye, what nonsense are you spouting this time?

263
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,080
We all know if it's nonsense or not.

264

The Yongyi Mansion is made up of a bunch of barbarians.

265

How dare you challenge us Ding Mansion?

266

A bunch of barbarians?

267
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,300
I think Ding Mansion is made up of a bunch of barbarians!

A gentleman does not argue nor fight.

271

He shouldn't disturb his mind before the music either.

-Second Young Lady. -Where are you taking Wan Niang?

Wan Niang has disrupted

the legitimate bloodline of the Jiang family.

287

She made a huge mistake, you know?

288
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,150
That's why she can't be buried in the Jiang family's graveyard.

289
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,420
We can only find a spot somewhere

00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,740
to get through it safely.

343
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,610
You only managed to return to the mansion now.

344
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,290
From now on, I'll tell everyone that

345
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,760
you are the second daughter of the Jiang family.

346
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:56,500
Why?

347
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,510
All I want is for her to return

348
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,240
what's mine.

349
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,370
Wan Niang, that despicable woman.

350
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,490
How did she teach you all these years?

351
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,710
How could you be so intolerant of others?

352
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:08,910
Wan Niang is not despicable.

353
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,180
If she's not, who is?

354
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,820
Back then, we gave birth on the same night.

355
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,100
If she hadn't played tricks

356
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,330
and switched the two of you when you were babies,

357
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,580
how could we have been

358
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,500
separated for so many years?

359
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:25,300
Yes.

360
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,620
I was raised by Wan Niang.

361
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,080
I'm barbaric, vulgar,

362
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,080
and unforgiving.

363
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,390
So what?

364
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,250
At least I'm not fake and

365
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,600
pretentious like you.

366
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,670
How could you be so treacherous?

367
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,510
Listen up.

368
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,940
From now on,

369
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,380
no one is allowed to mention Wan Niang.

370
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,460
Aren't you Wan Niang's flesh and blood?

371
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,220
Why aren't you speaking for her?

372
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,080
Say something!

373
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,220
What are you doing?

374
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:55,790
Stop messing around!

375
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,300
Madam!

376
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,260
Madam! Madam!

377
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,860
-Mother.
-Are you alright?

378
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:05,610
It's an ill fate.

379
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:08,110
It really is.

380
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,170
Look at you now.

381
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,760
You're the daughter of a noble family.

382
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,480
How can you

383
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,550
dress like this?

384
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,300
You regularly disregard your seniors and ignore family rules.

385
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,700
Fine, I can put up with that.

386
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,590
But this time,

387
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,360
you stayed out all night.

388
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:26,900
Isn't that too much?

389
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,280
Looks like you need to learn a lesson.

390
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:30,960
Nanny Yang.

391
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,450
Teach the Second Young Lady a good lesson,

392
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,980
so that she may remember it.

393
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:37,790
Madam.

394
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,990
Second Young Lady was flogged a few days ago.

395
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,290
Please forgive her this time.

396
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,160
Yes, Madam.

397
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,520
My lady!

398
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,620
Stop!

399
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,440
Second Young Lady.

400
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,050
Madam is doing this for your own good.

401
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,260
This is the way of filial piety.

402
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,550
Please accept the punishment.

403
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,080
I've been away for too long.

404
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,490
So long, that I forgot.

405
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:07,620
Last time,

406
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,290
it was full of conflicts and quarrels too.

407
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,200
What are you talking about?

408
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,070
I once thought that

409
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,220
since we are related by blood,

410
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,810
I may earn your genuine love

411
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,450
if I obeyed you.

412
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,210
But later I figured it out.

413
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:22,810
We're always

414
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,650
separated by Wan Niang.

415
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,270
Although you have given birth to me,

416
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,330
the grudge between us is inevitable.

417
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:32,330
If you are not destined to receive something,

418
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,470
don't force it.

419
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:34,710
Jiang Xuening.

420
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,050
Father has given me permission

421
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,920
to venture outside, disguised as a man.

422
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,310
I'm afraid your showcase of authority

423
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,440
is misplaced today.

424
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:41,410
How insolent!

425
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,000
Is this how you talk to your mother?

426
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,640
How dare you disrespect me?

427
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,080
Mother, calm down.

428
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,970
Your health is the most important.

429
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:53,620
I didn't expect

430
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,000
you to be so naughty

431
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,360
and hard to discipline.

432
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,630
Aren't you capable?

433
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,640
Fine.

434
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,310
You can stay right here

435
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,670
without going anywhere else.

436
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:03,870
Reflect on yourself.

437
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,260
Mother, take care.

438
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:19,820
Jiang is actually

439
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,750
the second daughter of the Vice Minister of Revenue?

440
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,550
Keep your voice down.

441
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:28,750
Let me tell you.

442
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,190
I'll make one thing clear.

443
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,300
Ning is mine.

444
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,930
Don't even think about wooing her.

445
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,450
Since you treasure her so much,

446
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,040
why did you introduce her

447
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,970
to me yesterday?

448
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,250
Just hide her.

449
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,690
That's becauseI I treat you as my brother.

450
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,390
Who wants to hear it?

451
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:47,740
But...

452
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,360
Miss Jiang has a bad reputation

453
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,600
in the capital.

454
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,810
Everyone knows that she is arrogant and domineering.

455
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:54,980
Not everyone

456
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,400
has a unique taste like you.

457
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,920
Those are all false.

458
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,400
Stuff like her being born in the countryside,

459
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,950
or being mischievous and unsightly. It's all false.

460
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,750
Why do you listen to such rumors?

461
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,900
I know very well

462
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,870
what kind of person Ning is.

463
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,890
You can ignore it.

464
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,150
But Jiang...

465
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,830
I mean, Miss Jiang.

466
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,130
She's a lady after all.

467
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,910
If you keep bringing her around with you like that,

468
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,630
I'm afraid it won't be good for her reputation.

469
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:17,860
She's the result of my doting.

470
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,380
Naturally, I'll be the one to marry her.

471
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,840
My coming-of-age ceremony is in two months.

472
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:22,870
When the time comes,

473
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:25,400
I'll officially propose to the Jiang family.

474
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,210
Ning Er...

475
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,080
Is Ning inside?

476
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,170
I brought her some medicine.

477
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,480
Mother was harsh on her today.

478
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,880
Make sure she's not hurt.

479
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,660
Thank you, First Lady.

480
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,520
[Jiang Xuehui's maid, Mei'er]

481
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,710
What a coincidence.

482
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,770
The things from First Young Lady's place

483
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:53,820
are always good.

484
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,690
I'll take the medicine.

485
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:56,790
You old woman,

486
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,940
know your manners in front of the First Young Lady.

487
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,540
This medicine is not for you.

488
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:01,610
Back then,

489
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,750
I took the Second Young Lady back to the capital.

490
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,360
Second Young Lady trusts me.

491
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,250
I'm in charge of

492
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,940
everything in her place.

493
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:09,470
You...

494
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,770
It's all the same.

495
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,580
When did you start

496
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,780
calling the shots here, Nanny Wang?

497
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,260
You misunderstood, my lady.

498
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,690
Your health is precious.

499
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,840
I just want to

500
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,600
try the medicine for you first.

501
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,080
Not everything

502
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,710
can be used on you.

503
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:25,690
Am I right?

504
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,990
Nanny Wang, you sure are concerned about me.

505
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,730
In the past, whenever the Second Young Lady was unhappy,

506
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,120
she'd surely make things difficult for us.

507
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,150
Why is she so peaceful today?

508
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,030
In this house, apart from Lian'er and Tang'er

509
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,520
who are loyal to me,

510
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,390
the rest treat me as a fool.

511
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,540
I didn't care about them before.

512
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,940
But they were so rampant behind their back.

513
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,130
I see.

514
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,070
They stole pretty much everything.

515
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,030
Come here.

516
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:33,660
My lady.

517
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,320
Stand closer.

518
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:36,960
Why are you so afraid of me?

519
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,930
I won't eat you.

520
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,160
My lady.

521
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,360
I didn't steal it.

522
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,200
I've always behaved myself and remained loyal.

523
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,800
Please don't sell me off.

524
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,400
I used to be arrogant and domineering.

525
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,210
I scolded and hit the servants a lot too.

526
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,340
I have to put up an act

527
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,310
so no one will be the wiser.

528
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,710
Please spare me.

529
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,070
-I will never...
-Shut up!

530
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,090
If you keep talking,

531
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,900
I won't let you eat for three days.

532
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,520
And you have to

533
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,200
wash all the clothes in the yard yourself.

534
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,130
Then, I'll sell you to be a laborer.

535
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:03,810
That's right.

536
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,410
She's back to normal.

537
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:06,990
So you just like

538
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,250
an unreasonable lady?

539
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:12,160
I was worried that you're sick.

540
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,350
Alright.

541
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,030
Stop it.

542
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,980
As you can see today,

543
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,720
Nanny Wang has no respect even for me.

544
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,750
Even the other servants are stealing from me.

545
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,090
So they really think

546
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,840
I don't know what I have.

547
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,580
They're stealing from me on a regular basis.

548
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,170
I have to discipline them.

549
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,210
But, my lady.

550
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,150
We don't have any evidence.

551
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,760
How will you

552
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,980
identify them and make them confess?

553
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,980
I was studying the chess manual today,

554
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,470
and chanced upon some puzzling parts.

555
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:53,400
I suddenly remembered that I received your guidance

556
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,440
when I first came to the capital.

557
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,870
So I came uninvited today,

558
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,010
hoping I may receive your advice.

559
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,610
I hope I'm not bothering you.

560
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,780
Junior Preceptor Xie, your shouldn't say that.

561
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,840
You are the emperor's half-teacher.

562
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,900
I dare not give you any advice.

563
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:14,310
[Vice Minister of Revenue, Jiang Boyou]

564
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,590
It is at most

565
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,170
a discussion between us.

566
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,920
It's no bother at all.

567
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,280
If you don't mind,

568
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,910
you can just call me Ju'an.

569
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,280
Is that okay?

570
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,900
What's going on?

571
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,470
What does the Second Young Lady want?

572
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,270
That's right.

573
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,830
Second Young Lady.

574
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:33,980
Well...

575
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,180
There are many chores in the mansion that needs tending to.

576
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,150
You know that.

577
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,290
Many chores

578
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,060
are waiting to be done.

579
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,610
You suddenly called everyone here.

580
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:46,060
Is there something you wish to announce?

581
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,460
It's nothing important.

582
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,200
My boxes are empty, that's all.

583
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,450
Return everything

584
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,910
you took in the past.

585
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,990
No one took anything?

586
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,110
Second Young Lady.

587
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,590
You have really

588
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,180
wronged us.

589
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,310
Everyone

590
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:07,780
serves you in this yard.

591
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,930
We have prioritized you

592
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,710
in everything we do.

593
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,670
You are the master.

594
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,510
Who dares to take your things?

595
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,620
It doesn't matter.

596
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,350
I knew this was going to happen.

597
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,350
Please wait.

598
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,170
If I can't handle you,

599
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,930
someone else can.

600
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,100
Master! Master!

601
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:27,610
My Lord!

602
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,360
What's wrong?

603
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,880
Something happened to the Second Young Lady.

604
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,430
What happened to Ning this time?

605
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,760
Tell me, what happened?

606
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,440
Second Young Lady said

607
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:40,340
she wants to discipline the servants who stole her things.

608
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,670
Did she really say that?

609
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,350
This girl.

610
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:46,190
Why has she suddenly changed her mind and approach?

611
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,350
Did the anger get to her head?

612
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,480
Let's go. I need to see this.

613
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:51,530
Master, the...

614
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:53,730
Ju'an.

615
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,520
I'm afraid I'll have to keep you waiting for a while.

616
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,070
Some unlawful acts have occurred in my residence.

617
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,270
I need to deal with it.

618
00:30:59,560 --> 00:30:59,960
You...

619
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:00,970
No worries.

620
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,470
Mr. Jiang, please go ahead.

621
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:02,820
Okay.

622
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:03,450
Okay.

623
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,470
Come on, let's go.

624
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:26,730
Second Young Lady.

625
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,180
We've been here for a while now.

626
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,920
If the chores are delayed,

627
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,950
Madam is sure to blame us.

628
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,680
It won't bore well for any of us.

629
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,660
Yes.

630
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,340
Nanny Wang,

631
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,950
when did you become so timid?

632
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,320
Look.

633
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,720
Isn’t he here?

634
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,650
What's wrong, Ning?

635
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,560
Greetings, Father.

636
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,130
I'm incompetent,

637
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,580
and I'm unable to discipline my servants.

638
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,110
So I could only trouble you.

639
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,230
What are you talking about?

640
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,420
With me here to uphold justice for you,

641
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,880
everything can be solved.

642
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:05,740
That's good.

643
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,540
Please take a seat, Father.

644
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:07,900
Okay.

645
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,760
I've said it just now.

646
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,680
Anyone who took my stuff

647
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,860
ought to find it and put it back.

648
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,800
I can let bygones be bygones.

649
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,060
What?

650
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,160
Have all of you

651
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,050
gone mute?

652
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,220
If anyone dares to lie to me,

653
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,880
I'll break your limbs

654
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:29,900
and sell you off!

655
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,510
Master, please spare my life!

656
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,740
Please spare my life!

657
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,140
My lady.

658
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,070
If you could bring out a ledger

659
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,190
and confront us one by one,

660
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,780
we may be convinced.

661
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:47,480
But you don't even know what you have.

662
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,470
Today, you said the things in the boxes

663
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,630
are missing.

664
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,200
But you can also say there are too many things inside.

665
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,310
Everything is only according to your words.

666
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:54,870
Yes.

667
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:55,990
So you mean

668
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,220
I'm framing you?

669
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,960
I dare not say that.

670
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:05,090
It's just that we are all from poor families.

671
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:08,060
We really don't have money to contribute to your lackings.

672
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,570
Yes.

673
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,720
Please uphold justice for us, Master.

674
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,780
Please help us!

675
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,050
We are innocent!

676
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,440
Master! Master!

677
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,100
Ning.

678
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,840
What is going on?

679
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:21,610
Father.

680
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,990
They're certain

681
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,140
that I couldn't provide any evidence.

682
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,470
That's why they dare to distort the truth.

683
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,910
Do you really think

684
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,380
I have no idea?

685
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,320
Tang'er.

686
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:32,630
Get the ledger.

687
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,620
There's really a ledger?

688
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,510
It's the sixth book from the left

689
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,330
on the third rack of my bookshelf.

690
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:40,800
Go.

691
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,150
What ledger?

692
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,090
I don't know.

693
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:43,750
Do you know?

694
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:44,690
What ledger?

695
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,670
I don't know.

696
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,170
Yes.

697
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,810
[Book of Poems, volume 5]

698
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,760
Is there really a ledger?

699
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,810
Let me take a look.

700
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,160
On my eighteenth birthday,

701
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,480
Father gave me a red jade Ruyi pendant,

702
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,270
and a kingfisher plume headpiece.

703
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,070
Father, look.

704
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,710
Did I remember it correctly?

705
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:11,489
Let me see.

706
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,639
That's right.

707
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,100
Also.

708
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:28,030
Prince Yan gave me a pair of white porcelain flowers,

709
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:30,080
a luminous pearl from the State of Yi,

710
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,610
and a nine-chain puzzle carved from

711
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,150
a whole piece of fine white tallow jade.

712
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,860
This item is official-made.

713
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,250
If any of you

714
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,320
foolishly pawned it,

715
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,179
I'm afraid you'll be sent to jail.

716
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,130
Nanny Wang.

717
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,230
Am I right?

718
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:45,489
I see how it is.

719
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,190
Now we have solid evidence.

720
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,260
If you don't admit it now...

721
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,340
Guards!

722
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:52,960
My Lord.

723
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,560
Search every room.

724
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:57,300
When they find the stolen goods,

725
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,800
I will punish you severely.

726
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,070
Yes.

727
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,360
Please spare my life.

728
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,280
What should we do?

729
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,880
Master, please spare my life!

730
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,800
Please forgive me, Master.

731
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:08,100
I'll tell you everything.

732
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,900
I was wrong.

733
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,760
I was blinded by greed.

734
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,010
My Lord.

735
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,360
I'm confessing too.

736
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,500
My lady, please show mercy!

737
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:22,310
Master, I confess.

738
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,570
I was wrong.

739
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,220
You finally confessed.

740
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,240
Don't worry.

741
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,990
Today, while Father is here,

742
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,750
you can take your time confessing every single one

743
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,610
of your crimes.

744
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:35,020
We confess. We confess.

745
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,610
All of us.

746
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,200
My girl Ning has grown up.

747
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,280
Now I can rest assured.

748
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,230
But how did you come up with

749
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,500
the idea for the ledger

750
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,600
just now?

751
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,760
And you remembered it so clearly.

752
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,280
Father, you're exaggerating.

753
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,480
I'm not that capable.

754
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,150
Yan Lin taught me all that.

755
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,330
It's that brat again.

756
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,520
Even if you get along,

757
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,650
you're both grown up now.

758
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:07,210
You can't stay together all the time.

759
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,270
By the way, Father.

760
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,490
What are you going to do

761
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:10,690
with those servants?

762
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,160
In your opinion,

763
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:13,870
what should we do?

764
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,610
As the saying goes,

765
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:18,010
no one is a saint, everyone makes mistakes.

766
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,850
They were originally just servants.

767
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:20,870
After all, it is

768
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,030
my indulgence towards them

769
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,630
that led to this outcome.

770
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,360
Since both sides are at fault,

771
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,900
I don't want to go too far.

772
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:29,100
Excluding those who talked back,

773
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,060
the rest will be flogged five times

774
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:32,650
and have their two months' salary deducted.

775
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:33,840
In the future, as long as they serve me wholeheartedly

776
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,320
and never steal again, they will all be forgiven.

777
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,330
If they do it again,

778
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:37,150
I'll single them out,

779
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,480
and settle the old and new scores together.

780
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,820
I'll sell them straight away.

781
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,280
What do you think, Father?

782
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,440
Why are you looking at me like that?

783
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,350
I thought,

784
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,220
with your personality,

785
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,760
you'd definitely make a fuss out of it.

786
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:52,630
By the way,

787
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,000
did Viscount Yan

788
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,000
teach you to say these as well?

789
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,790
It seems that Yan Mansion

790
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:02,660
has a worthy successor.

791
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,900
Since Father said so,

792
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,840
about Mother grounding me...

793
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,710
-About this…
-Mr. Jiang.

794
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,750
Ju'an.

795
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,840
Pardon me.

796
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,640
I couldn't sit still,

797
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,210
so I came out to enjoy the scenery.

798
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:34,810
I didn't expect the Miss Xuening to be here too.

799
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:35,950
Excuse me.

800
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,600
It's my fault, Ju'an.

801
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,060
Sorry to keep you waiting.

802
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,590
Ning,

803
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,260
go back to your room and rest.

804
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:42,860
Remember.

805
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,020
you must greet your mother tonight.

806
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:47,940
It's been years

807
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,140
since we went our separate ways.

808
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,670
My impression of Miss Xuening

809
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,130
was still that of the past.

810
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,230
Having met you today,

811
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,530
you seem more mature and mellow now.

812
00:37:59,030 --> 00:37:59,630
Oh, that's right.

813
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,320
Ning,

814
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,560
when you came to the capital alone,

815
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,210
I heard Ju'an was on the same way.

816
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,870
So I asked him to accompany you

817
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,070
and take care of you.

818
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,180
Do you remember me?

819
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,470
I am Xie Wei.

820
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,830
[Four years ago]

821
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,450
I'm here on Mr. Jiang's behalf.

822
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,580
Sorry to bother you.

823
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:22,370
Ning.

824
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,310
Why are you just standing there?

825
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,160
Don't be rude

826
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,460
in front of the guest.

827
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:29,190
It doesn't matter.

828
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,940
Miss Xuening was busy strategizing just now.

829
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,100
She must be tired.

830
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,170
It's better for her to return to her room

831
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,170
and get some rest.

832
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:37,790
You're right. Here.

833
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:39,320
Bring her lady back to rest.

834
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,270
-Yes.
-Come, Ju'an.

835
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:40,870
This way.

836
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:41,640
To the study.

837
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:43,730
Come on.
