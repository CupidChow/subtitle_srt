are a dreamy and peaceful.

20
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,080
The three-leaf cladding and the yellow-patterned

are a dreamy and peaceful.

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,280
Episode 1

24
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,280
When I was little,

25
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,280
my mother told me

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,800
that the most precious woman in the world is the Empress.

27
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,840
The palace where the Empress lives

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,240
is called the Palace of the Nings.

29
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,600
I asked my mother,

30
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,400
what does the Palace of the Nings look like?

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,560
I don't know either.

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,920
When I sat under the roof of the palace,

33
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,320
I thought,

34
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,520
if I could become the red leaf that flew over the sky,

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,240
and fly to the palace of the palace

36
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,720
with the golden silk,

37
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,280
I would be so happy to see what the Palace of the Nings looks like.

38
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,560
I was frightened as hell.

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,980
What I couldn't see in this world

40
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:43,640
is actually the skyrocketing 지금은.

41
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,960
But I fell into this world

42
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,960
because of you.

43
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,160
I lost my foundation in thatetus.

44
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,240
I was intensively chased away,

45
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,780
kept

46
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,780
ceptions of out viele

47
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,860
I loved you

48
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,500
and had many Heavenly seeds

49
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,100
that petrified me

50
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,740
He survived

51
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,040
even though

52
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,580
I died that

53
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,200
What I saved

54
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:20,920
was a comeback

55
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,460
Cut him to pieces

56
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,500
Anyone

57
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:27,980
wants me dead

58
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:53,960
tattoos

59
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,320
Maybe he is two-shot

60
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,600
You fuck.

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,440
Aren't you ashamed for not being alive?

62
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,360
You no understand.

63
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,680
Garon gives aити to Minister Jun,

64
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,280
takes the crowned на refrain

65
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,840
andierto with the sword.

66
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,120
I wish someone would like to explain their own concern to me

67
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:39,720
that you don't have anything to say to

68
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,080
Will it take long to surpass the hyung's challenge?

69
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,040
We are not good opponents

70
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,000
From the beginning, we're not good enemies

71
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,000
From the beginning, it's hard

72
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,000
We will pursue a lead

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,160
Not just me,

74
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,400
but also you.

75
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,280
Since today,

76
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,120
Yan's army shall boards

77
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:07,600
the City by the riders.

78
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,680
That's our position.

79
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,920
The sun has set,

80
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,000
and things are over.

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,880
But in this illusion,

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I've been a burden to you.

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
In this life,

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I've done too much evil.

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I've also become too much fruit.

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Why don't I use this life-threatening weapon

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
to destroy the last good thing?

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Thank you for your willingness to see me.

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Your Highness, please tell me.

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You must have a straightforward statement

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
in order to realize this.

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm willing to admit my wrongdoing.

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'll use your broad-mindedness to designate,

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
assist the court and choose the new emperor.

95
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I only beg you to promise me one thing.

96
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What is it?

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I've used too many people in this life.

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But it's been calculated that

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I've paid the full amount of love and affection to Yanling.

100
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yanling has already given up on me.

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Your Majesty is still alive. I'm the empress.

102
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Please allow me to enter the palace.

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yanling, are you crazy?

104
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I've been waiting for you.

105
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm not.

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm not.

107
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm not.

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yanling, are you crazy?

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You've been in the palace for years.

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But you told me that you would be the empress.

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm already crazy.

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What? You forgot, didn't you?

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Then I'll remember it one by one.

114
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let you remember it well.

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm willing to use the blood-drenched consort

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
to protect the Ying family.

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
They've already borrowed my throne.

118
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I've calculated that the Shen family

119
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
has the throne of the empress.

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But now,

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I have to sacrifice for her

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
and pay the full amount of money.

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I don't owe them.

124
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But there's only one person

125
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
who can make a living

126
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
and live a life of peace.

127
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm the one who's been in the world.

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm the one who's been in the world.

129
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm the one who's been in the world.

130
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm the one who's been in the world.

131
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
She's a good official.

132
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I hope you can

133
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
choose the person who's been in the world

134
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and choose the one who's not in the world

135
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
to sacrifice for you.

136
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'll sacrifice her.

137
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'll let her live.

138
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
How many lives do you need

139
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
to sacrifice a Zhang Zhe?

140
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Brother.

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Xiao Wei.

144
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Kill her.

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Brother.

146
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Hello, dear.

147
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Have you finished your draft?

148
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't want to write it.

149
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What's wrong with it?

150
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Do you know that

151
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
your book, Nian An Ru Meng,

152
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
has been printed in the book.

153
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You're still unhappy?

154
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I didn't want to write this book.

155
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Look at the current owner.

156
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What's the situation?

157
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
This is not the price I want to sell.

158
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But the current market

159
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
is not as good as the current market.

160
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm not sure.

161
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm not sure.

162
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
But the current market...

163
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You've been forcing me to write the market.

164
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,040
You have to make some

165
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,000
unruly arguments.

166
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
But Jiang Xue Ning is my star.

167
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It shouldn't be the end.

168
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I want to write according to my own ideas.

169
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Otherwise, I can't make up for it.

170
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Don't be impulsive.

171
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
If you don't listen to me,

172
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
you can discuss it.

173
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Tell me

174
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
what you want to change.

175
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I want to

176
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
let Jiang Xue Ning

177
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
bring back the memories of her life

178
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
and go through it again.

179
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Let her know

180
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
what she did wrong

181
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and what she neglected.

182
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Go to make up for it

183
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
and go back.

184
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Let her think about

185
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
what she really wants.

186
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Don't be impulsive.

187
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
If I knew it was the end of today,

188
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I would have been in a difficult situation

189
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
and saved my life.

190
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'd rather go to Wanli Road

191
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
to see Wanli River Mountain.

192
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
But I'll go there

193
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
to be free.

194
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
This time,

195
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'll go to Wanli Road

196
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
to see the river.

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'll go to the river

198
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
to see the river.

199
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'll go to the river

200
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
to see the river.

201
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
This time,

202
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'll never go to the palace again.

203
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Wanli Road

204
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Fan Zi!

205
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I've got to go.

206
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'll go back.

207
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Why did you do that to her?

208
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What can I do?

209
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
We're all men.

210
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
What's going on here?

211
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,400
What's going on?

212
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,520
I was still in Ning'an Palace.

213
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,400
Why did I suddenly appear here?

214
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,720
It seems like

215
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,880
Shen Jie hasn't been ascended the throne.

216
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,640
Yan Jia hasn't been born yet.

217
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,720
What's wrong with me?

218
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,160
Wrong.

219
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,760
I was away 18 years old.

220
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,000
I am a monk this year.

221
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,120
I am a monk again.

222
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,880
You are a true man.

223
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,120
What happened to you?

224
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,720
How are you able to make such a joke?

225
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,160
Yan Ling, I have other things to do.

226
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,080
Brother Shen.

227
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,000
It was my mistake earlier.

228
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,840
Please forgive me by holding you in red wine.

229
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,040
Ning Ling.

230
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,040
Ning Ling.

231
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,800
Why are you so drunk?

232
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,960
I'll walk you home to drink a little.

233
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,760
Let's go and have some herbs.

234
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,720
A lot of herb here.

235
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,160
You see?

236
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,320
It's just a misunderstanding.

237
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,600
Jiang Shuang hasn't woken up yet.

238
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,440
Moreover,

239
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,960
you and I grew up together.

240
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,040
If I have any ideas,

241
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,440
I should find you first.

242
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,760
Your Highness, you're wise.

243
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,400
Even if I really offend him,

244
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,920
you can still hold my hand.

245
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,800
I will.

246
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,800
You...

247
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,800
Let's go.

248
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,600
Since Mr. Xie wants to start the day in the flower shop,

249
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,000
I'll punish him with my punishment.

250
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:52,040
Jayang's

251
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,540
You're 먹고vers whose respect you value jaot right?

252
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,560
You're not been treating me as a lamp.

253
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,200
Don't issue me for the second time.

254
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,840
Master.

255
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,800
Ma Ho!

256
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,740
Ma Ho!

257
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,660
The nettail is the legendary Chiya Bang!

258
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,240
the legendary Chiya Bang!

259
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,820
We must escape.

260
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,440
They want to kill our Zhao Gu.

261
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,440
We can't escape.

262
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,320
They asked what kind of traps they would catch if there's a way.

263
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,400
No.

264
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,040
That's right.

265
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,540
I can't believe

266
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,860
ambus go 도 兴

267
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,240
I'm returning again.

268
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,240
Please punish me.

269
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,600
Where's your love?

270
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,760
I'm sorry, Young Master Xie.

271
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,040
I...

272
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,040
Young Master Xie, it's me...

273
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,440
Forget it.

274
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,840
I didn't pay the price yesterday.

275
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,360
You don't have to be punished.

276
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,160
Today is a special day.

277
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,160
Please sit down.

278
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,160
Thank you, Young Master Xie.

279
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,240
This...

280
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,840
Master Yan,

281
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,240
you're so anxious.

282
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,240
Why did you open the bar?

283
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,240
Forget it if you don't want to.

284
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,240
You even implicated Prince Lingzi.

285
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,240
What nonsense are you talking about?

286
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,240
You know what I'm talking about.

287
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,240
Yongyi's mansion is a mess.

288
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,240
How dare you call me a mess?

289
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,240
A mess?

290
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,240
I don't think you're a mess.

291
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,240
You're so reckless.

292
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,240
You're not fighting with each other.

293
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,240
You shouldn't mess with each other before you fall in love.

294
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,240
You two,

295
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,240
go to the mansion to wake up.

296
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,240
Is that meaningful?

297
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
Young Master Xie,

298
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,240
you should go to the mansion to wake up.

299
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,240
You can't go to the mansion to wake up.

300
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,240
I'm sorry.

301
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
You're not going to wake up?

302
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,240
I'm sorry.

303
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,240
I'm sorry.

304
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,240
Young Master Xie,

305
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,240
you're so anxious.

306
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,240
You're not fighting with each other.

307
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,240
You're so reckless.

308
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,240
You're so reckless.

309
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,240
You're not fighting with each other.

310
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,240
You're not fighting with each other.

311
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,240
You're not fighting with each other.

312
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,240
You're not fighting with each other.

313
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,240
You're not fighting with each other.

314
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,240
You're not fighting with each other.

315
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,240
You're not fighting with each other.

316
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,240
You're not fighting with each other.

317
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,240
You're not fighting with each other.

318
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,240
You're not fighting with each other.

319
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,240
You're not fighting with each other.

320
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,240
You're not fighting with each other.

321
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,240
You're not fighting with each other.

322
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,240
You're not fighting with each other.

323
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,240
I don't want any fights now.

324
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,240
I want,

325
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,240
until I get a chance to trust all of you.

326
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,240
Because I never let everyone in

327
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,240
goweh.

328
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,240
You can choose ever statement of that picture.

329
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,240
You have no choice.

330
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,240
You are the only one I know.

331
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,340
You can go back and look after

332
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:35,060
[...]

333
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,220
Young AlsoSongA pledged to send him away?

334
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,540
[...]

335
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,940
and killed him And open the newspapers

336
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,940
Do you know that?

337
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,140
ת perdre not to marry him

338
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,100
she could only get someone else

339
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,620
You should be happy

340
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,620
Miss!

341
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,620
Miss, listen to me.

342
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,620
Let me go!

343
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,620
Miss!

344
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,620
Miss!

345
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:22,620
It's a pity that something can't be changed.

346
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,620
You still know to come back?

347
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,620
Come.

348
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:43,620
Madam, please take her back safely.

349
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:00,620
My sister Ning is back. You're finally back.

350
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:05,620
I'm your mother. Your biological mother.

351
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:19,620
It's okay. You just came back. You need to get used to it.

352
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,620
Hui, come here.

353
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,620
Come here.

354
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,620
This is your sister, Xue Hui. This is your sister.

355
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,620
Sister.

356
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,620
Are you okay?

357
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,620
You want to make up for me?

358
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,620
Go tell everyone that I'm the only enemy of the Jiang family.

359
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,620
And she is the only daughter of my mother.

360
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,620
It's not your sister's fault.

361
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:02,620
My mother was unwell and was punished for her wrongdoings.

362
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,620
She was so careless that she didn't want to harm you.

363
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,620
Besides, our family is also a family of people.

364
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,620
How can a family like her be so important?

365
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:16,620
You're being criticized by your master.

366
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:21,620
You must be away from Fan Xiao before you're 14.

367
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,620
You're now in the house.

368
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:30,620
Tell everyone that you're the only daughter of the Jiang family.

369
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,620
Why? I just want her to give me back what belongs to me.

370
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,620
How did she teach you that bitch?

371
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,620
How could she not even have the strength to be a woman?

372
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,620
She's not a bitch. She's not a bitch.

373
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:49,620
We were parted at the same party.

374
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:54,620
If she didn't secretly take the blame and secretly transferred you two,

375
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:59,620
how could our mother and daughter be separated for so many years?

376
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:03,620
Yes. I was raised by my mother.

377
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,620
I was also a coward and was rude to others.

378
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,620
But what could I do?

379
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,620
I'm not like you, Jia Xin Xin.

380
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,620
How could you be so generous?

381
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,620
Listen to me.

382
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,620
From now on,

383
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:21,620
no one can mention my mother from now on.

384
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,620
Aren't you Wan Niang's new flesh?

385
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,620
Why didn't you tell her?

386
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,620
Tell her!

387
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,620
What are you doing?

388
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,620
Don't mess with me, Madam.

389
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,620
Madam, are you all right?

390
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,620
Where's Nie Yuan?

391
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,620
It's really Nie Yuan.

392
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,620
What are you doing?

393
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,620
Why are you dressed like this?

394
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,620
You're not the same as your father.

395
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,620
I'm not.

396
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,620
But you're not going back to your previous life.

397
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,620
Isn't that too much?

398
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,620
It seems like you're going to wake up.

399
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,620
Yang Ma, take good care of Second Miss.

400
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,620
Let her wake up.

401
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,620
Madam, it's been a few days since Second Miss died.

402
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,620
Madam, it's been a few days since Second Miss died.

403
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,620
Please spare her this time.

404
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,620
Yes, Madam.

405
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,620
Madam!

406
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,620
Stop!

407
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,620
Second Miss, it's for your own good.

408
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,620
You're filial to the child.

409
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,620
Please punish me.

410
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,620
I left here for too long.

411
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,620
I forgot about it.

412
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,620
Last time, you just came here in a hurry.

413
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,620
What are you talking about?

414
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,620
I once thought that

415
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,620
we have blood ties.

416
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,620
If I listen to you,

417
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,620
I'll be able to love you sincerely.

418
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,620
But then I realized that

419
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,620
we'll always be together.

420
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,620
Although we're kind,

421
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,620
we're still close friends.

422
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,620
If something is not decided,

423
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,620
please don't force it.

424
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,620
Jiang Xue Ning, you've been right.

425
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,620
I'm a man who's walking outside.

426
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,620
You're in danger today.

427
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,620
You're making a mistake.

428
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,620
How dare you!

429
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,620
Is this how you talk to your mother?

430
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,620
Do you have such attitude?

431
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,620
Mother, calm down.

432
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,620
Your health is the most important.

433
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:33,620
I didn't expect that you're so stubborn and hard to teach.

434
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,620
Aren't you capable of being stubborn?

435
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,620
Okay.

436
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,620
You just stay here.

437
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,620
Stay here.

438
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,620
Don't worry.

439
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,620
Take care, mother.

440
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,620
Where's the police?

441
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,620
Is it the second daughter of the Wolf Clan?

442
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,620
Don't be so serious.

443
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,620
I'm telling you,

444
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,620
you're my man.

445
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,620
You can't be so serious.

446
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,620
Since you're so precious,

447
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,620
why did you take her with you yesterday?

448
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,620
You just hid her.

449
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,620
I'm taking you as my brother.

450
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,620
Who told you that?

451
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,620
But

452
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,620
the second daughter of the Wolf Clan

453
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,620
is a well-known person in the capital.

454
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,620
No one knows that she's a good person.

455
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,620
Not everyone

456
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,620
is like you.

457
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,620
You're just a good person.

458
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,620
You're all fake.

459
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,620
You're born to be a good person.

460
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,620
You're not good at playing games.

461
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,620
Why do you listen to her?

462
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,620
I know what kind of person you are.

463
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,620
You can ignore her.

464
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,620
But Jiang Xiao'er,

465
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,620
she's a girl.

466
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,620
You're just taking her with you.

467
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,620
I'm afraid that she's not good at it.

468
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,620
I'm the one who's good at it.

469
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,620
I'm the one who's good at it.

470
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:59,620
It's my habit to be with her for two months.

471
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,620
I'm just reminding you.

472
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,620
Ning'er.

473
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,620
Is my sister in there?

474
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,620
I brought her some medicine.

475
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,620
I'm going to be badly injured

476
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,620
because of my mother's injury.

477
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,620
Thank you, Miss.

478
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,620
What a coincidence.

479
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,620
The medicine that Miss gave you

480
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,620
is good.

481
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,620
I'll take it.

482
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,620
You're so ungrateful

483
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,620
in front of Miss.

484
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,620
The medicine isn't for you.

485
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,620
Back then,

486
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:41,620
I took Miss to the capital.

487
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,620
Miss trusted me.

488
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,620
I made the decision

489
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,620
in her room.

490
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,620
You...

491
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,620
It's the same.

492
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,620
I don't know

493
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,620
if I'm the one who's going to be the head of the royal family.

494
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,620
Miss, you're mistaken.

495
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,620
You're so precious.

496
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,620
I want to try the medicine on you.

497
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,620
It's not something

498
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,620
that I can use on you.

499
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,620
You're right.

500
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,620
My mother is very concerned about me.

501
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,620
Miss, you're not feeling well.

502
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,620
You're going to be badly injured.

503
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,620
Why are you so sad today?

504
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,620
In this room,

505
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,620
except for Lian'er and Tang'er,

506
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,620
two girls in the middle of the room

507
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,620
are all so stubborn.

508
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,620
The rest of them treat me like a fool.

509
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,620
I've never been sad before.

510
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,620
I'm so proud of them

511
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,620
who were so shocked by me.

512
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,620
Good.

513
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,620
Good.

514
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,620
You stole the body.

515
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,620
You're so stubborn.

516
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,620
Come here.

517
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,620
Miss.

518
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,620
Calm down.

519
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,620
Why are you so afraid of me?

520
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,620
I ate you.

521
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,620
Miss, I didn't steal it.

522
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,620
I always steal it.

523
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,620
I'm so proud of you.

524
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,620
Don't sell it to me.

525
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,620
I'm so arrogant.

526
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,620
I'm also a fool to others.

527
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,620
I'm so arrogant.

528
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,620
I'm so proud of you.

529
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,620
Miss, please forgive me.

530
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,620
Please.

531
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,620
Shut up.

532
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,620
If you keep talking,

533
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,620
I'll make you stop eating for three days.

534
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,620
And you'll have to wash the clothes

535
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,620
in the yard.

536
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,620
I'll make you suffer.

537
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,620
Yes.

538
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,620
Yes.

539
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,620
I've recovered Lian'er.

540
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,620
When did you like

541
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,620
the girl who didn't tell you?

542
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,620
I was worried

543
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,620
that she might get sick.

544
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,620
Enough.

545
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,620
I'm making a scene.

546
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,620
You saw it today.

547
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,620
I dare not to put it in your eyes.

548
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,620
I stole my stuff from others.

549
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,620
They think

550
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,620
I'm not good at my stuff.

551
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,620
I don't steal much.

552
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,620
I can't do it.

553
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,620
Miss,

554
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,620
we don't have any evidence.

555
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,620
How can you save them?

556
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:32,620
Miss.

557
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,620
Look,

558
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,620
that's Cheung's clothes.

559
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,620
What does she want like me?

560
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,620
I think

561
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,620
I'm just a little bit lazy.

562
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,620
I'm not bothered.

563
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,620
You can just call me Ju An if you're not in a hurry.

564
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,620
Is that okay?

565
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,620
What's going on?

566
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,620
What are you doing?

567
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:14,620
Miss, you know a lot about the mansion.

568
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:18,620
A lot of things are waiting for everyone to do it.

569
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,620
You suddenly called everyone over.

570
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,620
Is there anything you want to tell me?

571
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,620
There's nothing important.

572
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,620
It's just that I'm a little bit empty.

573
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:31,620
Give me back all the money you took back in the past.

574
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,620
What's going on?

575
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,620
You didn't take anything, did you?

576
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,620
Miss, you're really a real person.

577
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,620
I'm sorry for the servants.

578
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:46,620
Everyone is giving you a lot of things in this mansion.

579
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,620
You're the only one who's not in danger.

580
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,620
You're the master.

581
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,620
Who dares to touch your stuff?

582
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,620
It's okay. I've talked about it.

583
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,620
Everyone, wait.

584
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,620
I can't clean up everyone.

585
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,620
Of course, someone can clean up.

586
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,620
Master, Master.

587
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,620
What's wrong?

588
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,620
Miss Er has an accident.

589
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,620
What happened to Ning Ya Tao?

590
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,620
What's going on?

591
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:16,620
Miss Er said she wanted to clean up the servants.

592
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,620
Is that really what she said?

593
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:22,620
Why is she so excited?

594
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,620
Is she just a mad woman?

595
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,620
Let's go and take a look.

596
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,620
Master.

597
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,620
Oh, Ju An.

598
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,620
I'm afraid I'm going to take you home.

599
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,620
Look at my stuff in the mansion.

600
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,620
I need to go and handle it.

601
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,620
You...

602
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,620
It's okay.

603
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,620
Please don't bother.

604
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,620
Okay, okay.

605
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,620
Let's go.

606
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,620
I'm going to take a look.

607
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,620
It's okay.

608
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,620
I'm going to take a look.

609
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,620
Okay.

610
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,620
I'll go and look.

611
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,620
I'll go and take a look.

612
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,620
Bye.

613
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,620
Bye.

614
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,620
Okay.

615
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,620
I'll go and take a look.

616
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,620
Bye.

617
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,620
I've seen so many things.

618
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,620
It's okay.

619
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,620
I'm going to take a look.

620
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,620
I don't want to do anything.

621
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,620
Yes.

622
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,620
My mother's courage has become so small in time.

623
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,620
Look, isn't this person here?

624
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,620
What's wrong, girl?

625
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,620
I've met my father.

626
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,620
I'm incompetent.

627
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,620
I can't handle the people in the house.

628
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,620
I can only fight my father.

629
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,620
What are you talking about?

630
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,620
My father is here to help you.

631
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,620
I can handle everything.

632
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,620
That's good.

633
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,620
Please have a seat.

634
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,620
Okay.

635
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,620
I've said that

636
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,620
if you take my stuff,

637
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,620
you can find it and put it back.

638
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,620
I can save it.

639
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,620
What?

640
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,620
You're all become mute?

641
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,620
If someone is in front of me,

642
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,620
break your hands and feet.

643
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,620
Go out.

644
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,620
Master.

645
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,620
Master.

646
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,620
Master.

647
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,620
Master.

648
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,620
Girl,

649
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,620
if you take a account book

650
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,620
and compare it with me,

651
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,620
I might be convinced.

652
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,620
But you don't know

653
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,620
what you're doing.

654
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,620
Today, you said that

655
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,620
you have less stuff in your box.

656
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,620
You have more stuff.

657
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,620
You're all talking about me.

658
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,620
Yes.

659
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,620
So you mean I'm making you feel bad?

660
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,620
I dare not say that.

661
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,620
But all the servants are out of the world.

662
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,620
They have no money.

663
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,620
They're all in your hands.

664
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,620
Yes.

665
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,620
Please have a seat.

666
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,620
Please have a seat.

667
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,620
Please have a seat.

668
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,620
Girl.

669
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,620
What's going on?

670
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,620
Father,

671
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,620
they just want to take my stuff.

672
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,620
That's why they're so black and white.

673
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,620
Do you really think I'm not in my heart?

674
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,620
Tang'er,

675
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,620
take the account book.

676
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,620
Really?

677
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,620
I'll take the book and write it down.

678
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,620
The third one is the sixth one.

679
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,620
Yes.

680
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,620
What account book?

681
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,620
I don't know.

682
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,620
Do you know?

683
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,620
What account book?

684
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,620
I don't know.

685
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,620
Yes.

686
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,620
What's the account book?

687
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,620
Look.

688
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,620
When I was 18,

689
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,620
my father had a red jade pendant.

690
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,620
It was a pair of red jade.

691
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,620
It was a pair of red jade.

692
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,620
Father, look.

693
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,620
I remember it's wrong.

694
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,620
Let me see.

695
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,620
It's right.

696
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,620
And,

697
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,620
the Yan's son gave a pair of white-tailed mushrooms.

698
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,620
As a gift from the State of Yi,

699
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,620
they also have a white jade pendant

700
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,620
with a whole white jade pendant.

701
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,620
This thing is so dirty.

702
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,620
If I can't take it out and hang it up,

703
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,620
I'm afraid I'll be sent to the government office.

704
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,620
Mother.

705
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,620
You think so?

706
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,620
Yes.

707
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,620
Good.

708
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,620
The evidence is confirmed.

709
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,620
If you still don't admit it,

710
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,620
come here.

711
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,620
Master,

712
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,620
I'll search every room.

713
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,620
When I find it out,

714
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,620
I'll be the one to be punished.

715
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,620
Yes.

716
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,620
Master,

717
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,620
Master,

718
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,620
I'm telling you.

719
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,620
I'm telling you.

720
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,620
It's all my wife's fault.

721
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,620
I'm so worried.

722
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,620
Master,

723
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,620
I'm so worried.

724
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,620
Master,

725
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,620
I'm so worried.

726
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,620
Master,

727
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,620
I'm so worried.

728
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,620
I'm so worried.

729
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,620
I'm so worried.

730
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,620
I'm so worried.

731
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,620
It's a deal.

732
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,620
Don't worry.

733
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,620
Father is here today.

734
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,620
You can see each other

735
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,620
and talk to each other.

736
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,620
Let's go.

737
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,620
Let's go.

738
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,620
Let's go.

739
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,620
Let's go.

740
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,620
Let's go.

741
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,620
My girl is really grown up.

742
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,620
I can rest assured now.

743
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,620
But what happened today

744
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,620
was so hard to figure out.

745
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,620
And I still remember it clearly.

746
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,620
You're kidding me.

747
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,620
I'm not that capable.

748
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,620
I'm just a person.

749
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,620
You're so mean.

750
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,620
Even if I'm here,

751
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,620
you're all grown up.

752
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,620
You can't always be together.

753
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,620
Father,

754
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,620
how are you going to deal with those servants?

755
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,620
How do you deal with them?

756
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,620
It's common sense.

757
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,620
They are not wise and have no power.

758
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,620
They were servants in the mansion.

759
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,620
But today,

760
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,620
they are all

761
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,620
too kind and kind.

762
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,620
Since both sides are wrong,

763
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,620
I don't want to force them too much.

764
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,620
Those who are too timid

765
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,620
and too stubborn

766
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,620
will be punished

767
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,620
for two months

768
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,620
for five boards.

769
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,620
It's okay

770
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,620
if you don't mind.

771
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,620
If you don't mind,

772
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,620
I'll take it out

773
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,620
and make a deal with you

774
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,620
to sell it.

775
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,620
How do you feel?

776
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,620
Why do you look at me like that?

777
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,620
I thought

778
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,620
you would be

779
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,620
a bad person

780
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,620
for your daughter.

781
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,620
By the way,

782
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,620
those words

783
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,620
are taught by that Yan.

784
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,620
It seems that

785
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,620
there's someone

786
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,620
in the mansion.

787
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,620
Since father said so,

788
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,620
I'll do it.

789
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,620
This is...

790
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,620
Lord Jiang.

791
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,620
Ju'an.

792
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,620
Look at me.

793
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,620
I couldn't sit down

794
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,620
and came out to close the gate.

795
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,620
I didn't expect

796
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,620
Miss Ning'er to be here.

797
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,620
I'm sorry.

798
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,620
It's my fault, Ju'an.

799
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,620
I've made you wait for so long.

800
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,620
Girl,

801
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,620
go back to your room and rest.

802
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,620
Remember,

803
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,620
I'll ask your mother for your good news.

804
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,620
I'll go back to my room

805
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,620
and ask your mother about it.

806
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,620
I'll go back to my room

807
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,620
and ask your mother about it.

808
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,620
I'll go back to my room

809
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,620
and ask your mother about it.

810
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,620
Since last time,

811
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,620
it's been years.

812
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,620
I still have

813
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,620
a lot of

814
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,620
impressions of Miss Ning'er.

815
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,620
Today,

816
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,620
the jade seal has been removed.

817
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,620
That's right.

818
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,620
Miss Ning.

819
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,620
You were alone in the capital.

820
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,620
I heard about

821
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,620
the way of Ju'an.

822
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,620
So I asked her

823
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,620
to take care of your wedding.

824
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,620
Do you remember?

825
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,620
I'm Xie Wei.

826
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,620
Sorry to bother you.

827
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,620
Girl.

828
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,620
Why is the child still standing there?

829
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,620
You can't be disobeyed

830
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,620
in front of the guests.

831
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,620
It's okay.

832
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,620
I saw Miss Ning'er

833
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,620
being so grumpy.

834
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,620
I think she's tired.

835
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,620
She should go back to her room

836
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,620
and rest.

837
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,620
That's good.

838
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,620
Yes.

839
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,620
Come on.

840
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,620
Help Miss Ning

841
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,620
to rest.

842
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,620
Come on.

843
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,620
Please.

844
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,620
I'm Xie Wei.

845
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,620
I'm Xie Wei.

846
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,620
I'm Xie Wei.

847
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,620
Love is a dream.

848
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,620
Love is a dream.

849
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,620
Love is a dream.

850
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,620
Love is a dream.

851
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,620
Love is a dream.

852
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,620
Love is a dream.

853
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,620
Love is a dream.

854
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,620
Love is a dream.

855
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,620
Love is a dream.

856
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,620
Love is a dream.

857
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,620
Love is a dream.

858
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,620
Love is a dream.

859
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,620
Love is a dream.

860
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,620
Love is a dream.

861
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,620
Love is a dream.
