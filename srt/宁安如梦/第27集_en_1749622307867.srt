00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
As long as I can enter the Ning'an Palace

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,200
and pay all the price

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,600
I will be happy

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,400
The End

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,800
The End

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Everything seems to be a dream

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,600
I have owe many people

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,000
Chaozhe, help me

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,800
I will be a good person after this

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
The End

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
I will be the one to pay the price

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,800
You can't give me something

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
But they

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,200
I can help you

16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,200
if you want to live

17
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,400
Everyone has a right to escape in this world

18
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,000
But I can't

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,000
I want to regret the past

20
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,600
and do the wrong thing

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,400
and go back in time

22
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,400
Does Mr. Zhang believe that everything is decided?

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,200
I believe in the future

24
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,200
Your Highness

25
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,000
Your Highness

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,400
The End

27
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,600
Ning'an

28
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,200
What are you doing?

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,200
In the future

30
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,800
there will be a pair of invisible hands

31
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,800
to break everything back to the original position

32
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,600
The revenge is long

33
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,800
Who are you in the end?

34
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,000
The Emperor of the mortal world

35
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,800
is so long

36
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,200
and so absurd

37
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,000
Chaser of the telegraph

38
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,000
Next time, you will offend Mr. Zhang

39
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,900
The Emperor of the mortal world is here

40
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,000
Don't you want to know?

41
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,400
Yan Ling

42
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,240
мы сегодня flying on a small land

43
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,100
we are Live in that place

44
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,320
we heard that In Baoxiao

45
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,400
That is fair

46
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,840
we spouse

47
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,780
we stay together

48
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,120
we come together

49
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,360
clear the wind

50
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,120
we two are getting together

51
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,740
We come together

52
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,580
clear the wind

53
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,900
Sen't be happy.

54
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,700
Don't be sad.

55
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,080
When they bring all one thing to life

56
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,300
There is no one to stop them from living on.

57
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,580
In the future

58
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,880
All wanting will disappear

59
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,320
Give me the right way

60
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,900
To replace their troubles

61
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,180
is a possibility for other people.

62
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:52,700
But as for you,

63
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,180
how do I?

64
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:04,960
After the

65
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,820
Ginger domestic ceremony,

66
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,900
you and I have the relationship of life and death.

67
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,480
Therefore,

68
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,140
Those places like this are all different.

69
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,660
Don't fall in love.

70
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,900
Never mind,

71
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,380
I fear you don't remember your fate.

72
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,780
There is noユシ here.

73
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,500
Because you saved him many times.

74
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,500
Don't be neg Odin.

75
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,540
If you do not forget your euphemism,

76
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,300
don't forget nothing.

77
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,520
Divine will fight on its own,

78
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,480
no matter at all.

79
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,620
Miyamoto Fientice쥜

80
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,540
send my doctor to help me perform the medical function,

81
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,680
He didn't tell,

82
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:11,920
Wei法十佁,

83
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,160
she serum is not suitable.

84
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,560
I'm not afraid of the future.

85
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,560
But I've been walking for a while.

86
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,560
There's no one who doesn't want to live on the road.

87
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,560
I've been living with fate for 20 years.

88
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,560
Even a person like me

89
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,560
doesn't have a reason to compromise on fate.

90
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,560
Why do you have to say this to me?

91
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,560
You're my student.

92
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,560
I don't want to see you having a hard time.

93
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,760
You've been living with fate for 20 years.

94
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,360
Although you've stopped living in the palace,

95
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,960
your love is already out of the question.

96
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,960
You can't give up here.

97
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,760
From tomorrow on, continue to learn from me.

98
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,760
Sir...

99
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,960
I've told your father about this.

100
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,760
There's no place for discussion.

101
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,960
Moreover, I can also tell you about the matter in Huangzhou.

102
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,960
Congratulations!

103
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,720
Congratulations to Miss tortoise!

104
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,260
Waiting for you.

105
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,260
Enjoy your meal.

106
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,960
Sausages for linger boxed Ev hotel.

107
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,400
It's hard to say the repair to thousands of heroes.

108
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,200
I will be the one to take the lead in the battle.

109
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,200
Enough, enough.

110
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,800
Old man, why are you in the battle again?

111
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,000
Old man, you're a bad guy.

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You're not going anywhere.

113
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Everyone, everyone.

114
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I've heard you.

115
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,200
You're so mischievous.

116
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,000
Speaking of the new thing,

117
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,600
I've heard about it.

118
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,200
This is not a good thing.

119
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,200
It's the current queen's wedding ceremony.

120
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,200
But this is one of them.

121
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,800
There are some things that are not right.

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,400
I'm afraid...

123
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,600
What are you afraid of?

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,400
I'm afraid of hearing about the wedding.

125
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,200
Which lady's thing?

126
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
Tell me.

127
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,200
Thank you, young master.

128
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,800
I'll be honest with you.

129
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,000
I'll be honest with you.

130
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
I'm telling you.

131
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,000
The day before that,

132
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,600
the official of the Communist Party of Jiao Mian Nhi was elected by Tongzhou.

133
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,600
I don't know.

134
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:54,800
One of them was hidden by a woman from the imperial palace.

135
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,800
She was 19 years old.

136
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,000
She was in the temple.

137
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,200
She was in the prison that night because of the old love.

138
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,400
She was in the temple because of the old love.

139
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,800
This is a golden title.

140
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,400
Listen to the news.

141
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,800
The next is the wedding ceremony.

142
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,600
Father, you're free to talk.

143
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm going to Xie Shao Shi's mansion to learn the piano.

144
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,000
Kneel down.

145
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What happened?

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,800
Today, I went to the minister's house with your mother.

147
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,800
The other party invited some opera singers to the party.

148
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,800
The old Tai Jun from the minister's mansion is a lively person.

149
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,800
He ordered a new play.

150
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,200
Who called you?

151
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,200
What's wrong?

152
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You still have the face to ask?

153
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,200
You were in the trouble of Tongzhou.

154
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,600
You were sent out when you were on the move with a group of men.

155
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,200
You were thrown into the face of the whole Jiang family.

156
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
You're in trouble again.

157
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,000
Father, which family did you just say the concert hall is?

158
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
Uncle Li Bu Shang.

159
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,400
What's wrong?

160
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,400
In Tongzhou, there are only Master Zhang,

161
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Xie Shao Shi and Master Xue.

162
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,600
Someone must have made such a rumor at this time.

163
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,800
I guess it's just what the Xue family did.

164
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,400
Good.

165
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,400
Even if the Xue family did it,

166
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,000
ask yourself.

167
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,800
If you were not a romantic person,

168
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,600
why did you do such a ridiculous thing?

169
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,200
Mother, you mean,

170
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,000
the other party made a mistake in my favor?

171
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,200
If you didn't dare to act like a woman,

172
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,200
how could you be so impulsive?

173
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,600
If you didn't do it at Yan family and Guan Li's,

174
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,600
and you were offended by the Xue family,

175
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,200
how could the state government's government

176
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,000
have a daughter like you?

177
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Shouldn't you be aware of these things?

178
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,200
Mother, you're so angry.

179
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,400
I'm afraid it's not for me.

180
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,600
But the reputation of the Jiang family and the marriage of Sister Zhang

181
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,000
are all my fault.

182
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,200
You...

183
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,400
Madam.

184
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,200
Madam, it's impossible.

185
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,000
Mother, don't worry.

186
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm the one who created it.

187
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,000
I'll solve it myself.

188
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,200
I won't be burdened by the Jiang family and Sister Zhang.

189
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,200
You...

190
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,000
How could we have a daughter

191
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,000
who is so ungrateful?

192
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,800
Well, Madam.

193
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,200
I know you're in pain.

194
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,400
But you know how Ning Yatuo's temperament is.

195
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,000
Why did you say such a thing to stimulate her?

196
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Besides,

197
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,400
I'm afraid the accident this time

198
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,800
is not because of Ning Yatuo's temperament.

199
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,000
Master, what are you talking about?

200
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,600
This time, Li Bu chose Princess Linzi.

201
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,400
And she's also in the temperament.

202
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,200
The temperament?

203
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Madam, I heard that

204
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,400
Madam was angry with Second Miss.

205
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,000
Master gave her a ban.

206
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,400
He didn't let her go out.

207
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,400
Father said he wanted to ban her for a few days.

208
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Why are you so worried about her?

209
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,200
I was about to get married and have a look at her.

210
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
This time, Second Miss's rumors

211
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,800
have spread all over the capital.

212
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,200
She will surely get her back.

213
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,600
She doesn't care about her own worries

214
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,200
about Prince Lingzi.

215
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,800
Nonsense.

216
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,800
The Jiang family is just a matter of one mind.

217
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,200
I can't get angry with her.

218
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,800
How could I be angry with her?

219
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,800
Madam, I was wrong.

220
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,400
Where are you going?

221
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,600
I'm afraid it's because of me.

222
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,600
The Xue family wants me to leave.

223
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,000
It's all my fault for being so hard on you.

224
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,200
I have to make it clear to Mother.

225
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,400
Madam, you can't.

226
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
If you say so,

227
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,200
Madam will know that you and Prince Lingzi...

228
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,200
You're so thoughtful.

229
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,000
With Madam's temperament,

230
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
she will let Master withdraw your decision.

231
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,800
Madam,

232
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,000
someone is sending you a letter from the door.

233
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,100
Your Majesty.

234
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Give it here.

235
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,600
If I don't do as you say,

236
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,800
but I could take as many people as I can,

237
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,600
they would keep coming and going.

238
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Please release all the police criminals,

239
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,800
confirming and Elementary Division.

240
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,200
I know I'll be defined as cop.

241
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,000
Director,

242
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,000
the case is signed to staff那么입니다.

243
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,200
What happened?

244
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,200
I've been looking for a chance

245
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,960
to talk to Miss Jiang alone.

246
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,920
What are you talking about?

247
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,400
Is there a good show in the capital?

248
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,400
You're a smart girl.

249
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,400
It's important to be a woman.

250
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,240
Miss Xue, do you know?

251
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,440
How so?

252
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,880
Besides Xue Ning,

253
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,320
she doesn't need to be left alone.

254
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,720
Since someone doesn't know the high ground,

255
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,800
I can teach you a lesson.

256
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,320
How should I know the man is leaving?

257
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,760
Miss Xue,

258
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,520
you're the Empress Dowager's

259
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,280
empress dowager's princess Lin Zi.

260
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,520
Why do you still have to make such a low profile?

261
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,680
Aren't you afraid that

262
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,400
someone will know you're a high ground?

263
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,760
High ground?

264
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,600
Jiang Xuehui,

265
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,560
with my family,

266
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,480
who dares to ask me a question?

267
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,080
Since the position of the princess is already

268
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,360
your responsibility,

269
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,880
why do you still do this?

270
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,560
I can control the empress dowager's mind,

271
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,960
but I can't control

272
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,480
the Prince of Lin Zi's mind.

273
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,760
Miss Jiang, you probably don't know, right?

274
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,400
Prince of Lin Zi has already

275
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,560
said it in front of the empress dowager.

276
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,440
I thought a position of concubine

277
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,680
could make you a princess.

278
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,120
But I know

279
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,000
with the character of Prince of Lin Zi,

280
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,560
I will surely

281
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,880
make you a concubine.

282
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,440
Since I,

283
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,760
Xue Jia,

284
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,640
and my aunt

285
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,440
have taken the throne,

286
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,040
I will never let this happen.

287
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,400
So you asked me to come

288
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,840
to awesome away your concubine?

289
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,720
Yes.

290
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,400
If you cool

291
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,720
the inequality of state,

292
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,560
or the reputation of Jiang Xuening,

293
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,000
we could preserve it.

294
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:05,920
Miss Xue,

295
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,480
in therico's heart,

296
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,120
it's not the Prince of Lin Zi's

297
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,920
position,

298
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,320
or that position?

299
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,240
Is this important?

300
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,240
Find someone to send to the Palace of the Blood to give to Zheng Bao

301
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,120
and let him transfer to Prince Lingzi.

302
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,640
Miss,

303
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,120
is it useful to find Prince Lingzi to help?

304
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,440
Xue Jiaquan is doing this at this time.

305
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,440
The purpose of destroying the Jiang family is very obvious.

306
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,360
He just doesn't want Jiang Xue to participate.

307
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,880
His personality

308
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,480
is more important than the reputation of the Jiang family.

309
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,480
Now that this has happened,

310
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,760
he will give up on the throne for the Jiang family.

311
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,440
So this matter

312
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,360
can only be solved by Prince Lingzi.

313
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,680
Miss,

314
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,400
are you trying to help Miss?

315
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,200
Not help her.

316
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,960
I'm doing this for my own peace.

317
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,760
It's her fault.

318
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,360
I should give it back to her.

319
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,600
Moreover,

320
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
someone used this kind of

321
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,640
low-ranking means

322
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,960
to bully my family.

323
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,520
I'm not good at your personality.

324
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,520
Zhen'er.

325
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,800
You're back.

326
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,360
Mom.

327
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,280
Today,

328
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,280
many people from the Jiang family

329
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,080
sent so many things.

330
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,040
I...

331
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,120
I don't dare to touch them at all.

332
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,240
Don't worry.

333
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,240
I'll put them here.

334
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,640
I'll handle them myself.

335
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,800
I think you're

336
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,040
making a good decision.

337
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,440
Zhen'er,

338
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,080
if you want to be a family member,

339
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,680
don't worry about me.

340
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,720
I've given you

341
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,960
a lot of gifts these years.

342
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,200
I won't let my daughter-in-law

343
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,720
suffer any grievance.

344
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,000
Mom.

345
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,040
Tell me the truth.

346
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,000
You don't like the family's marriage.

347
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,680
Do you have other girls in your heart?

348
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,360
Bring her here

349
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,840
and let her see it.

350
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,520
I believe

351
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,280
the girl I like

352
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,240
will be the best girl in the world.

353
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,480
I need you better Bu Yanqing.

354
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,280
Miss materials go to this drama.

355
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,960
I chose to jump out of it.

356
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,080
I don't want to go back to the city.

357
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,080
I came today

358
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,080
because someone else wanted to see you.

359
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,080
After seeing you,

360
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,080
I can make you change your mind.

361
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,080
I can make you change your mind.

362
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,080
Xie Shaoshi designed to let mother Zhang investigate the matter of Dinggu Palace

363
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,080
and report it to His Majesty.

364
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,080
Shaoshi was a little impulsive.

365
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,080
I didn't know that.

366
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,080
Until now,

367
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,080
what do you still think I should do?

368
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,080
I'm not sure what you're doing.

369
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,080
But I came today

370
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,080
for your sake.

371
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,080
It's none of my business.

372
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,080
Everyone told you to sign the defense mausoleum

373
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,080
as we work toward it.

374
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,080
There is a rumor that

375
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:34,080
there are enforcement staff.

376
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,080
However,

377
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,080
all's well because they Pascal swear

378
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,080
the hacer there.

379
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,080
And this matter is about the imperial daughter of the court.

380
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,080
Lord Zhang went to investigate and was clearly speaking.

381
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,080
This matter is none of your business.

382
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,080
But the two of you have been in the same boat since you were in the State of Tongzhou.

383
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,080
This journey is really meaningful.

384
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,080
Lord Zhang, are you really going to stand by?

385
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,080
No problem.

386
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,080
No problem.

387
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:24,080
He won't to let you be by Father's side.

388
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,080
What happened?

389
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,080
He bullied me.

390
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,080
Really? It was a good talk.

391
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,680
Your Highness, Her Highness and Noble Consort are resting.

392
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,080
I am sorry, Your Highness.

393
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,960
I'm sorry to offend you.

394
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,800
I should be punished.

395
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,040
But please punish me.

396
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,240
You may leave.

397
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,440
Yes.

398
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,720
You are the prince.

399
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,720
You are in the imperial study.

400
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,760
What are you doing?

401
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,720
I'm a doctor.

402
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,440
I'm always under the spell.

403
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,800
I can't protect my friends.

404
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,880
I can't beg for freedom.

405
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,120
Now I'm even forced to be punished.

406
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,120
I don't want to be the prince.

407
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,520
Prince Ling.

408
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,920
What are you doing?

409
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,040
You're the brother of His Majesty's favorite.

410
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,200
What's the matter?

411
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,360
Please tell me.

412
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,120
Huang Xiao.

413
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,440
I have no other choice.

414
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,760
Mother and Xuejia

415
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,240
are going to force me to marry Xue Shuo.

416
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,400
But I have someone in my heart.

417
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,680
I've already decided.

418
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,560
If I can't marry her,

419
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,600
I'd rather die.

420
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,840
I only want you to be the prince.

421
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,600
You're crazy.

422
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,480
What nonsense are you talking about?

423
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,400
Brother.

424
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,960
I'm so sincere.

425
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,040
I've told mother many times.

426
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,120
I don't have any feelings for Xue Shuo.

427
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,840
But mother still wants to choose Xue Shuo as the princess.

428
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,320
Now only brother

429
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,920
can be the prince for me.

430
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,240
Please forgive me.

431
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,000
Please fulfill my wish.

432
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,000
Your Majesty.

433
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,640
Your Highness.

434
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,840
Please don't say anything.

435
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,760
Guards.

436
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,680
Guards.

437
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,360
Please get the prince out of here.

438
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,000
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

439
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,320
Huang Xiao.

440
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,040
Please.

441
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,520
Huang Xiao.

442
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:56,840
Huang Xiao.

443
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,440
Your Highness.

444
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,680
Please don't say anything.

445
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,160
Huang Xiao.

446
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,240
If you don't agree,

447
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,680
I'll kneel in the palace.

448
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,000
I'll wait for your approval.

449
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:03,800
Huang Xiao.

450
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,400
Your Majesty.

451
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,840
Prince Ling is gentle and gentle.

452
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,840
He's never been like this.

453
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,760
He's just a kind-hearted person.

454
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,520
Don't be mad at him.

455
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,200
What I'm worried about

456
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,000
is not about this.

457
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,240
It's about the mother's intention.

458
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,320
She's wasted so much time.

459
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,480
She must let Shen Jie

460
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,640
marry Xue Shini.

461
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,040
Don't you understand?

462
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm afraid the Wei family's position

463
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,360
is too big.

464
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,600
Both of you

465
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,120
cannot do it.

466
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,840
My mom usually

467
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,400
abandoned me

468
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,880
and you.

469
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,040
We never get down on our own.

470
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,460
Let's go.

471
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,400
I think...

472
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,260
that's too much.

473
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,860
Master.

474
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,740
Okay, go ahead.

475
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,460
Father.

476
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,100
He's here.

477
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,060
Go and have a look at this.

478
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,640
Ro droling splatter?

479
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,920
Fel muerte and practical!

480
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,340
But once it miked his Patreon�� reason why did heinations.

481
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,400
2 package�니다

482
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,040
Yan family Luo Ba

483
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,480
Xue is very forceful

484
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,460
He has something inside on Xue's age

485
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,380
Our Xiang Family

486
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,720
not only the destruction

487
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,880
But also the reprimands

488
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,480
Hence theability of rank

489
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,820
Available at us

490
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,440
To violent

491
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,080
They're just trying to bring us into action

492
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,720
They want to send your brother

493
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,720
Father, you know everything.

494
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,720
I'm not blind or blind.

495
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,720
I know some things very well.

496
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,720
The Xue family has long been the position of the Princess Consort.

497
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,720
It's a position of the Nang State.

498
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,720
Although the Princess Consort's trouble and the Imperial Library

499
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,720
were suppressed by the Empress Dowager and the emperor,

500
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,720
how many secrets can this court hide?

501
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,720
The court fights and fights,

502
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,720
they are all in the same boat.

503
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,720
Even the Yan family is lost.

504
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,720
How can I help you?

505
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,720
Why don't we leave the place of the Princess Consort?

506
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,720
Father, you can't.

507
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,720
Tongzhou is a busy country.

508
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,720
The Xue family is in trouble.

509
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,720
That's my fault.

510
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,720
How can father have a reason to leave the capital?

511
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,720
Don't talk nonsense.

512
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,720
If you admit it,

513
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,720
how will you deal with it?

514
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,720
I won't.

515
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,720
That's even more nonsense.

516
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,720
You are a daughter.

517
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,720
How can you not get married?

518
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,720
Father and the Xue family have been in the court for many years.

519
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,720
Don't you know the tricks of the Xue family?

520
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,720
The Jiang family and the Xue family have already been married.

521
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,720
Once the Xue family has the power to take over,

522
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,720
we will be in the same boat.

523
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,720
The Xue family will not let us go.

524
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,720
What you said is not clear to me.

525
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,720
I don't know.

526
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,720
But the Xue family has the Empress Dowager's protection.

527
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,720
They have the power to take over.

528
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,720
It's easy to fight with them.

529
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,720
Your daughter,

530
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,720
I only have Huoyan and you two daughters.

531
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,720
As long as you can be safe and sound,

532
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,720
I will do whatever it takes to be the head of the Shang family.

533
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,720
What are you doing?

534
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,720
In the world of life,

535
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,720
I used to think that I was the most difficult one.

536
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,720
But now I am so determined.

537
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,720
Other than myself,

538
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,720
I seem to have thoroughly investigated other people's difficulties.

539
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,720
Father is in the court and he is more like a soldier.

540
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,720
Your crying is something I should have understood earlier.

541
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,720
I was too kind and reckless to cause so much trouble to my family.

542
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,720
Hurry and get up.

543
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
I was wrong.

544
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,720
I should have come to fight with myself.

545
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,720
I shouldn't have sacrificed my father.

546
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,720
Alright.

547
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,720
Why are you still so red-handed?

548
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,720
I don't have a hard heart to say that.

549
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,720
Alright.

550
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,720
I will think about these things carefully.

551
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,720
You should go back and rest.

552
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,720
I will take my leave first.

553
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,720
Father should rest earlier.

554
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,720
Alright.

555
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,720
I am not feeling well these days.

556
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,720
If there is nothing important,

557
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
I will put the memorial on the wall first.

558
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,720
I will take care of it after I see it.

559
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,720
Father.

560
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,720
Father.

561
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,720
Father.

562
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,720
Father.

563
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,720
Father.

564
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,720
Father.

565
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,720
Father.

566
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,720
Father.

567
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,720
Let's go back.

568
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,720
Father.

569
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,720
Your Majesty,

570
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,720
What are you doing for me?

571
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,380
When did your inteَّable

572
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,720
輸 removed the memorial?

573
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,720
You should...

574
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,720
sencillase and stay in the state business for three years.

575
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,360
This case happened three years ago.

576
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,520
You're the one who's responsible for it.

577
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,080
You're now in charge of the rescue.

578
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,120
You're still responsible for pushing me into this.

579
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,720
What are you doing?

580
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,200
If the Duke of the Palace is not guilty,

581
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,280
what's the use of this rescue case?

582
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,920
Nonsense!

583
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,720
Your Majesty, I'm wronged.

584
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,320
Please make the decision for me.

585
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,920
Jiang Qing, do you know who you're having dinner with today?

586
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,920
If it's Wu Gang, don't say it's you alone.

587
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,320
It's your family's fault.

588
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:45,320
Your Majesty, I know.

589
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,720
Fine. Since that's the case, what evidence do you have?

590
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,520
Your Majesty, I've found the witness of this case.

591
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,920
And he's in the Ministry of Justice now.

592
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,720
Your Majesty, please allow me to make a decision.

593
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,520
Your Majesty, the capital is now in a state of chaos.

594
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,720
The Jiang clan is in a state of chaos.

595
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,120
It's not clear.

596
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,920
So, I think

597
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,920
he's just trying to calm down the situation of his family.

598
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:14,320
He's just trying to get rid of the situation and call for the accused.

599
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,320
If Your Majesty doesn't punish him,

600
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,720
then the Ministry of Justice will force him to do so.

601
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,520
It will cause the court to be in a state of chaos.

602
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,920
Please punish him.

603
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,120
Your Majesty, the Jiang clan is in a state of chaos.

604
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,320
They're trying to break the law.

605
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,920
They're guilty.

606
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,320
I'll take my leave.

607
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,120
Your Majesty, I have a plan to go.

608
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,120
Zhang Zhe, your plan is in the future.

609
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,320
Your Majesty, I'm going to report

610
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,920
the matter related to the Jiang clan's case with the State of Ding.

611
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,720
Lord Zhou, you're really...

612
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,520
You're really...

613
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,920
Zhang Zhe, the matter related to the incident you mentioned

614
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,120
can be solved?

615
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,520
Your Majesty, I'm sure

616
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,520
that it's true.

617
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,520
It's true?

618
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,320
I'm going to report the matter to the State of Ding.

619
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,320
Your Majesty, I and Young Master Xie

620
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,320
have been in a state of chaos.

621
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,320
During this time, the daughter of the Jiang clan

622
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,720
was not allowed to enter this matter.

623
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,120
She was forced to enter the matter.

624
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,720
This matter is a matter of one-sided.

625
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,520
But the daughter of the State of Ding is using her power to use her power.

626
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,720
She's going to create a misunderstanding with this matter.

627
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,320
The situation in the capital is very serious.

628
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,720
The reason is that she's the daughter of the Jiang clan.

629
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,320
I've visited the capital for several days.

630
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,120
I'm in a state of chaos.

631
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,520
Tell me, who told you this?

632
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,720
The letter was written by the lady.

633
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,720
The lady asked me to send it to them.

634
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,320
It doesn't concern my family.

635
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,320
Who else is involved?

636
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:16,920
Speak.

637
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,120
The lady asked Xie Wuwei to go to the house to avoid using their family.

638
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,320
I'm just being crazy.

639
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,520
It really doesn't concern my family.

640
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,520
Please make a decision.

641
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,520
Your Majesty, please be quiet.

642
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,920
This matter is due to the female sister of the girl.

643
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:39,320
I once made a agreement with the person who was involved in the case of Tongzhou.

644
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,920
I can't mention it to anyone else.

645
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,120
The lady of the Jiang clan is a great figure.

646
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,320
She's a member of the State of Wei.

647
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,920
She's a former member of the Tongzhou.

648
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,520
She's not a member of the State of Wei.

649
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,920
She's a loyal person.

650
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,320
She's not allowed to be disloyal.

651
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,720
You shouldn't be disloyal.

652
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:59,520
Duke Ding, what else do you have to say?

653
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,120
Your Majesty, I'm not sure about this.

654
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,120
There must be some things that I don't know.

655
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:04,720
Please, Your Majesty...

656
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,920
The letter was written clearly.

657
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,320
It's all about Xie Wuwei.

658
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,920
You're still making a mistake.

659
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:15,120
Duke, the lady is a member of the family.

660
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,320
She's a member of the state.

661
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,720
She should be the one to decide.

662
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,320
Lady Xue, if you really have the talent to be a member of the family,

663
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,120
you can choose.

664
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,320
Why is the State of Wei so hard?

665
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:31,720
Your Majesty, what the State of Wei said is not about loving your daughter.

666
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,520
Please, Your Majesty, calm down.

667
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,720
A loving daughter?

668
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,320
I think the State of Wei is taking the State of Wei as his personal matter.

669
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,520
He's taking Xie Wuwei as his concubine.

670
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,520
Your Majesty, I have no intention of doing this.

671
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,120
Please...

672
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,120
What do you mean?

673
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,920
Just investigate.

674
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:55,320
My dear officers, I've ordered you to go to Xie Wuwei's house

675
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,720
and investigate the case three years ago.

676
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,720
Also, the military camp of Tongzhou is in a state of disarray.

677
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,520
We'll investigate it in time.

678
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:08,120
I want to see how deep the water is in Xie Wuwei's house.

679
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

680
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,520
This is a very dangerous place.

681
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,720
It's too dangerous.

682
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,720
You're a fool!

683
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,120
How dare you hide from me for doing such a thing?

684
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,920
You even caught me!

685
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,720
Please, Your Majesty, this is not related to me.

686
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,920
Your Majesty, it's not related to you.

687
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,120
You're the one who made me submit the case.

688
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,720
I don't know your means.

689
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,120
I've told you three times.

690
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,520
Before the election, you can't make any mistakes.

691
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,520
What is the Jiang Xue Hui?

692
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,520
Do you know your identity?

693
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,320
I taught you this!

694
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,120
I'm angry, I'm also worried about Your Highness.

695
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,320
I'm afraid that she might be too worried.

696
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,320
She might be in trouble at the election.

697
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,520
Please, let me see the situation of the Xue family

698
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,920
and give her another chance.

699
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,720
Situation?

700
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,320
I brought you here to educate you.

701
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,120
For the sake of the Xue family.

702
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,320
How about you?

703
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,320
You've done such a stupid thing for the past three times.

704
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,320
Last time, I told you that you were in a state of disarray.

705
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,920
You must be careful and not leave any traces.

706
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,320
This time, you actually let Zhang Zhe

707
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,720
expose your evil behavior.

708
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,320
You've put your father and your family in such a state of disarray.

709
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,120
How can I leave you with your anger?

710
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:34,720
Aunt, aunt, Shuang'er is not a meanie.

711
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,320
Get out!

712
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,120
Aunt!

713
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,320
Aunt, Shuang'er is not a meanie.

714
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:45,320
Aunt, aunt, Shuang'er is not a meanie.

715
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,320
Aunt, aunt!

716
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:55,720
Your Highness, you can't escape from other people's mistakes and can't go through it yourself.

717
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,120
You must be careful.

718
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,720
Did I really look the wrong way?

719
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,920
Master!

720
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,320
You bastard!

721
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,920
You let the Xue family into such a awkward state of calm.

722
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,720
Look at your good daughter!

723
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,720
Master, why don't we beg Her Highness the Empress Dowager?

724
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,120
She always loves Shu'er. There must be another way.

725
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,320
If you don't have any idea,

726
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,520
then it's better to say it, but now, it's all because of others.

727
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,120
You've lost my face!

728
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,120
I lost my face?

729
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,320
I did all this for the sake of the Xue family?

730
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,520
General, your father did this for his own daughter.

731
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,320
He didn't even listen to the rumors.

732
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,720
But where is your father?

733
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,120
You let your daughter lose her position as the princess.

734
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,720
You let her take the revenge for the Xue family.

735
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,520
Did you say anything wrong with my daughter?

736
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,720
She sent Jiang Xue Ning to Tongzhou and disobeyed the Party of Nidang.

737
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,120
She was the one who caused the destruction of Ming City. It's not me!

738
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,920
You bastard!

739
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,120
How dare you talk back to me?

740
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,920
You disobeyed the Party of Nidang?

741
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,520
You still have your last words.

742
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,320
Then, you're all in the hands of His Majesty!

743
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,120
Do you think that those unloyal means

744
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,520
can be used to deal with His Majesty's reputation?

745
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,720
Father!

746
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,120
Something big happened!

747
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,920
What is it?

748
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,120
Xie Wei and Zhang Zhe took the army to the new Wei Ya Sect.

749
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,920
What?

750
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,720
I'm telling you, from now on, you must leave the Xue family and take a step back.

751
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,920
You must be careful!

752
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,720
Shu Er.

753
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,720
Let me see.

754
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,920
Xie Wei and Zhang Zhe.

755
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,720
What's going on?

756
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,320
It's the decree of the Emperor.

757
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,520
His Majesty is in the court today.

758
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,520
He just got the decree.

759
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,920
Did the State of the Palace forget about it so quickly?

760
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,720
The decree is fine.

761
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,520
But what do you mean by taking so many soldiers?

762
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,320
What did you mean by that?

763
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,520
I've already told you.

764
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,720
I'm not going to let you go.

765
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,920
I'm not going to let you go.

766
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,280
You're not leaving.

767
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:34,920
You're saying

768
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,420
that I will leave the new Weiimao tastes village to vindicate the Kafka臩 stone

769
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:59,780
and wake theches when I draw the

770
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:03,820
Little sister, the needle can fill it and he can't have that Yang Zhen-jie tailtle while I'm here.

771
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,340
The chwad of Yang Zhen-jie can do even this.

772
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:09,020
Who ever has the sense to be形 syc 구�ç 파绑?

773
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:12,200
That old man is a bits and piece.

774
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,600
What kind of drug have we sacrificed for him?

775
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,280
Is it his heat?

776
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,960
Are all of you salt выглядит wrong?

777
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,760
Do you think you can just leave?

778
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,160
Alright, Madam.

779
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,160
I'm telling you, this is not to make you scold me.

780
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:40,160
I just want you to know that this rumor is indeed done by Miss Xue.

781
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,160
This marriage is due to Prince Ling's selection.

782
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,960
She is not the one who is against you this time.

783
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,960
But...

784
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,960
Madam.

785
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,160
Miss is here. She said she was here to apologize.

786
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,960
It's me.

787
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,960
I have a personal affair with Prince Ling.

788
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,960
I caused the Xue clan to be in a mess.

789
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,960
That's why I caused the rumor.

790
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,960
Madam, don't!

791
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,960
How did I teach you from a young age?

792
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,960
Why are you so stupid?

793
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,960
You did such a dirty and useless thing!

794
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,960
You...

795
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,960
I'm here to apologize!

796
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,960
Madam, you should ask her nicely.

797
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,960
Don't hit her.

798
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,960
Mother, I'm in love with you.

799
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,960
I didn't do anything wrong. Please believe me.

800
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,960
Yes, yes.

801
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,960
Madam, you raised your own child so well.

802
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,960
Don't you know the character of a girl?

803
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,960
Alright.

804
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,960
You are now going to admit it.

805
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,960
I won't punish you.

806
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,960
But you must promise me to withdraw from the selection.

807
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,960
Prince Ling will never see Prince Ling again.

808
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,960
So that he can get rid of those concubines.

809
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:04,960
How...

810
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,960
Ups,

811
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,960
Hui Er,

812
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,960
you are by mother's side all the time.

813
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,960
I so accusable and obedient may never care about you.

814
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,960
I will also listen to mother this time.

815
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,960
Mother did everything for your own good.

816
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,960
I won't harm you.

817
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,960
You know that Lingzi went to the night-dying room.

818
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,960
She is doing this for you, to make the Empress Dowager's reputation.

819
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,960
You should understand her feelings.

820
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,960
I know her feelings all the time.

821
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,960
I also believe in them all the time.

822
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,960
Then what are you afraid of?

823
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,960
You should understand that it's not a way to avoid evil.

824
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,960
This is not a moment of consciousness, but a life of your own.

825
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,960
Then do you think I should stick to it?

826
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,960
It's not me who think so.

827
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,960
Cheng Xue Hui, you have been depressed for more than ten years.

828
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,960
It's time to ask your heart what you want.

829
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,960
It's outside the world.

830
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,960
If you haven't tried, how can you know it's not possible?

831
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,960
As long as you are willing to participate,

832
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,960
willing to take this step,

833
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,960
I will take the path that is left behind.

834
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,960
Okay?

835
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,960
Please forgive me for not smiling.

836
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,960
I have listened to you since I was a child.

837
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,960
But this time, I want to follow my heart.

838
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,960
This time, what are you saying?

839
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,960
Say it again!

840
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,960
Madam, Madam.

841
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,960
Please take it.

842
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,960
Madam.

843
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,960
Mother!

844
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,960
Take the family and come!

845
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,960
No, no, no!

846
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,960
I know that what you have done is all for the peace of the Jiang family.

847
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,960
But you should also know that the Xue family is all great.

848
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,960
It can't be helped.

849
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,960
When people have something,

850
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,960
they are not afraid of the peace that is being brought back.

851
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,960
It's more than a mere 70% of the people.

852
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,960
Madam,

853
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,960
the name of the Xue family has been set.

854
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,960
No one can change it.

855
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,960
Okay!

856
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,960
Okay.

857
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,960
Old, old, small, small.

858
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,960
Each one is in a big mood.

859
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,960
Aren't you afraid of death?

860
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,960
You are all from the Jiang family, right?

861
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:44,960
I am the only outsider.

862
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,960
Madam, what are you talking about?

863
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,960
No matter what you want, I don't care.

864
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,960
Mother!

865
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,960
Mother!

866
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,960
Don't call me mother!

867
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,960
I have a big daughter.

868
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,960
I am not as impolite as you are!

869
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,960
Madam!

870
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,960
Miss, you are the one who beat Madam.

871
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,960
She has been punishing herself.

872
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,960
She has been kneeling in the hall.

873
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,960
But she didn't agree to give up on you.

874
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,960
I didn't expect that

875
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,960
you would be so persistent.

876
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,960
Maybe it's the real her.

877
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,960
That's good.

878
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,960
At least she finally understands what she wants.

879
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,960
I heard that

880
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,960
Madam is angry with Old Master this time.

881
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,960
She didn't let him enter the room.

882
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,960
It's no wonder that Madam is so surprised this time.

883
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:40,960
But I heard that

884
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,960
thanks to Master Zhang and Young Master Xie,

885
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,960
she could be safe and sound.

886
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,960
I am sorry.

887
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,960
I am sorry.

888
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,960
I am sorry.

889
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,960
I am sorry.

890
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,960
I am sorry.

891
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,960
I am sorry.

892
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,960
I am sorry.

893
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,960
I am sorry.

894
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,960
I am sorry.

895
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,960
I am sorry.

896
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,960
I am sorry.

897
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,960
I am sorry.

898
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,960
I am sorry.

899
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,960
I am sorry.

900
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,960
I am sorry.

901
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,960
I am sorry.

902
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,960
I am sorry.

903
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,960
I am sorry.

904
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,960
I am sorry.

905
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,960
I am sorry.

906
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,960
I am sorry.

907
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,960
I am sorry.

908
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,960
I am sorry.

909
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,960
I am sorry.

910
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,960
I am sorry.

911
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,960
I am sorry.

912
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,960
I am sorry.

913
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,960
I am sorry.

914
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,960
I am sorry.

915
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,960
I am sorry.

916
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,960
I am sorry.

917
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,960
I am sorry.

918
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,960
I am sorry.

919
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,960
I am sorry.

920
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,960
I am sorry.
