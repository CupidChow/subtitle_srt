[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,590
As long as I can take over Ning'an Palace,

3
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,210
I'm willing to pay any price.

4
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:24,530
Cleanse the court of traitors and sycophants.

5
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,560
The cinnabar imperial brush determines one's life and death.

6
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:35,760
Everything

7
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:37,860
is like a dream.

8
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,500
I once was indebted to a lot of people.

9
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,900
Zhang Zhe, help me.

10
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,020
I'll be a good person after this.

11
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,490
I'll marry the one I spoiled.

12
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,080
There are things

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,880
you can't give me.

14
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,280
But he can.

15
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,150
To keep my life,

16
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,050
only you, Sir, can help me.

17
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,350
Everyone in the world is entitled to escape.

18
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,390
But I'm the only one who can't.

19
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,420
I want to do my best to make up for

20
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,950
my past regrets and wrongdoings.

21
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:39,060
Mr. Zhang, do you believe in predestination from the previous life?

22
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,509
I'd rather believe in what's in front of me.

23
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,310
Welcome, Your Highness.

24
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,050
Welcome, Your Highness.

25
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,530
Congratulations on returning to the capital of our homeland.

26
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,979
Ning'er, what are you afraid of?

27
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,430
But in the unfathomable,

28
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,220
there's always an invisible hand

29
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,759
that puts everything back to its original place.

30
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,530
You've taken revenge and paid your debts.

31
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,640
At the end of the day, who are you?

32
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,820
A bustling place, or a battleground.

33
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,410
A life of absurdity, a story of mistakes and regrets.

34
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,740
[Story of Kunning Palace]

35
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,600
[Episode 24]

36
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,640
Miss Jiang.

37
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:46,890
Can I come in?

38
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:47,550
Come in.

39
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,190
As expected of someone who came from a prestigious family from the capital.

40
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,140
By dressing up,

41
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,610
you look different.

42
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,250
Don't be glib-tongued.

43
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,170
I don't buy it.

44
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,620
If you have to put it that way,

45
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,000
I'll be sad.

46
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,350
Your outfit

47
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,660
was carefully selected by me

48
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,510
from a lot of materials.

49
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:14,890
What do you think?

50
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,040
Is my taste

51
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,760
better than Xiao Bao's?

52
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,120
But tell me,

53
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:21,260
why did Feng

54
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,810
store so many women items

55
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,280
in the temple?

56
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,420
Is he hiding a woman?

57
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:30,800
All right.

58
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:31,940
Tonight,

59
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,780
I've prepared a lot of good wine.

60
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,810
Let's get drunk.

61
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,380
You are going too?

62
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,410
It took me so much effort to prepare this for you.

63
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,610
Can't I ask for a meal?

64
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:41,780
All right.

65
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,140
I admit I have my own intentions.

66
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,460
Junior Preceptor Xie is planning to

67
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,220
bring me back to the capital.

68
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,810
I'm planning to have more friends and build my connections

69
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,610
since the capital is so complex.

70
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,160
Much less you.

71
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,450
You are Junior Preceptor Xie's favorite

72
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,250
wo...

73
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,430
female student?

74
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,420
Mr. Zhang has made a great contribution.

75
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,080
He'll definitely get promoted when he returns.

76
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,650
Although

77
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,870
I don't have other skills,

78
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,470
I know how to take advantage of things.

79
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:12,170
So,

80
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,150
please, Miss Jiang,

81
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,240
take me with you this time.

82
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,899
Both Yan and Xue families are noble families.

83
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,100
I wonder how they gave birth to

84
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,170
someone like you.

85
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,040
Miss Jiang!

86
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,700
Itâ€™s cold outside! Put this on!

87
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,960
I just found it for you!

88
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:31,970
Miss Jiang.

89
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:32,670
Wait.

90
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,980
There's a treasure.

91
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,200
Wait for me.

92
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,170
It's snowing.

93
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:56,810
Miss Jiang!

94
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:57,880
Smell this!

95
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,159
Century-old wine.

96
00:04:59,180 --> 00:04:59,840
Miss Jiang.

97
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,660
This will definitely be strong.

98
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,340
Oh right.

99
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,780
Junior Preceptor Xie.

100
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,040
Junior Preceptor Xie?

101
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,130
Do you want to go to

102
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,030
Miss Jiang's birthday party?

103
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,510
No need.

104
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,990
I have work to do.

105
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,080
Work?

106
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,670
You can do that any time.

107
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,940
But Miss Jiang's birthday

108
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,160
is only once a year.

109
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,630
Sir is not feeling well.

110
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,780
He'll catch a cold if he goes out in snow.

111
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,880
He should rest.

112
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,800
Don't.

113
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,090
Exactly.

114
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,430
Enjoy yourselves.

115
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:35,840
Miss Jiang.

116
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:41,659
Mr. Zhang!

117
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,560
In that case,

118
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,760
we'll go first.

119
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:54,460
Go ahead.

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,980
Jian Shu, close the door.

121
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:02,700
Yes.

122
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,860
It's such a light snow and you're holding up an umbrella?

123
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,010
How romantic, Mr. Zhang.

124
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:08,540
Let's go.

125
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,270
Hurry up.

126
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:26,810
What do you think?

127
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,070
Isn't this a good idea?

128
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,100
Sitting around a stove in the winter.

129
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:29,630
How warm.

130
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,700
This makes it more fun to eat.

131
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,170
Right?

132
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,409
As the saying goes,

133
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:35,470
"You meet people everywhere you go."

134
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:37,720
Come.

135
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,870
The three of us

136
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,690
got together because of this.

137
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,409
We're brothers who have been through life and death situations.

138
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:47,860
When we return to the capital,

139
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,930
I hope you two

140
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,070
can take care of me.

141
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,630
I'll thank you here.

142
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,880
Are you going back to the capital?

143
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,450
My surname is Xue.

144
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,159
Even if I used to serve the rebels,

145
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,260
it was just a show.

146
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,680
At the end,

147
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,940
we still have to be loyal to His Majesty.

148
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,340
Right?

149
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,260
But the people who died in Tongzhou

150
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,150
all know you.

151
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,700
How will you

152
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,390
explain yourself in Jinling?

153
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,850
I

154
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,580
am a viscount after all.

155
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,580
I should be enjoying a luxurious life in Duke's Mansion.

156
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,580
But I've been living an inhuman life

157
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,990
in Jinling these years.

158
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,310
On the surface, they respect me.

159
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,860
But what they actually respect

160
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,880
is just the name.

161
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,420
They're all fake.

162
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,600
It's time for me

163
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,740
to take back the things that belongs to me when we return to capital this time.

164
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,840
-Dingâ€“
-All right.

165
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,590
Let's stop talking about me.

166
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,500
Miss Jiang is the star today.

167
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,800
Speaking of which,

168
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,950
I always

169
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,450
carry women things

170
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,110
with me.

171
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,070
Now, I can use it

172
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,090
as your birthday gift.

173
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:52,940
Mr. Zhang.

174
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,909
Is your gift

175
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,560
that shabby umbrella?

176
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,470
When the time comes,

177
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,960
to be at ease.

178
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,320
All happiness,

179
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,080
should always be

180
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,250
by peace.

181
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,360
I knew about it late.

182
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,660
I didn't have time to prepare.

183
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,220
So I drew a portrait for you

184
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,020
and write a congratulatory letter to you.

185
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,820
My apologies.

186
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,390
No.

187
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,120
I like it very much.

188
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,020
A gentleman practices six arts.

189
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,640
You are indeed talented.

190
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,360
You are a gentleman.

191
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,820
Iâ€™m flattered.

192
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,620
I just think

193
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,100
though it has been a dangerous journey,

194
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,980
it's far away from the complexities and rules of

195
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,970
the capital.

196
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,150
It's also a rare memory.

197
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,330
All right.

198
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,540
It's cold.

199
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,870
Have something hot and warm yourself up.

200
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:16,680
Here.

201
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:17,710
Try this.

202
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:18,690
Thank you.

203
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,690
Is something bothering you, Mr. Zhang?

204
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:27,850
Nothing.

205
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,940
It just occurred to me

206
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,260
I promised my mother

207
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,720
before I left capital that

208
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,620
I'll go back before New Year.

209
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,340
She doesn't feeling well every winter.

210
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,670
I wonder how she is doing

211
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,790
without me at home.

212
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:41,980
I couldn't tell that

213
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,360
you're a filial son.

214
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,970
You looks cold,

215
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,500
but you're actually a hot-blooded man.

216
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,420
Very good.

217
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,260
I like people who are loyal and loyal the most,

218
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,700
Here, Mr. Zhang.

219
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,380
Here's to you.

220
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,170
I read in a book

221
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,180
there is a custom in Tongzhou to drive away the Nian beast.

222
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,380
Every new year,

223
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,260
the whole city set off fireworks

224
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,860
to pray for good weather,

225
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,390
no natural disasters, and no diseases for the next year.

226
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,610
This is the real gift.

227
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,480
The city is full of fireworks.

228
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,770
Wishing Miss Jiang all the best

229
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,730
and may everything go smoothly.

230
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,370
I dare not ask for anything else.

231
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,330
I just hope everyone I care about

232
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,530
can be safe.

233
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,110
Miss Jiang, are you thinking of Viscount Yan?

234
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,860
Yan family's case

235
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,760
is something that His Majesty is worried about.

236
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,700
As long as we can get rid of it,

237
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,930
the Yan family will surely have a chance to reverse the case.

238
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,240
Do you believe in

239
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,830
predestination from the previous life?

240
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,890
One shouldn't talk too much about superstition.

241
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,500
Compared to the illusionary words of previous lives,

242
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,900
I'd rather believe in what's in front of me.

243
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,570
I thought

244
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,130
people are highly capable

245
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,370
and are able to change their fate.

246
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,700
But now I feel

247
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,920
people are actually very insignificant.

248
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,450
There are some things that I still can't shake

249
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,350
even if they happen again.

250
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,160
You can't say that.

251
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,910
Take me for example.

252
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,200
I used to...

253
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,260
I used to be...

254
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,810
the son of the Duke.

255
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,250
In the end,

256
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,220
I had a rough life.

257
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,640
I'm always in danger and don't know if I can live till night every day.

258
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,420
But now,

259
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,190
things have changed for me too.

260
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,880
We're going to enjoy wealth and glory soon.

261
00:11:58,850 --> 00:11:59,590
So,

262
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,920
please have a seat.

263
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,200
Good wine and good food.

264
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,570
Let's get drunk today since we have wine today.

265
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,700
Whatever fate it is,

266
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,060
whatever tomorrow will be,

267
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:12,790
let's drink.

268
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,270
You are right.

269
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,900
Though there are times where things go beyond the capabilities of humans,

270
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,300
as long as we try our best,

271
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,220
there may be a chance to change.

272
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,120
Here. Cheers.

273
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,500
Eat.

274
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,600
How is it going with Yan Liu's

275
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,650
road reconstruction?

276
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,710
Didn't he say he has to take a few days?

277
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,860
I just told you this afternoon.

278
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,030
He wanted to get you drunk,

279
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,430
but he fell down himself.

280
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,780
I didn't know you can hold your liquor.

281
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,100
This wine is quite strong.

282
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:13,880
Let's go for a walk

283
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,370
and sleep after we've sobered up a little.

284
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,330
Otherwise, when we wake up tomorrow,

285
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,090
we will definitely get a headache.

286
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:18,580
Sure.

287
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,970
Are you okay?

288
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,340
The road is slippery on a snowy day.

289
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,340
Watch your step.

290
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,690
Does Xue Dingfei have nothing better to do?

291
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,900
All he knows is to eat and drink.

292
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,900
Where is Xue Yuan?

293
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:06,990
What is he doing?

294
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,370
Didn't you send Dao Qin to keep an eye on him?

295
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,900
The Duke is said to be taking care of Xue Ye.

296
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,980
There's nothing unusual about Xingwu Guards.

297
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,350
Sir,

298
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,560
are you feeling...

299
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,440
I'll go concoct the medicine for you.

300
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,080
I'm fine.

301
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,140
Open up the door. Maybe it's because it's a little warm.

302
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,420
But you haven't recovered yet.

303
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,950
-The snowâ€“
-Just do as I say.

304
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:24,870
Yes.

305
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,980
Close the door!

306
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:44,820
Yes!

307
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,640
Why are you smiling about?

308
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,100
I suddenly remembered

309
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,430
the first time I met you,

310
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,860
was at Tai'an Hall.

311
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,030
You're not afraid of danger.

312
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,180
You are indeed different from ordinary women.

313
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,570
If it were someone else with me

314
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,630
on this journey to Tongzhou,

315
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,900
I'm afraid they would have given themselves away a long time ago.

316
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,010
Same goes for you.

317
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,310
I thought I was doomed that day.

318
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,850
All I know was that I was wronged,

319
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,580
but I don't know how to solve it.

320
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,890
Fortunately, you were on duty

321
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:21,890
and saved my life.

322
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,220
It seems that our multiple meetings

323
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,440
were all for cases.

324
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,430
This is also a type of fate.

325
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:28,840
You look like

326
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,990
a lady who's just 18 or 19 years old.

327
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,400
Yet, you're fearless.

328
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,740
You have an idea of everything in your mind.

329
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,740
It seems like you've been through a lot.

330
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,340
I came from the Jiang family.

331
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,980
But I grew up with Wan Niang in the countryside.

332
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,990
I used to be fearless.

333
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,110
It was after Wan Niang passed away,

334
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,870
that I returned to the capital.

335
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,660
Maybe the heavens pitied me

336
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,280
and gave me the chance to rectify

337
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,570
what I did wrong

338
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,970
and make up for what I did.

339
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,880
Others can make mistakes,

340
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,970
but I can't.

341
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,360
The more I know,

342
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,380
the further those peaceful days

343
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,650
are from me.

344
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:07,970
So

345
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,980
you want to help Viscount Yan with all you can?

346
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,420
Viscount Yan must be

347
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,640
a very important friend

348
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,570
after you returned to the capital.

349
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,900
The court will be in turmoil

350
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,630
after we return to the capital.

351
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,090
And that Mr. Dingfei

352
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,940
appeared in such a strange situation.

353
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,470
I wonder what he will cause.

354
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,070
The Xue family

355
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,940
is not worthy of the throne.

356
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,640
They enjoy wealth and glory

357
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,210
yet kept abolishing the government for personal reasons.

358
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,930
Although Xue Dingfei is odd,

359
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:35,970
I think

360
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,190
he has to be a hundred times better than Xue Ye.

361
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,120
You think

362
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,970
Xue Dingfei can be trusted?

363
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,430
Iâ€™m not sure.

364
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,210
But if Junior Preceptor Xie thinks that he is useful,

365
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,410
then he must be right.

366
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,630
Is it beautiful?

367
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,690
It suits you well.

368
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,940
I don't like wearing flowers.

369
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,260
But isn't there a tradition in the court

370
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,970
where the scholar wears a flower hairpin?

371
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,540
You had bad luck.

372
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,900
You are full of talents but didn't pass the exam.

373
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,099
If you can do it again,

374
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:21,960
you will definitely be the young man crowned with flowers in the court.

375
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,660
How about

376
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,240
I give you this flower?

377
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,280
Take it as you passed the imperial exam.

378
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,260
â™«The snow is very lightâ™«

379
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:41,270
â™«It doesn't stop even after filling all the cracks in the eavesâ™«

380
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:47,630
â™«You left in a hurry, leaving traces in the snowâ™«

381
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,630
â™«They're about to be erased nowâ™«

382
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,870
â™«Disrupting my expectationsâ™«

383
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,520
But someone as upright as you are,

384
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,270
I'm sure you wouldn't care about

385
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,770
the vanity of passing the imperial exam.

386
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:07,760
I'm not

387
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:09,310
ambitious.

388
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,900
Distinguishing the truth,

389
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,030
serving my family,

390
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,450
getting married,

391
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,630
and watching the rain quietly,

392
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,560
is all I want.

393
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,100
That's all?

394
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,440
Don't you have any other ambitions?

395
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:23,820
I do.

396
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,270
I have one now.

397
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,100
All happiness,

398
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,750
should always be

399
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:31,950
by peace.

400
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,180
In the case of Zhou Yinzhi accomplice case,

401
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,610
the main official in-charge Zhang Zhe broke the law for his personal gains.

402
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,660
It's all thanks to Zhou Yinzhiâ€™s righteousness.

403
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,800
After he was released, he reviewed his subordinates personally

404
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,080
and found a lot of solid evidence

405
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,090
of bribery.

406
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,430
And these people

407
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,030
are the innocent sentenced by Zhang Zhe.

408
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,700
Everyone knows Zhang Zhe's good at solving cases.

409
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,560
How could there be such a mistake?

410
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,430
He did it on purpose.

411
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:13,270
Zhang Zhe.

412
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,750
What happened?

413
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,800
I've failed Your Majesty.

414
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,660
Your Majesty,

415
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,010
all of this

416
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,970
is all my fault.

417
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,920
It has nothing to do with others.

418
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,520
When I asked you to let go of Zhou Yinzhi,

419
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,430
I didnâ€™t expect to hurt you like this.

420
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,920
I know you hate me.

421
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,720
You have been upright

422
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,650
and have a good reputation.

423
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:55,220
Even the judge dared not write to convict you easily.

424
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,200
But why do you sentence yourself?

425
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,610
I'm the one who should be convicted.

426
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,740
Three days ago,

427
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,260
the prison officer told me

428
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,860
that my mother had passed on.

429
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,720
You may not know.

430
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,220
In the past, to allow me to study,

431
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,820
she helped others do laundry

432
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,470
and became weak to the cold.

433
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,050
She didn't believe that I'd do such a thing.

434
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,840
So in the blizzard,

435
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:28,630
she ran to knock at the government office's door to say that I was wronged.

436
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:32,060
But it was during the curfew and no one dared to open the door.

437
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,170
She kept knocking

438
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,190
for three days and nights.

439
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,060
She fainted countless times.

440
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:44,070
But no one opened the government office's door.

441
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,630
No one took care of her at home

442
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,470
and she died at home like that.

443
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,810
The body was there for seven days

444
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:54,640
before she was found.

445
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,220
I was wrong.

446
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:02,570
I'm sorry.

447
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,530
You don't have to forgive me.

448
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,940
I just want you to live.

449
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,010
Zhang Zhe,

450
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,160
I don't allow you to die.

451
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,720
No need.

452
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,110
Your Highness, please leave.

453
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,990
I developed feelings for you that I shouldn't have.

454
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,090
It's unethical.

455
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,330
As an official of the Ministry of Justice,

456
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,790
I concealed the evidence.

457
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,300
I'm disloyal.

458
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,810
Mother gave birth to me and raised me.

459
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,170
But I killed her

460
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,700
and couldn't even send her off.

461
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,610
I'm unfilial.

462
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,630
Someone like this

463
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,720
is hated even by myself.

464
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,260
Why should I live?

465
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,760
No.

466
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,180
You're a good person.

467
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,970
You are the best person

468
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,210
I've ever seen.

469
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,260
In that case, Your Majesty,

470
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,090
I beg you.

471
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:18,630
Just go.

472
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,200
Miss Jiang, whatâ€™s wrong?

473
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,530
Are you feeling unwell?

474
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,720
Maybe I drank too much.

475
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,850
Sorry.

476
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,160
I'll return first.

477
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,090
Miss Jiang!

478
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:56,710
[Mansion of Earl You]

479
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,880
Donâ€™t think I know nothing.

480
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,540
Are you pretending to be sick?

481
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,680
Okay, don't worry.

482
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,230
Even if you die here from pain,

483
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,030
you must get on the bridal sedan.

484
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,190
Get up!

485
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:12,650
Miss.

486
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:13,540
Please bear with it.

487
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,260
Her Ladyship said

488
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,380
she can't get hurt before the wedding.

489
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,780
She's obviously acting.

490
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,520
Madam has sent someone to get a physician.

491
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,780
If she dares to pretend to be sick,

492
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,080
Madam won't spare her.

493
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:23,500
Yue'er.

494
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:28,330
Mother, she's just acting.

495
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,460
Please ask the physician to check on her.

496
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,790
She was fine last night.

497
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,560
What's wrong with her?

498
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:36,690
Yes, Madam.

499
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:08,790
Madam.

500
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,210
She's pregnant.

501
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,290
What?

502
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:17,920
You little wench!

503
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,640
You dirty woman!

504
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,060
Madam, someone is looking for you in the front hall.

505
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,650
Mother-in-law,

506
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,220
it's all my fault.

507
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,320
Please fulfil me and Fangyin,

508
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,800
don't separate us.

509
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,930
How dare you two!

510
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,220
How dare you get her pregnant before marriage?

511
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,690
Do you not take the Mansion of Earl You seriously?

512
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:41,130
I'm going to take you to the government now

513
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:43,050
and convict you for seducing and kidnapping.

514
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,410
Guards!

515
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,080
Mother-in-law, calm down.

516
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,450
I came here

517
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,200
with sincerity.

518
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,590
What do you mean?

519
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:52,910
Please take a look.

520
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,660
This 3,000 taels.

521
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:57,820
Let alone an illegitimate daughter,

522
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,520
I should be able to marry even Earl You's legitimate daughter,

523
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,410
right?

524
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,410
Everyone in the capital knows

525
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,340
the Mansion of Earl You is nothing as compared to what it used to be.

526
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,020
Otherwise, you wouldn't have to

527
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,550
sell your daughter, right?

528
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:07,790
I get a lady

529
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,950
and you solve your urgent matter.

530
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:11,790
We benefit each other.

531
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,370
How dare a dirty businessman

532
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:14,850
bargain with me?

533
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,910
This is real cash.

534
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,340
How can you call me dirty?

535
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,930
Marriage

536
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,830
is no different from business.

537
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,810
It's just that both parties look at the conditions.

538
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:24,740
If it's suitable, then they collaborate.

539
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,740
If not,

540
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,160
you can wait for You family's Third Young Lady

541
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,690
to be married to that old man

542
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,630
and he might even have an offspring.

543
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,090
How dare you threaten me?

544
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,320
Guards!

545
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,900
So you've already found out about everything,

546
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,960
waiting for me to get into your trap?

547
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,420
You're exaggerating, Madam.

548
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,760
From now on, we are family.

549
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,860
What trap?

550
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:54,330
These are the debts that Father-in-law have out there.

551
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,170
I have paid them off for him.

552
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:57,780
You

553
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,050
are the matron of a family.

554
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:01,210
Are we going to make it ugly

555
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,340
or cooperate with me?

556
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,470
You should be able to

557
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,150
calculate this.

558
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:18,490
Mr. Lyu.

559
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,070
Come in.

560
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,370
Didn't you ask me to pretend to have a stomachache?

561
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,700
Then why did the physician say...

562
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,370
I-I-I asked the doctor to say that.

563
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,850
And I told Madam You

564
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,710
that your baby is mine.

565
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,750
I asked Madam You for permission to marry you.

566
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,250
She agreed to marry you off to me.

567
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:44,830
But...

568
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,660
Let me explain.

569
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,460
I'm not asking you to marry me for real.

570
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,390
I'm just using this to help you out.

571
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:55,330
This may be a bad trick,

572
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,380
but it's the fastest and most thorough way

573
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,110
for you to get out of You family.

574
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,540
Then...

575
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:04,450
Then you should have told me earlier.

576
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,300
That's right.

577
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,670
But it was too hasty that day.

578
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:10,100
I didn't have time to explain it to you.

579
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,510
And you are upright.

580
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,730
I'm afraid you'll hesitate and cause delays.

581
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:15,590
That's why I...

582
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,840
It's all my fault.

583
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,500
M-miss You.

584
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:26,780
Even if you blame me,

585
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,830
even if Jiang family's Second Young Lady

586
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,230
didn't ask me to help you,

587
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,490
I would still want to help you.

588
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,440
During this period,

589
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,300
I saw you going in and out of the Guild hall,

590
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,330
making friends with merchants

591
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,330
and making deals.

592
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,130
You even dare to go in and out a prison.

593
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,980
You've already done so many things that

594
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,180
a noble family's daughter would never.

595
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:45,930
Although

596
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,220
there is the excuse that this is for Miss Jiang.

597
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,470
But what about your own feelings?

598
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,790
You may look timid and weak,

599
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,420
but I can feel that

600
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,080
there's a force in your heart.

601
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,000
You may not know yourself,

602
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,090
but your eyes are shining

603
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,070
when you talk business.

604
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,580
I think your world

605
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,600
shouldn't just be confined to a house.

606
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,580
You shouldn't only be serving your husband and teaching your kids for your whole life.

607
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,370
If you want,

608
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,520
I'll take you away.

609
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,370
From now on, you can do anything

610
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,600
you want in the world.

611
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,460
You can do business if you want.

612
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,920
You can travel if you want.

613
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,270
Anyway, everything

614
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:25,400
is up to you.

615
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:35,060
What am I to

616
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,310
have you treat me like this?

617
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,140
You...

618
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,670
Don't cry.

619
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:42,820
If you do this,

620
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,100
people outside would really...

621
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,100
really think I...

622
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,740
I did something to you.

623
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:47,960
Anyway,

624
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,850
let's escape from You family first.

625
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,140
We can make do with it for now.

626
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,860
If you want to be

627
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,140
completely free in the future,

628
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,690
then we can get a divorce.

629
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:02,130
I've written the divorce agreement for you.

630
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,200
You can feel at ease

631
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,720
if you have it on your hand.

632
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,620
Let me ask you.

633
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:35,220
Am I the most handsome person in the world?

634
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,490
It's late at night.

635
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,410
Why is the Duke here?

636
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,380
It's Junior Preceptor Xie.

637
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,170
It's nothing.

638
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,690
I just thought

639
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,160
I killed all the rebels this time.

640
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,090
Yet we didn't get any information

641
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,120
from them.

642
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,270
It's a pity.

643
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:11,220
I heard that Junior Preceptor Xie

644
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,980
planted a spy among the rebels.

645
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,390
He seems to be called

646
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,780
Dingfei?

647
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,180
I was careless.

648
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,720
I forgot to inform you about this.

649
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,390
But it's not really a spy

650
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:26,060
as the gossip goes.

651
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,290
Everyone calls him Mr. Dingfei.

652
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,660
It reminds me of

653
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,500
the secret letter with Lord Pingnan.

654
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,180
It mentioned Viscount Dingfei like

655
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:40,090
he's still alive in this world.

656
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:46,180
There are many people with the same name in the world.

657
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,280
Iâ€™m afraid itâ€™s just a coincidence.

658
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,570
But why do I think,

659
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,430
though this Mr. Dingfei

660
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,150
looks like a loser,

661
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,880
he looks quite similar

662
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:59,060
to you?

663
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,220
Similar?

664
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:08,360
I think you must've

665
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,500
seen it wrong.

666
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,160
Isn't this... good news?

667
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:14,990
Why are you...

668
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,920
I just

669
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,080
can't really believe it.

670
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:22,830
If this is true,

671
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,990
then congratulations, Duke.

672
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,980
Viscount Dingfei survived the chaos.

673
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,380
You now have a successor.

674
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:30,490
The Xue family

675
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,510
is blessed with a next generation.

676
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:33,080
Duke,

677
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,850
aren't you going to meet this Mr. Dingfei?

678
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,190
Do you feel a little distanced

679
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,900
because it's been 20 years?

680
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,700
It's dark and windy. Forgive me Duke,

681
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,050
but I caught a cold recently.

682
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,460
I canâ€™t stay here for long.

683
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,860
I'm going back to my room.

684
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,820
Sir, Yan's troops have fixed the mountain road.

685
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:17,790
Great!

686
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,500
We can finally return to the capital.

687
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,250
But Sir,

688
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,460
are you really going to take Mr. Dingfei back to the capital?

689
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,010
What if the court doesn't trust him...

690
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:26,890
Don't worry.

691
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,300
I have my own plan.

692
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,280
You stay in Tongzhou

693
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,890
and keep an eye on Jinling.

694
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,200
If anything happens,

695
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:35,510
write to me immediately.

696
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,590
How is it going?

697
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:49,600
Duke,

698
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,670
I have deployed a reliable team

699
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,930
to be led by Sergeant Li

700
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,020
to act as rebels

701
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,920
to set off first.

702
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,660
They set up an ambush in the forest ten miles away.

703
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,720
They're just waiting for your order.

704
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:00,390
Yes.

705
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,970
Then I'll leave this to you.

706
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:08,060
Yan Liu,

707
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,530
thank you in advance.

708
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,640
Youâ€™re welcome.

709
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:12,070
I will take it to heart.

710
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,030
Mr. Zhang,

711
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:24,080
let's ride the same carriage later.

712
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:25,730
Think about it.

713
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,050
We came together and are returning together.

714
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:27,840
It's good

715
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,660
to end on the starting note.

716
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,180
Duke, it seems that your son has recovered well.

717
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,850
Thank you for your concern.

718
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,640
Ye'er's leg injury

719
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,570
is fine now.

720
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:55,340
By the way,

721
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,490
I have asked General Yan Liu to escort him.

722
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,300
Everyone

723
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:03,390
be fully prepared.

724
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:04,280
Understand?

725
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,070
Yes.

726
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,620
Is it not enough for my Xingwu Guards to escort?

727
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,780
What are you worried about?

728
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:13,600
Why do you react like that?

729
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,860
Of course it's to fend off the rebels.

730
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,980
Although the rebels in Tongzhou have been eliminated,

731
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,520
we canâ€™t be sure that no one escaped.

732
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,909
I did this

733
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:24,940
to fend off the rebels who are ambushing on the way back.

734
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,150
Itâ€™ll be safer.

735
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,420
Otherwise, what do you think

736
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,239
I'm guarding against?

737
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:31,320
Besides,

738
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:33,409
Viscount Dingfei

739
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:36,260
returning to the capital is a big thing.

740
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,300
Iâ€™m doing this for the safety of Viscount Dingfei.

741
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,340
What Viscount?

742
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,850
What do you mean?

743
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:46,409
Haven't Duke told you yet?

744
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:49,440
After a few days of inquiry,

745
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:51,310
this Mr. Dingfei in the temple

746
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:53,060
is Viscount Dingfei.

747
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,219
Nonsense!

748
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,010
Xue Dingfei is dead.

749
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,490
Who knows where this bastard came from?

750
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,810
Who are you calling a bastard?

751
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,390
Who are you calling a bastard?

752
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:03,990
Listen,

753
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,070
do you believe I'll tear your mouth apart

754
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:06,810
and break your legs?

755
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:07,540
Try me if you dare!

756
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,180
Come on!

757
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,060
-We will know if it's real or not when we return.
-You think I don't dare?

758
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,570
Why get angry here?

759
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:13,630
Oh right.

760
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:16,910
Iâ€™ve written a letter about finding Viscount Dingfei

761
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,670
and sent it to capital with a pigeon.

762
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:21,020
His Majesty was very pleased when he found out.

763
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,400
He said he must meet the Viscount himself.

764
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,200
Junior Preceptor Xie.

765
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,570
This is my own family business.

766
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,700
It's none of you, an outsider's business.

767
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,530
Do you not want His Majesty to know

768
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,220
or you don't want to acknowledge this son?

769
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,560
Junior Preceptor Xie.

770
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:39,970
How dare you.

771
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:43,790
Things concerning Viscount Dingfei

772
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,780
is both your family and the state's business.

773
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,570
He is the only survivor

774
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:49,140
among 300 loyal souls back then.

775
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,190
You should know

776
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,820
what's important about him.

777
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,210
As long as Iâ€™m alive,

778
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,620
I wonâ€™t allow anything to happen to him.

779
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,130
Only in this way

780
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:01,300
can I give His Majesty an explanation.

781
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,520
You're so thoughtful.

782
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,470
That was mindless of me.

783
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,020
All right.

784
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,740
Since everyone is ready,

785
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,120
let's set off back to the capital.

786
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:27,460
Let's go.

787
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,300
The plan is cancelled.

788
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:33,720
Yes.

789
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,040
Letâ€™s go, Mr. Zhang.

790
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,530
[is Viscount Dingfei. Junior Preceptor Xie will be returning to the capital with him to meet His Highness.]

791
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,170
Is it really Xue Dingfei?

792
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,810
Are you sure?

793
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:17,060
Official Xie sent a message back to the capital.

794
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,660
Chen Ying handed this report in personally.

795
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,920
It should be credible.

796
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,390
After they return to the capital,

797
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:24,050
I will ask them again.

798
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,360
Back then, he stood out

799
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:27,950
in order to save me.

800
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:30,220
He's a loyal official of the State of Qian.

801
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,950
I didn't expect him to survive.

802
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,470
And was found by Official Xie by accident.

803
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,250
He also made great contributions to pacifying the rebellion.

804
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,850
I should reward him greatly.

805
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:40,070
That's what Your Majesty thinks?

806
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,130
Your Majesty was still young.

807
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:56,050
But Your Majesty should be old enough to remember things.

808
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,020
Have Your Majesty really forgotten

809
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:02,250
why Xue Dingfei was willing to die?

810
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:05,330
My son is the emperor.

811
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,360
He is a subject.

812
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,020
It's natural for a subject to die

813
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,040
for the emperor.

814
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,220
There's a difference between the dignified and inferior,

815
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,650
and the inequality between the noble and not.

816
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:14,220
Mother.

817
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,550
Don't be afraid.

818
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,460
I'm willing to go on behalf of the His Highness.

819
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:18,990
I

820
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:20,620
will go in his place.

821
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:28,150
[To be of Noble Character and High Prestige]

822
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,480
It's all in the past.

823
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,260
He was still young.

824
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:28,900
Besides,

825
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,180
even if there is any misunderstanding,

826
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,420
he still agreed to go.

827
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:33,930
I still

828
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:36,300
owe him.

829
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,030
Your Majesty is being foolish.

830
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:40,530
Xue Dingfei has been in exile for years.

831
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,690
He might have survived with the help

832
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,280
of Lord Pingnan.

833
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:46,930
Would he still be

834
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:50,590
the ignorant kid from 20 years ago?

835
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:54,380
Even if what happened that day has passed,

836
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,910
given Yan Min's death

837
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:57,700
and the exile of the Yan family,

838
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,300
what does Your Majesty think

839
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:00,570
he would think?

840
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,520
But he is the only survivor

841
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,010
among the 300 Loyal Souls.

842
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,800
The officials and the people saw it.

843
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:10,470
I must give this matter its recognition.

844
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:19,620
Nobel Consort Qin is getting heavier now.

845
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,830
I promised to visit her.

846
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:25,200
I understand what Mother means.

847
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:28,420
As for what to do with Xue Dingfei,

848
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,640
we'd better ask Junior Preceptor Xie

849
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,900
after they come back.

850
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,720
Just ask what you want to.

851
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,450
I just find it strange.

852
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:55,140
Xue Dingfei is Xue Yuanâ€™s son.

853
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:56,990
Even if it's been 20 years,

854
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,470
this shouldn't be Xue Yuan's reaction.

855
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,640
Do you really think he is Xue Dingfei?

856
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,850
Isn't he?

857
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:08,470
If I say he is,

858
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,040
then he is.

859
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,450
Just wait and see.

860
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,510
The show has just begun.

861
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,540
You

862
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,470
don't seem to have that happiness of

863
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:27,800
reuniting with the Duke after a long time.

864
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,880
When we parted,

865
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,150
I was about this tall.

866
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,220
I was only six or seven years old.

867
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,330
After so many years,

868
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,460
I can barely remember him.

869
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,150
Besides,

870
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,700
with a stepmother,

871
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,700
and a stepfather,

872
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,990
who can count on him?

873
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:43,440
Do you remember the rebellion of Lord Pingnan?

874
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,640
Please forgive me.

875
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,900
I've been wandering since I was a kid.

876
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,230
When I think about this,

877
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,580
I get a headache.

878
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,110
Let's not talk about it.

879
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:58,040
Let's not talk about it, all right?

880
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,220
Your Majesty.

881
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,920
Junior Preceptor Xie is back.

882
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

883
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:35,550
Get up.

884
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,590
Thank you, Your Majesty.

885
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,500
The ministers have won the battle

886
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,980
and destroyed the base of the rebels,

887
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,440
eliminating the rebels.

888
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:46,700
In one battle, you broke off the rebeillious Lord Pingnan's

889
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,320
ambition for a rebellion.

890
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:50,540
You have done an incredible dead for the country.

891
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,910
I feel relieved.

892
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,050
We're flattered, Your Majesty.

893
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,980
As subjects who enjoy the prosperity of the country,

894
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,380
this is what we should do.

895
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:58,690
However,

896
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,820
if it weren't for Viscount Dingfei,

897
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,350
this rebellion at Tongzhou

898
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:04,250
wouldn't have gone so smoothly.

899
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,420
I am Xue Dingfei.

900
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:13,700
I have been away from the capital for 20 years.

901
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,750
I'm sorry towards Your Majesty

902
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:15,940
and towards the State of Qian.

903
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:18,000
Even death can't get me forgiveness.

904
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,080
I-it's really Xue Dingfei?

905
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,260
He's still alive?

906
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:23,480
Why are you

907
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:25,260
calling yourself a sinner?

908
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,250
Official Xie, what happened?

909
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,240
Is he...

910
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:31,430
really Xue Dingfei?

911
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,300
A few months ago,

912
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,190
I was saved by Mr. Dingfei by chance.

913
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:39,560
At that time, Mr. Dingfei went by a fake name.

914
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:43,050
The two of us got close

915
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,740
and I thought I just became friends with an upright man.

916
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,740
But I didn't expect Mr. Dingfei to be

917
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,480
part of the battle in Tongzhou.

918
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,880
If he hadn't informed us,

919
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,370
we wouldn't have found

920
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:56,130
Shangqing Temple's location in time.

921
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:58,860
All the more we couldn't have destroyed the rebels' plans

922
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,520
of rebelling with gunpowder.

923
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,820
I thought it was strange at first.

924
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,620
Later, after some questioning,

925
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:05,810
Mr. Dingfei

926
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:08,970
is Viscount Xue from Duke's family.

927
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,720
Your Majesty is wise.

928
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,060
All these years,

929
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,790
though I have been living among the rebels,

930
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:15,300
I have always been loyal to the court.

931
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,270
I've always wanted to find a chance

932
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:18,570
to serve His Majesty.

933
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,450
Now that I've redeemed myself,

934
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:22,310
I finally have the face to see you.

935
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:26,690
Junior Preceptor Xie confirmed that he is the Viscount

936
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,000
just by his words.

937
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,160
Isn't this too rash?

938
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:33,360
I have risked my life multiple times

939
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,960
yet I never gave up this name.

940
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,540
It's because I hope that one day

941
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,680
I can return again.

942
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:38,840
Your Majesty,

943
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:41,470
others may not believe it,

944
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:42,520
but I

945
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:44,370
grew up with Your Majesty

946
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:46,260
and studied martial arts with you.

947
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,390
Don't you remember?

948
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,770
When I was young,

949
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:52,710
Your Majesty liked the layered walnut cake my mom made the most.

950
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:53,440
I remember

951
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:55,350
all these.

952
00:43:58,750 --> 00:43:59,720
That did happen

953
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:03,200
when I was young.

954
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:07,130
Dingfei is around my age.

955
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,950
We did grow up together.

956
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,590
I think

957
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:15,020
blood is thicker than water.

958
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,610
No matter how much gossip there is,

959
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,230
it's better to ask Duke Xue.

960
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:20,500
Duke.

961
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:23,620
Is he really your son?
