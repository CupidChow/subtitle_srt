the Jade Ruyi Scepter incident was a scheme against the Yan family.

After meddling in Zhou Yinzhi's affairs,

85

you think you can interfere in the power struggle at court.

You think you care about the Yan family

or are you?

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,650
Junior Preceptor Xie is actually afraid of cats.

102
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,690
How interesting.

103
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,310
That must be another of your secrets,

104
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,830
distinguished Junior Preceptor Xie.

105
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,410
I'm just a nobody

106
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,900
but have made you scared more than once.

107
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,080
It turns out that a perfect person has worries too

108
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,780
and a saint has fears as well.

109
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:20,640
A perfect person can have worries and a saint can have fears.

110
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,330
But I'm not perfect,

111
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:25,770
nor am I a saint.

You think you're clever

and never bother to keep a low profile.

115
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,850
But you should know this.

116
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,550
When someone

117
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,280
doesn't want to touch something,

118
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,870
it's not necessarily because of fear.

119
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,520
It can be because of hate

120
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,909
and aversion.

121
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,120
A military camp?

122
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:04,890
Yes.

123
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,560
I watched it all night.

124
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,150
There were horses, provisions, and weapons.

125
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,490
They were all military supplies.

126
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,550
I've done the math.

127
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,520
They're enough to support at least 3,000 people.

128
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:15,600

Four.

134

One.

135
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,050
Xingwu Guards

136
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,690
have the approval of His Majesty.

137
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,650
Although Xue Yuan is the commander,

138
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:45,030
all their supplies are allocated by the court.

139
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,820
He's stored so many supplies.

140
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:48,760
It seems

141
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,980
he's building a private army.

142
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,830
Building a private army is a felony.

143
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,360
His Majesty won't allow it.

144
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,590
Is Xue Yuan so bold that he's keeping it from His Majesty?

145
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,690
Xue Yuan is ambitious

146
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,890
and hungry for power.

147
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,070
When His Majesty ascended the throne,

148
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,480
the empress dowager intended

149
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,350
to let him command the armies.

150
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,840
Later, all the other officials in the court

151
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,040
submitted a petition

152
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,650
and stopped that from happening.

153
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,940
These years, he's been resenting the Yan family

154
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,600
for the armies at our command.

155
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,140
It makes sense that he's built a private army

156
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,270
to stand against us.

157
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,690
If we report this to His Majesty,

158
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,940
we'll be able to suppress the Xue family, won't we?

159
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,220
His Majesty is in poor health.

160
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,040
The empress dowager carries a great deal of clout.

161
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,840
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

162
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,740
Father, you're right.

163
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,340
If the Yan family reports this matter,

164
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,020
the empress dowager is very likely to get in the way.

165
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,680
But they want to make Lord Linzi the crown prince

166
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,510
and have a private army now.

167
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,400
If something happens to His Majesty,

168
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,530
there will be chaos.

169
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,700
Such a large number of military supplies

170
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,500
couldn't have been quietly transported

171
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,050
from a place too far away.

172
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,330
It's very likely that they were from Tongzhou.

173
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,580
I'll go to the Tongzhou military camp in secret

174
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:00,190
to find out what's going on.

175
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,910
Then we'll find a way to report it to His Majesty.

176
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,810
A while ago,

177
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,340
a military official was arrested by Xue Yuan without a good reason.

178
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,130
We need to send someone to the prison again to make inquiries.

179
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,160
Despite our constant efforts,

180
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,580
we still haven't managed

181
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,530
to meet that guy in person

182
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,710
and find out what happened.

183
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,070
If this goes on,

184
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,480
the Yan family will be even more disadvantaged.

185
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,460
Father, don't worry.

186
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,940
I'll take care of things here.

187
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,980
If you find anything,

188
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,060
send a message back by carrier pigeon.

189
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,059
I'll make preparations in advance.

190
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:42,289
I just got word

191
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,260
that early this morning,

192
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,420
Marquis of Yan left town

193
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,620
and went to Tongzhou.

194
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,510
He left town?

195
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,190
For what?

196
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,350
Maybe

197
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,960
he's going to inspect the troops?

198
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,620
Yan Lin went hunting in the suburbs

199
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,850
with Lord Linzi yesterday

200
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,420
and didn't come back until this morning.

201
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,130
I see.

202
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,580
You must have known about the Jade Ruyi Scepter incident

203
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,040
and what Gongyi Cheng did.

204
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,190
We'd better be cautious these days.

205
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,170
Wait.

206
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,810
You insisted on giving lessons in the court yesterday

207
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,670
because you had to send a message.

208
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,550
The message has been sent,

209
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,900
yet you're still hurrying to the court.

210
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,490
Are you doing this

211
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,550
because of Miss Jiang?

212
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,570
In my opinion,

213
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,480
Miss Jiang is so mysterious.

214
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:26,970
She knows everything

215
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,190
and had the guts to talk to Mr. Xie like that.

216
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,840
We must get rid of her!

217
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:31,780
No.

218
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:32,680
Why?

219
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,980
She's got something on us.

220
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,100
She could be the death of us.

221
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,960
She's an enigma

222
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,430
but not a bad person.

223
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,510
In time,

224
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,160
she may open up to us.

225
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,330
But you told us

226
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,860
that we should nip it in the bud.

227
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,620
Can't you understand what I'm saying?

228
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,480
I've told you she's not our enemy.

229
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,050
Why do you have to get rid of her?

230
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:52,650
Besides,

231
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,320
I'll be watching over her.

232
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,340
What could possibly go wrong?

233
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,450
But you also said that…

234
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,050
Enough.

235
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,050
You can leave now.

236
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,260
We'll take care of things out here.

237
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,060
Rest assured.

238
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,650
What are you doing?

239
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:07,840
Silly boy.

240
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,020
I just saved you.

241
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,530
Another poor guy who's implicated in the Jade Ruyi Scepter incident.

242
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,210
Before I went to bed last night,

243
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,540
I heard Eunuch Huang and the other eunuchs

244
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,380
torturing servants outside.

245
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,810
I was so scared that I was up all night.

246
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,210
I need to go to the temple and say my prayers.

247
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,300
If the Jade Ruyi Scepter incident is really intended to undermine the Yan family,

248
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,960
I must find a way to prevent that from happening.

249
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,970
But the court is heavily guarded now

250
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,850
and Xie Wei won't help me again.

251
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,780
What should I do?

[Work hard to make the country better]

253

Are you really going to give lessons in the Fengcheng Hall?

254
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,050
Junior Preceptor Xie

255
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,030
assigned us to give lessons

256
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,450
but compiled such a textbook.

257
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,270
[Political Classics]

258
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,250
It's all about politics.

259
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,360
I'm at a loss

260
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,350
for how to teach.

261
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,980
Junior Preceptor Xie is accomplished at a young age

262
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,910
and always has some unusual ideas.

263
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,050
But the Hanlin Academy

264
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,930
has its own long-established traditions.

265
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:33,710
Moreover,

266
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,270
Miss Xue is a study partner too.

267
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,330
If we say something improper in class

268
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,740
and she tells it to the duke,

269
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,180
we'll be in trouble.

270
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,200
That's exactly what I'm saying.

271
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,820
Not long ago, the duke asked us

272
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,620
to draft a memorial about making Lord Linzi the crown prince.

273
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,530
It went unanswered for some reason.

274
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,680
The duke is still sulking about it.

275
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,700
If we cause more trouble for him at this time,

276
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,110
we'll…

277
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,150
How about

00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,290
we use this book as the textbook?

279
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,290
It can't go wrong.

Mr. Wang,

283
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,700
I wonder when we can learn

284
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,230
the textbook Junior Preceptor Xie compiled.

285
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,420
Your Highness.

286
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:30,840
His Majesty ordered me and the other scholars to give you lessons

287
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,470
with the aim of enlightening you

288
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,620
instead of spoiling you

289
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,030
and letting you do whatever you want.

290
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,450
I heard

291
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,960
someone in the Fengcheng Hall

292
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,010
was disrespectful to the elders

293
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,730
and didn't show the virtues of forbearance and civility

294
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,780
that were expected of a woman.

295
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,750
I found it ridiculous

296
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,060
and realized the heavy burden on my shoulders.

297
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,720
So I changed the textbook today

298
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,080

Please open the textbook.

301

Since ancient times,

302
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,550
women have been expected to be obedient,

303
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,130
modest,

304
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,770
and tolerant.

305
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,330
Those good-for-nothing dipsticks.

306
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,550
They call me an unscrupulous vixen

307
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,140
and are hellbent on talking Shen Jie into deposing me.

308
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:42,670
What?

309
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,190
It's my fault that Shen Jie dotes on me.

310
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,050
It's also my fault that he allows me to talk politics.

are not bigoted?

323
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,030
Throughout history, the fall of every empire

324
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,140
and the degeneration of every noble man

325
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,020
could more or less be blamed on women.

326
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,350
So as women,

327
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,680
you must conform to

328

insult your teacher?

336
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,350
That's strange.

337
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,040
I said I feel sick.

338
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,760
Why do you feel insulted?

339
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,780
Maybe I ate something spoiled yesterday

340
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,800
or smelled something repulsive

341
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,070
and stinky today.

00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,740
If I stay here any longer,

343
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,070
I'm afraid I'll throw up

344
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,010
and ruin your mood for teaching.

345
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,210
So please forgive me.

346
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,270
I'll take my leave.

347
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:05,610
You…

348
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,300
You…

349
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:09,810
You…

350
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,300
You…

351
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,890
What a rebellious girl!

352
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,630
An ill-mannered and willful person like you

353
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,350
doesn't deserve to stay in the Fengcheng Hall.

354
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,750
Go find someone else to teach you!

355
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,980
That's your Ning.

356
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:31,900
Ning?

357
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,770
So that's the Miss Jiang

358
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,370
who I've heard so much about.

359
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,490
I finally meet her in the flesh today.

360
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,190
Please don't make fun of us.

361
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,020
Miss Jiang is just my friend.

362
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:43,950
You can make fun of me when we're alone.

363
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,350
But if what you just said reaches my father,

364
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,620
I'll just be beaten up

365
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:51,080
but Miss Jiang's reputation will be stained.

366
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,080
Please be careful with what you say.

367
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,990
King Yanping is young and frank.

368
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,140
Please…

369
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,740
Don't take offense, Miss Jiang.

370
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,010
See?

371
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,540
This is who Viscount Yan is.

372
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,660
When he was all over her,

373
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,050
he treated her so nicely.

374
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:14,610
But now,

375
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,230
he's so cold to her.

376
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,870
You're good-looking.

377
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,180
Viscount Yan doesn't want you,

378
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,010
but I'm interested in you.

379
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:22,580
Xue Ye.

380
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:23,750
Shut up.

381
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,450
Mr. Xue, you look

382
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,020
well-educated

383
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,740
but talk like a lout.

384
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,890
There are many things that Viscount Yan doesn't want.

385
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,260
But I'm afraid you don't deserve

386
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,030
to have any of them.

387
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,290
You…

388
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:33,960
Enough.

389
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,280
Miss Jiang is Zhiyi's study partner.

390
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,410
Don't be rude to her.

391
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,380
All right. Let's go.

392
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,800
Aren't you going to meet Mr. Xie?

393
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:47,580
Let's go.

394
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,040
Yan Lin.

395
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,410
Watch your mouth.

396
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,020
Wait. I…

397
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:51,910
What did I say?

398
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,170
I didn't say anything.

399
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,830
What does it have to do with me?

400
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:55,890
Silly.

401
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,190
Why did you come?

402
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,190
Mr. Xie.

403
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,900
My father said I've been studying for half a year

404
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,099
and insisted on testing me on politics.

405
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,480
If I fail his test,

406
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,050
I'm afraid I'll be punished.

407
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,180
I stayed up all night

408
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,930
and wrote this essay.

409
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,619
Please take a look at it.

410
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,490
Why are you laughing?

411
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,950
You're laughing at me today

412
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,750
but it'll be your turn tomorrow.

413
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,370
These days,

414
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,250
you've improved a lot

415
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,160
and outshined most of your peers.

416
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,860
Even if there are imperfections in your essay,

417
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,760
your father won't mind them.

418
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,760
-Thank you.
-But since you've brought it here,

419
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,830
I'll review it carefully later

420
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,710
and give you feedback in class tomorrow.

421
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,150
Okay.

422
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,000
We'll take our leave then.

423
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:01,900
Viscount Yan.

424
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,250
I selected several pieces of wood to make a qin a few days ago.

425
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,980
Some of them need to be disposed of.

426
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,580
Can you help me move them out?

427
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,210
My pleasure, Mr. Xie.

428
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:11,820
You two go on.

429
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,800
Knock it off.

430
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,800
Miss Ning'er came to me for qin lessons a few days ago

431
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,140
and left her qin here.

432
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,950
Although she's ill-mannered, naughty,

433
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,580
and bad at school,

434
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,100
she's smart.

435
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:47,630
Viscount Yan,

436
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,560
you don't have to worry too much about her.

437
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,070
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

438
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,800
If only I could stop worrying

439
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:55,970
so easily.

440
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,380
By the way,

441
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,740
I didn't see your father in the council meeting this morning.

442
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,800
I heard he's sick and resting at home.

443
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,760
Is he all right?

444
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:03,700
My father

445
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,280
drank a little too much.

446
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,780
His old injuries from the battlefield are acting up.

447
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,040
But he'll be fine soon.

448
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,830
Thank you for your concern.

449
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,780
Is something troubling you, Viscount Yan?

450
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,580
I'm your teacher.

451
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,060
It's my duty to share my knowledge of life with you.

452
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,570
Even saints have concerns sometimes.

453
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,050
You must have your concerns too.

454
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,920
If you trust me,

455
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,980
you can come to me

456
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,630
whenever you need help.

457
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,090
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

458
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:37,850
I can handle

459
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,690
most of the things myself,

460
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,430
but

461
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,380
it worries me that she's all alone in the court.

462
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,140
She's

463
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,150
straightforward by nature.

464
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,150
She may say something wrong and offend someone.

465
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,550
If it's not an imposition,

466
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,210
please take care of her for me,

467
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,270
will you?

468
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,090
Okay.

469
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,120
Try it.

470
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:15,920
Ning.

471
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,230
You're finally back.

472
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,420
You must've been scared by that old man.

473
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,060
Thank you for your concern, Your Highness.

474
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,920
I just didn't want to listen to him

475
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,170
and hung out for a little while.

476
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,170
I enjoyed myself.

477
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:26,880
Not only you,

478
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,980
I was also sickened by what he said.

479
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,060
You don't like him either?

480
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,130
I'm always aware that unmarried women outside

481
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,360
have to learn the Book of Etiquettes,

482
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,700
but I never took it to heart.

483
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,470
After I learned it myself, I found it disgusting.

484
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,330
It has no respect for women at all.

485
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,490
It's unbelievable

486
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,970
that such abominable stuff

487
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,010
was brought into the court

488
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,410
and taught to us in class.

489
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,810
Luckily, besides qin lessons,

490
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,020
Mr. Xie will give us other lessons too.

491
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,380
We'll be able to learn the textbook he compiled later.

492
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,150
He's even harder to deal with

493
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,180
than that pedantic old man Wang Jiu.

494
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,870
Greetings, Mr. Xie.

495
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,750
Skip the formalities.

496
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,170
[Book of Etiquettes]

497
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,220
This book shouldn't have appeared in the Fengcheng Hall.

498
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,270
Who brought it here?

499
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:14,890
Mr. Xie.

500
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,630
Mr. Wang said

501
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,430
we were disrespectful to the elders

502
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,700
so he decided to teach us etiquette.

503
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,570
He also told us

504
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,470
that women should be obedient.

505
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:26,900
Throw them away.

506
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,410
How should we explain it to Mr. Wang?

507
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,500
There are already enough restraints on women in this society.

508
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,540
You're not here

509
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,590
to learn something like that.

510
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,570
If anyone still wants to learn the Book of Etiquettes,

511
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,830
go ahead and pick it up.

512
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,200
I won’t stop you.

513
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,080
Class begins.

514
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,790
That's all for today.

515
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,350
You may leave.

516
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,470
Miss Ning'er.

517
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:14,700
Please wait.

518
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,240
Did you understand

519
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,260
today's lesson?

520
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,090
I'm afraid he's here to get even with me.

521
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:25,070
Thank you for your concern.

522
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,470
I understood everything.

523
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,290
Later, I will...

524
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,620
If you have no other plans later,

525
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,470
come with me to Wenzhao Pavilion.

526
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,250
No need.

527
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,780
I'm unbearably obstinate.

528
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,150
It's a waste of time for me to attend lessons.

529
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,280
You misunderstood.

530
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,600
You left your qin at my place.

531
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,460
It's occupying my space.

532
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,120
I just want you to get your qin.

533
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,300
Thank you, sir.

534
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:52,020
Goodbye.

535
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,550
Did you really think

536
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,940
I brought you here just for your qin?

537
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,500
Of course.

538
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,540
Apply some medicine.

539
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,860
It's fine to be reckless.

540
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,810
But you're badly injured.

541
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,610
You need to apply some medicine.

542
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:15,810
Wait.

543
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,670
Clean your hands first.

544
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,400
Wipe your hands.

545
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:46,730
Your hand.

546
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,060
Are you still angry?

547
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:01,950
I dare not.

548
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,560
Yesterday,

549
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,120
I was affected by the white cat.

550
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,860
I shouldn't have lost my temper with you

551
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,720
or scolded you.

552
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,250
And about last night,

553
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,510
I know you said those things

554
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,700
because you were worried about Yan Lin.

555
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,560
I shouldn't have said what I said.

556
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,550
It's only fair that you're angry.

557
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,060
Are you

558
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,200
admitting that you're wrong?

559
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,770
I knew that the Jade Ruyi Scepter scepter matter

560
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,430
was targeting the Yan family.

561
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:37,750
So I was in a bad mood

562
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,830
and vented my anger at you.

563
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,420
I called you here today

564
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,400
to tell you that

565
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,370
I will handle the Jade Ruyi Scepter scepter matter.

566
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:46,940
Besides,

567
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,270
Yan Lin tried every means to get you into the palace

568
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,620
because he wanted you to learn some real skills.

569
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,100
You are like an unrefined jade.

570
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,030
It would be a pity

571
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,830
not to refine and polish you.

572
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,060
Unrefined jade?

573
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,960
What makes you think that I'm an unrefined jade?

574
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,880
Back then, on the way to the capital,

575
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,570
a young girl

576
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,660
was neither afraid of robbers

577
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:13,590
[Four years ago]

578
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,690
nor afraid of escaping into the wilderness.

579
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,060
Even when she was trapped

580
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,920
and in danger, she was not afraid.

581
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:19,120
She smashed the qin and drew her blood.

582
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,680
With her stubbornness,

583
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,490
she did everything

584
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,650
to save me, a weak scholar.

585
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,200
Jiang Xuening.

586
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,540
I've seen what you were like.

587
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,660
I had expectations.

588
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,810
So I was disappointed.

589
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:36,750
Disappointed?

590
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,710
After I came to the capital,

591
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,570
I once visited the Jiang Mansion

592
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,260
and saw you in brocade clothes.

593
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:46,370
[Four years ago]

594
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,490
Just because you were unhappy,

595
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,620
you scolded and punished

596
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,750
a young servant who was about your age.

597
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,020
Miss Xuening, I'm sorry.

598
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,720
I was wrong.

599
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,470
You failed at such a small task.

600
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,190
Stop crying.

601
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,120
All you do is cry.

602
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,180
If you keep crying,

603
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,580
I'll sell you off.

604
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,850
Your gaze became unfamiliar.

605
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,750
You even made me suspect

606
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,070
that what happened on our way to the capital

607
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,840
didn't actually happen.

608
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:11,280
After that,

609
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,980
I heard that you became even more unruly

610
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,280
and rampant.

611
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,420
At that time, I thought,

612
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:19,340
the prosperity in the capital

613
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,420
truly did change people for the worse.

614
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,090
Gradually,

615
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,850
it erased

616
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,790
your past self and spirit from you.

617
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:28,750
So,

618
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:30,790
you hated me back then.

619
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,580
It wasn't exactly hate.

620
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:35,810
It was more like pity.

621
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:38,290
Sometimes people may go astray.

622
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,070
But if someone could step in

623
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,810
and teach you to tell the good from the bad,

624
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,420
you could still return to the right path

625
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,520
and regain your true self.

626
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,580
I found it a pity that you had changed.

627
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:52,230
But it was also a pity that no one was there to guide you.

628
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,160
But now it seems

629
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,150
your nature hasn't changed.

630
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,810
Your kindness is still there.

631
00:26:59,260 --> 00:26:59,880
Although

632
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,230
you're still short-tempered,

633
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,840
you're doing better than in previous years.

634
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,860
I guess...

635
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,200
You're still considered an unrefined jade.

636
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:11,810
So, are you willing to

637
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:13,810
learn qin here tomorrow?

638
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,290
Ning'er!

639
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,390
I'm not angry anymore.

640
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,130
With your naughty temper,

641
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,140
who can handle you in the future?

642
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,790
You don't have to worry about that.

643
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,610
We'll leave future matters

644
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,500
for the future.

645
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,460
Don't do it again.

This traitor actually makes

648
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,180
a pretty decent teacher.

Are you looking for Her Highness?

-She...
-No.

I'm here for you.

654
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:13,850
Miss Jiang,

655
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:14,950
I don't know what happened

656
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:15,780
between you and Yan Lin,

657
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,460
but he's been acting strangely lately.

658
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,680
He used to be the most free-spirited person I know.

659
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,310
But now,

660
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,440
he's depressed.

661
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,140
He wouldn't tell me anything when I asked him about it.

662
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,270
So I can only ask you.

663
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,580
There are many things in this world

664
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,490
that are difficult to tell others.

665
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,720
If it's convenient for you,

666
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,450
I would like to ask you to pass a message to Yan Lin.

667
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,660
Just tell him that

668
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,820
strong wind shows the strength of grass,

669
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,940
and clouds will part to reveal the moon's glow.

670

For some matters,

671
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,220
as long as he can keep calm,

672
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,150
things will change for the better.

different levels of knowledge mastery.

680
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,340
But you have to teach them together.

I'll surely tell him about your difficulties and hard work.

684
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,080
Thank you, Miss Xue.

685
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,910
I deeply appreciate that.

686
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,380
But there is one thing you may not know.

687
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,500
During class today,

688
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,120
Junior Preceptor Xie tossed the

689
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,050
Book of Etiquettes out of the hall.

690
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:28,630
This...

691
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,470
Why did he...

692
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,660
That's right.

693
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:34,990
Junior Preceptor Xie is highly valued by His Majesty.

694
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,510
He has always been gentle towards others.

695
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,440
Why did he act so strangely today?

696
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,300
After thinking about it,

697
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,630
there's only one possibility.

698
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,870
Someone hates you

699
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,100
and made a false complaint about you

700
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,860
to sow discord between the two of you.

701
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,810
You mean...

702
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,700
Jiang Xuening?

703
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,860
That is just my guess.

704
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,340
But speaking of which,

705
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,060
some disobedient individuals

706
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,380
may not be suitable study partners in the palace.

707
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,840
If they insist on staying,

708
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:06,070
not only will you get angry and damage your health,

709
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,890
but we won't be able to find peace either.

710
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:08,950
Don't you think so?

711
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:21,710
It's all gone.

712
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,040
How could this happen?

713
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,980
The camp equipment and supplies

714
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,750
were managed by Zhao Guang.

715
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:28,840
Where is he?

716
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,560
He is nowhere to be seen.

717
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,690
I've sent someone to look for him.

718
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,040
General,

719
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,770
we have searched the entire camp.

720
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,570
No trace of Zhao Guang was found.

721
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,430
Did he flee to escape punishment?

722
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,290
Send someone to search for him immediately.

723
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,920
Bring him back no matter what.

724
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,230
Yes.

725
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,570
Jiang Xuening.

726
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,300
Do you feel

727
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,990
better today?

728
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,970
You are like an unrefined jade.

729
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:01,900
It would be a pity

730
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,550
not to refine and polish you.

731
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,170
I offended you yesterday.

732
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,710
Please forgive and enlighten me.

733
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:11,090
At least you know your mistakes.

734
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,870
In that case,

735
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,510
recite for everyone

736
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,070
the Book of Etiquettes chapter

737
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,960
that I talked about yesterday.

738
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,130
Why is he still talking about the Book of Etiquettes?

739
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,280
The book is already gone.

740
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,290
He didn't mention anything about reciting it yesterday.

741
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,180
It's understandable

742
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:30,940
if others cannot recite it.

743
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:35,020
But Miss Jiang claims to be talented

744
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,870
and knowledgeable beyond means.

745
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,280
You wouldn't even

746
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,940
listen to my lesson.

747
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,280
I guess you must have memorized it.

748
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:45,560
Mr. Wang,

749
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,310
I can't recite it.

750
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,450
First, in Mr. Zhao's class,

751
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,460
you said you couldn't understand the books.

752
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,530
Then, in my class,

753
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,820
you refused to listen to my lesson.

754
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,340
You always talked back to the scholars.

755
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,080
I thought you were inevitably arrogant

756
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,980
because you were talented.

757
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,540
However,

758
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,020
you couldn't even recite

759
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,500
such a short chapter of text.

760
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:19,180
Turns out, you're actually an empty-headed fool.

761
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,640
Mr. Wang, you've gone too far.

762
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:24,430
-Ning is not…
-Your Highness.

763
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,660
The job of a study partner

764
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,530
is to study knowledge and learn

765
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,690
etiquettes with you.

766
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,150
Back then,

767
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,930
when I taught the former emperor,

768
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,260
he respected his teacher

769
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:41,430
and never disobeyed me.

770
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:46,000
Are you going to stray from the behavior

771
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,310
exemplified by the former emperor?

772
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,380
You...

773
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,570
Your Highness.

774
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,760
No need to argue for me.

775
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:57,460
I'm willing to accept the punishment.

776
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,380
Fine.

777
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,040
Today,

778
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,620
on behalf of the scholars of the Hanlin Academy,

779
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:08,930
I will punish you for your insolence.

780
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,680
If you do it again,

781
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,190
you will be severely punished.

782
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,060
That stupid old man Wang Ji

783
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,500
was obviously picking a fight.

784
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,010
He even mentioned the former emperor to shut me up.

785
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,070
How outrageous!

786
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,230
I must get back at him for this.

787
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:28,140
Your Highness, please be gentler.

788
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,970
I was beaten a lot at home.

789
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,460
This is nothing.

790
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:33,560
Your home is a different matter.

791
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,690
But here, you're under my protection.

792
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,740
This won't do.

793
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,060
I'll find Mother right now

794
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,520
and ask her to kick Wang Jiu out of the palace.

795
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:46,560
Ning,

796
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,270
can Her Highness really kick Mr. Wang out?

797
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,010
Wang Jiu once taught the former emperor.

798
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:52,300
Although he's a bit old-fashioned,

799
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,300
he is the most senior scholar of Hanlin Academy.

800
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,360
It's not that easy.

801
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,810
But my father told me

802
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,700
he never taught any proper lessons.

803
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,540
It's all because Lord Pingnan killed many

804
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,980
Hanlin scholars during his rebellion

805
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,690
that he became the most senior one.

806
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,350
It's useless to know this now.

807
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,050
Mr. Wang told me to write a poem.

808
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,540
He said he wanted to check it this afternoon.

809
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,230
I can't write proper poems.

810
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:14,210
Let's think about how to deal with it first.

811
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,280
If you're troubled by something,

812
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,080
you should consult divination.

813
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,340
Gosh.

814
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:30,730
What's wrong?

815
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,150
Tell me.

816
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:35,780
This is a villain's fortune.

817
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,650
According to the divination,

818
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,320
Mr. Wang picked on you

819
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,320
because you offended someone.

820
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,389
Ning'er!

821
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,120
It can't be

822
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,080
him, right?

823
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,110
What a coincidence.

824
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,750
Jie, the color of your clothes

825
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,560
is Shu's favorite color.

826
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,400
Looking at how youthful you both are,

827
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,910
I really feel old now.

828
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:30,830
Your Highness,

829
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,980
this is dendrobium ginseng tea.

830
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,410
It's good for your health.

831
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:35,470
It's most suitable

832
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,940
for autumn and winter.

833
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:39,190
Thank you.

834
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:50,500
Jie.

835
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,140
You're not usually

836
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,840
this quiet.

837
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:55,610
Mother,

838
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,080
I think

839
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,070
we don't need to talk

840
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:58,870
if we have nothing to talk about.

841
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:59,930
No need to force it.

842
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,120
I have an appointment with Yan Lin.

843
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,130
I shall take my leave.

844
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:03,810
Sit down.

845
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,580
Mother! Mother.

846
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,880
Why are you in such a hurry?

847
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,030
How inappropriate.

848
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:10,010
What is it?

849
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:10,760
I...

850
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,190
I'm here for my brother.

851
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,470
Shu is here too?

852
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:21,770
Brother.

853
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,350
You can't do this.

854
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,960
Shu is not married yet.

855
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,330
It's inappropriate for you two

856
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,460
to be here together.

857
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,770
They grew up together

858
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,800
and we're family.

859
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,900
What's inappropriate about it?

860
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,770
Mother.

861
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,690
Mr. Wang said,

862
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,350
there is order in Yin and Yang. Men are superior to women.

863
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:39,260
This has been the etiquette since ancient times.

864
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,530
Mr. Wang also said

865
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,380
men and women above age seven can't sit together.

866
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,250
Women in the harem are not allowed to interfere in politics.

867
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,580
That old fool Wang Jiu..

868
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,430
He's teaching such ridiculous things.

869
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,340
Guards.

870
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:49,730
Aunt.

871
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,750
Mr. Wang is the chief of Hanlin Academy.

872
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,090
A few days ago, he even mentioned the matter of

873
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:57,550
appointing the Crown Prince to His Majesty.

874
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,050
What Crown Prince?

875
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:02,980
Mother.

876
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,020
Zhiyi and I will take our leave first.

877
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,590
We shan't disturb your teatime.

878
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,120
Let's go.

879
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,060
[Yingchun Pavilion]

880
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,460
[Wenzhao Pavilion]

881
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,310
What's wrong?

882
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,120
Greetings, sir.

883
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,330
What are you doing?

884
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,450
Even if you don't want to learn, you don't have to do this.

885
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,350
I know I'm mischievous and unruly,

886
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,950
I'm here to ask for your forgiveness.

887
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,880
Please be generous and forgive me.

888
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:15,900
Don't let the teachers pick on me anymore.

889
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,830
What do you mean?

890
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:19,890
So,

891
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,580
it really wasn't you.

892
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,730
What happened?

893
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,150
Tell me the details.

894
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,180
Brother,

895
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:28,190
you have to thank me this time.

896
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:30,210
If it weren't for my brilliance,

897
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:32,270
you would have lost your reputation.

898
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,540
What nonsense are you saying?

899
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,070
I think you're learning all the wrong things.

900
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,110
Oh no.

901
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,770
It's all your fault.

902
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:41,970
I promised Ning to kick Wang Jiu out.

903
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,950
She must think I broke my promise.

904
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:49,020
So, not only did Wang Jiu

905
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,340
lie to everyone by switching the

906
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,540
study partners' textbooks without permission,

907
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,060
he even exacted revenge in private.

908
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,260
And that Zhao Yanhong

909
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:00,170
panders to authority and takes advantage of others.

910
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,650
Both of them have no dignity or morality to speak of.

911
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:03,510
Hanlin Academy

912
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,670
cannot keep these sorts of people around.

913
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:09,980
But I noticed recently that

914
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,760
Wang Jiu and the others

915
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,980
seem particularly respectful towards Xue Shu.

916
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,820
Do you think

917
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,790
this is the Xue family’s idea?

918
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,950
Even you found out about their relationship?

919
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,280
What do you mean even me?

920
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:22,800
Half a month ago,

921
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,820
Wang Jiu and Zhao Yanhong

922
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,280
helped the Duke of Xue draft a memorial.

923
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,250
It was about appointing the Crown Prince.

924
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,540
Fortunately, the Xue family

925
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,780
offended His Majesty because of the Raw Silk Case.

926
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,110
So, this matter was put on the back burner.

927
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,610
The Xue family befriended

928
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,610
the ministers of the six ministries outside the court

929
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,600
and planted spies in the palace.

930
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,810
They have already secured a firm footing.

931
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:45,100
Now in the court,

932
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,310
only the Marquis of Yan is loyal to the country

933
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:48,840
and can stand against them.

934
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:51,080
So the Yan family is a thorn in the flesh

935
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,820
that the Xue family wants to get rid of?

936
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,620
That's right.

937
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,890
However, the Yan family has a high reputation among soldiers.

938
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,130
Currently, the State of Qian

939
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:00,440
is being targeted by the State of Yue's armies in the north.

940
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,630
Lord Pingnan has been wreaking havoc in the south for years.

941
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,690
If the Xue family wants to harm the Yan family,

942
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:07,150
they will need more than some petty charges.

943
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,310
That's why they decided

944
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:10,920
to collude with the rebels.

945
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,880
I see.

946
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:16,300
No wonder they let Zhou Yinzhi into the Yan Mansion

947
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,190
to steal Marquis of Yan's handwritten letter

948
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,590
and forge a letter addressed to the rebels.

949
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,840
But His Majesty has handed the Rebels Case

950
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,180
to the Ministry of Justice,

951
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,790
and you used the Raw Silk Case to trap Xue Yuan.

952
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:28,590
The situation is not that bad.

953
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,520
But I don't understand.

954
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,550
I'm just a study partner.

955
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,210
I'm not outstanding either.

956
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,730
Why did the Xue family use the Hanlin Academy

957
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:36,530
to target me?

958
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,960
I was just rambling

959
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:43,260
and making wild guesses.

960
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,320
Please forgive me.

961
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,040
This mouth of mine will be the death of me one day.

962
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,500
Although your intelligence is mediocre

963
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,100
and you're not outstanding,

964
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:04,730
but...

965
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,490
Didn't you say Wang Jiu wanted you to write a poem?

966
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,220
I happen to have one.

967
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,860
When it's time, give this to him

968
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,540
and tell him you wrote it.

969
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,270
Let's see what he will say then.

970
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:25,050
The moon is as bright as jade.

971
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,250
The empty mountains cannot tell flowers apart.

972
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,110
The clouds cast a shadow over them.

973
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,840
The wind blows and sways a hundred stalks with it.

974
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,280
It's so well written.

975
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,820
Will Mr. Wang believe that I wrote it?

976
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,430
It doesn't matter if he believes it or not.

977
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:38,490
Just say

978
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,340
you wrote it yourself.

979
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,690
Sir, are you...

980
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:43,910
trying to help me?

981
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,040
In your dreams.

982
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:47,900
I'm the Crown Prince's Junior Preceptor.

983
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,330
My job is to remove the Xue family's

984
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:51,260
eyes and ears from Hanlin Academy.

985
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,940
It just so happens

986
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:55,510
that your matter helps my cause too.

987
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:57,920
As for you,

988
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,110
you always wanted to leave the palace.

989
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,470
Why don't you take this opportunity

990
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:04,600
to leave the palace?

991
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,270
It's true that I don't like the palace.

992
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:10,300
But this is the highest peak.

993
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,450
Only by studying hard

994
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:14,370
and becoming better,

995
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,950
can I help the Yan family

996
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,250
and Yan Lin.

997
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,480
I will leave sooner or later.

998
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,800
But I hope I can leave without regret.

999
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,390
If I want to reverse my fate,

1000
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:27,250
I can't possibly give up halfway.

1001
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,660
Reverse fate...

1002
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:33,180
I'll copy the poem now.

1003
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:35,100
Wait.

1004
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:44,460
It's not serious.

1005
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:45,370
It's just that...

1006
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:46,160
Baoying didn't want it to hurt,

1007
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,860
so she wrapped it thicker than necessary.

1008
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,920
The palace has rules for paper types.

1009
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,880
The papers from the Imperial Household Department

1010
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,740
are Bingyi paper and Bailu paper.

1011
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:54,920
The papers I use here

1012
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,930
are from the palace's Chengxin Hall.

1013
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:58,100
Memorize this poem

1014
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,030
and write it down when you go back.

1015
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:01,130
This way, you won't get caught

1016
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:02,190
and cause trouble.

1017
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,160
You are indeed a rebel.

1018
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,020
You didn't miss such a detail.

1019
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,240
Do you hear me?

1020
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,040
You're right.

1021
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:11,920
I'll memorize it now.
