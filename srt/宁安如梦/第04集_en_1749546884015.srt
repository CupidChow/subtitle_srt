1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
As long as I can enter the Ning'an Palace

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,200
and pay all the price

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,600
I will be willing to do my best

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,400
The End

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,800
The End

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,800
Everything seems to be a dream

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,400
I have owed a lot of people

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,800
Chaozhe, help me

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,600
I will be a good person after this

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
The End

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
I will be the one to take the favor

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,800
There are some things you can't give me

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
But what about them?

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,000
The life you chose is for Mr. You

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,400
In this world, everyone has the right to escape

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,000
But I can't

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,000
I want to regret it

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,400
and do the wrong thing

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,200
and try my best to return

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Does Mr. Zhang believe that everything is decided?

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I would rather believe in the future

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,000
Your Highness

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,000
Your Highness

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The End

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Ning'an, what are you doing?

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
In the end

28
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,800
there is a pair of invisible hands

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,600
that will break everything

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,400
The revenge is long

31
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,600
Who are you in the end?

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,800
The Emperor of the mortal world is so long

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,200
and so absurd

34
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,200
You are so cruel

35
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,200
The End

36
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,200
The first one to kill is Zhou Ying Zhi.

37
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
He also put his head on the gate.

38
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Let the person who entered the palace see his whereabouts.

39
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,200
And this snake,

40
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,200
the one who was killed in the past,

41
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,200
was the one who killed Zhou Ying Zhi.

42
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,200
He also put his head on the gate.

43
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,200
Let the person who entered the palace see his whereabouts.

44
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
And this snake,

45
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,200
the one who was killed in the past,

46
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,200
was the one who killed Zhou Ying Zhi.

47
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,200
He also put his head on the gate.

48
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,200
Let the person who entered the palace see his whereabouts.

49
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
And this snake,

50
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
was the one who was killed by Yan Li when he was young.

51
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
It was me indeed.

52
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,200
Miss,

53
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,200
your face is not very good.

54
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,200
But what's wrong with it?

55
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,200
I was just thinking that

56
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,200
if I come to find Zhou Ying Zhi,

57
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
would I be wrong?

58
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,200
I don't dare to trouble you.

59
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,200
But I have one thing to say to you.

60
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,200
I know that people are greedy and have a strong will.

61
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,200
But I don't know that

62
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,200
the tiger knows the tiger,

63
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,200
is a man who is not supposed to be a man of nature.

64
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,200
Today, the tiger is not a man of nature.

65
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,200
He is a man of the tiger.

66
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,200
Your Highness,

67
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,200
you are so thoughtful.

68
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,200
Miss.

69
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,200
It's nothing.

70
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,200
I just want to remind you of what I said.

71
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,200
I hope that this reminder

72
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,200
can change something.

73
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,200
What you are thinking about is Lord Yan.

74
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
No.

75
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,200
He is a person who is very proud of me.

76
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,200
Lord Yan,

77
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
I am sorry.

78
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,200
Lord Yan,

79
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,200
what's wrong with you?

80
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,200
Ma Er is ill.

81
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,200
It's just an excuse of Miss Shi Cai.

82
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,200
She asked you to come back from the gate of the Liang State

83
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,200
to protect her.

84
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,200
She is very well-behaved and strong.

85
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,200
Your Highness,

86
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,200
do you still remember how long I have been in this horse?

87
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,200
As long as I have.

88
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,000
I've been away from Jiang Family for four years.

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I've never contacted him for four years.

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,600
How did he know I had a batch of horses?

91
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,200
He also knew that if I heard that Ma'er was sick, he would definitely come back.

92
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,200
Yesterday, I went to Yan's Army.

93
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,200
He immediately cured his wounds.

94
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,200
And Zhang Zhe Tang and Nidang were killed. He was all over the place.

95
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,200
He was so different from before.

96
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,200
What cause H aku lobe?

97
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,200
I get what it takes.

98
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,600
Don't even question it.

99
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,000
Yu Mann?

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:11,840
Pet PGt 8

101
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,800
If someone asks me,

102
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,000
I'll tell them I'm sick.

103
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,760
That's why I'm going home.

104
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,040
Greetings, Your Highness.

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,600
Come here.

106
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,320
Have a taste of the tea I brought.

107
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,080
Yes.

108
00:06:43,760 --> 00:07:05,800
A

109
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,560
Yu Yuan.

110
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,120
柱香.

111
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,120
I can get hurt immediately.

112
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,480
But if I don't care about it,

113
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,000
no one can hurt me.

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,240
If I think about it,

115
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,880
I feel like I'm just a little girl.

116
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,040
I can't do anything about it.

117
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,040
You can think of a way to do it.

118
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,600
By the way, Mother.

119
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,120
Have you chosen my companion?

120
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,800
Where's the list?

121
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,680
Show me.

122
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm looking for you for the imperial brother.

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,360
I don't have one here.

124
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,760
Then I'll go now.

125
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,560
Go.

126
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,720
Xie Qing.

127
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,720
I heard you were assassinated by the rebel.

128
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,520
Are you hurt?

129
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,320
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

130
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,920
I'm lucky to have you.

131
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,320
I'm lucky to have you.

132
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,320
Chen Ying?

133
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,320
It's like a new weapon

134
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,320
when you're looking for this Xuzhou.

135
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,320
Your Majesty.

136
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,320
The King of Pingnan is in the south of the country.

137
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,320
He's been in the capital for a long time.

138
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,920
If you want to be a rebel,

139
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,320
you need to be patient and patient.

140
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,320
Don't be too hasty.

141
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,120
I don't want to do that.

142
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,720
It's a pity that I can't wear it.

143
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,920
The old man wants to kill me.

144
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,320
I can't let him be as innocent as I want.

145
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,520
Your Majesty.

146
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,320
Your Majesty.

147
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,520
Yesterday, the imperial doctor sent me to the imperial doctor's office.

148
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,720
I invited Dr. Hu to ask questions.

149
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,720
I only wrote four words.

150
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,120
If you want to be a rebel,

151
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,720
you need to be patient and patient.

152
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,920
How can you be sad?

153
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,120
It's just that the emperor is a sonless.

154
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,720
The country can't be ruled by the imperial doctor.

155
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
I'll tell your father

156
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,120
that Li Jianer is the emperor.

157
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,320
You can ask him.

158
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,920
Don't worry, aunt. I understand.

159
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,920
Jianer is at the age of marriage.

160
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,120
After the emperor is gone,

161
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,120
his whole family will be the empress of the future.

162
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,720
To ensure that I don't lose my family,

163
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,520
this position must be yours.

164
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,120
Aunt is so kind.

165
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,720
She won't let you down.

166
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,320
I know my body well.

167
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,120
Why did Xie Qing come to look for me today?

168
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,920
Your Majesty.

169
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,920
I heard that you and the empress dowager

170
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,320
have chosen a princess.

171
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,920
I'm thinking that

172
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,520
the princess is a woman, but she's also a royal family member.

173
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,720
Other than the rest of the kitchens,

174
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,320
she needs to learn something else.

175
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,520
I ask for your permission to take the lessons.

176
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,520
You're so generous.

177
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,320
You're going to thank me for the imperial doctor.

178
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,720
I dare not.

179
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,320
I'll help you.

180
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,920
You've slept well.

181
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,720
Continue with the road courses.

182
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,020
Think of it,

183
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,720
I'll be lying to them!

184
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,320
Tell Xiao здang,

185
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,720
they deserve a suitable wife.

186
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,240
You lied to me in the city.

187
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,120
You didn't mean it.

188
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,240
You lied to me.

189
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,560
Nonsense.

190
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:33,960
How could I...

191
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,760
I...

192
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,960
I'm a fool.

193
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,600
This list of names

194
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,960
is for heaven's sake.

195
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,240
It's related to the safety of the Jiang family.

196
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,760
How could this happen?

197
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,880
How could this happen?

198
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,200
Is it you?

199
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,280
Is it you?

200
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,560
You tricked the new record

201
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,680
and made a mess.

202
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,440
You changed your name.

203
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,960
If I really have the ability to act in heaven,

204
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,840
I should be happy.

205
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,280
This is the end of the Jiang family.

206
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,040
It's a waste of time.

207
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,600
You...

208
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,480
Stop right there!

209
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,000
You...

210
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,320
My wife...

211
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,320
is fine.

212
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,120
You're going to kill me.

213
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,840
This is a bad news.

214
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,160
Huya Tao.

215
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,080
This list is for the emperor.

216
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,480
No one can change it.

217
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,320
But I can promise you.

218
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,240
In the future,

219
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,360
if I have the chance,

220
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,040
I will definitely protect you.

221
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,440
It's okay.

222
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,200
You don't have to worry about me.

223
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,840
Your sister can be chosen

224
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,640
and the glory of the Jiang family

225
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,640
will be the same.

226
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,880
Good girl.

227
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,520
Who is this bastard who wants to harm me?

228
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,640
Miss.

229
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,400
Isn't this a good thing?

230
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,880
How could it be a bad thing?

231
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,520
Good thing?

232
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,880
Forget it. You don't understand.

233
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,840
Miss.

234
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,840
The big girl is here.

235
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,160
Mother said something wrong.

236
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,760
Don't put it in your heart.

237
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,360
Father asked me to tell you

238
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,440
that after entering the palace,

239
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,000
you don't need to fight for a second.

240
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,760
Just watch and don't say anything.

241
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,960
Just be safe.

242
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,040
If I were you,

243
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,360
I would have been chosen

244
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,560
by the name.

245
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,240
But I didn't learn

246
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,760
how to be a sister.

247
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,320
I would have thought about it.

248
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,840
Did I get a chance

249
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,360
to be framed?

250
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,560
You're here for me

251
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,240
and you're here to give me a gift.

252
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,160
Do you think I can't see it?

253
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,480
You want to enter the palace too?

254
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,880
Yes.

255
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,480
I want to enter the palace.

256
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,920
Which woman in the world

257
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,720
has never loved Fan Hua?

258
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,840
This is not

259
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,440
a shameful thing to me.

260
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,800
But now I can't do it.

261
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,400
I have no good grudge.

262
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,320
Everything has its own principle.

263
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,480
Now I don't have the ability

264
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,920
or the fate.

265
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,200
I was in the capital four years ago.

266
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,960
You're not like this.

267
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,200
At least not like now.

268
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,680
Clouds and mountains are like a living Bodhisattva.

269
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,480
A useless and useless fake.

270
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,560
Do you know why I don't like you?

271
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,440
Not only because you're better than me,

272
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,760
but also because you're more outstanding.

273
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,320
You enjoy everything I want.

274
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,280
More importantly,

275
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,400
you've known your own background

276
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,760
for four years.

277
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,480
You know what I did

278
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,680
for you.

279
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,160
But you never said anything

280
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,080
to me.

281
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,160
So I'm not glad

282
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,760
to see that you're a good boyfriend.

283
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,120
That's great.

284
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,880
It's late.

285
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,080
I've got some time off.

286
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,640
來, let's go.

287
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,000
Quickly, outside.

288
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,240
Second DISCADEN620

289
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,920
All my servants carrying

290
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,000
the samecuz Pay

291
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,480
Guys all you got

292
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,480
I was born to be a mother.

293
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,480
But all this is because of her.

294
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,480
She made Jiang family, mother, and you and I both become a joke.

295
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,480
I was proud of not being alone.

296
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,480
Not asking about my mother's life,

297
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,480
I was happy to be a mother.

298
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,480
When I asked about my mother's life,

299
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,480
I was grateful to my parents.

300
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,480
I couldn't have any health care.

301
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,480
Why can't I be like the one who taught me since I was a child?

302
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,480
Mingzhe is very good.

303
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,480
There is a good Mingzhe.

304
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,480
Zhang Xuehui.

305
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,480
But in this world,

306
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
not everyone is like you.

307
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,480
The world is full of obstacles.

308
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,480
Liangbo's life is full of cold blood.

309
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,480
So you hate me for what I should do.

310
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,480
I never thought about giving up on you.

311
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,480
I also want to be a mother.

312
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,480
Why didn't you realize

313
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,480
you are the one who made the empress's bride?

314
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,480
Last time, I took the chance to rob Jiang Xuehui.

315
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,480
But this time, I already knew about the palace.

316
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,480
Why can't I change the last step?

317
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,480
No. I can't let it happen.

318
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,480
The palace is full of obstacles.

319
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,480
If my father finds out that someone is in the prison

320
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,480
and doesn't want to change the last step,

321
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,480
he will be in trouble again.

322
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,480
Didn't you tell him to find out this time?

323
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,480
You can't tell him about my gift.

324
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,480
It's been a few days. How is your hand injured?

325
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,480
It's in the camp. It's hard to get used to.

326
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,480
Who dares to hurt you in the camp?

327
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,480
A man of the five senses.

328
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,480
Although he is a thief, he is a good man.

329
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,480
He often comes to the camp to compare with me.

330
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,480
Speaking of this man,

331
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,480
there is something about him recently.

332
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,480
It's said that there is a horse that loves to fight.

333
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,480
It's a new weapon.

334
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,480
But one day, when he heard this horse was sick,

335
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,480
he rushed back to his mansion.

336
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,480
After he found out that it was a man of the six senses,

337
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,480
he killed this horse himself.

338
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,480
People asked him about his origin.

339
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,480
Guess what he said?

340
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,480
This horse is my confidant.

341
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,480
It's sick and panicky.

342
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,480
It's hard to get rid of it.

343
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,480
The first thing is to give it to him.

344
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,480
The second thing is to give it to him for many years.

345
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,480
Ling Ning, do you think he is a bit different from normal people?

346
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,480
You just tell the person who is with Zhu Ying Zhi

347
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,480
that his cancer is dying soon.

348
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,480
Let him come back and have a look.

349
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,480
Do you know this person?

350
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,480
How do you know?

351
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
Do you know him?

352
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,480
I heard that he is a man of the five senses.

353
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,480
I heard that.

354
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,480
But this Zhu Ying Zhi is my sweet-hearted aunt.

355
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,480
She grew up in the sweet-hearted.

356
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,480
Then she took me to the capital,

357
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,480
and then her father took me to the Ministry of Revenue.

358
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,480
She also took me to the Ministry of Revenue to enter the five senses.

359
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,480
Anyway, this person is a man of the five senses.

360
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,480
I think he is not simple.

361
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,480
As for the words of the horse, what do you think?

362
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,480
It's not a lie.

363
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,480
But he can kill his horse himself.

364
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,480
He can do half of the things he does.

365
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,480
I think he likes this horse so much.

366
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,480
But he can kill him if he wants to.

367
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,480
He is really a very bad man.

368
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,480
You should be careful with the people around him.

369
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,480
You are so worried.

370
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,480
Even if he really came with some purpose,

371
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,480
I am not afraid of the evidence that I am a bad man.

372
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,480
That's not what you said.

373
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,480
Okay, I won't talk about him.

374
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,480
Let's take a look.

375
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,480
I know you are lazy to be a coward.

376
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,480
Didn't your hand get hurt?

377
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,480
You can do this little thing even if your hand is broken.

378
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,480
What's wrong? You don't like to eat?

379
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,480
I know. I should buy you some examples.

380
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,480
No, I like it.

381
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,480
Then why don't you eat?

382
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,480
Forget it. You can eat if you don't want to.

383
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,480
I will bring you something else next time.

384
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,480
Tell me.

385
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,480
You are going to the palace to be a maid in the future.

386
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,480
Can you still be a guest in the new year?

387
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,480
How are you feeling?

388
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,480
Wait.

389
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,480
You just came back.

390
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,480
You know I am going to be a maid in the palace.

391
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,480
You told me that you are going to be a maid in the palace.

392
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,480
I told you that I am going to marry you.

393
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,480
You were curious about what you have never seen before.

394
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,480
You still want to know about the palace.

395
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,480
This time, you have a great chance.

396
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,480
How can I forget my life?

397
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,480
How about this?

398
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,480
I will be a good maid in the palace.

399
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,480
You are going to be a maid in the palace.

400
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,480
This is so beautiful.

401
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,480
It's so exciting.

402
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,480
You are happy.

403
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,480
You are talking about Mr. Xie.

404
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,480
It's just right time.

405
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,480
Let's go. I will take you to a place.

406
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,480
Let's go.

407
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,480
Let's go.

408
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,480
The music of the past life is so different from the past.

409
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,480
It's a great song.

410
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,480
It's a good song.

411
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,480
But unfortunately,

412
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,480
this is the second song of the past years.

413
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,480
Who am I?

414
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,480
It's not even a fake embroidery.

415
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,480
You can't even make a copy of the paper.

416
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,480
You can't even make a copy of my book.

417
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,480
I am afraid that you will be in trouble.

418
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,480
Lv Xie, you are a businessman.

419
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,480
You won eight classes.

420
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,480
Besides, you and Mr. Xie are the same class.

421
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,480
He is your brother-in-law.

422
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,480
He is your brother-in-law.

423
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,480
When he was in the meeting,

424
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,480
you are still brother-in-law.

425
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,480
You are the second in the past.

426
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,480
Am I wrong?

427
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,480
You bought it or not?

428
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,480
I will pay you.

429
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,480
You earned 880 yuan.

430
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,480
So expensive.

431
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,480
This money is 880 yuan.

432
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,480
I will use the rest of the money

433
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,480
to make a good embroidery.

434
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,480
Then I can go to the stupidity of the poor.

435
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,480
Lv Xie, you are too kind.

436
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,480
What?

437
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,480
You want to do it?

438
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,480
Lv Mo is a bad man.

439
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,480
He is in the Hanlin Academy.

440
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,480
The last one is about the most recent

441
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,480
Shengxian Book.

442
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,480
The standard gold is 500 taels.

443
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,480
The right hand one is about the change of the thousand-tenth-year-old.

444
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,480
The standard silver is 1000 taels.

445
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,480
It's up to you.

446
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,480
Can you beat him?

447
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
You are so rude.

448
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,480
I am ashamed to argue with you.

449
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,480
Let's go.

450
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,480
He is Lv Xie.

451
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,480
I often hear that

452
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,480
he is a lover of the past.

453
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,480
He can't buy or buy.

454
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,480
It's too dark.

455
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,480
It's too dark.

456
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,480
It's not expensive.

457
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,480
What's important is the good things.

458
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,480
Mr. Xie loves the Qin.

459
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,480
You learn the Qin in the palace.

460
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,480
Even if you are good,

461
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,480
even if you are strict,

462
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,480
you will be generous

463
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,480
when you see the Qin.

464
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,480
Prince, you are finally here.

465
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,480
I found five pieces of the original.

466
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,480
One of them is the new one

467
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,480
from the Gu Ben Yuan in Jiangning.

468
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,480
It's a pity that it's too late.

469
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,480
When I went there,

470
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,480
the original was already

471
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,480
given to Xie Juan.

472
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,480
He is a famous poet.

473
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,480
He is a Gu Xie.

474
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,480
I think he has to

475
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,480
give it to him for three years.

476
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,480
It's a gift.

477
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,480
Isn't it?

478
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,480
It's a good Qin.

479
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,480
I can buy it for a thousand taels.

480
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,480
I can sell it to you

481
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,480
for a hundred taels.

482
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,480
Xie Juan is a good man.

483
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,480
He is a good man.

484
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,480
He is a good man.

485
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,480
Ning Ning, do you like that one?

486
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,480
I play the same level.

487
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,480
I play the same level.

488
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,480
That one.

489
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,480
You are so good.

490
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,480
This Qin

491
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,480
is the mother of three hundred years ago.

492
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,480
It's a famous song.

493
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,480
It's a good song.

494
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,480
It's a good song.

495
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,480
And it's not expensive.

496
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,480
It's only three thousand taels.

497
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,480
It's him.

498
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,480
No.

499
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,480
Yan Lin,

500
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,480
it's too expensive.

501
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,480
You have already

502
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,480
given me so many things.

503
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,480
If you add this piece of Qin,

504
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,480
I can't pay it back.

505
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,480
What?

506
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,480
You just want to take my life.

507
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,480
You are so generous.

508
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,480
Miss,

509
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,480
inside.

510
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,480
Look.

511
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,480
This umbrella is useful.

512
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,480
There are so many places to find Qin Feng.

513
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,480
I'll go find a car.

514
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,480
Wait for me here.

515
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,480
Miss Jiang.

516
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,480
Fang Yin.

517
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,480
Why are you here?

518
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,480
But Yueyue bullied you again.

519
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,480
She didn't bully me.

520
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,480
I wanted to go to Jiang Fu to find Miss Cheng'er.

521
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,480
I didn't expect to meet her here.

522
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,480
This is the money you gave me last time.

523
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,480
Besides cooking,

524
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,480
my mother used it.

525
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,480
There are still many things left.

526
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,480
I'll return them to you first.

527
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,480
The rest,

528
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,480
I'll return them to you later.

529
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,480
It's yours after all.

530
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,480
Miss.

531
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,480
Take it.

532
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,480
You said this.

533
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,480
She didn't bully you.

534
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,480
Fang Yin,

535
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,480
do you still want to continue this life?

536
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,480
You used to be a mother.

537
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,480
You were careful everywhere.

538
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,480
But now,

539
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,480
you're gone.

540
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,480
Do you still want to

541
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,480
take yourself home?

542
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,480
But I...

543
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,480
Do I still have the choice?

544
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,480
If you trust me,

545
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,480
you can follow my instructions.

546
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,480
Although you can't leave the family,

547
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,480
you can't live long.

548
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,480
You can definitely change your fate.

549
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,480
Ning Ning.

550
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,480
Fang Yin.

551
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,480
Remember what I said.

552
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,480
Live well for yourself.

553
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,480
Let's go.

554
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,480
deserve it

555
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,480
Be with me.

556
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,480
And do as what I said.

557
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,480
We have to get there often.

558
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,280
Figure out what youcipe

559
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:41,320
Remember

560
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,240
Remember

561
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,480
things began

562
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,240
Think back

563
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,480
Everyone would think

564
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,480
that

565
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,480
we're the Clear经.

566
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,480
I know it clearly.

567
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,480
This Miss Jiang Er

568
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,080
is indeed going to the palace.

569
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,480
But I think her magic

570
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,600
seems to be wrong.

571
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,000
I know.

572
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,400
That's it?

573
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,600
What else?

574
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,040
Jiang Boyou is just a wolf.

575
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,280
He has nothing to do with your plan.

576
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,720
What is the reason

577
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,960
for you helping the princess

578
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,240
to send Miss Jiang Er off?

579
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,600
I think

580
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,720
Miss Jiang Er is very good-looking.

581
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,160
She's so humble

582
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,480
that she's not going to teach him.

583
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,400
She won't like him, right?

584
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,720
Mr. Lv is indeed a good-looking man.

585
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,200
But

586
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,200
what's the solution

587
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,360
for the old man's heart?

588
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,080
As you wish.

589
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,800
Then the entry of the account book

590
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,480
is also random.

591
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,160
You...

592
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,840
You know nothing.

593
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,680
I'm working hard to earn money for you.

594
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,600
You can't even leave me

595
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,840
a single penny.

596
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,760
W meanings

597
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,480
In my opinion,

598
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,140
endo doesn't have the easy money

599
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,200
to buy things.

600
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:53,640
But

601
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,440
sometimes

602
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,480
you also think

603
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,680
that

604
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,760
can't open more money than a 100 stone.

605
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,760
Fine.

606
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,600
I have just received money.

607
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,800
Do you have any more time

608
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,840
to talk about more?

609
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,700
I think this is more comfortable.

610
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,920
Oh well.

611
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,160
Your Majesty.

612
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,620
I heard an heightened stomach disorder.

613
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,660
She's not making a living.

614
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,360
It'll be good for her.

615
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,660
It'll be tasty.

616
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,040
Stop.

617
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,880
Yes.

618
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,120
Your Highness, what are you looking at?

619
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,680
Let's go.

620
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,760
Do you remember

621
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,080
the girl we met outside the temple half a year ago?

622
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,360
Be careful.

623
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:38,680
Go.

624
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,800
Go.

625
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,680
Miss.

626
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,920
Miss, are you all right?

627
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,160
Sir, are you all right?

628
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,800
I'm fine.

629
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,080
I'm not good at it.

630
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,080
I've lost my horse.

631
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,000
I'm really sorry.

632
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,480
Thank you for saving me.

633
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,960
Let's wipe it off first.

634
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,040
I was surprised by you.

635
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,120
You even thanked me.

636
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,360
I was surprised by the horse.

637
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,960
But you saved me.

638
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,960
You know what I mean.

639
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,120
Thank you for saving me.

640
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,320
This is Miss's nickname.

641
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,760
Sir, your clothes are dirty.

642
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,080
Why don't we change them?

643
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,920
The Buddha's family is a commoner.

644
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,240
They don't care about riding a horse or riding a horse.

645
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,240
They don't care about you.

646
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,120
They won't blame you.

647
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,040
The Buddha's heart is free.

648
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,360
He doesn't want to act.

649
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,680
You're thinking too much.

650
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,040
If you do that,

651
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,280
you won't be able to delay your work.

652
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,280
I'll take my leave.

653
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,680
Let's go.

654
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,840
Let's go.

655
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,400
I haven't seen him in a half year.

656
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,280
I even forgot his voice.

657
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,600
I should have asked his family name.

658
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,160
It's okay.

659
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,320
I'll go in.

660
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:36,840
Okay.

661
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,000
Miss, what's wrong?

662
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,600
I just seemed...

663
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,840
Forget it. It's nothing.

664
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,360
Let's go.

665
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,420
Lianmian's father-in-law

666
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:22,640
...mata a

667
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,640
Big Sister Fang panels.

668
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,320
What did you get?

669
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,240
You knew it right.

670
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,400
This is the advantage my father used when working away from comunity.

671
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,800
And he organised all the problems differently.

672
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,320
But I'll fine you.

673
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,640
Where is the place you are going to visit today?

674
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,640
I'll forget it.

675
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,480
Who am I?

676
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,520
I see you are the sister of the Duke of Dingyuan's Mansion.

677
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,680
You are...

678
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,920
The daughter of the Duke of Qingyuan's Mansion.

679
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,840
You're so kind.

680
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,960
I really envy you.

681
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,480
You are not only a princess,

682
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,080
but also a princess who likes you.

683
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,880
You are much younger than us.

684
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,080
You can also choose.

685
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:04,920
Young girl.

686
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,600
Come on.

687
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,720
Who's that sister?

688
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,920
How beautiful she is!

689
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,560
Who else?

690
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,240
Thatashed Jiang Xue Ning

691
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,920
carried out the gold king.

692
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,760
She did,

693
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,120
not like Royal非常.

694
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,080
You cannot imagine,

695
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,680
she is not an underhanded person.

696
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,680
I'm sure these people have nothing to do with it.

697
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,680
Two more are not here yet.

698
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,680
Please wait for a moment for Miss.

699
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,680
I'll take you to the palace later.

700
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,680
Eunuch, didn't you say that the city is the palace?

701
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,680
Miss, you're finally here.

702
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,680
Today is the day that Eunuch Huang came here personally.

703
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,680
I didn't tell you to tell me.

704
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,680
Empress Dowager, today I came here to see you all.

705
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,680
I came back to talk to the princess.

706
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,680
A'Xin, come here.

707
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,680
The palace is in the capital.

708
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,680
I went to pick A'Xin up.

709
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,680
Can you give me some time?

710
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,680
No, no.

711
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,680
Miss, please.

712
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,680
Okay, we're here.

713
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,680
Please leave the luggage to the palace.

714
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,680
We'll go to the palace with you.

715
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,680
Yes.

716
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,680
Miss, this way, please.

717
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,680
Let's go.

718
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,680
Look at this.

719
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,680
Go.

720
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,680
Let me see.

721
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,680
Over there.

722
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,680
Let's go.

723
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,680
Although you all have entered the palace,

724
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,680
you still have to be careful.

725
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,680
I'll take you to the palace.

726
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,680
Okay.

727
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,680
I'll go.

728
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,680
Okay.

729
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,680
Although you all have entered the palace,

730
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,680
you still have to pass the exam.

731
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,680
The exam is divided into three.

732
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,680
The etiquette, the fragrance, and the smell.

733
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,680
You can use the etiquette to examine you all.

734
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,680
I'm most afraid of exams.

735
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,680
You all are noble.

736
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,680
You don't have to be afraid of these.

737
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,680
Okay, it's getting late.

738
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,680
Please go to the exam.

739
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,680
Yes.

740
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,680
Why did I hit him again?

741
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,680
I'm still so serious and scary.

742
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,680
Miss Su looks so scary.

743
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,680
She even has a board.

744
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,680
She can't do it, right?

745
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:19,680
I heard that

746
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,680
Miss Su is a good girl.

747
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,680
But she even dares to eat the Empress.

748
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,680
We can't do this.

749
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,680
Today, the Shangyi Bureau ordered to teach you all

750
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,680
some etiquette in the palace.

751
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,680
You all call me Miss Su.

752
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,680
You all have to be careful

753
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,680
for the princess.

754
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,680
You have to be careful.

755
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,680
If anyone is a thief or doesn't know how to learn,

756
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,680
you'll have to leave the palace.

757
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,680
Yes.

758
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,680
Miss Su is always the most strict.

759
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,680
As long as I make a mistake on purpose,

760
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,680
I'll make a mistake.

761
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,680
As long as I can leave the palace,

762
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,680
I'll be fine.

763
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,680
I didn't expect that I'd be with you

764
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,680
in this kind of mess.

765
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,680
If Mr. Xie comes back,

766
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,680
we'll be doomed.

767
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,680
He's not good at reading.

768
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,680
He can't find the exam tomorrow.

769
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,680
He won't be able to pass the exam.

770
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,680
Don't look for it.

771
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,680
Why is it there?

772
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,680
It must be here.

773
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,680
Come here.

774
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,680
Hurry.

775
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,680
What are you doing?

776
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,680
The battle is going on.

777
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,680
The two legs are in a tight position.

778
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,680
They're in a tight position.

779
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,680
The waist is straight.

780
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,680
The head is a little bit down.

781
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,680
The hands are facing each other.

782
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,680
The body is in the waist.

783
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,680
Miss Jiang Er.

784
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,680
What's wrong?

785
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,680
Not bad.

786
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,680
It's really a great meal.

787
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,680
What's wrong with Su Shang Yi?

788
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,680
Can he endure it like this?

789
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,680
I'm sure I'm not strong enough.

790
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,680
Jiang Xuning.

791
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,680
Did you do it on purpose?

792
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,680
All right.

793
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,680
You can learn the next one.

794
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,680
Miss Jiang Er.

795
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,680
You're really...

796
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,680
Your Highness.

797
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,680
Your Highness.

798
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,680
Don't be so formal.

799
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,680
I'm here to see you.

800
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,680
It's good that you're here.

801
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,680
Jiang Xuning.

802
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,680
Have a seat.

803
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,680
I'm here to see you.

804
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,680
I'm here to see you.

805
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,680
I'm here to see you.

806
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,680
I'm here to see you.

807
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,680
I'm here to see you.

808
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,680
Have a seat.

809
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,680
Your Highness is here.

810
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,680
I'm here to see how Su Shang Yi is so biased.

811
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,680
Yes.

812
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,680
Miss Su.

813
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,680
Look.

814
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,680
She's broken the palace's stuff.

815
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,680
But the fairy is not so different.

816
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,680
She's so calm and calm.

817
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,680
Your Highness is right.

818
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,680
Miss Jiang Er is so confident.

819
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,680
She's so confident.

820
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,680
Jiang Xuning.

821
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,680
What kind of magic did you use?

822
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,680
How could you even use the power of the princess?

823
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,680
You're so good at this.

824
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,680
You're so good at this.

825
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,680
You're so good at this.

826
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,680
How could you even use the power of the princess?

827
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,680
You're so good at this.

828
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,680
Your Highness.

829
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,680
Miss You is right.

830
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,680
I grew up in the countryside.

831
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,680
I'm lazy and stupid.

832
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,680
I'm afraid I can't learn the etiquette in the palace.

833
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,680
I'm afraid I'll let you down.

834
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,680
Please let me go.

835
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,680
Is this enough?

836
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,680
I like you.

837
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,680
But the etiquette in the palace is just the way you are.

838
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,680
It's okay if you can't learn it.

839
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,680
I'll take care of it.

840
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,680
Miss Jiang Er can open the new door for you.

841
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,680
She must be so proud of you.

842
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,680
I saw you grow up.

843
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,680
I'm so happy to have a friend like you.

844
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,680
You've done a lot of good deeds to make you enter the palace.

845
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,680
Although I'm the one who took your name from the beginning,

846
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,680
I really want you to enter the palace.

847
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,680
But the rule of the capital is the same.

848
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,680
You can't be a半-doer if you haven't been born.

849
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,680
I've been a brother for a long time.

850
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,680
How do you think?

851
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,680
I treat you well.

852
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,680
Are you happy?

853
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,680
I'm so happy to have a friend like you.

854
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,680
I'm so happy.

855
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,680
I like you anyway.

856
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,680
If anything happens to you in the palace,

857
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,680
just let me know.

858
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,680
I'll go to see you tomorrow.

859
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,680
I'll see you tomorrow.

860
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,680
Princess Songzhang.

861
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,680
That's how things go.

862
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,680
I was wrong to go to the exam room.

863
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,680
The student is willing to be punished.

864
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,680
But I have to take the money to your highness.

865
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,680
Serves you right.

866
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,680
Today, I got the gold.

867
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,680
I lost 300 golds in a row.

868
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,680
I don't have any money left.

869
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,680
I don't have any responsibility

870
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,680
to take the money.

871
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,680
But I have a question.

872
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,680
I want to ask you a question.

873
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,680
Are you sure that you love me

874
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,680
as well as you love me?

875
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,680
I think it's not important.

876
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,280
You said that the gentleman has his own reasons and his own weaknesses.

877
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,960
I only do what I want to do.

878
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,160
I don't want to force you to do it.

879
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,200
Okay.

880
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,120
You guys go out.

881
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,200
Thank you, sir.

882
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,120
Let's go.

883
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,200
Do you know if you can see our acquaintance?

884
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,680
Help Nian Nian.

885
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,400
Don't be so impulsive. Let's go.

886
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,560
Let's go.

887
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:33,240
Why didn't my mother tell me that the palace is so bitter?

888
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,080
Who said it wasn't?

889
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,400
The elephant said that it was too bitter.

890
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,920
But who would have thought that a reasonable scholar would make us like this?

891
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,360
I don't know how bitter it would be to eat it.

892
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,160
Everything is difficult.

893
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,560
The princess is kind and kind. She is the best matchmaker.

894
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,080
It's good that the class is starting.

895
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:57,360
Uncle, I don't see much with the princess.

896
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,160
But I rarely see who she is good to.

897
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,040
This Miss Jiang Jia is just pretending for her.

898
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,320
How can the princess treat her like this?

899
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,560
If it's just pretending,

900
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,760
of course it's not like that.

901
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,200
The important thing is the words she said.

902
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,720
The words.

903
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:20,480
Xi, we can't say it in this life.

904
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,100
You're insane.

905
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:29,840
You dare to ask for the chantingydibromy.

906
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,300
Now Princess Jiang Jia is already flushed,

907
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,320
and she just does nothing.

908
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,240
The prince Dasi didn't promise anything to Only the two of you

909
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,720
can't finish the exam.

910
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:58,100
and

911
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:06,060
have

912
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,900
no

913
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,700
why

914
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,260
comments

915
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:26,480
but Management is no longer believing in splendor

916
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:50,260
I will never forget you

917
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:52,260
I will never forget you

918
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,260
I will never forget you

919
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:56,260
I will never forget you

920
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,260
I will never forget you

921
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,260
I will never forget you

922
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:02,260
I will never forget you

923
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,260
I will never forget you

924
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,260
I will never forget you

925
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,260
I will never forget you

926
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,260
I will never forget you

927
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,260
I will never forget you

928
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,260
I will never forget you

929
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,260
I will never forget you
