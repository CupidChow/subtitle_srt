What's the use of just rhyming?

46
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,460
There is no artistic conception

47
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,590
and it is illogical.

48
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:57,910
Mr. Zhao,

49
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,560
this sentence, "The deep mountains do not recognize flowers",

50
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,340
is especially confusing.

51
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,420
The first half is still about deep mountains,

52
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,230
but in a blink of an eye, it's about a court of darkness.

53
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,580
That instead sticks rather well to the question.

54
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,150
There's wind, moon,

55

Tell me,

93
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,800
where did you smuggle the things to?

94

Yan's troops

A few days ago,

they accused my son of being a rebel.

105
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,720
They threw him into jail and tortured him for answers.

106
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,740
My son vowed never to confess under torture.

107
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,490
They actually cut off my son's finger

108
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,480
and used it to threaten me.

109
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,120
I had no other choice.

110
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,490
If I refused,

111
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,810
my son's life will be in danger.

112
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:34,920
Are you foolish, Zhao?

113
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,610
If you had told us earlier,

Your son Zhao Xin's case

116
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:42,690
was handed over to the Ministry of Justice a few days ago.

117
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,159
Why did you continue to keep it a secret?

118
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,780
Stealing weapons is a capital crime.

119
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,310

120

You should be executed according to military law.

125

But,

126
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,520
I also failed to protect Zhao Xin,

127
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,050
and I failed Yan's troops.

128
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,380

Take stock of all the missing military supplies

133
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,180
within the barracks,

134
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,740
and make sure they are all recorded.

135
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,940
Then, order two or three light cavalry.

136

Take me and Zhao back to the capital.

about the entire incident.

139
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,320
Keep a close eye on the camp.

140
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,480
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

141
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,140
Yes.

142
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,590
There is big trouble!

143
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,260
Big trouble! Big trouble!

144

Mr. Wang

146
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,300
has volunteered to resign and return to his hometown yesterday.

147

He said he had limited knowledge

148
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,290
and could no longer teach the First Princess.

149
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,980
His Majesty has approved it.

150
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,460
He even transferred Mr. Zhao

151
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,220
to Ganzhou to be a court attendant.

152
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,770
A scholar at Hanlin Academy is at least a fifth-ranked official.

153
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,350
A court attendant is a sixth-ranked official,

154
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,560
and he is being sent to a remote place like Ganzhou.

155
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,630
How could someone like Mr. Zhao...

156
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,780
It's definitely true.

157
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,020
Otherwise, why would I say it's a big matter?

158
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,950
What do you think

159
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,960

Let me tell you.

164
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,090
She must have begged Her Highness

165
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,250
in order for this to happen.

166
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:19,910
Sister Xue,

167
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,200
you are closest to Her Highness.

168
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,600
You have to persuade her

00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,910
to not listen to the malicious slanders.

170
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,770
Alright,

00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,700
Miss Jiang is our classmate.

172
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,980
Why do we have to go against each other?

173
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,510
I think she's a nice person.

174
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,110
We should all get along well in the future.

175
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,560
Why are you also...

176
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,260
How is it that a small Hanlin Academy

177
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,820
has so many cronies?

178
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,140
A fifth-ranked scholar

179
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,310
can't even tell a good poem from the bad.

180
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,830
When I slightly probed into this yesterday,

181
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,290
I found out that he did not get his official position through legitimate means.

182
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,040
Now in the court,

183
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,870
I don't even know how many officials have colluded with each other.

184
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,270
Calm down, Your Majesty.

185
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,860
It's not appropriate to make a conclusion before we finish investigating.

186
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,480
However,

187
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,040
I also found out that

188
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,280
many of the memos drafted by the Hanlin Academy

189
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,140
are all related to the Xue family.

190
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,360
That is indeed my good uncle.

191
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,080
Look.

192
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,180
This is a report sent by the Ministry of Personnel this morning.

193
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,630
The position of the Minister of Justice has been vacant for a long time.

194
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,980
The Minister of Revenue retired and returned to his hometown.

195
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,450
Most of the candidates nominated by the Ministry of Personnel

196
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,450
have relations with the Xue family.

197
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,020
I can't make a decision.

198
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,990
Gu Chunfang, Investigating Censor of the Jibei Circuit,

199
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,140
was originally an official released by the Ministry of Justice.

200
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,400
He was also once Your Majesty's teacher.

201
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,610
Why don't we let him be the Minister of Justice?

202
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,789
Mr. Gu is indeed a suitable candidate.

203
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,600
He has no history with the Xue family

204
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,120
and he is free from any suspicion of alliance.

205
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,050
But for the Ministry of Revenue...

206
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,670
Your Majesty, what do you think of

207
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,070
the Vice Minister of Revenue, Jiang Boyou?

208
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,600
I heard that

209
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,680
among the study partners, there is a Miss Jiang,

210
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,410
who is Jiang Boyou’s daughter.

211
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,720
I also heard

212
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,680
you know Miss Jiang well.

213
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,110
It's just a teacher-student relationship.

214
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,310
We're not that close.

215
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,100
Forget it.

216
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,130
Although Jiang Boyou

217
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,260
cannot be considered as very capable,

218
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,120
but he is very cautious.

219
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,130
Official Xie, you have been good at reading people.

220
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,590
Let him take the position.

221
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,350
As you wish, Your Majesty.

222
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,030
What did you say?

223
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,010
You've been promoted?

224
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,460
Why is this so sudden?

225
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,300
A typical Vice Minister

226
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,220
will need to be sent out for at least three to five years,

227
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,820
before he can try for the position of a minister.

228
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,950
How did you get promoted for no reason?

229
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,390
This is so strange.

230
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,700
What do you think?

231
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,990
I find it strange too.

232
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,170
I thought

233
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,320
I would just end up retiring

234
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,420
in this position.

235
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,800
But I didn't expect to have

236
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,310
such an opportunity at the last minute.

237
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,380
Hui,

238
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,970
write a letter

239
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,930
to the palace

240
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,610
and ask what is going on.

241
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,520
Wait, wait, wait.

242
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,700
My Lady,

243
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,340
what kind of letter do you want to write?

244
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,800
Why can't I write a letter?

245
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,220
I just want to write a letter to Ning who is in the palace

246
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,280
and ask her to find out what happened.

247
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,300
My Lady,

248
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,680
what do you think this palace is?

249
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,660
Did you really think you can find out

250
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,060
whatever information you want?

251
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:20,940
Fine.

252
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,200
I won't ask.

253
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,180
But I can at least write a letter

254
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,110
and tell her to follow the rules in the palace, right?

255
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,420
You don't have to worry.

256
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,830
You have no idea.

257
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,030
I've been trying to arrange a marriage for Hui lately.

258
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,270
People who are interested in her

259
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,360
still find that our family's social status is a bit low.

260
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,390
Aren't you promoted now?

261
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,120
That changes things.

262
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,350
Maybe

263
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,450
it'll be greatly beneficial

264
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,710
to Hui's marriage.

265
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,780
At this critical moment,

266
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,630
I can't let the one in the palace

267
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,840
spoil our plans.

268
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,260
My Lady,

269
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,830
that is exactly why

270
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,180
you should avoid stirring up further trouble.

271
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,780
How am I stirring up further trouble?

272
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,540
Explain yourself clearly.

273
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,820
-Father, you have misunderstood Mother.
-You are now...

274
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,950
Mother is just being

275
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,500
concerned and confused.

276
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,140
Father, your promotion

277
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,660
will definitely make people jealous.

278
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,020
And with Sister in the palace,

279
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,020
we don't exactly know how many people are watching her.

280
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:12,730
Mother

281
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,230
is just worried that Sister does not know what is at stake.

282
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,100
That's why she wanted to write a letter to urge her.

283
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,100
Did you hear that?

284
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,870
Even Hui understands what I am trying to do.

285
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,200
I don't believe you're so kind.

286
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,700
Hui is still the only sensible one.

287
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,390
Besides,

someone engraved treacherous words on the Jade Ruyi Scepter

341
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,890
that was given to the Empress Dowager,

342
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,130
and stirred up the wrath of His Majesty.

343
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,500
These days, he has been investigating all of us,

344
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,030
and cleaned up many people.

345
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,460
The Yangzhi House is also a place in the palace.

346
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,780
We are just carrying out a routine search

347
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,220
based on His Majesty's orders,

348
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,150
and the Empress Dowager's decree.

349
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,220
How is this routine?

350
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,170
You guys are clearly treating us as criminals.

351
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,890
When I was a study partner then,

352
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,420
there was no such incident.

353
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,410
Did something happen again?

354
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,350
Sir,

355
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,310
I found this in Miss Jiang's room.

356
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,380
Miss Jiang, how dare you

357
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,120
collude with the rebels in the palace!

358
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,610
There's a curfew. Get out of the way!

359
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,140
Let's go.

360
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,410
Go home!

361
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,220
Get going! Move!

362
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,180
There's a curfew!

363
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:15,710
There's a curfew!

364
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,850
Hurry pack up and go home.

365
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:17,670
Go back!

366
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:18,950
Hurry up!

367
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:21,860
Move away!

368
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,010
Your Royal Highness,

369
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:24,860
His Majesty has ordered that

370
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,320
the whole city is placed under curfew to search for rebels.

371
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,230
I dare not disobey.

372
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,550
Didn't you hear me?

373
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,120
My father's illness has relapsed.

374
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,580
I need to find a physician.

375
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,440
I've informed

376
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,140
the Duke about His Lordship's illness.

377
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,790
The imperial physician sent from the palace will be here soon.

378
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,990
Please calm down, your Royal Highness.

379
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,820
Eunuch Huang is slinging mud at me.

380
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,750
When did I collude with the rebels?

381
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,810
How dare you deny it even up till now?

382
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,320
Look carefully. What is this?

383
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,570
[How innocent are the 300 Loyal Souls? How dare the mediocre Emperor call himself the Son of Heaven?]

384
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,540
We have solid evidence.

385
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,070
What else do you have to say?

386
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,830
This is not mine.

387
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,730
I found it in your room.

388
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,580
How dare you say it's not yours?

389
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,060
According to Eunuch Huang,

390
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,420
my room is in this palace.

391
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,579
This piece of paper was found in my room,

392
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,300
and hence it was found from within the palace.

393
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,410
Therefore, who should be blamed?

394
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,270
What nonsense!

395
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:15,400
I think you won't give up until you see the coffin.

396
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,839
I must let you know today that

397
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,329
this palace

398
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,900
is not a place where you can do whatever you want.

399
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,359
Guards!

400
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,790
Take her to the Office of Punishment.

401
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,050
How dare you!

402
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,339
I am an honorable daughter of a minister,

403
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,180
and the study partner personally chosen by the First Princess.

404
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,610
Who are you to take me away?

405
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,220
Just because I'm the Chief of Internal Affairs?

406
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,090
Am I not qualified?

407
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:34,890
Of course not.

408
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,410
The Chief of Internal Affairs

409
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,090
is in charge of affairs within the palace.

410
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,490
But I'm neither a consort

411
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,540
nor a palace maid.

412
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,250
You have no right to punish me.

413
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,010
But it was the Empress Dowager who ordered the investigation.

414
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,520
Then let the Empress Dowager question me personally.

415
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,320
Eunuch Huang,

416
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,860
seeing that you're a senior in the palace,

417
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,380
I thought I would share a few words with you.

418
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,750
If the Office of Punishment wants to take me into custody,

419
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,620
I am just a weak woman who cannot resist.

420
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,220
But please think it through.

421
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,100
If I am proven innocent later,

422
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,460
but something happens to me while I am with the Office of Punishment,

423
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,720
will you be able to take responsibility?

424
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,460
Since you can't make the decision,

425
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,180
go find someone who can make the decision.

426
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,040
Please pass a word to Tai'an Hall.

427
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,430
Tell them that Jiang Xuening was wronged

428
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,390
and framed,

429
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,150
and ask that the Empress Dowager herself to judge and decide.

430
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,450
How can there be assassination for no good reason?

431
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,380
Where is Lyu Xian?

432
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,890
Didn't I ask him to watch the Yan and Xue family?

433
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,320
Where is he?

434
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,900
Mr. Lyu pretended to meet them on his way out of town to buy goods,

435
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,450
and he has helped Royal Highness send the people back to the Yan Mansion.

436
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,490
He then went to find Physician Liu.

437
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:25,010
He will be fine.

438
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,050
His Lordship is old.

439
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,610
His body is filled with injuries he sustained on the battlefield.

440
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:28,940
I am just worried just in case something goes wrong.

441
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,810
Is the carriage ready?

442
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:30,810
Dao Qin is preparing it.

443
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:31,340
But Sir,

444
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,910
if you rush there tonight,

445
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,210
your concern for the Yan family will be exposed.

446
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,330
If Xue Yuan knows about it,

447
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,060
he will definitely target you.

448
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,490
Why don't you let me...

449
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,750
Something is strange.

450
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,180
Xue Yuan is not someone who is impulsive and foolish.

451
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,330
If he dares to hurt others,

452
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,730
he must have a backup plan.

453
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:46,830
If I don't make a trip there personally,

454
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,290
I would be really worried.

455
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,020
Sir, bad news.

456
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,700
Xingwu Guards dispatched large troops,

457
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,090
claiming that there's a party of rebels outside of the city,

458
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,490
resulting in a curfew within the city.

459
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,610
Lyu Xian went to find Physician Liu

460
00:18:58,610 --> 00:18:59,580
but he was stopped in the clinic

461
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,650
and not allowed to leave.

462
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,760
He came prepared.

463
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,740
He deliberately prevented the physician from entering the mansion.

464
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,270
Jian Shu,

465
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,220
go get the token given to me by His Majesty.

466
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,410
I'll personally bring someone in.

467
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:07,790
Yes.

468
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:08,900
And Sir,

469
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,860
news came from the palace

470
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,380
that something has also happened

471
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,180
to Miss Jiang.

472
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:13,810
What?

473
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,740
[Yangzhi House]

474
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:27,550
Xue Ning,

475
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,220
exactly what happened with that piece of paper?

476
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,170
How did you get yourself

477
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,910
involved with such a matter?

478
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,490
You dying alone is not enough,

479
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:35,730
and instead insisted on dragging us all along.

480
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:36,850
What kind of logic is that?

481
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,780
The paper was found from your room.

482
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,210
What does it have to do with us?

483
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,290
If someone wants to harm me,

484
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,170
I would naturally take some backups with me.

485
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,210
You want me to fall into this trap unknowingly?

486
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,430
Don't even think about it.

487
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,680
What do you mean?

488
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,460
Are you suspecting us?

489
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,170
If you are innocent,

490
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,610
there's nothing to be afraid of.

491
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,580
This incident stemmed from Yangzhi House.

492
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,980
No one can escape anyway.

493
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,140
Instead of being blamed for it,

494
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,090
why don't we

495
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,370
go to the Empress Dowager's place and discern what happened?

496
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,780
That's a good suggestion.

497
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,360
There's nothing to fear if we haven't done anything wrong.

498
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,140
Everything will be cleared up once we can explain what happened.

499
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,340
I think the Empress Dowager

500
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,540
is not someone indiscriminate either.

501
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,700
The Empress Dowager has given orders

502
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,290
to immediately take her to Tai'an Hall,

503
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,750
so that she can interrogate her personally.

504
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:20,840
Miss Jiang,

505
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,870
the Empress Dowager has given orders

506
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,070
to take you to Tai'an Hall immediately.

507
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,940
Her Majesty wants to interrogate you personally.

508
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,620
Eunuch Huang,

509
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,490
does that mean we can go back now?

510
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:29,370
The Empress Dowager said

511
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,050
all the study partners should also be there.

512
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,040
Since it's an interrogation,

513
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,660
we should interrogate clearly,

514
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,570
lest some people remain unconvinced

515
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:36,570
and unsatisfied.

516
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,260
Let's go then.

517
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,200
Aren't you going to restrain me?

518
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,130
I dare not.

519
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,660
Sir, please have mercy.

520
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,580
My wife is giving birth,

521
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,690
and we have nine generations of a single lineage.

522
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,220
It all depends on this baby.

523
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:04,170
Could you

524
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,370
please just let us go over?

525
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,870
We're under orders.

526
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,550
Not to mention your wife,

527
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,460
even if your mother gives birth,

528
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:15,660
you'd better stay here.

529
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,060
You...

530
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,210
You came at the right time.

531
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,410
Show them your token.

532
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,260
I see it's Mr. Xie.

533
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,200
Sir,

534
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,060
the city is not safe tonight.

535
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,990
Why are you here?

536
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,530
I have something to attend to in the palace.

537
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,490
Mr. Lyu is my good friend.

538
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,750
I seek your mercy

539
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,710
and to do me this favor.

540
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,500
Well?

541
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:53,920
No?

542
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,020
Sir, you may not have an idea.

543
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:56,670
We are just

544
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:59,580
following up on orders to investigate the rebels.

545
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,930
If the higher-ups blame us...

546
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:01,560
By order?

547
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,170
Whose order?

548
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,890
Was it His Majesty, or was it Duke of Xue?

549
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,020
As far as I know,

550
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,210
His Majesty has handed Rebels Case to the Ministry of Justice.

551
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,670
When did it become the task of Xingwu Guards?

552
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:17,170
Sir,

553
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,900
Junior Preceptor Xie is going into the palace.

554
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,610
If he mentions this in front of His Majesty,

555
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,690
I'm afraid it'll be harder to explain to the Duke.

556
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,040
Step aside.

557
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,010
Sir, please hurry up!

558
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,730
My wife can't wait.

559
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:43,750
Hurry up.

560
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,450
The outside of Yan Mansion is filled with Xingwu Guards.

561
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,650
I'll ask Dao Qin to take you in secretly.

562
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,580
We must make sure the Marquis of Yan remains safe.

563
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,260
I need to go to the palace,

564
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:05,880
and I will be back as soon as possible.

565
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,940
I'm afraid you can't leave this time.

566
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,840
His Lordship's injury

567
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,920
is not that simple.

568
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,440
What do you mean?

569
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,170
His Lordship has been fighting in wars for many years.

570
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,690
How can an ordinary arrow wound cause such a high fever?

571
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,090
I'm afraid the arrowhead

572
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,040
could have been tainted with poison.

573
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,660
This doesn't seem to be ways of the Xingwu Guards.

574
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,520
Instead, it looks like the ways of

575
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,130
Gongyi Cheng

576
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,740
Greetings, Your Majesty.

577
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,580
Your Majesty,

578
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,210
I carried out your order as you have asked,

579
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:46,250
and thoroughly searched the palace grounds.

580
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,330
But when we searched Yangzhi House today,

581
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,490
I found this in Jiang Xuening's room.

582
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,060
It was stuck between the pages of a book on the bookcase.

583
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,290
If we don't search carefully, it was so well-hidden that

584
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,750
we might not have found it.

585
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,950
[How innocent are the 300 Loyal Souls? How dare the mediocre Emperor call himself the Son of Heaven?]

586
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:07,040
Such evil rumors have reached the palace.

587
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,170
Aren't you something?

588
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,650
What's your purpose of

589
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,610
asking to see me in the middle of the night?

590
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:16,830
Your Majesty,

591
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,810
I'm just a nobody.

592
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:21,010
How could I collude with the rebels?

593
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,450
Also, the handwriting on this paper

594
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,770
is definitely not mine.

595
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,860
The scripts that I wrote in Fengcheng Hall these couple of days

596
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,010
could be used as a reference.

597
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:28,890
Your Majesty, please investigate this thoroughly.

598
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,410
Although I don't know why this piece of paper

599
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,120
appeared in my room,

600
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,220
this is definitely not my doing.

601
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:37,260
You are completely leaving yourself out of the entire picture.

602
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,280
I'm innocent.

603
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,040
I have a clear conscience.

604
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:43,220
Well, this is a very different attitude

605
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,820
from when you first greeted me.

606
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:47,980
Is your father

607
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,940
the new Minister of Revenue,

608
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,180
Jiang Boyou?

609
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:53,530
Yes.

610
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:55,860
I heard that

611
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,510
the Jiang family

612
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,380
has close relations

613
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,120
with the Yan family.

614
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,380
You and Yan Lin

615
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:06,590
seem to also be very affectionate with each other.

616
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,010
Your Majesty, please investigate it thoroughly.

617
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,210
This rumor is false.

618
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,370
Members of the Yan family is highly noble.

619
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:15,050
It is not a place I can rise to.

620
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,180
Nonsense!

621
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,610
You are just short of discussing marriage with Yan Lin.

622
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,410
You still want to hide it from me?

623
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:22,840
Shu,

624
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,850
what does this have to do with Yan Lin?

625
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,220
The Empress Dowager has her own judgment.

626
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,610
We should be careful with our words.

627
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,330
The Empress Dowager is insisting on

628
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,770
dragging the Yan family into this mess

629
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,010
without good intentions.

630
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,740
I must not get Yan Lin involved.

631
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,340
But if in this palace,

632
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,090
the truth is completely up to them,

633
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,890
how can I clear the suspicion between me and the Yan family?

634
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:42,690
Eunuch Huang.

635
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,150
Yes, Your Majesty.

636
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,020
Take her away

637
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:45,830
and cane her

638
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,450
until she confesses.

639
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,190
Let's see

640
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,670
whether she is tougher

641
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:51,690
than the cane.

642
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:53,830
Yes.

643
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,450
Who dares to touch me?

644
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,490
What are you trying to do?

645
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:03,810
Your Majesty,

646
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,250
according to the laws of this dynasty,

647
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,770
the harem is not allowed to interfere in politics.

648
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:09,000
Your Majesty can punish the harem according to the law,

649
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,530
but I'm not from the palace.

650
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,970
If in accordance with the law,

651
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,170
and if the matter involves the Rebels Case,

652
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,770
it should be investigated by the previous dynasty.

653
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,460
How could Your Majesty abuse your authority?

654
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,000
Are you scolding me?

655
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,290
I dare not.

656
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:21,730
Although I may not be respected the same way as Your Majesty,

657
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,610
I am also the daughter of a minister.

658
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,800
In the history of the State of Qian, there have been many lawsuits against powerful people.

659
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,480
I ask that either His Majesty gives his approval to put me into prison,

660
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,140
or that we ask the Ministry of Justice

661
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,570
to investigate with a trial.

662
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:33,140
Your Majesty, you want to torture me

663
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,490
with just a piece of paper.

664
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,770
Aren't you afraid of being notorious for beating people into submission,

665
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,200
and make all the former ministers anxious?

666
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,460
How dare you!

667
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,000
Guards!

668
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:40,490
Yes.

669
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:41,380
If the daughter of a minister

670
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,180
dies in the palace for no reason,

671
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,030
it will become a tricky issue.

672
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,410
Even if you want to brush it off,

673
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:50,250
I'm afraid no one in the previous dynasty will let it go.

674
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,010
I know

675
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,820
what Your Majesty wants is the truth,

676
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,570
not a corpse of unknown origins.

677
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,280
What a sharp-tongued mouth.

678
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:14,950
It seems that

679
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,890
I can't punish you.

680
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:19,970
Well then, let's find someone who can deal with you.

681
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:20,450
Guards!

682
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:21,220
Yes.

683
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,570
Take my token to the Ministry of Justice

684
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,410
and find someone who can judge the case.

685
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,410
But Your Majesty,

686
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,130
the Ministry of Justice's office is in the south.

687
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:28,850
I'm afraid

688
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,490
it will take at least two hours.

689
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,890
Well then, let's all wait

690
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,060
together with Miss Jiang.

691
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:35,500
Yes.

692
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:52,730
I...

693
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,500
thank Your Majesty for accommodating.

694
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,250
If it were handed over to the Ministry of Justice,

695
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,380
at least Yan Lin wouldn't be involved.

696
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,070
It will be worth it

697
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:09,710
even if I have to withstand some torture.

698
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,210
It hurts.

699
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,310
It hurts!

700
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:15,440
Let go. Let go!

701
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:16,120
Let go!

702
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,820
What Jade Ruyi Scepter? What Miss Jiang?

703
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,750
You have to make it clear to me.

704
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:21,880
Mr. Xie said

705
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,680
you are to enter the palace and meet the Empress Dowager immediately.

706
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,590
He said you are to investigate the case of the Jade Ruyi Scepter

707
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,930
and to protect Miss Jiang.

708
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:29,120
As long as the case drags beyond tonight, he'll have his own plans. Hurry up!

709
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,450
Isn't this ridiculous?

710
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,410
I am not in the right position for this.

711
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,880
Will Empress Dowager let me investigate the case?

712
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,800
Let me think about it.

713
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,610
Think no more.

714
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:40,810
This is the token given by His Majesty

715
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,340
to enter the palace freely.

716
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,390
-Don't think too much, Mr. Chen.
-I...I...

717
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,320
We are not going to make it if we are any later.

718
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,470
Let me think. I...

719
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:48,170
Mr. Chen,

720
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,530
there is someone from the palace.

721
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,060
Mr. Chen,

722
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,110
you are on duty today.

723
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,710
[Ministry of Justice]

724
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,540
Her Majesty has orders.

725
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,640
Please come with me to the palace.

726
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:14,610
She single-handedly caused all the trouble,

727
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:15,940
yet we are all suffering with her.

728
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,400
What kind of logic is that?

729
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,970
Didn't you hear what the Empress Dowager said?

730
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,100
If it weren't for Miss Jiang,

731
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,420
we would all be suspects.

732
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,960
Of course we can't leave at will.

733
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,760
Sister Fang Miao,

734
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,420
don't you have the ability of foresight?

735
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,540
Can you tell whose paper it is?

736
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,010
Why are you still thinking about

737
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,120
calculating at this time?

738
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,740
Grow up!

739
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,900
You have been kneeling for two hours.

740
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,270
Aren't you tired, Miss Jiang?

741
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,610
Your Highness,

742
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,100
I am indeed tired.

743
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,370
But this is a matter of life and death.

744
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:45,510
I dare not slack off.

745
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,400
I heard that

746
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,480
the methods of interrogation undertaken by the Ministry of Justice

747
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,200
would strip off three layers of skin from a living person.

748
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,730
No matter how sharp you are,

749
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,210
I'm afraid

750
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:58,040
it won't be of any use.

751
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,000
As the old saying goes,

752
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:02,880
for the ideals that I uphold in my heart,

753
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,270
I will not regret even after dying a thousand times.

754
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,870
As long as I can clear my name,

755
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:10,000
and not be slandered by someone with ulterior motives,

756
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,530
so what if I suffer a little?

757
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,930
I see you won't give up until you see the coffin.

758
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:15,410
Fine.

759
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,040
Let me see

760
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,710
how long more

761
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,440
can you last.

762
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,930
Your Majesty,

763
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:28,530
he's here.

764
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:33,520
Vice Minister of Justice, Chengyan Mengzhao.

765
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,050
Greetings, Your Majesty.

766
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:39,270
[Supervising Secretary for the Division of Criminal Justice, Zhang Zhe]

767
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:36,230
I am...

768
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,600
Supervising Secretary for the Division of Criminal Justice, Zhang Zhe.

769
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,060
Greetings, Your Majesty.

770
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:01,560
The Supervising Secretary for the Division of Criminal Justice

771
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,800
is just a seventh-ranked official, right?

772
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,770
Your Majesty,

773
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:07,130
Mr. Zhang has handled half a year's worth of accumulated cases

774
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,440
in the short time since

775
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,390
he joined the Ministry of Justice.

776
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,010
He is a talented man.

777
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,880
I'm afraid I am limited in my abilities to resolve your problems,

778
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,520
and keep Your Majesty waiting.

779
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,250
So I brought Lord Zhang with me.

780
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,320
Did you already know about the case

781
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,750
on your way here?

782
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,940
Yes, we have been briefed.

783
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,770
Well then, the two of you shall investigate this thoroughly.

784
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:27,430
I want to see

785
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,890
exactly what kind of person is behind this.

786
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:33,570
May I ask where is the evidence of today's case?

787
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,040
Mr. Chen, please take a look.

788
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:45,870
Mr. Zhang, have a look too.

789
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,240
This is Bailu paper,

790
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,820
in a regular letterhead size,

791
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,570
and the handwriting features a regular script.

792
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:54,620
On my way here,

793
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,130
I took a look at the inscription rubbings from the Jade Ruyi Scepter,

794
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:59,130
and it is indeed the same as the contents of this letter.

795
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,250
Do you mean that

796
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,020
whoever who has this

797
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:04,520
will definitely be related to the rebels?

798
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,520
Not necessarily.

799
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,400
The evidence is so clear,

800
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:09,250
yet you are still uncertain.

801
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,070
What's your intention?

802
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,690
Matters related to the rebels are complicated.

803
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,730
The law says that there is no crime without evidence.

804
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,710
We cannot convict someone based on a piece of paper alone.

805
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:21,170
We need to find out the truth before we can determine anything.

806
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:24,290
You are indeed an upright official.

807
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,810
That's for sure.

808
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:27,270
May I ask

809
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:30,220
who, when, and where was this item found?

810
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,350
I was searching the palace on Her Majesty's orders.

811
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,650
At 10 PM tonight,

812
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,000
I found this in the room of Jiang Xuening at Yangzhi House.

813
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,220
The room is very big. Exactly where is it?

814
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,250
It was stuck in between a book that was on the bookcase.

815
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,580
It was hidden very well.

816
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:48,730
If we hadn't searched carefully,

817
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,380
I doubt we would have found it.

818
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,310
What book was it?

819
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,170
This...

820
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,520
Sir,

821
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,610
I can't read.

822
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,290
I only remembered that

823
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,000
there were four words on the book.

824
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,210
I only recognize one word, "talk".

825
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,050
Where is the book? You didn't copy them?

826
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,100
He's asking you.

827
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:06,710
This...

828
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,240
It's "Weilu Poetry Talks".

829
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:13,810
[Weilu Poetry Talks]

830
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,780
This is the only book on my bookcase.

831
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:13,640
I was just reading it

832
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,250
two hours before Eunuch Huang

833
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,780
came to conduct the search.

834
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,480
The other things that were on the bookcase were just some brushes, ink and paper,

835
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,540
hence I could remember this clearly.

836
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,880
Your Majesty,

837
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,230
I think this lady doesn't look well.

838
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,450
Can you allow her to get up first?

839
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,320
I'm afraid she'll faint

840
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:31,050
in the middle of the interrogation,

841
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,110
and delay the case.

842
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,990
Well...

843
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:38,120
as long as she doesn't demolish my Tai'an Hall, that will be good enough.

844
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:39,860
Get up.

845
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,280
Yes.

846
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,880
Please investigate thoroughly, Sir.

847
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,880
This paper has nothing to do with me,

848
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,760
and it is not my handwriting.

849
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,040
There is no evidence.

850
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,370
How can you prove it?

851
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:14,090
I can testify for Miss Jiang.

852
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:18,770
Your Majesty,

853
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:19,710
Mr. Zhang,

854
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,920
I know a little about calligraphy.

855
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,679
Miss Jiang initially wrote with a cursive script.

856
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:27,050
Although she has been learning to write in the regular script,

857
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:29,280
she's just like a toddler learning how to walk,

858
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,340
and is unlikely to be able to write something like this.

859
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,610
Thank you, Miss Xue.

860
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,090
Although what this lady said carries some weight,

861
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:38,370
it is still possible to imitate handwriting.

862
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,969
Let's put that aside for now.

863
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,170
Eunuch Huang.

864
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,380
Mr. Zhang.

865
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,770
Who else knows that

866
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,880
you were going to Yangzhi House today?

867
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,199
This is a serious matter.

868
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,530
I am also afraid that there might be spies hiding in advance,

869
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,770
so I dare not disclose this ahead of time.

870
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:53,800
Only a few eunuchs know about it.

871
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:55,110
However...

872
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,730
The Ministry of Justice is asking.

873
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,130
Just answer truthfully.

874
00:34:59,290 --> 00:34:59,760
Yes.

875
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,380
However, I received the orders from Her Majesty at 5 PM,

876
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,160
and we started the search from the Western Palace.

877
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,190
By the time we reached Yangzhi House, it was 9 PM.

878
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,040
There were four hours in between.

879
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,500
Perhaps, there was a leak.

880
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,630
Eunuch Huang,

881
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,060
where are the staff of Yangzhi House?

882
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,360
Since such a big incident has happened,

883
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,490
they have been detained according to the palace rules.

884
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,550
That's not enough.

885
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,870
All the visitors of Yangzhi House,

886
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,140
and also

887
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,080
those palace maids who were still around

888
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,690
from 5 to 9 PM,

889
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,850
should be detained for interrogation.

890
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,190
Mr. Zhang, it seems like

891
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,590
you are trying to prove that she was indeed framed?

892
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,720
Why don't you first question

893
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,980
the most suspicious person?

894
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,000
Calm down, Your Majesty.

895
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,890
If we want to prove that this piece of paper

896
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,290
is related to Miss Jiang,

897
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,890
it is actually not difficult.

898
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:45,920
You have an idea?

899
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,930
The palace strictly examines all items going in and out.

900
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,570
When a study partner enters the palace,

901
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,250
her items must be checked before she can bring it in.

902
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,600
So unless Miss Jiang

903
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,520
bribed the guard who inspected,

904
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:00,450
this page of slanderous words must have originated from the palace.

905
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,160
Three reams of Bingyi paper.

906
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,110
[Imperial Household Department]

907
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,900
Two reams of Bailu paper.

908
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,330
There are rules for all paper products in the palace.

909
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:12,810
One must not burn it in private.

910
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,760
Even if it has been used, it must be kept aside.

911
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,420
The controls are very strict.

912
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:26,120
This page is written on Bailu paper that is from the palace.

913
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,930
How much was delivered to each person in Yangzhi House,

914
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,120
and how much they used,

915
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,320
the Imperial Household Department should have records.

916
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:36,010
If Your Majesty suspects that

917
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,480
this was written by Miss Jiang,

918
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,730
and it is related to the case of the Jade Ruyi Scepter,

919
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:42,040
why don't you give an order to retrieve the records from the Imperial Household Department

920
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,800
and check against the paper count in the Yangzhi House.

921
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,240
If Miss Jiang's paper count doesn't match

922
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,740
and it is short of a few,

923
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,460
her suspicion for this crime will be greatly enhanced.

924
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,010
Zhang Zhe has always been cautious.

925
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:57,110
But what he said is not quite right.

926
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,150
Is he trying to...

927
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:02,450
Shu, is something wrong?

928
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:03,720
Nothing.

929
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,240
It is indeed quite an alternative approach

930
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,120
to be investigating from the paper itself.

931
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,370
I just think

932
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,660
it's a bit too hasty

933
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,000
to conclude just based on the paper count.

934
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,360
Mr. Zhang is such a brilliant judge.

935
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,760
Maybe he has his reasons.

936
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:20,670
That’s a good idea.

937
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:22,730
Eunuch Huang.

938
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,360
I’ll go investigate it now.

939
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,160
Wait a minute.

940
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:28,080
Yangzhi House is a residence for the ladies after all.

941
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,550
Checking paper is a trivial matter.

942
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,320
Since there were palace maids who were previously detained,

943
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,050
why don't we ask them to assist?

944
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,680
After all, they have served the study partners

945
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,880
and know them better.

946
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:37,030
It's getting late.

947
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,370
It's inconvenient for me and Mr. Chen

948
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:40,440
to enter the grounds for our investigations.

949
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,500
I'm afraid it'll drag on for too long.

950
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,300
Do as Mr. Zhang said.

951
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,350
Yes.

952
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:54,250
Your Majesty, please allow me to wait outside.

953
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:55,810
Permission granted.

954
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:00,180
A girl's residence is delicate

955
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,520
and very private.

956
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,540
Mr. Zhang specially ordered palace maids to assist in the investigation.

957
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,880
I wonder if he is afraid of offending

958
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,760
any particular lady from the Yangzhi House.

959
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,560
How annoying.

960
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:09,570
Don't you dare

961
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,580
be rude in front of Her Majesty.

962
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,200
Mr. Zhang, give me some background.

963
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,560
Miss Jiang does seem to look like

964
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,230
she has been wronged.

965
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:20,450
Mr. Chen, do you really care?

966
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:21,750
Of course.

967
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,360
We are called upon to judge

968
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,040
such a big case as the Ministry of Justice.

969
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,600
As the Vice Minister, I should be concerned about it.

970
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,290
Otherwise,

971
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:30,400
I wouldn't have brought you along.

972
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:32,900
You brought me along

973
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,280
only because you're worried that the truth

974
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,090
is not what the Empress Dowager wants.

975
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,880
If the Empress Dowager points fingers,

976
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,680
then someone can take the blame.

977
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,330
These words from you...

978
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,250
I'm your superior after all.

979
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,250
How can I let you bear the blame alone?

980
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,290
It doesn't matter.

981
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,750
I only care about the case.

982
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,480
The truth

983
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,330
will reveal itself later.

984
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,770
Here comes His Majesty.

985
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,780
Greetings, Your Majesty.

986
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:58,530
Rise.

987
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,090
I have heard the report from Tai'an Hall,

988
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,810
and have a general idea of what happened.

989
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:03,760
How is the investigation going?

990
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,010
I am right at the critical moment.

991
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,440
I've sent people to Yangzhi Hall

992
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:11,240
to check the paper count against the records from the Imperial Household Department.

993
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,920
Physician Liu,

994
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,720
how is Father?

995
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,450
He's finally stable.

996
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:40,730
After this, he must take the medicine on time

997
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:41,870
and rest well.

998
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,380
Thank you, Physician Liu.

999
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,730
Thank you, everyone.

1000
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:48,880
All right.

1001
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,760
Let me see Physician Liu out.

1002
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,970
Thank you for keeping my secret today.

1003
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,040
You didn't tell Viscount Yan

1004
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,920
that the Marquis of Yan was poisoned.

1005
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,560
I was once indebted to you.

1006
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,730
I will of course fulfill your request.

1007
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,620
Actually, His Lordship's arrow wound wasn't deep,

1008
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,350
but the poison on the arrow is very toxic.

1009
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:22,510
I've never seen such poison before.

1010
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,770
It is all thanks to the antidote recipe that you gave me.

1011
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:28,000
I still have to thank you, Physician Liu.

1012
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,460
Dao Qin,

1013
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,860
send Physician Liu out secretly.

1014
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:31,350
Yes.

1015
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,690
Physician Liu.

1016
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:33,690
This way, please.

1017
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,360
Although the truth about the poison is now withheld,

1018
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,700
can Yan Lin

1019
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,880
simply let the assassination of His Lordship go?

1020
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,940
Without evidence,

1021
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,960
he will only be falsely accused

1022
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,040
by the Xue family.

1023
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,130
I will make him stay put for now.

1024
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,200
Judging from what happened today,

1025
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,080
it was indeed done by the Xue family.

1026
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,540
But the poison on the arrow

1027
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,010
came from the lineage of Lord Pingnan.

1028
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,100
It looks like Gongyi Cheng

1029
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:00,980
has already

1030
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,400
placed men among the Xue family's assassins.

1031
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,000
He wants to use Xue Yuan’s plan

1032
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,640
to get rid of the Marquis of Yan.

1033
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,700
I’m afraid Xue Yuan

1034
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:09,930
becomes someone else's arrow

1035
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:11,120
without even realizing it.

1036
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:11,850
Indeed.

1037
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:14,640
But Gongyi Cheng works in the dark, while we work in the light.

1038
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,770
He knows who you are.

1039
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,670
When we act,

1040
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,000
we inevitably have to be more cautious.

1041
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,800
Get Dao Qin to find Gongyi Cheng.

1042
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,510
I must see him.

1043
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,890
We made a big fuss today.

1044
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,490
Have you thought about what to do tomorrow?

1045
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:31,370
If His Majesty finds out that you interfered with the Yongyi Mansion,

1046
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:33,370
he would demand for an explanation.

1047
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,170
Don't worry.

1048
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,720
I have my own considerations.

1049
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,140
Sir.

1050
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,570
Why are you here?

1051
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,720
What is the situation like in the palace?

1052
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,850
What a coincidence.

1053
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,440
When I was about to send

1054
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,040
Chen Ying into the palace just as you ordered,

1055
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,990
the Empress Dowager had also

1056
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:50,760
sent someone to ask the Ministry of Justice to investigate the case.

1057
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,090
This way, we didn't have to use your token.

1058
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:54,410
Ning'er

1059
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,470
is not the type to sit and wait.

1060
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,820
She must have figured out a way to make things worse.

1061
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,750
With the Ministry of Justice taking over the case,

1062
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:05,280
it spoils the set up of those who have no good intentions in the palace.

1063
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,460
Not dealing our cards according to the opponent's logic,

1064
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,840
is the beginning of breaking through the entire ploy.

1065
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,320
Chen Ying said he wouldn't know how to investigate the case.

1066
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,640
He initially didn't want to go,

1067
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,760
but Zhang Zhe happened to also be on duty at the Ministry of Justice.

1068
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,320
Chen Ying knew he's an expert in solving cases,

1069
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,650
so he brought him along.

1070
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:18,560
Zhang Zhe?

1071
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:25,260
Calm down, Your Majesty.

1072
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,120
It's just the rebels spreading these terrible rumors.

1073
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,720
It will all be eradicated very soon.

1074
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,460
It's not worth being angry.

1075
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,520
Even His Majesty is shocked.

1076
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,800
You are so capable.

1077
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,080
Your Majesty,

1078
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:37,000
as long as the rebels are still alive,

1079
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,520
the people in the palace live in fear and trepidation.

1080
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,360
His Majesty and Your Majesty have been worried sick about this,

1081
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,690
and it's only right I share the same worry.

1082
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:47,920
Your Majesty,

1083
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:48,850
Her Majesty,

1084
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,080
I followed your orders and checked the paper count of Yangzhi House.

1085
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,160
The Imperial Household Department confirmed that

1086
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,210
they supplied 16 reams of Bailu paper.

1087
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:55,840
The First Princess then ordered

1088
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,700
to add an additional ream of Bailu

1089
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,550
-and Bingyi paper for Jiang Xuening.
-Cut the crap.

1090
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:00,960
Just say if there was missing paper.

1091
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,560
There was.

1092
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,100
We happened to be one piece short.

1093
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,180
The evidence is solid.

1094
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:08,580
Now tell me,

1095
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,630
where is the missing piece of paper?
