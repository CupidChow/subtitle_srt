these are supplies and medicine stored by the rebels in the temple.

You need to apply the medicine immediately.

00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:45,630
the person standing in front of me right now,

86
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:44,380
Miss, Mr. Xie asked me

to take you to rest.

88
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,030
I picked some clean clothes

89

from the resources we have in the temple.

90
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,070

93
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,350
just go ahead.

Xue Dingfei is also on your side?

97
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,170
Kind of.

98
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,810
Miss Jiang said

99
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,280
Yongding Pharmacy didn't receive any support from the court.

100
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,940
What you told me in the capital

101
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,940
was a lie from beginning to end.

102
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,410
You don't want me to leave Tongzhou alive.

103
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,460
Do you think

104
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,310
your life is important

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,770
to me in this

107
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,950
I am indeed insignificant.

108
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,050
But once I return to the capital alive,

109
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,510
I will become your threat.

110
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,600
So...

111
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,470
That's why I want to kill you?

112
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,770
You think too highly of yourself.

113
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,020
I never said

114
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,530
I’m a saint.

115
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:50,380
But

116
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,409
in troubled times, if one wants to stabilize the court,

117
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,830
one must appoint extreme people

118
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,030
to do extreme things.

119
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,230
Xue Dingfei and Xiao Bao are rebels.

120
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,060
How can I make this public

121
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,700
before I have trusted you?

122
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,110
But along the way,

123
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,950
didn't they secretly

124
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,490
protect you?

125
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,490
Have you thought about it?

126
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,030
Feng Mingyu can send gunpowder

127
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,490
into Tongzhou quietly.

128
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,880
How many imperial officials are involved in this?

129
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,170
If you think

130
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,630
after returning to the capital,

131
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,560
just by reporting about my crimes,

132
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,390
it'll bring peace to the world,

133
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,660
you can do that.

134
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,720
But to me,

135
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,680
we've always been wanting the same thing.

136
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,680
It's just that

137
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,000
we chose two different paths.

138
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,710
I admire you

139
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,190
and I don’t want to be your enemy.

140
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,510
But as to what you want to do,

141
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,460
is up to you.

142
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,370
Wait.

143
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,010
One more thing.

144
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,150
Miss Jiang was forced to get involved.

145
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,920
-Please don't–
-Ning'er is my student.

146
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,120
I'll take care of her.

147
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,250
You took care of her on the way.

148
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,200
I should thank you.

149
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,480
But

150
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,040
I have something

151
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,390
to ask you.

152
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,570
Who is Ning'er

153
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,450
to you?

154
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,130
What do you think

155
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,060
about Ning'er?

156
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,110
Such words will harm Miss Jiang's reputation.

157
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,750
-Please don’t–
-She’s a fool.

158
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,590
All her thoughts are written on her face.

159
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,310
It's fine that others can't see it.

160
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,310
Do you, Zhang Zhe,

161
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,920
really not know?

162
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,710
What goes on between Miss Jiang and I,

163
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,409
is just between us.

164
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:35,940

165

to talk to me about this?

166
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,520
-Because I’m her teacher–
-You are her teacher.

167
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,680
But I am now free.

168

You...

169
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,270
When you were in the capital,

170
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,670
if you were really worried about her,

171
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,710
you shouldn't have taken her out of the capital.

172
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,780
Today, it's because of you,

173
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,520
that she's in danger.

174
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,720
You're a noble man.

175
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,590
You have both loyalty and filial piety.

176
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,850
But for love,

177
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,830
what one needs is putting their whole heart into it.

178
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,230
If you have any concerns,

179
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,100
then stop provoking her anymore.

180
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,800
Otherwise,

181
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,400
I don’t mind

182
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,740
really killing you.

183
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:19,000
You're so arrogant that you can do everything in the world.

184
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,050
But Miss Jiang is a human.

185
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,730
You can't control her.

186
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:23,530
Really?

187
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,940
Hurry up, everyone!

188
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:40,549
-Yes.
-Yes.

189
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,630
Check all the materials in the temple.

190
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,030
Okay.

191
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,360
Everyone, work harder.

192
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,450
Hurry up!

193
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,130
Yes.

194
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,860
I ran away twice and got caught twice.

195
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,650
How lucky.

196
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,190
General.

197
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:53,600
Here.

198
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,560
Duke Xue wants to lead Xingwu Guards down the mountain for medical treatment.

199
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,990
But all the roads have been buried.

200
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,710
They can only return to the temple.

201
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,260
We have to treat them.

202
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,720
Why are you dawdling? I'm dying from pain.

203
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,780
Where's everyone?

204
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,290
Can't you see I'm injured?

205
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,110
Where's everyone?

206
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,930
Is this how Yan's troops heal people?

207
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,940
You really have a bunch of losers.

208
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,150
What are you doing?

209
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,010
Stop it!

210
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,330
You are bold.

211
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,780
Are you Yan's troops

212
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,780
used to

213
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,790
disrespecting your superior and rebelling?

214
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,150
Duke Xue, how dignified you are.

215
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,330
But may I ask

216
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,660
who escaped just now?

217
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,470
Who was the one

218
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,310
who caused trouble right now?

219
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,740
You're just a guard.

220
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,440
How dare you raise your voice towards me?

221
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,820
Don't be angry, Duke.

222
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,570
His Majesty has handed Yan's troops over to me.

223
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,790
If there's anything,

224
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,340
you can talk to me.

225
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,720
You were a civil official.

226
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,210
How can you manage military affairs?

227
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,160
What happened today almost caused a disaster.

228
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,620
That should be enough to tell.

229
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,120
Thank you for your advice.

230
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,130
I’m not capable enough.

231
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,100
It's all thanks to the Yan's troops' brave operation.

232
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,390
But it's strange.

233
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,830
I made an appointment to meet you in Tongzhou.

234
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,600
But why did I meet you here?

235
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,470
My father is just eager to eliminate the rebels.

236
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,670
Does he have to listen to you on this too?

237
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,250
Duke is highly ranked.

238
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,140
Of course not.

239
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,830
But I will tell His Majesty

240
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,180
everything that happened today

241
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,880
to ask for a verdict.

242
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:52,360
Let's go.

243
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,390
Mr. Dingfei!

244
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,030
Where are you going?

245
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,040
The Yan's troops has no leader now.

246
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,600
It's already unstable.

247
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,950
If the Xue family finds a chance to attack us,

248
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,990
the consequences will be unimaginable.

249
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,320
So for the next few days,

250
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,680
let's stay on the low.

251
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,570
Understood.

252
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,020
Sit.

253
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,430
But

254
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,380
Marquis Yan

255
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,310
investigated the case of the stolen weapons in the camp.

256
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,910
The information is pointing to Xingwu Guards.

257
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,700
Now that the Xue family is here,

258
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,510
I’m afraid they will enter the barracks

259
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,900
and destroy the evidence.

260
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,180
I came here

261
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,000
to find out the truth.

262
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,400
Please

263
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,400
prepare relevant evidence

264
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,740
and give it to me.

265
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,680
Understood.

266
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,880
Only one part of the rebels'

267
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,350
gunpowder has been detonated.

268
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,950
It didn't cause much damage,

269
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,070
but the rocks that fell from the mountain

270
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,000
blocked the way down the mountain.

271
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,360
I've sent someone to repair the roads.

272
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,910
But end of the year is coming,

273
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,150
and there are many things going on.

274
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,010
These few days,

275
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,270
we can only ask you to stay here in the temple.

276
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,200
There's no rush.

277
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,240
I will just leave it to General.

278
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,500
Sir, he is here.

279
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,630
I'll go make the arrangements.

280
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,070
Just let me know if you need anything.

281
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,900
Dao Qin, send General off for me.

282
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,410
Please.

283
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,040
Did you hear that clearly?

284
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,190
I followed him secretly.

285
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,250
I heard it clearly.

286
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,780
Junior Preceptor Xie's man

287
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,180
did call him Mr. Dingfei.

288
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,230
Did you see

289
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,280
whether there is a

290
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,910
crescent-shaped scar behind his ears?

291
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,030
Why are you being so anxious?

292
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,550
I'm just going to the toilet.

293
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,380
Don't be afraid.

294
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,310
I won't run away.

295
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:04,990
Really.

296
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:08,620
Yes!

297
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,450
There was indeed a crescent-shaped scar.

298
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,080
Did you find out who he is?

299
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,060
I heard

300
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,030
he seems to be a spy that Junior Preceptor Xie

301
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,360
planted among the rebels of Lord Pingnan.

302
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,750
In this chaos,

303
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,420
he has contributed a lot.

304
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,190
All right, you may leave.

305
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,250
Don't tell anyone about this.

306
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:31,590
Yes.

307
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,150
How is he still alive?

308
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,480
Xiao Bao told me

309
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,030
Zhang Zhe is suspicious of your identity

310
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,890
because made a slip of the tongue.

311
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,690
I-it was just a slip of tongue.

312
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,950
How would I know a low-ranking official of the Ministry of Justice

313
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,110
would be so hard to deal with?

314
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,910
I asked Xiao Bao to pass my order to you,

315
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,750
telling you to kill Zhang Zhe in the process.

316
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,880
Why didn't you do it?

317
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,630
I testified to Feng Mingyu

318
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,040
that he was Mr. Dujun.

319
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,230
If I did something conflicting then,

320
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,160
wouldn't it prove that I was lying?

321
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,690
When I return to Jinling,

322
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,490
how can I report to Lord Pingnan?

323
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,910
You still want to go back to Jinling?

324
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,720
I wouldn't dare.

325
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:15,870
You killed Feng Mingyu.

326
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,970
Of course I'd follow you.

327
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,750
It's just killing Zhang Zhe.

328
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,450
I'll go now.

329
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,390
I'll make you satisfied.

330
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:21,950
No need.

331
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,220
Is it because of Miss Jiang?

332
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,070
You saw she was willing to

333
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,620
risk her life for Zhang Zhe

334
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,690
and you got scared?

335
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,810
I asked you here

336
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,560
not to talk nonsense with you.

337
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,910
Now that Feng Mingyu is dead in Tongzhou,

338
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,230
Lord Pingnan will definitely take action.

339
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,230
The war is coming.

340
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,750
You can't be indecisive.

341
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,890
Have you thought about

342
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,170
what we should do next?

343
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,480
I'm not you.

344
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,000
I don't have your ability and wits.

345
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,850
I just want to live

346
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,300
everyday in luxury.

347
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,870
The path you want to walk on is too dangerous.

348
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:05,470
I dare not.

349
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,780
Lord Pingnan wants to use

350
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,390
Xue Dingfei's identity to do things.

351
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,340
But he is worried that I will betray him.

352
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,670
That's why he asked you to be a substitute.

353
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,720
But you and I both know the ending of a subsitute.

354
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,270
Once it's done,

355
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,570
you'll die.

356
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,610
But if you come to me,

357
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,140
there might be a chance of survival.

358
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,210
When I finish what I should do,

359
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:32,050
I can leave Xue Dingfei's identity to you.

360
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,310
But if you don't want to be Xue Dingfei anymore,

361
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,570
you can come and go freely.

362
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,290
Enough.

363
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:47,950
Think about it.

364
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,270
Before you leave Tongzhou,

365
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,270
give me an answer.

366
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,110
Mr. Zhang,

367
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,200
may I come in?

368
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:10,270
Come in.

369
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,150
General Yan said

370
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,310
the mountain road was blocked.

371
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,260
We need to stay here for a few more days.

372
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,270
I'm afraid that it's inconvenient for you to eat

373
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,310
since you hurt your arm,

374
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,510
so I brought it to you.

375
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,010
Thank you, Miss Jiang.

376
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:30,320
What did you talk to Junior Preceptor Xie about this afternoon?

377
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,320
Nothing.

378
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,760
Just some business.

379
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,610
Although Sir has an unpredictable personality,

380
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,220
he is righteous

381
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,240
and is a good man.

382
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,160
I know

383
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,310
there are many things that don't make sense along the way.

384
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,890
But he saved us today.

385
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,150
So can you

386
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,400
not tell those things to the court?

387
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,190
What’s the relationship between you

388
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,650
and Junior Preceptor Xie?

389
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,430
Teacher and student.

390
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,610
Is that all?

391
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,530
In the capital prison,

392
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,230
I should have given up my mission

393
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,290
and left you there.

394
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,480
But I was ordered by His Majesty

395
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,390
and got you involved.

396
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,310
It’s my fault.

397
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,240
I apologize to you.

398
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,430
This is a rare opportunity.

399
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,930
You're doing this for the country.

400
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:22,990
How can I blame you?

401
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,869
I was in danger today.

402
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:27,000
You risked your life to save me.

403
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,190
When Junior Preceptor had his arrow aimed at me,

404
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,390
it was also you who risked your life to save me.

405
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,340
But what I did

406
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,750
is nothing compared to what you did.

407
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,890
I feel very guilty.

408
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,350
You saved my life

409
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,910
during the Jade Ruyi Scepter case.

410
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,110
At Yan Lin's Coming-of-Age Ceremony,

411
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,220
you stood up for us.

412
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,490
If you didn’t agree

413
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,070
to investigate the rebellion case for Yan family

414
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,230
and gave them justice,

415
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,560
you wouldn't have to get involved in this.

416
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,630
I should be the one

417
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,550
who should feel guilty towards you.

418
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,820
Miss Jiang, you don't have to do this.

419
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,580
It’s my duty

420
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,060
to find out the truth.

421
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,520
As the poem goes,

422
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,940
"If you give me a melon,

423
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,550
I will return the favor with a jade."

424
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,880
With how you treated me,

425
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,440
I won’t let you down.

426
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,030
As long as Junior Preceptor Xie doesn't do anything to harm the court,

427
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,160
I can not speak of it.

428
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,170
Because...

429
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:11,660
I trust you.

430
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:17,660
Let's eat.

431
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:36,500
Sir.

432
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,500
The effect of Golden Stone Pills should have worn off.

433
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,580
You need more rest.

434
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:41,890
I know.

435
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,040
I'll sit here for a while.

436
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,050
Bring my cloak.

437
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:46,250
Yes.

438
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,620
Duke.

439
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,200
Why are you here so late?

440
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,640
Ye will join the army in the future.

441
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,160
His leg can't be injured.

442
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,300
So you should go to the temple

443
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,400
and get me the best injury medicine.

444
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,160
Got it.

445
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:19,840
Look carefully!

446
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,090
I have your Crown Prince!

447
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,270
Xue Yuan!

448
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:24,860
Stop now!

449
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,580
If you don't stop now,

450
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,890
I'll kill him!

451
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:30,470
Father...

452
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,240
Father.

453
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,140
How dare you lie to me with a fake?

454
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:42,400
Xue Yuan!

455
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:43,990
Retreat now!

456
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,700
And hand over the real Crown Prince!

457
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,450
Otherwise,

458
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:50,150
I'll let you experience the pain of losing your son too!

459
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,510
My son

460
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,040
lives for the State of Qian,

461
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,960
and should die for the State of Qian too.

462
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,950
You want to use him to threaten me?

463
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,060
Dream on!

464
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,360
Father...

465
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,410
Sir.

466
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,440
Are you okay?

467
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,390
You look pale.

468
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,380
Where are Jian Shu and the others?

469
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,380
I'll go find them.

470
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,250
When you see me around,

471
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,500
you're so skittish. Like a mouse meeting a cat.

472
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,070
How did you get the courage

473
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,170
to go get soldiers from the barracks to save Zhang Zhe today?

474
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,260
That's because

475
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,940
human life is at stake.

476
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,040
In one's life,

477
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,590
one should prioritize oneself

478
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,320
then others.

479
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,960
Don't you understand that?

480
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,860
You are always

481
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,450
careful in the palace.

482
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,340
I thought you were smart.

483
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,910
Why are you taking

484
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,670
even your own life so lightly today?

485
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,410
Do you remember what I told you

486
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,810
when you first entered the palace?

487
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,740
You told me to behave

488
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,830
and not to make you angry.

489
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,360
If it weren't for me,

490
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,650
you would have died ten times.

491
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,080
Ning'er.

492
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,530
Are you so concerned about Zhang Zhe?

493
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,530
That you want to die with him?

494
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:28,720
I...

495
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,980
Say something!

496
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,830
You're usually sharp-tongued.

497
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,230
Why do you pretend to be deaf and mute

498
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,360
when it comes to him?

499
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,790
I do want to listen to you.

500
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,130
But what about you?

501
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,490
Do you dare to say

502
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,590
that you never planned to kill Mr. Zhang?

503
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,990
You have many connections

504
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,580
with the rebels.

505
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,190
Since you killed Gongyi Cheng,

506
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,360
you've been setting things up.

507
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,260
Step by step.

508
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,940
Everyone is your pawn.

509
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,630
You can abandon them anytime.

510
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,220
And kill them.

511
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,790
Tell me then.

512
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,400
Who did I use?

513
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,270
You used Mr. Zhang to investigate the case.

514
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,470
You used Xiao Bai and Xue Dingfei to implement the plan.

515
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,280
You used Feng Mingyu to go against Xingwu Guards.

516
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,350
And you used Yan's troops to complete your plan.

517
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,480
When you asked me to enter the palace,

518
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,890
you wanted to use me too,

519
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,800
-to help you save the Yan family, right?
-Shut up!

520
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,170
The truth is right in front of me.

521
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,390
I have to believe it.

522
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,670
I'm timid.

523
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,150
I didn't want to get involved with you.

524
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,120
On my way here,

525
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,250
you've been moody.

526
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,900
I can never see through you.

527
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,090
But even so,

528
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,260
I still think

529
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,020
you are a good person.

530
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,350
If you are a good person,

531
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,500
then you can't kill the innocent.

532
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:33,730
Jiang Xuening.

533
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:34,710
Listen.

534
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,810
Zhang Zhe is a good man.

535
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,250
But I'm not.

536
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,270
Ning'er, remember this.

537
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,950
In this world,

538
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,390
the bad should be killed.

539
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:46,860
Much less

540
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,500
the dumb.

541
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,410
No matter whether you want to get involved or not,

542
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,870
you're already by my side.

543
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,150
If there is a next time,

544
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,440
you get involved and ruin my plan again,

545
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,950
I'll take your life.

546
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,590
♫How much do I have to give♫

547
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,150
Sir!

548
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:09,020
♫In exchange for the love I deserve♫

549
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:16,810
♫I thought letting go was the best choice for memory♫

550
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,160
Get lost.

551
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,770
♫Lend me a breeze♫

552
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:24,290
♫To pursue the unsolved dream♫

553
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:32,340
♫But it disappeared as the snow fell♫

554
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:33,440
Sir.

555
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,390
How do you feel?

556
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:36,870
Sir?

557
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,590
The Cold Toxin is too deep in his body.

558
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,110
We don't have many medicine in the temple.

559
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,710
We should go back to the capital to recuperate.

560
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,950
I'll find another way down the mountain.

561
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:02,480
Maybe there's still hope to leave here early.

562
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,320
As long as we tell General Yan Liu about the situation,

563
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,430
he will agree to let us go back to the capital first.

564
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,070
Don't tell anyone about this.

565
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,980
I can't fall.

566
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,720
Go get some painkillers.

567
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,380
But sir...

568
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,810
-Your body...
-Go.

569
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:17,510
Yes.

570
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,850
If it weren't for me,

571
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,510
you would have died ten times.

572
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,480
Are you so concerned about Zhang Zhe?

573
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,010
So much so that you want to die with him?

574
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,430
I was in danger today

575
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,640
you risked your life to save me.

576
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,640
When Junior Preceptor had his arrow aimed at me,

577
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,640
you also risked your life to save me.

578
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,640
But what I did

579
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,660
is nothing compared to that.

580
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,610
I feel guilty.

581
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,530
What kind of feelings

582
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,500
do I have for Zhang Zhe now?

583
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,630
Do I feel guilty because of the fact that

584
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,140
we couldn't be together previously?

585
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,940
Or is this what I'm really feeling right now?

586
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,060
Thinking about it,

587
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,270
along this way,

588
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,380
many things have not changed.

589
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,280
If I insist on being with Zhang Zhe,

590
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,380
wouldn't it be the same?

591
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:22,880
There's one point that

592
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,350
Xie Wei is right about.

593
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,940
If he hadn't arrived in time,

594
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,220
not only me,

595
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,000
I'm afraid everyone would've died.

596
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,870
Should I... go give in?

597
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,720
After all, we are teacher and student.

598
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,020
Now that I think about it,

599
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,680
he has always treated me well.

600
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,700
Mr. Lyu said everything is fine in the capital.

601
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,840
Chen Ying has made a report about Tongzhou.

602
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,900
He will submit it soon.

603
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,500
Minister Jiang visited Xie Mansion a few days ago.

604
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,330
He said...

605
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,040
What did he say?

606
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,710
He asked when Jiang family's Second Young Lady will return to the capital.

607
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,440
Miss Jiang's birthday is at the start of the year.

608
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,770
The year is coming to an end.

609
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,470
They're asking if she is able to make it back to the capital for her birthday.

610
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,010
The mountain road is blocked.

611
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,610
We can't go back before the New Year.

612
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:16,520
That's right.

613
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,090
When the mountain road is cleared,

614
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:20,350
she can go home herself and make up for it.

615
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,180
Sir.

616
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,510
Can I come in?

617
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,020
Come in.

618
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:33,940
What is it?

619
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,190
I said something I shouldn't have said yesterday

620
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,270
and made you angry.

621
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,700
I'm here to apologize.

622
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,960
It was not my intention

623
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,590
to create chaos in Tongzhou.

624
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:45,150
But I caused you a lot of trouble because of this.

625
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,150
I know I was wrong.

626
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,230
You know you're causing trouble?

627
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,130
Sir's health is ruined because of you too.

628
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,310
How dare you.

629
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,550
It's cold today.

630
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,080
You'd better not go out.

631
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,350
It's most important to recuperate.

632
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,180
I know

633
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,340
my own body.

634
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:03,770
Is there

635
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:05,450
anything else?

636
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,580
Let me remind you on behalf of your father.

637
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,820
There are many people watching.

638
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,810
Put your reckless mind away.

639
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,690
If you are still rational,

640
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,650
don't cause any more trouble.

641
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,800
I understand.

642
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:22,270
Yan's troops will need a few days to repair the road.

643
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,660
If you need any daily necessities,

644
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,470
look for Xiao Bao.

645
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:28,530
Sir.

646
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,530
Go get Xue Dingfei

647
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,350
and Xiao Bao.

648
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:48,690
Yes.

649
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,350
Mr. Zhang.

650
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:58,990
General Yan.

651
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,510
What happened?

652
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,340
I heard that you're good at solving cases.

653
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,140
I'm here today

654
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,360
to ask you

655
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,410
for a favor.

656
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:07,510
What is it?

657
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,040
Please help me

658
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,340
find out the truth of the theft of military weapons in Tongzhou

659
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,140
and clear the Yan family's name.

660
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,410
What did you ask us here for?

661
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,550
Minister Jiang asked Lyu Xian to send a message here.

662
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,470
He said Ning'er's birthday is coming.

663
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,470
You mean you want to celebrate Miss Jiang's birthday?

664
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,980
The Xie Ju'an I knew

665
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,310
is not someone

666
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,640
who'd care about such trivial things.

667
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,760
In such a situation,

668
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,830
you still want to celebrate a lady's birthday.

669
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:45,710
It's not normal.

670
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,830
Absolutely not.

671
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:48,330
Could it be...

672
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:54,310
There are many formal things to do outside.

673
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,800
But none of them can be entrusted to you.

674
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,400
Things are complicated in the temple.

675
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,920
This is a small matter.

676
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,430
Just make whatever preperations you want.

677
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:04,830
-If it’s not convenient–
-It is!

678
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,990
How is it not convenient?

679
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,150
That bandit Feng Mingyu

680
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,950
left a lot of items in the temple.

681
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,900
It's more than enough to prepare a feast.

682
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,580
How about this?

683
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,580
Let's split up.

684
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,750
You prepare the banquet.

685
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,280
And I'll invite Miss Jiang.

686
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,430
Since it's her birthday,

687
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,550
I'll prepare some gifts

688
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,510
to be delivered to her too.

689
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,040
Go ahead.

690
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,070
I... I'll prepare some gifts too.

691
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,800
Xue Dingfei.

692
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,850
Have you thought about

693
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,010
what I asked you last time?

694
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,650
I've thought about

695
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:34,940
what you said.

696
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:36,990
It makes sense.

697
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,660
At this point,

698
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,080
I can only trust you.

699
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,920
When I return to the capital,

700
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,120
I'm at your disposal.

701
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:44,940
Anyway, to me,

702
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,440
as long as I can live,

703
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,350
it doesn't matter what I do.

704
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,530
Get back to work.

705
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:03,830
You family's Third Young Lady is involved in the Rebels Case?

706
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,260
Sir,

707
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,550
please take a look at this first.

708
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:14,640
[Earl You's daghter Fangyin is gentle and rule-abiding. Now, she is temporarily imprisoned for being involved in the Rebels Case.][Investigation has shown that this is a mistake. You family's daughter is innocent. This letter is the proof. She should be released for return to her mansion immediately.]

709
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,030
I used some of my connections

710
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:14,980
to ask the wife of Duke Xue to write a note.

711
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,250
What rebels?

712
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,240
Just take it as a joke.

713
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,890
We are all prestigious families.

714
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,160
Please

715
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,570
release my daughter immediately.

716
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,790
Duke is not in the capital recently.

717
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,460
I...

718
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,370
I can't decide on my own.

719
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,680
If Duke Xue knew that

720
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:36,110
you cheated money from my mansion,

721
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,160
your official position will...

722
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,330
Please come with me.

723
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,130
Mr. Zhou.

724
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,320
Young man.

725
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:52,730
Is Mr. Xie in?

726
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:53,900
He's not.

727
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,110
Did he say when he will be back?

728
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,910
I have something important to tell him.

729
00:30:58,910 --> 00:30:59,770
He didn't tell us.

730
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:00,970
We don't know either.

731
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:01,830
How about this?

732
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,890
Inform him.

733
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:05,010
Tell him it's about Miss You Fangyin.

734
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,960
Go now. Don't just stand there.

735
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,850
I heard you mention

736
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:14,730
You Fangyin?

737
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,350
What happened?

738
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,160
Since you knew

739
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,910
there's something wrong with Xingwu Guards,

740
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:26,110
why didn't you tell His Majesty directly?

741
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,110
During that time,

742
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:29,590
the Yan family was framed by the Xue family.

743
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,720
They were involved in the Rebels Case.

744
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,200
Even if Marquis Yan submitted a report,

745
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,060
how would His Majesty believe it?

746
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,560
Duke Xue has been coveting Yan's military power for a long time.

747
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,520
He must be prepared.

748
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,310
Without enough evidence

749
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,060
to bring him down and convict him,

750
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,990
I'm afraid we will get ourselves in trouble instead.

751
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,350
Is there any witness and evidence in the barracks?

752
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,960
Zhao is dead.

753
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:53,960
But the record of military supply is still there.

754
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,150
When the mountain road is fixed

755
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,280
I can bring it to you.

756
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,340
Okay.

757
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,440
Are you agreeing to it?

758
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:02,320
About the fight between Yan and Xue,

759
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:05,290
there's still one thing I don't understand.

760
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,760
You want to ask about

761
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,370
Viscount Dingfei, right?

762
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,730
I wasn't following Marquis Yan 20 years ago.

763
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,720
I don't know what happened exactly.

764
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,430
His Lordship rarely talks about what happened back then.

765
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,370
What I know

766
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,440
might be similar to what you do.

767
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,060
If this person in the temple

768
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,460
is really Viscount Dingfei,

769
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,510
His Lordship will be very happy

770
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,540
to know.

771
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,210
I have one more thing.

772
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,020
Please answer honestly.

773
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,780
Are you here today

774
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,360
on Junior Preceptor Xie's arrangement?

775
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,020
Junior Preceptor Xie has been working hard for Yan family.

776
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:43,820
He did that to get Marquis Yan back to the capital as soon as possible.

777
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,890
Don't worry, General.

778
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,430
Since there's something wrong about this case,

779
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,830
I will find out the truth.

780
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,320
I just want to ask you

781
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,350
to send a message to Junior Preceptor Xie.

782
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,270
I won’t

783
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,840
report about him.

784
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,490
We'll talk about it after my investigation on the Xue family.

785
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,350
Please ask him to do what he's supposed to

786
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,610
and don't do anything suspicious again.

787
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,960
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

788
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,740
What do you think?

789
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,670
Do you like them?

790
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,550
These are all found

791
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,720
around Shangqing Temple.

792
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,670
Though they might not be great things,

793
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:19,270
at least no one has used them.

794
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,440
It's not bad.

795
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,030
Why did you suddenly give me these?

796
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,780
Isn't your birthday coming?

797
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,390
How did you...

798
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,040
Sir told me to prepare it.

799
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:32,580
Help me thank Sir for his kindness.

800
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,660
But I don't like to celebrate my birthday.

801
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,430
Take these back.

802
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:37,760
You don't like them?

803
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,590
I'll go find something else.

804
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,540
Don't bother.

805
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,790
I'm not standing on ceremony with you.

806
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,290
Zhang Zhe is on a different side from me.

807
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,490
But no matter what,

808
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,930
he is still an upright and good official.

809
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,330
He will find out the truth

810
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:57,950
if he knows that there's something wrong.

811
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,750
Nowadays, everyone in the court

812
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,370
is afraid of Duke Xue's power.

813
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,240
There are few people like him.

814
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:07,190
If I have any inconvenience in the future,

815
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,110
you can ask him for help.

816
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,920
You are smart and good at plotting things.

817
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,699
Mr. Zhang is perceptive.

818
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:16,520
If the two of you can come together and make a perfect duo,

819
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,860
it would be a good thing.

820
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,040
Unfortunately, we have different intentions.

821
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,650
We can't conspire.

822
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,790
If we have the same intentions,

823
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,150
all the more we can't work together.

824
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,560
What's wrong?

825
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,620
Miss Jiang said she doesn't want to celebrate her birthday.

826
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,389
She didn't even take any of the gifts sent to her.

827
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:40,389
Sir, what should we do?

828
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,260
There's no need to do anything.

829
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,230
If she doesn't want them,

830
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,360
throw them all away.

831
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,370
What a good girl.

832
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,150
If it weren't for the difficulties in your family,

833
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,380
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

834
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,120
Good girl.

835
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,520
You must be hungry.

836
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,520
I asked the kitchen

837
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,510
to cook a table of good dishes for you.

838
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,970
I don't know what you like.

839
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:15,570
Here.

840
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:16,660
Try it.

841
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,410
Thank you for your concern.

842
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:23,730
I just don't know

843
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,890
why my family brought me back.

844
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,620
It's for your marriage.

845
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,460
Speaking of which,

846
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,100
I'm also your legitimate mother.

847
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,530
Now that you've grown up,

848
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:37,080
I have to argue for you.

849
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:38,640
Now,

850
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,240
we have a perfect marriage

851
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,680
for you.

852
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,040
You're going to become a phoenix soon.

853
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,760
Why do you suddenly want me to get married?

854
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:49,680
May I ask

855
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,520
what kind of person is he?

856
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,360
How dare you!

857
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:55,350
How can a girl ask about this?

858
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,510
As for other matters,

859
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,190
I will make the decision for you.

860
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,450
You just need to prepare for the wedding.

861
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:04,700
Marriage

862
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,630
is decided by one's parents.

863
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,360
But I was imprisoned.

864
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,870
Noble families will surely dislike it.

865
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,320
I'm afraid it'll disgrace the You family.

866
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,920
Mother, please think twice.

867
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,000
That's easy.

868
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:17,140
I'll inform Duke Xue's wife later.

869
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,990
As long as you don't speak a word,

870
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,920
others wouldn't dare to spread it.

871
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,150
But I'm lowly

872
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,270
and stupid–

873
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,350
Cut the crap.

874
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,390
These are just excuses.

875
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,670
Mr. Li is a noble.

876
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,480
Although he is over 50 years old, he has no son.

877
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,870
If you have the ability to give birth for him,

878
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,540
you'll be his third-rate wife.

879
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,600
What else are you not satisfied with?

880
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,880
Is it Marquis Shangyong, Mr. Li?

881
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:41,810
Yes.

882
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:45,590
Doesn't he have more than 20 concubines?

883
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:46,430
So what?

884
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,390
With your lowly background,

885
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,650
you still dislike him?

886
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,370
Alright.

887
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,270
Let me tell you the truth.

888
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,840
Your father's business is in deficit.

889
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,650
Mr. Li extending a helping hand

890
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,430
and being willing to marry you,

891
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,550
is your blessing.

892
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,730
I won't say more about this.

893
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,360
If you are obedient,

894
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,500
I'll give you more dowries.

895
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:09,060
If you have any other ideas,

896
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:12,010
I have plenty of ways to deal with you.

897
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,130
Boss.

898
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,010
How is it?

899
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,310
I found out from the Chamber of Commerce that

900
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:23,470
You Mansion bought a lot of

901
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:24,930
things used for weddings.

902
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,510
Did You Residence take You Fangyin back

903
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,980
to get married?

904
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:33,740
That's impossible.

905
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:34,800
I heard

906
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,700
Earl You owed a lot of debts in business.

907
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,630
That’s why he wanted to give up his daughter for money.

908
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,290
Just right,

909
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:43,490
that rich Mr. Li from the capital's wife

910
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:44,850
died a long time ago.

911
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,310
He also wants to find a daughter from a noble family

912
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:48,370
to prop up his name.

913
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,620
The two families get along very well.

914
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,650
That old man is always arrogant.

915
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:54,690
He's old enough to be her father.

916
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,940
I'm afraid they wanted to marry You Yue.

917
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,900
But they couldn't bear to part with this legitimate daughter

918
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,870
so they came back to humiliate You Fangyin.

919
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,930
Even a radish is not cut on both sides,

920
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,900
they're only bullying one girl.

921
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,100
How heartless.

922
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,610
How about this.

923
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,600
Go and prepare some gifts.

924
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,580
They have to look over the top

925
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,490
and valuable.

926
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,440
I'll send it to the You family now.

927
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,130
Yes.

928
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,110
Mr. Lyu, you have good taste.

929
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,700
The Mansion of Earl You

930
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,700
don't do business with just anyone.

931
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,550
After all, we are relatives of the royal family.

932
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,190
Yes.

933
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:42,320
But Mr. Lyu,

934
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,620
if you are sincere to do business with us,

935
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,000
I can give you a chance.

936
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,700
You are right.

937
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,750
It's three lifetimes of luck that I have

938
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,760
that I can step into Earl You's mansion.

939
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,500
It's just a small gift,

940
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,300
nothing much.

941
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,490
I will come more often in the future

942
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,910
and have more things for you.

943
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,800
Of course, of course.

944
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,950
I have to go to the toilet.

945
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:09,040
May I go to the toilet?

946
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:09,730
Of course.

947
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,510
It's at the backyard.

948
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,150
Excuse me.

949
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,280
Miss You.

950
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,640
Miss You.

951
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:48,780
Mr. Lyu.

952
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:49,960
Why are you here?

953
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,520
Jiang Xuening is not in the capital now.

954
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,930
Only I can help you out.

955
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,410
How about this?

956
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:57,340
As long as you

957
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,670
agree to transferring the stakes of the salt well

958
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,480
to me.

959
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,210
I can get you out of here now.

960
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,270
What do you think?

961
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,390
Impossible.

962
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:05,030
I won't betray Second Young Lady.

963
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:05,430
You...

964
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:08,780
Do you really want to marry that man?

965
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,600
Of course not.

966
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,080
Then you should be more flexible.

967
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,310
You can promise me now.

968
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,840
And change your mind later.

969
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:16,210
No.

970
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,140
You're so nice to me normally,

971
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,080
I don't want to lie to you.

972
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,820
This marriage is inevitable.

973
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,880
I don't want to drag you into this.

974
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:33,400
I've been in business for so many years.

975
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:36,280
I deal with cunning old foxes all day.

976
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:38,860
I think I have seen all sorts of people.

977
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,910
But I've never seen anyone like you.

978
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,260
Forget it.

979
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,590
There's always a way.

980
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,320
How about this?

981
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,810
I'll teach you a way.

982
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:51,360
Come closer.

983
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:57,270
Listen.

984
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:58,290
How about this?

985
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,540
From now on,

986
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,630
Hui will be one year older.

987
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,760
You've grown up well.

988
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:20,470
I wish you a safe

989
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:21,420
life.

990
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,600
May all your wishes come true.

991
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:24,540
Here.

992
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,340
Take a look.

993
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,130
Do you like this dress?

994
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:29,990
You do?

995
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,740
Turn around.

996
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:38,170
Birthday girl.

997
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,870
Why are you sitting here alone?

998
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:40,520
Aren't you bored?

999
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,100
Wait.

1000
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:44,250
How come even you know?

1001
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,830
Your teacher told me.

1002
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,910
I went to the kitchen just now.

1003
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,660
The ingredients are all here.

1004
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:54,270
I'll definitely set up an amazing banquet for you today.

1005
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:57,510
I'll show you what the top Young Master of Jinling is capable of.

1006
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,670
I told Xiao Bao

1007
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:00,350
I don't like to celebrate my birthday.

1008
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:01,150
Don't bother.

1009
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:01,840
No.

1010
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,950
Ladies your age

1011
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,270
all love to celebrate your birthdays, no?

1012
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,450
Is it because you think

1013
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:08,530
this temple is too small

1014
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:10,070
and it doesn't have a decent scale?

1015
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,730
It has nothing to do with this.

1016
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:14,510
I just remembered something in the past.

1017
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,350
Not everyone's birthday

1018
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,630
is worth celebrating.

1019
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,390
When I was in the capital,

1020
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,180
Yan Lin celebrated my birthday with me.

1021
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,240
Now that he's gone,

1022
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,040
what's the difference between celebrating it or not.

1023
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,100
That's exactly why

1024
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,500
we should celebrate this year's birthday.

1025
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,710
Leaving the capital, Viscount Yan

1026
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,800
must also hope that you can live a happy life.

1027
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,190
You should do as he wishes.

1028
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,160
So that he can rest assured.

1029
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:35,030
Yes.

1030
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,900
Mr. Zhang is right.

1031
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,370
You should celebrate your birthday.

1032
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:39,480
It's none of other's business.

1033
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,010
Besides,

1034
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,480
in the capital,

1035
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:43,350
the things around you are nothing.

1036
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:45,390
You definitely can't understand the fun of it.

1037
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:46,120
Now,

1038
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:47,230
in the wilderness

1039
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,280
of Tongzhou,

1040
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:49,370
and with good wine and food,

1041
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:49,970
feel it,

1042
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,040
doesn't it feel different?

1043
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,350
I finally have an excuse to drink.

1044
00:42:58,350 --> 00:42:59,530
I've been craving so much these days.
