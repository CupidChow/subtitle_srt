For so many of us to enter the capital together,

38
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,470
it will attract too much attention and is not safe.

54

he's worried that the identity documents we prepared

But our family doesn't allow for it.

This time round, it's not just for the mission,

00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,260
Yan's troops are stationed in Tongzhou.

173
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,760
If Lord Pingnan wants to act,

174
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,960
it won't be that easy.

175
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,120
No matter how valiant the Yan's troops are,

176
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,650
they can't beat my methods.

177
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,020
You don't have to worry.

178
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,230
Tomorrow,

179
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,440
there will be something exciting for you to see.

180
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,040
What's happening tomorrow?

181
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:39,670
We're here.

182
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,159
This is the place.

183
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,600
Dinner is ready?

184
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,150
[Hongmeng Tavern]

185
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,680
I'm starving.

186
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,580
Huang.

187
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,240
Is the meal ready, Huang?

188
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,370
Brother.

189
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,690
Let's eat.

190
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,190
Please, Sir.

191
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,440
What's wrong?

192
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,170
N-nothing.

193
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,290
Miss Jiang was quite worried about you today.

194
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,980
Eat up.

195
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,150
Here, eat.

196
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,450
Is something wrong with that girl?

197
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,430
No.

198
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,770
They are both normal.

199
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,700
Stop asking.

200
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:35,100
Let's eat.

201
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:37,270
What happened?

202
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:38,370
Nothing much.

203
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,320
I don't think you should know.

204
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,570
On the way,

205
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,520
Feng Mingyu kept asking me questions.

206
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,450
It must be the same with Huang Qian.

207
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,200
Miss Jiang, please tell me the truth.

208
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,600
So that I can be prepared.

209
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,370
Do you really want to hear it?

210
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:56,730
It's nothing much.

211
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,760
He asked me

212
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,270
about our relationship.

213
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,680
And why did you take me on

214
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,140
such a dangerous mission?

215
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,590
Didn't we discuss this question

216
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,340
on the way here?

217
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,930
Yes, we did.

218
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,300
But I came up with a better answer.

219
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,090
I said

220
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,160
we love each other.

221
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,390
This is an elopement.

222
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,890
What did you say?

223
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,190
I said this is an elopement.

224
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:22,840
Nonsense!

225
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,860
Eat, eat.

226
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,930
Eat up.

227
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,270
I said–

228
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,810
Don't talk nonsense.

229
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,170
I was afraid that by saying more things I'd make a mistake,

230
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,040
so I made an excuse to shut them up.

231
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,960
Did I say something wrong?

232
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,760
I can't think of a good excuse at that moment.

233
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,360
What if I ruin your plan?

234
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,000
Didn't you say

235
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,530
it's good for them to mistake

236
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,440
our relationship?

237
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,520
Them misunderstanding

238
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,380
is different from you

239
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,980
telling them that yourself.

240
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,040
It's all my fault.

241
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,250
I won't ruin your reputation anymore.

242
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,250
I'll say whatever you want me to say.

243
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,300
Don't be angry.

244
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,830
My reputation is nothing.

245
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,280
You have to get married in the future.

246
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,460
Such nonsense is inappropriate.

247
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,890
What's inappropriate?

248
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,580
I don't want to marry anyone else anyway.

249
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,180
All right.

250
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,150
Let's stop

251
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:39,980
talking about this.

252
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,880
I heard Feng Mingyu talking on the way here.

253
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm afraid they'll take action tomorrow.

254
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,660
Miss Jiang.

255
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,770
There's no time to lose.

256
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,450
Just pretend to be sick tonight.

257
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,710
I know you're worried.

258
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,480
But it's dangerous here.

259
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,520
If you stay here,

260
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,420
I will only be more worried.

261
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,000
I promised you

262
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,540
that I'll make sure you return safely to the capital.

263
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,000
Since I made this promise,

264
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,490
I can't go back on my word.

265
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:08,690
What's wrong?

266
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,160
It hurts.

267
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,050
Where are you hurting?

268
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,220
Miss San.

269
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:34,800
How is my sister?

270
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,160
Please tell me the truth.

271
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,500
Miss Jiang looks like

272
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,410
she was poisoned.

273
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:48,890
Why are you looking at me?

274
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:49,890
As a man,

275
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,570
how can I poison a little girl?

276
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,060
This is your base.

277
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,770
Your men are everywhere.

278
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:58,560
You kept trying to probe me on the way here.

279
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,410
How can I believe that?

280
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,090
Don't be anxious, Sir.

281
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:05,930
It's true that

282
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,440
we want to probe you.

283
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,010
But if we really wanted to kill you,

284
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,560
everyone here is our man.

285
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,890
Why do we have to do this?

286
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:13,690
Our priority

287
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,190
is to treat

288
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,680
your sister first.

289
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,160
It's not dawn yet.

290
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,640
Where can we find a doctor?

291
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,490
There's one.

292
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,820
Physician Xie from Yongding Pharmacy lives in the shop.

293
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,280
We can send her there.

294
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:27,170
Look.

295
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,900
As expected of Xiao Bao.

296
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:29,500
Xiao Bao,

297
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:30,700
I'll send two men to you later.

298
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,700
If you meet an official, you can work your way through.

299
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,710
Don't worry, Mr. Zhang.

300
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,920
I will take good care of your sister.

301
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,060
Stop.

302
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,310
What's wrong?

303
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,940
Stop.

304
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,160
What's wrong?

305
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:40,590
Miss Ning'er.

306
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,790
This is the antidote.

307
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,380
Ning'er?

308
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,000
Are you Xie Wei's man?

309
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,870
You poisoned me?

310
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,320
It's just a temporary plan.

311
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,320
Fortunately,

312
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,680
I managed to get you out.

313
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,340
I have some money here.

314
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,760
Go stay a night

315
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,840
at that inn across the street tonight.

316
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,470
No matter what happens on the street tomorrow,

317
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,330
don't come out.

318
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,330
Someone will come to pick you up.

319
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,320
Where is Mr. Zhang?

320
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,130
What about him?

321
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:12,860
Don't worry.

322
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,680
Viscount Dingfei is with Mr. Zhang.

323
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,540
He will be fine.

324
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,060
He's also Xie Wei's man?

325
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,960
Things have been set up in Yongding Pharmacy.

326
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,610
There are always plans in the court.

327
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,810
All we need to do now is to save Mr. Zhang.

328
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,320
That's good.

329
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,300
Thank you for saving me.

330
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,290
You're welcome.

331
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,350
You went out for so long.

332
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,630
You managed to send her there?

333
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,120
She fell asleep after taking the medicine.

334
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,490
So I left those two at the pharmacy.

335
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,610
If anything happens, she can be protected.

336
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,340
That's good.

337
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,450
At least there's someone keeping an eye on her.

338
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,780
Come in. Get ready to go.

339
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:00,920
Father.

340
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,570
The forest is so big.

341
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,800
Where are the rebesl?

342
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,190
If Xie Wei takes the first credit,

343
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,690
our trip will be wasted.

344
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,000
Check around

345
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,660
and see if there are any clues.

346
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,340
Yes!

347
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:25,570
Sir,

348
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,690
Xiao Bao has brought Miss Jiang out.

349
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,440
Xue Dingfei also sent a message.

350
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,590
Saying that before dawn,

351
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,640
Feng Mingyu instigated them to go to Shangqing Temple.

352
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,640
Looks like that's

353
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,980
where Feng Mingyu set the gunpowder.

354
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,140
It's strange.

355
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,250
Why aren't they targeting Yan's troop

356
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,890
but instead, set up this gunpowder

357
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:43,790
in the temple?

358
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,120
In that case I should inform Duke Xue

359
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,090
to go to Shangqing Temple.

360
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:46,550
No need.

361
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,440
For military merits,

362
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,810
Xue Yuan only trusts himself

363
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,440
He won't listen to us easily.

364
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,550
Dao Qin.

365
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,240
Pretend to be the rebel.

366
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,120
Let them go there themselves while investigating.

367
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,580
Yes.

368
00:15:59,400 --> 00:15:59,820
Sir.

369
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,890
Zhang Zhe has noticed your connection with the rebels.

370
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:03,390
Today,

371
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,990
we must get rid of him in the chaos.

372
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,970
Xiao Bao is Xie Wei's man.

373
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,570
It should be the same for Xue Dingfei.

374
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,350
In that case,

375
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,740
why didn't Xie Wei tell Zhang Zhe about this earlier?

376
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,280
Could it be because he's afraid that

377
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,930
Zhang Zhe suspects that he's related to the rebels?

378
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:42,990
If that's the case,

379
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,940
by asking Xie Bao to get me out,

380
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,680
isn't he exposing himself in front of Zhang Zhe?

381
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,050
With his meticulousness,

382
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,680
he would never make such a mistake.

383
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,820
Unless...

384
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:52,960
Guest.

385
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,900
I brought you some snacks.

386
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:56,230
Come in.

387
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,080
Did anything happen in the city today?

388
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,760
Like,

389
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,690
the barracks sent troops or the government is out to suppress bandits?

390
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,610
Not that I've heard of.

391
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,250
In the past, if the government takes any action,

392
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,890
they would issue an official notice

393
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,020
and inform us businessmen in advance.

394
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,109
Enjoy.

395
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,280
Xiao Bao brought me out last night.

396
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,609
It means the court is ready to take action.

397
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,560
But it's been hours.

398
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,079
Why is there no movement?

399
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,420
No.

400
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:22,060
I have to check it out.

401
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,540
[Yongding Pharmacy]

402
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,530
Is this Yongding Pharmacy?

403
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,080
Yes.

404
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:33,820
Miss,

405
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,000
are you feeling uncomfortable anywhere?

406
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,600
It's not me.

407
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,460
It's Mr. Zhang.

408
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,570
He's in danger.

409
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,360
Please inform the reinforcements immediately.

410
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,240
What Mr. Zhang?

411
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,230
What reinforcements?

412
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,250
This is a pharmacy,

413
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,250
not the barracks.

414
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:46,830
You don't know?

415
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,040
How is that possible?

416
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,930
Sir,

417
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,720
how many Yongding Pharmacies are there in Tongzhou?

418
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,920
There's only us.

419
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,770
Miss, what are you trying to do?

420
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,760
If you don't need to see a doctor,

421
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,530
don't disturb our business here.

422
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:58,590
Xie Wei lied to him.

423
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,560
Xie Wei didn't set any plan

424
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,010
for Yongding Pharmacy to be a point to get help.

425
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,230
He wants to kill.

426
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,360
He never wanted Zhang Zhe to leave Tongzhou alive.

427
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,370
Where is Yan’s troops' barracks?

428
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,490
I'm asking you where Yan's troops' barracks is.

429
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,210
Xiao Bao.

430
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,480
You don't have to follow us up the mountain.

431
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,640
Guard at the foot of the mountain.

432
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,840
If anything happens,

433
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,970
come up to report to us anytime.

434
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,040
[Shangqing Temple]

435
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,000
This used to be an abandoned temple.

436
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,360
I came here a year ago

437
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,020
and have occupied this place.

438
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,370
I sent people to train here to practice

439
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,970
while gathering information about the court and the barracks.

440
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,120
Now,

441
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,210
it's at quite a large skill.

442
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,760
You're quite something, Feng.

443
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,890
You've hidden well.

444
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,010
You did such a big thing in Tongzhou,

445
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,410
yet I didn't hear anything about it before.

446
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,080
All these years, Lord Pingnan has been stopped in the north.

447
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,340
He's been suspicious.

448
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,840
At first, I thought

449
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,620
Mr. Dujun betrayed the court.

450
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,640
So I've been very cautious on our way here.

451
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:00,950
Please forgive me.

452
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,780
You've done a lot of work to help Lord Pingnan.

453
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,250
It's good to be cautious.

454
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,730
However,

455
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,990
where is the good show that you want to show me?

456
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,930
I have to keep the good show to the end.

457
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,390
Why are you in such a hurry?

458
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,580
Please.

459
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,300
[Celebrate with Light]

460
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:03,040
I heard you've always been good at drinking.

461
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,050
You loved Gusu Yellow Wine the most when you were in Jinling.

462
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:06,980
Unfortunately,

463
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,860
we don't have any here.

464
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,680
Where did you hear that?

465
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,410
Mr. Dujun likes reading scriptures.

466
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,070
He can be considered half an innocent outsider.

467
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,010
He doesn't

468
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:17,980
drink.

469
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:19,610
General Feng.

470
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,730
I'm happy today.

471
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:22,970
I can drink with you.

472
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,570
I didn't expect Mr. Dujun

473
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,850
to be such an outgoing personality.

474
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,250
It suits our temperament.

475
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,250
Coincidentally,

476
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,320
I have something I can't make a decision on.

477
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,410
Let me tell everyone

478
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,170
so you can help me make a decision.

479
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,300
After we left the capital,

480
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,290
I secretly sent people

481
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,140
to keep an eye on the court.

482
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,780
Soon after,

483
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,400
news came.

484
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,570
The court sent Duke Xue

485
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,160
to bring a large number of Xingwu Guards to suppress the rebels.

486
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,960
They came straight to Tongzhou.

487
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,080
General Feng,

488
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,400
since you already knew about this,

489
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,560
why didn't you tell us earlier?

490
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,160
So that we can prepare for it.

491
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,880
What are you afraid of?

492
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,850
There are many soldiers in Shangqing Temple.

493
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,580
We also have a lot of gunpowder.

494
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,960
Who knows who will win?

495
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,180
I was just thinking

496
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,450
we should be cautions

497
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,230
on the way here

498
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,630
and be careful.

499
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,760
Unless Duke Xue is able to have the power of god,

500
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,040
how would he know we are in Tongzhou?

501
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,070
You mean...

502
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,350
there's a mole?

503
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,260
General.

504
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:46,480
There's a girl outside

505
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,930
claiming to be Mr. Yan's friend

506
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:48,930
asking to see you.

507
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,200
Mr. Yan?

508
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:51,980
A girl on top of that?

509
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:52,530
Yes.

510
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,800
Mr. Dujun is resourceful.

511
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,250
Don't you want to say anything?

512
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,990
General Feng said the news.

513
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,160
You're not explaining it yourself

514
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,620
but are asking me about it.

515
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,240
It's putting me in the spot.

516
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,130
Before I came to the capital,

517
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,540
Lord Pingnan suspected you

518
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,600
of defected to the court.

519
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,530
Now it seems that

520
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,090
it can only be you

521
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,220
who colluded with Duke Xue.

522
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,740
I'm innocent.

523
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,970
I have a clear conscience and carry out Lord Pingnan's orders.

524
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:23,840
Except me,

525
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,420
is General Feng not suspcious?

526
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:30,660
Me?

527
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,850
What do you mean?

528
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,420
I wasn't sure at first.

529
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,780
But now General Feng has gotten anxious.

530
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,720
If you had suspected me on the way,

531
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,100
why didn't you send a letter to Jinling

532
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,840
and get Lord Pingnan's confirmation?

533
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,560
Yet you're trying to stir up trouble here.

534
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,020
Jinling is far and high up.

535
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,570
When the letter reaches,

536
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,030
you would have succeeded.

537
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,600
Let me ask you.

538
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,050
When you left Jinling,

539
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,720
did Lord Pingnan say I have defected

540
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,240
and told you to only listen Feng Mingyu?

541
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,100
No.

542
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,360
Lord Pingnan just told me

543
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,720
to pass most of the forces in the capital to Mr. Gongyi's

544
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,560
and Mr. Dujun.

545
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,100
As for General Feng's visit to the capital, there is another mission on him.

546
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,730
Yes.

547
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,080
I'm a strategist.

548
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,560
And you are a soldier.

549
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,810
Most of the secret services in the capital are in my hands.

550
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,810
Gongyi Cheng's has been abandoned.

551
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,240
But General Feng

552
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,960
left the capital and entered Tongzhou

553
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,450
just like entering a deserted place.

554
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,740
I would like to ask

555
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,930
if you haven't joined forces with the court, what other explanation can there be?

556
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:19,600
That's because–

557
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,400
Viscount Dingfei,

558
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,130
are you still going to stand by?

559
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,580
General Feng and I will fight till death.

560
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:29,720
Aren't you afraid that the higher-ups will blame you?

561
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,960
You're slandering me.

562
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,640
My loyalty for Lord Pingnan is witnessed by heaven and earth.

563
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,620
There's no way I will rebel.

564
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,600
I'm already a fifth-rank official in the court.

565
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,520
If I weren't loyal to Lord Pingnan,

566
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,520
I wouldn't have been not afraid to be in danger

567
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,160
and got involved in this mess.

568
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:39,900
But you.

569
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:40,930
You have gunpowder.

570
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,280
Why didn't you ambush Xingwu Guards on the way

571
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,600
but lured us here?

572
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,440
Are you trying to kill us?

573
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,430
Nonsense!

574
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,140
Don't listen to him!

575
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,040
This mountain

576
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,060
is Yan's troops.

577
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,250
We chose this place

578
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,690
to bury the barracks

579
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,570
with the mountain's slope as an advantage.

580
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:57,940
I...

581
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,650
I'm doing this for the great cause of Jinling.

582
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,040
There are thousands of soldiers in Tongzhou's barracks.

583
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,280
Their tents are pitched wide and apart.

584
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,050
They won't be easily buried under a landslide.

585
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,880
Your excuses are full of flaws.

586
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,860
Viscount Dingfei,

587
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,590
are you still not making a move?

588
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,020
Xue Dingfei.

589
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,150
Are you crazy?

590
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,300
Huang Qian.

591
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,480
What are you waiting for?

592
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,450
When he detonates the explosives,

593
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,580
we will all die here.

594
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:18,910
Hurry up!

595
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,080
General Feng.

596
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,690
I didn't want to be your enemy.

597
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:22,950
But the situation is complicated now.

598
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,260
Could you two please surrender

599
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,580
and go back to Jinling with me to see Lord Pingnan?

600
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,510
Let Lord Pingnan

601
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,710
make the decision.

602
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,790
I'd love to

603
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,290
have my name cleared.

604
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:30,690
No.

605
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,480
If we let such eloquent rebel go back,

606
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,320
who knows how he will taint my name in front of Lord Pingnan?

607
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,120
You can leave.

608
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,730
But he must stay.

609
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,750
General Feng is afraid that after I leave,

610
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,030
you won't be able to give Duke Xue a good answer, right?

611
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:43,490
You...

612
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,330
What are you doing?

613
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,480
He's the one who is suspicious,

614
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,210
not me.

615
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,780
Explain your identity first.

616
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,500
Have you ever betrayed Lord Pingnan?

617
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,870
Two idiots.

618
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,800
What are you waiting for?

619
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,270
Waiting for them to start a gamble game?

620
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,020
Let's go.

621
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:36,390
Sir.

622
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,270
Xue Yuan fell for the trap.

623
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,310
He's on his way to Shangqing Temple.

624
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,360
Why are there so few people in the barracks today?

625
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:43,830
Sir,

626
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,370
a girl came this morning

627
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,500
saying that she has clues about the rebels.

628
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,290
The general led an army and went into the mountain with her.

629
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,270
They have been gone for a while now.

630
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:49,740
A girl?

631
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,830
Is she a girl about 18 or 19 years old?

632
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,230
Yes.

633
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,610
She also said she was an old friend of Viscount Yan.

634
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:56,710
She talked about many things about the Viscount Yan.

635
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:57,840
They are really close.

636
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,470
No way.

637
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,170
Didn't Xiao Bao do the things according to the plan

638
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,650
-and brought Miss Jiang to–
-Since she's here,

639
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,650
it means she has found something wrong.

640
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,290
Immediately deploy the troops and move with little things packed.

641
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,370
Attack from the back mountain.

642
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,960
You must bring her out

643
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,380
before Feng Mingyu ignites the gunpowder.

644
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:09,860
Yes.

645
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,240
Are you going too?

646
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,190
You haven't recovered yet.

647
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,050
It's too dangerous.

648
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:16,650
Medicine.

649
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,050
Give it to me.

650
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,060
Stop fighting!

651
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,270
Open your eyes!

652
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,770
Is Zhang Zhe still here?

653
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:52,740
This...

654
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,870
Viscount Dingfei is gone too.

655
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:55,860
Idiots.

656
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,610
Why didn't you trust me?

657
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,370
They are clearly in cahoots.

658
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,970
Xue Dingfei has already defected to the court.

659
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,660
What?

660
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:04,190
General, bad news!

661
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,280
Xingwu Guards are sneaking an attack.

662
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,880
They're already at the gate.

663
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,270
Stop!

664
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:10,730
Go!

665
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:13,570
Stop!

666
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,140
Stop!

667
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,380
Hurry up.

668
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,810
Didn't you ask Xiao Bao to guard down the mountain?

669
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:19,540
Where is he?

670
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:20,770
Now you know to panic?

671
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,650
Don't panic.

672
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:24,700
I have a plan.

673
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,080
So what if they're Xingwu Guards?

674
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,590
Today,

675
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,870
they will all die here.

676
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,250
I'll go kill them!

677
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:31,640
Stop!

678
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:39,730
You...

679
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:41,540
come with me.

680
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,150
Let's go.

681
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,100
Hurry up.

682
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,190
Xue Dingfei!

683
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,530
Are you working for Lord Pingnan

684
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,460
or for the court?

685
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,440
We need to escape now.

686
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,930
Can we talk about it after we go down the mountain?

687
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,130
Otherwise, when they come to their senses,

688
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,290
none of us can escape.

689
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:57,820
Let's go.

690
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,100
If we leave like this,

691
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,130
what would happen to the lives of the Xingwu Guards

692
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,660
and the innocent people in the barracks?

693
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,680
What ideas do you have?

694
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,410
Just you?

695
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,610
You're just a weak scholar.

696
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,810
If you go back, Feng will kill you first.

697
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,580
What are you doing?

698
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:13,710
See?

699
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,120
He's looking for death. I won't accompany you for that.

700
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,660
I won't.

701
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:20,570
I'll go.

702
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:36,370
Kill them!

703
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:37,930
Don't let anyone escape!

704
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,210
Kill!

705
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:45,890
Mr. Xue.

706
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,610
Mr. Zhang?

707
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:48,840
Where is the Duke?

708
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,610
I have something important to tell him.

709
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:52,800
It's just a den of rebels.

710
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:54,680
My father and I chased them

711
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,330
and beat them up.

712
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,010
We then led troops to hunt them down separately.

713
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,740
But it's none of your business.

714
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,890
The Xingwu Guards

715
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,380
will help His Majesty to stop the rebellion.

716
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,510
Chase!

717
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,230
No!

718
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,850
Watch out for traps, Mr. Xue!

719
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,010
If you are afraid,

720
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,150
just stay here.

721
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,680
Don't chase the poor.

722
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,820
This place is surrounded by mountains.

723
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,570
It's obviously a hidden plan to lure the enemy in.

724
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:18,880
Feng Mingyu has gunpowder.

725
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,050
What a coward.

726
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,080
You're a civil official. What do you know about war strategies?

727
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,740
Move aside!

728
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,810
Mr. Xue, no!

729
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:24,750
Mr. Xue!

730
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,050
There’s a trap ahead, Mr. Xue!

731
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:32,820
Mr. Xue!

732
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,620
Retreat!

733
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,270
Hello, Mr. Dujun.

734
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,400
It’s now obvious

735
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,180
who's the court's lackey.

736
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,820
What else do you want to say?

737
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,520
How dare you rebels

738
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,290
be so brazen?

739
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:20,880
Surrender now

740
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,380
and I will spare your life.

741
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:25,800
How dare you!

742
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:26,680
Shoot!

743
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,740
Protect Sir!

744
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:00,780
Sir.

745
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,880
We are outnumbered.

746
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,010
And they're on a vantage point.

747
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:03,890
We are disadvantaged.

748
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:04,800
What are you afraid of?

749
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,160
I'll send the signal now.

750
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,010
When my father comes,

751
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,050
-I’ll teach them a lesson!
-No!

752
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:08,490
No.

753
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:09,960
They have gunpowder

754
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,110
and deliberately lured us here.

755
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,950
They must've set a trap here waiting for us.

756
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,130
If you inform the Duke,

757
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,460
Xingwu Guards will be destroyed here too.

758
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,060
Don't shoot!

759
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,430
Mr. Xue!

760
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,500
It's a message from Xingwu Guards.

761
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,560
They're here too?

762
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,850
It's time.

763
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,300
To send them off!

764
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:45,310
Miss,

765
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,440
this is our first time in this mountain too.

766
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,100
It's too slow to keep looking.

767
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:49,780
How about

768
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,650
I lead a team to save Mr. Zhang first?

769
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,160
No.

770
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,160
The rebels brought him here.

771
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,290
There must be a base in the mountain.

772
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,410
If you split up,

773
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:58,160
it will be dangerous for you to go alone.

774
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,170
The rebels must be plotting something.

775
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,480
We must not only save Mr. Zhang,

776
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,810
but also stop this.

777
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:05,070
General.

778
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,160
I'm really Mr. Zhang.

779
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,960
I'm really...

780
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,080
It hurts. Don't.

781
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,050
It's you.

782
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:11,430
Miss.

783
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,370
You know him?

784
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,370
When I was patrolling,

785
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,680
I found this man suspicious

786
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,560
and interrogated him.

787
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,840
But he said he's Mr. Zhang.

788
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,770
I don't think so.

789
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,990
So I brought him here.

790
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,240
All right, it's a misunderstanding.

791
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:21,870
I mean

792
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,930
I'm looking for someone to save Mr. Zhang.

793
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:24,590
Where is he?

794
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,070
Over there.

795
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,170
Father!

796
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,170
I'm here!

797
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:08,850
Ye'er!

798
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,280
Duke, be careful! Don't come over!

799
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,480
They have gunpowder!

800
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:40,170
Ye'er!

801
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:40,820
Father!

802
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,760
Save me!

803
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:48,889
Ye'er!

804
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,510
Ye'er, are you okay?

805
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,570
Duke, retreat!

806
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:33,500
I destroyed the way down the mountain.

807
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,810
You have nowhere to go.

808
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:35,380
Today,

809
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,350
everyone will die here.

810
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,230
Why are there so many people?

811
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:50,720
Father.

812
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:52,060
We've been tricked.

813
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,290
It's not that easy

814
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:56,510
to kill me.

815
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,920
I'm not afraid of you rats.

816
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,390
Attention, Xingwu Guards!

817
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,590
If you don't want to die here,

818
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,680
then slaughter a path out for me!

819
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:07,750
Yes!

820
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,870
Kill them!

821
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,730
Kill all of them!

822
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,550
Yes!

823
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,320
Sir, I went down to have a look.

824
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,850
The road down the mountain was blown up.

825
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,640
There might be gunpowder ambushed on the mountain.

826
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,080
Sir.

827
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,690
They should be up there.

828
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:32,020
Sir.

829
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,880
You're not feeling well. Please wait here.

830
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,650
Right, Dao Qin?

831
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,990
We will definitely bring Miss Jiang back.

832
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:36,790
Stop talking.

833
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,800
Hurry up.

834
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:38,670
Sir!

835
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,540
Mr. Zhang!

836
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,090
Don't come over!

837
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,860
The Yan's troops are here too?

838
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,780
God is on my side.

839
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,250
Protect Mr. Zhang!

840
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:32,720
Yes!

841
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,040
Why did you come back?

842
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,110
We agreed to leave together.

843
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,770
I can't leave you here alone.

844
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,790
I planned to

845
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:50,160
trap and kill the Xingwu Guards first

846
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,000
then get some capacity to deal with Yan's troops.

847
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,210
I didn't expect that they would come here themselves.

848
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,200
That's great.

849
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,640
So what

850
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,090
if we die together today?

851
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,030
General.

852
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,180
What do you mean?

853
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,020
Do you want us to die together?

854
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,510
If you're afraid of death,

855
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,780
how can you achieve great things?

856
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:10,550
The whole mountain is filled with gunpowder.

857
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,170
Once my flute rings again,

858
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,290
the whole mountain will turn into ashes.

859
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,860
All the people on the mountain

860
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,040
can't escape.

861
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,410
General.

862
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,930
So many people have died.

863
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,870
How will you explain this to Lord Pingnan?

864
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,570
Lord Pingnan will succeed soon.

865
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,830
The whole Jinling will remember my name.

866
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,140
He's crazy!

867
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,290
Stop!

868
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,030
Are you two going to betray Lord Pingnan too?

869
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:07,830
Father.

870
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,080
Save me!

871
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,530
Ye'er!

872
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,370
Ye'er!

873
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:17,620
Let's go!

874
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,730
You foolish woman who's afraid of death.

875
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:51,160
Give me back my flute!

876
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,430
Huang Qian died in your hands.

877
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,590
I'll kill you!

878
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,350
Mr. Zhang, Miss Jiang,

879
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:01,970
Let me take you out first.

880
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,730
Don't worry about us.

881
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:06,010
As long as we can stop Feng Mingyu from sending the signal,

882
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,870
we still have a chance to survive.

883
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,190
You guys come with me.

884
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:10,750
Yes.

885
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,060
Duke!

886
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,720
It's not the time to escape.

887
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,850
Please order Xingwu Guards

888
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:27,980
to go up the mountain to help the Yan's troops.

889
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,510
Otherwise, we will all die.

890
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,210
Ignore him!

891
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,190
While the rebels are busy,

892
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,830
inform all Xingwu Guards

893
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,370
to evacuate the valley!

894
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:38,310
Duke Xue!

895
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,670
Duke!

896
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:40,790
The war is coming.

897
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,780
Yet they just want to retreat.

898
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:45,110
Retreat! Retreat!

899
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,300
Come on.

900
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,410
Let's go.

901
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,360
Xie Wei! Don't kill him!

902
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,040
Junior Preceptor Xie.

903
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,420
All the rebels

904
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:45,970
should be killed without mercy!

905
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:46,610
Yes!

906
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,450
Are you okay?

907
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:53,530
This is ridiculous!
