1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
As long as I can enter the Ning'an Palace

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,200
and pay all the price

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,600
I will be willing to do my best

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,400
The End

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,800
The End

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Everything seems to be a dream

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,600
I have owed a lot of people

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,000
Chaozhe, help me

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,800
I will be a good person after this

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
The End

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
I will be the one to take the favor

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,800
There are some things you can't give me

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
But what about them?

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,000
The life you chose is for Mr. You

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,400
In this world, everyone has the right to escape

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,000
But I can't

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,000
I want to regret it

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,400
and do the wrong thing

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,200
and go back in time

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Does Mr. Zhang believe that everything is decided?

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I am more willing to believe in the future

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Congratulations, Your Highness

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,000
Congratulations, Your Highness

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,400
Congratulations, Your Highness

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Ning'an, what are you doing?

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,800
In the end, there is always a pair of invisible hands

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,800
that can break everything back to the original position

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,600
The revenge is long and the wish is long

30
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,800
Who are you in the end?

31
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,800
The Emperor of the mortal world is so long

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,520
Twisted in the retreat of time,esi

33
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,280
General.

34
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,760
If you overcome quickness in ending,

35
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,240
peace will settle in your sleep.

36
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,360
We speakоль

37
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,320
Did you write that吗

38
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,000
I think I have to try

39
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,680
since my birthdayissent

40
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,300
I didn't get time enough for writing the poem

41
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,100
Please tell me, what's the use of this duck?

42
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,540
What's the use of this duck?

43
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,140
It's neither a jade nor a logic.

44
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,860
Lord Zhao, especially this phrase,

45
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,420
the sky and mountains don't change,

46
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,980
and it's not even a cloud.

47
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,300
The front is still in the sky and mountains.

48
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,100
The transfer is a single-stop.

49
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,020
But the answer is that there are wind, moon,

50
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,580
mountains, flowers, and clouds.

51
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,700
It's just that it's too hard to enter the flow.

52
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,740
Is this phrase true?

53
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,420
It is.

54
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,940
Mr. Wang.

55
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,460
Thank you, sir.

56
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,380
What brings you here, Mr. Xie?

57
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,620
Mr. Wang,

58
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,340
may I borrow a poem from you?

59
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,100
Please have a look.

60
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,500
Mr. Xie, what do you think of this poem?

61
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,020
I don't know.

62
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,860
The poem is not in the flow.

63
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,380
Is it that bad?

64
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,820
Yes, yes, yes.

65
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,980
Then...

66
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,020
What do you mean?

67
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,500
You two are laughing.

68
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,300
This poem is a play of my old days.

69
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,540
It's a mess.

70
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,660
I can't stand it.

71
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,900
I dare not move the house and the private business.

72
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,660
Mr. Xie, this...

73
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,660
This...

74
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,660
This...

75
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,900
Ning'er, what's going on with this poem?

76
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,940
Mr. Xie, I'm sorry.

77
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,540
I practiced the piano in your place today.

78
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,340
I was worried that my father's homework

79
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,740
would be a mess.

80
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,340
I know I was wrong.

81
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,020
I'll go to the war.

82
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,340
This...

83
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,220
Mr. Ji,

84
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,420
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,860
General.

86
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,660
Zhao, you've been with me for 20 years.

87
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,260
This thing in the camp is not just a weapon.

88
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,180
It's also the life of the Yan Army.

89
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,340
Tell me, where did you get this?

90
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,780
The Yan Army has been protecting the rich for decades.

91
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,460
Only the dead are alive.

92
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,860
There are no people who are cruel.

93
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,340
Now, you're abandoned and run away.

94
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,020
If that's the case, I won't let you go.

95
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,900
It's the people of the heart.

96
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,980
They were wronged a while ago.

97
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,420
They locked him up in the prison and asked him about the Yan Army.

98
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,460
My son is dying to go to the war.

99
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,540
They even cut my son's finger.

100
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,940
They even threatened me.

101
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,020
I have no other way.

102
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,340
If I don't leave,

103
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,620
I'll die.

104
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,140
You're so stupid, Zhao.

105
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,220
If you say that again, we can still think of another way.

106
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,620
Your son, Zhao Xin,

107
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,620
has been in the Ministry of Justice for a few days.

108
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,140
Why did you hide it?

109
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,500
The Yan Army is guilty of the crime of death.

110
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,700
I'm afraid I can't say it.

111
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,340
General, please spare my life.

112
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,140
General.

113
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,140
This is...

114
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,500
You're indeed hard to say goodbye to.

115
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,340
You're a traitor.

116
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,540
But I haven't protected Zhao Xin.

117
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,540
I have a father, Yan Army.

118
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,940
I'm so angry.

119
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,340
I can't continue my work.

120
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,140
Yan Liu, I'm here.

121
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,420
All the military documents and documents

122
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,940
that were lost in the camp

123
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,740
are all recorded.

124
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,020
I'll send the two or three of them to Qing Qi.

125
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,220
Take Zhao and me back to the capital.

126
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,220
I'll make sure that

127
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,740
this matter is solved.

128
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,940
Li Yao, watch the army camp.

129
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,940
Remove any misdeeds.

130
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,140
Yes!

131
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,940
Something bad has happened.

132
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,940
Something bad has happened.

133
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,340
Did you hear that?

134
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,540
Old man Wang was the one who invited us to the temple yesterday.

135
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,940
He said he had a limit in his knowledge.

136
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,340
He couldn't teach the princess.

137
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,540
His Majesty was so sure.

138
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,340
He even transferred Mr. Zhao to Gan Zhou to be the Chaofeng Wolf.

139
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,940
Han Linyuan is a martial art student.

140
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,540
Chaofeng Wolf is a sixth-rank official.

141
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,740
He even went to Gan Zhou to be the chief of the academy.

142
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,740
How could a person like Mr. Zhao be...

143
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,940
You're so stubborn.

144
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,140
How could I say it's a big deal?

145
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,140
What did you two do?

146
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,540
What else could it be?

147
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,340
The teachers tried their best

148
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,140
to punish Jiang Xue Ning a few times.

149
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,540
I'm telling you.

150
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,340
He must have asked the princess to do this.

151
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,340
Older Sister Xue, you're the closest to the princess.

152
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,740
You must persuade him.

153
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,340
Don't listen to him.

154
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,940
Alright. Miss Jiang is also our classmate.

155
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,940
Why are you so close to each other?

156
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,540
I'm looking at her.

157
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,540
I'll have to get along with her in the future.

158
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,540
How could you...

159
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,340
A little Han Linyuan

160
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,940
already has so many parents.

161
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,140
A martial art student

162
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,340
can't even tell a good and bad thing about a poem.

163
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,940
I asked her about it yesterday

164
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,340
and she knew that her position was wrong.

165
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,140
Now that the court is full of rumors,

166
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,740
how many officials are involved?

167
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,340
Don't be angry.

168
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,740
It's not clear yet.

169
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,740
The conclusion is not too early.

170
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,140
But I also found out

171
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,140
that Han Linyuan has a lot of memorials

172
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,340
related to the Duke of Ding.

173
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,540
This is really my old father.

174
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,740
Look.

175
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,140
This is the memorials sent by Li Bu Jin Chen.

176
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,540
The position of the Minister of Justice.

177
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,540
The air is still fresh.

178
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,940
The Minister of Revenue is also very old.

179
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,340
Li Bu is the candidate for the memorial.

180
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,540
Most of them are related to the Xue family.

181
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,540
It's really hard to decide.

182
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,940
The Gu Chunfang of the North Sword Investigation Bureau

183
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,140
was originally an official from the Ministry of Revenue.

184
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,740
He was once the teacher of His Majesty.

185
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,740
Why not let him take over the Ministry of Revenue?

186
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,140
The old Gu is indeed a suitable candidate.

187
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,140
He has no old and no party with the Xue family.

188
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,140
But the Ministry of Revenue...

189
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,740
The Ministry of Revenue is the general of the Langjiang Provincial.

190
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,940
What do you think?

191
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,940
How do I know that

192
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,540
there is a Miss Jiang in the capital

193
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,340
who is the daughter of Jiang Boyou?

194
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,940
I also heard that

195
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,340
you and Miss Jiang are close.

196
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,940
I'm not sure about the teacher's will.

197
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,140
I don't know how close they are.

198
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,140
Forget it.

199
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,340
Although Jiang Boyou may not be capable of anything,

200
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,140
he is very cautious.

201
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,940
Xie Qing, you are a good person.

202
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,540
Let him be the top.

203
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,140
But he is not qualified to be the emperor.

204
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,740
What did you say?

205
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,140
You are a good person?

206
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,940
Why is it so sudden?

207
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,740
The common man

208
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,140
has to be a third-year Wu Zai.

209
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,940
He can come back and take over the top position.

210
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,340
Why are you so good at it?

211
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,940
This is so strange.

212
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,340
What do you think? I still think it's strange.

213
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,740
I thought

214
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,340
I was sitting in this position and making a fuss.

215
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,140
But I didn't expect that

216
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,740
there is such a chance.

217
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,340
Hui Jie, write a letter to the palace.

218
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,140
Ask around.

219
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,340
Wait.

220
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,340
Madam, what letter do you want to write?

221
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,340
Why can't I write a letter?

222
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,340
What's the matter with the girl in the palace

223
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,340
who wrote a letter to the palace?

224
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,740
I said, Madam, do you think that the palace

225
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,340
is a place?

226
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,740
If you want to know what the news is,

227
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,140
you can.

228
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,140
Fine, fine.

229
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,740
I won't ask around.

230
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,140
You can write a letter

231
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,940
and listen to the rules of the palace.

232
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,740
Don't worry.

233
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,940
Don't you know

234
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,540
I'm looking at Hui Jie's marriage recently.

235
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,340
I can see that

236
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,340
she is still in love with our family.

237
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,940
You are now a relative.

238
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,540
That's different.

239
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,940
Maybe

240
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,340
it's a good thing for Hui Jie's marriage.

241
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,940
In this case,

242
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,740
how can I let the palace

243
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,340
ruin the marriage?

244
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,740
Madam,

245
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,140
that's the reason.

246
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,140
So you have to be careful.

247
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,740
How can I be careful?

248
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,740
Tell me clearly.

249
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,740
Don't ask me.

250
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,740
I'm worried about the mess.

251
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,540
I will make a fuss about this.

252
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,940
And I don't know how many people are watching me in the palace.

253
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:39,940
Mother,

254
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,340
I'm afraid that you don't know the power of this.

255
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,140
That's why I want to be the master of the palace.

256
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,540
Did you hear that?

257
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,540
Hui Jie has seen it.

258
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,540
I don't believe you have such a good heart.

259
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,740
We are still the same.

260
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,940
Besides,

261
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,540
if we get good news like this

262
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,340
from our family,

263
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,340
we won't tell her.

264
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,740
If you know,

265
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,140
you will be in trouble.

266
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,940
Father,

267
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,340
as you said,

268
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,340
write a letter to the palace.

269
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,740
But remember,

270
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,340
write nice and gentle words.

271
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,940
Don't even think about it.

272
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,540
Yes.

273
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,340
You've done your job.

274
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,740
Thank you, Master.

275
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,540
The King of the Palace

276
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,540
Episode 12

277
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,940
The letter?

278
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,140
The wolf will suddenly pay attention to my father?

279
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,340
Last time, I didn't participate in the battle with Yan Xue.

280
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,540
That's why the Jiang family didn't enter the palace.

281
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,540
Now I'm helping Xie Wei, the weak and the Xue family,

282
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,940
to get the blessing from the Ying Huo

283
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,140
and give my father a crown.

284
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,940
Does this mean that

285
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,340
everything still has a chance to change?

286
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,540
Retreat!

287
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,540
Retreat!

288
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,540
Retreat!

289
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,540
Retreat!

290
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,540
Retreat!

291
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,940
My Lord, the message from Feige is coming back.

292
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,540
Why isn't he here yet?

293
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,140
Retreat!

294
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,540
Retreat!

295
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,940
Go!

296
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,540
Retreat!

297
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,140
Qi Feng, catch them!

298
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,740
Father, what's going on?

299
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,940
It's the Xue family.

300
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,540
The Xue family is so bold.

301
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,140
This letter is not far from the capital.

302
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,140
They dare to assassinate father in this letter.

303
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,540
They didn't come here because of me.

304
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,340
They are...

305
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,940
Retreat!

306
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,540
Retreat!

307
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,540
Retreat!

308
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,540
Retreat!

309
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,540
Father!

310
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,140
Qi Feng!

311
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,540
Qi Feng!

312
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,540
Come!

313
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,140
Retreat!

314
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,140
Search carefully for the Zha family!

315
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,140
Yes!

316
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,740
If that's the case,

317
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,340
I need to tell you some needs.

318
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,140
I searched carefully.

319
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,740
Brother Yinsi, take a look.

320
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:47,140
Let's wait for our next report.

321
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,740
Brother Yinsi?

322
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,860
no matter I can find out the news with this photo card?

323
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,380
It doesn't have to be the StarH supporter.

324
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,780
He found it clearly as a culprit,

325
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,860
but that duty mainknown back then

326
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,180
wasn't responsible.

327
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,300
And it was forced just now.

328
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,380
It's Master,

329
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,260
who told the neighbors to turnov it.

330
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,940
")

331
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,060
Miss Jiang, how dare you

332
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,960
built a acho nave in the imperial palace?

333
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,180
Get up.

334
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:35,560
Get out of the way.

335
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,320
Thats right.

336
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:37,600
Go back.

337
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:38,920
Move.

338
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,940
Get out.

339
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,940
Get some rest.

340
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,620
Get out.

341
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,020
Move.

342
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,720
The Ci N99...

343
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,320
Strike!

344
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,820
Crown Prince, His Majesty ordered

345
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,320
to supressBI bone-over on crroat and spleen

346
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,520
and couldn't approve it.

347
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,020
Didn't you hear what I said?

348
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,720
My father takes the לשtok route

349
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,720
to find a doctor!

350
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,520
Bin, I've already informed theなる

351
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,220
that a royal decree will arrive.

352
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,520
Crown Prince,andan� treadmill.

353
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,820
Silent Chamber of Repentance

354
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,820
How dare you talk back?

355
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,620
Look carefully. What is this?

356
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,740
The evidence is true.

357
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,940
What else do you have to say?

358
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,140
This is not my thing.

359
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,060
You searched it in your room.

360
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,460
How dare you say it's not yours?

361
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,180
According to what the palace officials said,

362
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,500
my room is in the palace.

363
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,660
This paper was searched by me in the room.

364
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,340
It was searched in the palace.

365
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,620
Who should it be?

366
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,620
You're so rude.

367
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,380
I think you're not good at sight, not tired.

368
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,900
I have to tell you today that

369
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,100
you can't think of a place

370
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:45,940
that you can't think of.

371
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,660
Come on.

372
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,940
Take her to the heart center.

373
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,260
How dare you!

374
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,300
I'm the daughter of the imperial uncle.

375
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,100
How can you take me

376
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,540
to the capital of Princess Zhang's family?

377
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,220
The palace is in charge of the internal affairs.

378
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,100
Is it qualified?

379
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:01,980
Of course not.

380
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,380
The palace is in charge of the internal affairs.

381
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,980
The same thing is in the palace.

382
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,460
But I'm not a concubine.

383
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,620
I'm not a palace servant.

384
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,260
You're not qualified to punish me.

385
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,060
But the investigation is under the Empress Dowager's order.

386
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,100
Then let the Empress Dowager

387
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,140
ask me personally.

388
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,380
Eunuch Huang,

389
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,980
I think you're an old man in the palace.

390
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,180
I'll tell you a few words.

391
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,740
The Imperial Physician of the Imperial Physician

392
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,380
wants to kill me.

393
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,620
I'm a weak woman.

394
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,180
But please understand.

395
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,340
If the Empress Dowager proves that I'm innocent,

396
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,380
there will be three short stories in the Imperial Physician.

397
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,860
Can you bear to do it alone?

398
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,500
If you can't remember the main story,

399
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,260
then go find the person who can do it.

400
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,060
Please tell the Taian Hall.

401
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,620
Just say that Jiang Xue Ning is in the palace.

402
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,580
She's in the prison.

403
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,660
She's been framed.

404
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,740
Please punish the Empress Dowager.

405
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,700
Why is she assassinated?

406
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,740
What about Lv Xian?

407
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,340
She's not the one who let her watch over the Yan family and Xue family.

408
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:46,780
She's a human.

409
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,300
Mr. Lv pretended to be in the prison.

410
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,900
He helped the Prince Jiang to send her back to the Empress Dowager.

411
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,900
He's been sent back to the Empress Dowager.

412
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,780
He's been treated by the Imperial Physician.

413
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,580
He won't be in trouble.

414
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,460
You're getting old.

415
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,820
You're injured in the battlefield.

416
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,940
Are you afraid that you'll get a disease?

417
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,060
Have you prepared the carriage?

418
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:57,980
I've prepared it.

419
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:58,900
But, Mr. Lv,

420
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,100
you're being rashly punished.

421
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,780
Don't you want to expose the Yan family's concern?

422
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,860
If Xue Yuan knows,

423
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,540
she'll treat you.

424
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,620
Why don't you let me do it?

425
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,700
This is a trap.

426
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,140
Xue Yuan is not a stupid person.

427
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,380
He's a wounded man.

428
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,740
He must have a back-up.

429
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,860
I won't go to him personally.

430
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,140
I'm really worried.

431
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,380
Sir, something bad happened.

432
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,740
The new guard was in a big mess.

433
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,100
He said there's a gang outside the city.

434
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,420
He's going to be in the city.

435
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,620
Lv Xian went to Dr. Liu.

436
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,580
But he was stopped in the clinic.

437
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,620
He can't go out.

438
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,180
He's being too rash.

439
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,740
He deliberately didn't let the doctor come in.

440
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,500
Uncle Jian,

441
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,180
go and bring the token to me.

442
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,420
I'll bring it in myself.

443
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,220
Yes.

444
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,420
And, sir,

445
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,660
there's news from the palace.

446
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,220
Miss Shu Qing'er

447
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,220
has also happened.

448
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,180
What?

449
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,940
Xue Ning,

450
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,980
what's going on with that paper?

451
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,100
Why are you so stubborn?

452
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,180
How could you have such a relationship?

453
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,420
You're not alone.

454
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,620
You're going to drag us together.

455
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,740
What's the point?

456
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,700
It was originally from your room.

457
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,260
What's the point of having a relationship?

458
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,340
Someone wants to harm me.

459
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,180
I'm going to drag a few people in my back.

460
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,260
I want to make a fuss about it.

461
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,460
I don't want to think about it.

462
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,140
What do you mean?

463
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,100
Do you suspect us?

464
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,180
If it's true,

465
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,660
what's the harm?

466
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,580
This paper is from Yang Zhizhai.

467
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,340
We can't escape from the trap.

468
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,300
Instead of being picked by others,

469
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,460
it's better to go to the Empress Dowager

470
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,420
to find out the truth.

471
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,780
That's a good thing.

472
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,380
It's a good thing to have a good family.

473
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,140
Let's just explain it clearly.

474
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,340
I think the Empress Dowager

475
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,340
is not a part of the public.

476
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,660
The Empress Dowager has a paper.

477
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,300
She will be sent to the Taian Hall

478
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,580
to interrogate her.

479
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,340
Miss Jiang,

480
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,860
the Empress Dowager has a paper.

481
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,100
She will be sent to the Taian Hall

482
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,860
to interrogate her.

483
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,580
Eunuch Huang, can we go back?

484
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,380
The Empress Dowager said

485
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,020
all the poison is needed.

486
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,620
We have to interrogate her clearly.

487
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,500
In case someone doesn't like it,

488
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,180
the heart doesn't like it either.

489
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,580
If there are words like this,

490
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,260
or he strongly believes in thebürgist fears,

491
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,980
he can only lie to the Empress Dowager.

492
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,980
Although he doesn't like it,

493
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,620
he can only prove that he diaspora background.

494
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,900
I have energy and the fear online.

495
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,260
This is what's future.

496
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,780
Maybe the Empress Dowager

497
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,980
can't keep him from やing.

498
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:32,980
Please leave.

499
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,600
SpringMYii nhyeong

500
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:52,160
May the automatior

501
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,000
Very characters

502
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,540
It's a good sign

503
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,740
Thank you sir

504
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,800
With all your efforts

505
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,120
I want to want to

506
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,000
My lord.

507
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:06,800
My lord.

508
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,320
It's not a good night.

509
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,320
Why are you here?

510
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,480
I have something to do.

511
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,800
This is my friend,

512
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,040
Mr. Lv.

513
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,360
Please come in.

514
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
It's convenient.

515
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,120
What?

516
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,600
You don't want to?

517
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,040
My lord, I don't know.

518
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,120
We are here to serve you.

519
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,200
If we blame you...

520
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,160
To serve you?

521
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,760
Who?

522
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,800
Your majesty, Ding Bo.

523
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,120
According to the paralyzed blazer,

524
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,080
Your majesty has given your GRAD neuter case to the Ministry of Justice.

525
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,240
You are an un tasked official now.

526
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,000
My lord.

527
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,240
My lord,

528
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,320
It's asemology,

529
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,180
If we don't give it to Your majesty,

530
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,240
It might not lead to any good confrontant among the departments.

531
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,480
Move away.

532
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,120
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

533
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,120
My wife is waiting for me.

534
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,120
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

535
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,120
Now the whole Houshigou tribe is in danger.

536
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,120
I'll ask Dao Qing to take you in secretly.

537
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,120
You must ensure His Lordship's safety.

538
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,120
I have to go to the palace.

539
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,120
I'll be back soon.

540
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,120
I'm afraid this time,

541
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,120
you can't leave this time.

542
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,120
His Lordship's injury is not that simple.

543
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,120
What do you mean?

544
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,120
His Lordship has been fighting for years.

545
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,120
How could a normal sword injury be so serious?

546
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,120
I'm afraid this sword injury is very painful.

547
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,120
This is not the way Xinwu Wei is supposed to be.

548
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,120
It's like...

549
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,120
Gong Yi Cheng.

550
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,120
Your Highness.

551
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,120
Your Highness.

552
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,120
Your Highness.

553
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,120
I've been searching the palace for you.

554
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,120
But I found out that Yang Zhi is in the room

555
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,120
and has been searching this room from Jiang Xue Ning.

556
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,120
It's a book.

557
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,120
If I didn't look carefully, I might not have found it.

558
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,120
You've got the power to speak.

559
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,120
You're amazing.

560
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,120
You're making a fuss at night.

561
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,120
What's the point of being so depressed?

562
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,120
Your Highness.

563
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,120
I'm just a little girl.

564
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,120
How could I collude with the opposition?

565
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,120
And I'm the one who's left behind.

566
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,120
I've been writing to myself in the Feng Chen Hall

567
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,120
these days.

568
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,120
I'm afraid I can't be the one to blame.

569
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,120
I'm afraid I can't be the one to blame.

570
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,120
I've been writing to myself in the Feng Chen Hall

571
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,120
these days.

572
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,120
I'm afraid I can't be the one to blame.

573
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,120
Please investigate it, Your Highness.

574
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,120
I don't know why this letter

575
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,120
appeared in my room.

576
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,120
It's not what I think.

577
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,120
You're making yourself so depressed.

578
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,120
I'm just a little girl.

579
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,120
I'm not in a hurry.

580
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,120
You're different from the one

581
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,120
who invited you to the wedding.

582
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:18,120
Your father is a new minister of the Ministry of Revenue.

583
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,120
Jiang Boyou?

584
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,120
Yes.

585
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,120
I heard that

586
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,120
the Jiang family and Yongyi Marquis's Mansion

587
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,120
are close.

588
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,120
You seem to be very close to Yanlin.

589
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,120
Your Highness, you're right.

590
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,120
This is a secret.

591
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,120
Yongyi Marquis's Mansion is expensive.

592
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,120
It's hard to get married in a city.

593
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,120
Nonsense.

594
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,120
You and Yanlin only want to talk about the wedding.

595
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,120
You still want to keep me company?

596
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,120
Uncle, what's the deal with Yanlin?

597
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,120
Her Highness the Empress Dowager has her own merits.

598
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,120
We're in the same boat.

599
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,120
Her Highness the Empress Dowager must teach Yongyi Marquis

600
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,120
to be in a mess.

601
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,120
I can't let Yanlin get away with it.

602
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,120
But if in this palace,

603
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,120
they say that

604
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,120
how can I wash Yan family and my suspicion?

605
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,120
Your Majesty.

606
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,120
I'm here.

607
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,120
Take her away.

608
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,120
Stop the war.

609
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,120
Let her stay here.

610
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,120
I want to see if she's a woman.

611
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,120
Yes.

612
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,120
Who dares to touch me?

613
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,120
What are you doing?

614
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,120
Your Highness.

615
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,120
I'm in charge of the imperial court.

616
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,120
I can't interfere in the imperial court.

617
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,120
Her Highness the Empress Dowager can be in charge of the imperial court.

618
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,120
I'm the one in charge of the imperial court.

619
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,120
If I'm in charge of the imperial court,

620
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,120
I'll be in charge of the imperial court.

621
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,120
Why are you using your personal interests?

622
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,120
You're being a coward.

623
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,120
I dare not.

624
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,120
I'm just a woman who doesn't respect you.

625
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,120
I'm also a woman who is a minister.

626
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,120
I've been in charge of the imperial court for a long time.

627
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,120
I can't let His Majesty take the imperial court

628
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,120
and take the imperial court.

629
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,120
I can't let the court report the case.

630
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,120
I can't let the court investigate.

631
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,120
Her Highness the Empress Dowager has a decree.

632
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,120
She'll be in charge of the imperial court.

633
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,120
I'm not afraid of being punished.

634
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,120
I'll be in charge of the imperial court.

635
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,120
You're so bold.

636
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,120
Who's there?

637
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,120
Yes.

638
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,120
If the imperial court is in the palace,

639
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,120
what's the matter?

640
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,120
I just want to take a look.

641
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,120
I'm afraid that the imperial court

642
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,120
might not have someone to bear the burden.

643
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,120
I know that

644
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,120
the Empress Dowager wants the truth.

645
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,120
But she's not a body that's not clear.

646
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,120
What a cunning tongue.

647
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,120
It seems that I can't control you.

648
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,120
Then I'll find someone who can cure you.

649
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,120
Guards.

650
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,120
Yes.

651
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,120
Take my token to the Ministry of Justice

652
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,120
and find someone who can solve the case.

653
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,120
But Your Highness,

654
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,120
the Ministry of Justice is in the south.

655
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,120
It's a time of a time.

656
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,120
Then let's go with Miss Jiang.

657
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,120
Yes.

658
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,120
I have to take the anonymity challenge off of you.

659
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,120
Just go and search.

660
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,120
Yes.

661
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,100
since these egent Plasma Sutra came,

662
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,220
so you should obey the order.

663
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,060
Tomorrow is the粉 woodов!

664
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,720
As long as we calculate the профile texts for this…

665
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,500
.....

666
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,380
Hear aei...

667
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,220
Su, you know anyway!

668
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,500
اخ Mateis, you both need to tell me clearly!

669
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,060
I'll do it myself.

670
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,380
Isn't this ridiculous?

671
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,260
I'm not doing anything right.

672
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,860
Can the Empress Dowager let me check?

673
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,740
I'm thinking about it.

674
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,660
Stop thinking.

675
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,140
This is the token that His Majesty gave to the late emperor.

676
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,260
Lord Chen, don't think so much.

677
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,340
We're really sorry.

678
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,220
I have to think about it.

679
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,500
Lord Chen, the palace maid is here.

680
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,180
Lord Chen, it's your turn today.

681
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,740
The Empress Dowager has ordered

682
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,900
that you come with me to the palace.

683
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,540
He's the only one who's making trouble.

684
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,900
Let's follow him.

685
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,980
What's the point?

686
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,940
Didn't you hear what the Empress Dowager said?

687
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,100
If it wasn't for Miss Jiang,

688
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,380
we would all be suspicious.

689
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,980
Of course, we can't follow the rules.

690
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,900
Sister Fang Miang,

691
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,460
can you check the paper?

692
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,100
Can you see who the paper is?

693
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,100
It's already this time.

694
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,220
What are you counting?

695
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,180
Just take it.

696
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,620
It's been a while since you've been kneeling.

697
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,820
Aren't you tired, Miss Jiang?

698
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,940
Your Majesty,

699
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,340
I'm tired.

700
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,460
I'm just dying.

701
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,220
I don't dare to thank you.

702
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,460
I heard that

703
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,540
even if you're a living person,

704
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,340
you should take three-layered leather.

705
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,660
If you keep pushing your tongue,

706
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,900
I'm afraid you won't be able to use it for half a minute.

707
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:30,020
Gu Ren Yun is kind to the heart.

708
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,380
He's been in a bad mood for a long time.

709
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,740
As long as he can wash and brush his hair,

710
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,140
he won't let the heartless person destroy me.

711
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,900
Why should he suffer?

712
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,020
It's not tiring to not see the officials.

713
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,060
Fine.

714
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,700
I'll see.

715
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,140
How long can you endure this pain?

716
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,060
Your Highness, here comes the person.

717
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:02,860
I, the Minister of Justice, am here to greet you, Your Highness.

718
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:07,500
I, the Minister of Justice, am here to greet you, Your Highness.

719
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,900
All right.

720
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,140
I'm taking you to the fate, your Majesty.

721
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,340
Sir, you're all the harvests.

722
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,940
Just a short while.

723
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,940
I've already told you about the case.

724
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,940
Then you two can have a good look at it.

725
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:50,940
Let's see what kind of person is behind it.

726
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:54,940
Let's ask where the evidence is today.

727
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,940
Mr. Chen, please have a look.

728
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,940
Mr. Zhang, you're here.

729
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,940
I'm here to see what's going on.

730
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,940
Let's see.

731
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,940
Bai Lu Zhi, a common person who lives in the capital,

732
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,940
is a self-proclaimed person.

733
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,940
On the way here, he has been invited to the book of the contents of the jade seal.

734
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,940
It's true that the contents of this letter are meaningless.

735
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,940
What Mr. Zhang meant is that

736
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,940
whoever has this in their hands,

737
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,940
will be involved in the jade seal.

738
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,940
It's not necessary.

739
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,940
The evidence is so clear.

740
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,940
It's not necessary.

741
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,940
What's the point of Mr. Zhang's intention?

742
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,940
It's complicated to find out what's going on with the jade seal.

743
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,940
It's a lawful and unlawful case.

744
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,940
It's not a single paper.

745
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,940
It's not a crime.

746
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,940
It's also necessary to investigate the source.

747
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,940
Mr. Zhang, you're indeed a hostage.

748
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,940
Of course.

749
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,940
Who is the person who asked this?

750
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,940
When and where did you get it?

751
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,940
I'm the one who ordered it to be in the palace.

752
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,940
The evidence is clear tonight.

753
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,940
The jade seal is removed.

754
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,940
The evidence is in the Jiang Xue Ning's room.

755
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,940
The room is very big.

756
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,940
What's the point of not asking?

757
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,940
It's a book on the book.

758
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,940
It's hidden very well.

759
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,940
If we didn't look carefully,

760
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,940
we wouldn't have found it.

761
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,940
What book?

762
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,940
This...

763
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,940
Answer me.

764
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,940
I don't know much about words.

765
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,940
I remember there are four words on the book.

766
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,940
It's just a picture.

767
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,940
What about the book?

768
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,940
It's not a single paper.

769
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,940
I'm asking you.

770
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,940
This...

771
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,940
It's a fake.

772
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,940
I only left this book on the case.

773
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,940
I just read it

774
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,940
before the imperial aunt came to investigate.

775
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,940
The other things on the case are all notes and fingerprints.

776
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,940
I remember it clearly.

777
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,940
Your Highness,

778
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,940
the girl in charge of this girl's face is not right.

779
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,940
Can you allow her to get up first?

780
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,940
If Chen Zhikong interrogates her,

781
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,940
she will faint.

782
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,940
She will be quiet.

783
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,940
I'm afraid that

784
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,940
she won't give me the Tai'an Hall first.

785
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,940
It's good.

786
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,940
Get up.

787
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,940
Yes.

788
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,940
Please, Your Excellency,

789
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,940
resign yourself to Chen Yu.

790
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,940
It's not Chen Yu's fault.

791
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,940
She is innocent.

792
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,940
How can she resign?

793
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,940
Can Chen Yu prove herself to Miss Jiang Er?

794
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:45,940
Your Highness,

795
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:46,940
Lord Zhang,

796
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,940
Chen Yu is a little bit clumsy.

797
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,940
Miss Jiang Er's first writing is the form.

798
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,940
She has learned to write with you.

799
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,940
But she is like a child who studies in the mountain.

800
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,940
She can't write herself.

801
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,940
Thank you, Miss Xue.

802
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,940
You have your own opinion.

803
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,940
But you have your own way of writing.

804
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,940
I don't think so.

805
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,940
Eunuch Hong.

806
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,940
Lord Zhang.

807
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,940
Who knows

808
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,940
you are going to Yangzhi's house to investigate?

809
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,940
The money is big.

810
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,940
I'm afraid that there will be a trap.

811
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,940
I don't dare to make a fuss about it.

812
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,940
Eunuch Long will be under the control of some eunuchs.

813
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,940
But...

814
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,940
Ask the Ministry of Justice.

815
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,940
Just answer the question.

816
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,940
Yes.

817
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,940
But I have the order from the Empress Dowager.

818
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,940
I will start investigating from the Western Palace.

819
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,940
Yangzhi's house is a crime scene.

820
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,940
There are two officials in the middle.

821
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,940
Maybe they have gone crazy.

822
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,940
Eunuch Hong,

823
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,940
where is Yangzhi's palace now?

824
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:41,940
Such a big thing happened.

825
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,940
The palace rules are suspended.

826
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,940
But

827
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,940
all the officials who have been to Yangzhi's house today

828
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,940
should be suspended

829
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,940
from the government to the court.

830
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,940
All the officials who are still here

831
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,940
should be suspended.

832
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,940
Lord Zhang means

833
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,940
he wants to prove that this is a trap.

834
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,940
Why don't you ask

835
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,940
who is the suspect?

836
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,940
Empress Dowager is in a serious condition.

837
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,940
If she proves that this is a trap,

838
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,940
it's not difficult to get involved with Miss Jiang Er.

839
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,940
Lord Zhang, you have a way?

840
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:16,940
The palace is under the control of the Ministry of Justice.

841
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,940
The Ministry of Justice has been investigating the crime.

842
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,940
If Miss Jiang Er is not the one

843
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,940
who bought the checkup,

844
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,940
then the man who did the crime

845
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,940
should be in this palace.

846
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:30,940
Three knives for one of the soldiers.

847
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,940
Two knives for the white paper.

848
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,940
The medical products in the palace are all fixed.

849
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,940
They are not allowed to be separated by fire.

850
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,940
They are also used to collect medical supplies

851
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,940
to control the smoke.

852
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,940
This paper is the white paper used in the palace.

853
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,940
How many people have been sent by Yangzhi?

854
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,940
How many have been used?

855
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,940
There should be a record in the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

856
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,940
Empress Dowager is suspecting that

857
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,940
this is written by Miss Jiang Er.

858
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,940
It's as if there are thousands of them.

859
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,940
Why don't you send the Ministry of Internal Affairs

860
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,940
to investigate the paper of Yangzhi?

861
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,940
If Miss Jiang Er's paper is not the one

862
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,940
who bought the checkup, then there is no evidence.

863
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,940
The suspect of this crime should be in the heaven.

864
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,940
Zhang Zhe is so serious.

865
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,940
He is speaking in a wrong way.

866
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,940
Is he thinking?

867
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,940
Uncle, is something wrong?

868
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,940
Nothing.

869
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:34,940
From the start, the checkup is indeed a different story.

870
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,940
It's just that the paper is not the one

871
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,940
who wrote the paper.

872
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,940
It's not as good as the paper.

873
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,940
It's not the one who wrote the paper.

874
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,940
Maybe it's his reason.

875
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,940
This is a way.

876
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,940
Imperial Concubine.

877
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,940
I'll go and investigate.

878
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,940
Wait.

879
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,940
Yangzhi is a man of the past.

880
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,940
The checkup is a matter of the past.

881
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,940
If there is any money to pay for the palace eulogy,

882
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,940
why not ask them to help?

883
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,940
After all, they have served the poison.

884
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,940
The night is dark.

885
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,940
It's dangerous to mediate with the minister

886
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,940
and the minister's case.

887
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,940
It's also too long to delay.

888
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,940
Just do as Minister Zhang said.

889
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,940
Yes.

890
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,940
Please allow me to wait outside.

891
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,940
Yes.

892
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,940
The housekeeper of my daughter is very delicate

893
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,940
and has a personal background.

894
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,940
Minister Zhang has ordered the palace eulogy to investigate.

895
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,940
I'm not sure which girl

896
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,940
has offended Yangzhi.

897
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,940
Disgusting.

898
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,940
In front of the Empress, don't be so rude.

899
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,940
Minister Zhang, you should give me a hint.

900
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,940
How many of the girls in Jiang's family

901
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,940
are involved in the case?

902
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,940
Does Minister Chen really care about them?

903
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,940
Of course.

904
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:51,940
We are not always in a serious case.

905
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,940
I am a minister.

906
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,940
Of course I care about them.

907
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,940
Otherwise, I won't be like you.

908
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,940
You asked me to come here.

909
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,940
I'm just worried that the truth is not as the Empress Dowager wishes.

910
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,940
If the Empress Dowager blames me,

911
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,940
I'm afraid that someone will punish me.

912
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,940
Minister Zhang, you are right.

913
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,940
I'm at least your superior.

914
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,940
How can I let you bear the responsibility alone?

915
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,940
It's okay.

916
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,940
I only care about the case.

917
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,940
I'll share the truth with you later.

918
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,940
His Majesty is here.

919
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,940
Greetings, Your Majesty.

920
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,940
In the face of the news of the Tianan Hall,

921
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,940
do you know what happened?

922
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:30,940
How did you find out?

923
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,940
I found out the key point.

924
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,940
I asked someone to go to Yangzhi Village

925
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,940
to report to the Imperial Department of Internal Affairs.

926
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,940
Doctor, how is my father?

927
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,940
He's finally stable.

928
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,940
He needs to take some medicine.

929
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,940
He's fine.

930
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,940
Thank you, Doctor.

931
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,940
Thank you for your help.

932
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:05,940
Okay.

933
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,940
I'll take you out.

934
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,940
I'll go.

935
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,940
I'll go.

936
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,940
I'll go.

937
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,940
I'll go.

938
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,940
I'll go.

939
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,940
I'll go.

940
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,940
Thank you for your help.

941
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,940
I didn't tell the Prince Yin

942
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,940
about the poison.

943
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,940
I'm very grateful for your help.

944
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,940
You did it.

945
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,940
Actually, you are not a good swordsman.

946
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:46,940
But the poison is very poisonous.

947
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,940
My father has never seen such a poison.

948
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,940
Thank you for your help.

949
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,940
Thank you, Doctor Liu.

950
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:57,940
Daoqing, send Doctor Liu out.

951
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,940
Yes.

952
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,940
Doctor Liu, this way, please.

953
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,940
The poison is hidden.

954
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,940
But the Prince Yin is so sensitive.

955
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,940
He's so stubborn.

956
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,940
He only knows how to turn the Xue family

957
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,940
into a criminal.

958
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,940
I'll let him be quiet.

959
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,940
The Xue family is indeed

960
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,940
the most important thing.

961
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,940
But the poison is from the Prince of Pingnan.

962
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,940
It seems that the Palace of Justice

963
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,940
has already killed the people in the family.

964
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,940
He wants to take the money from the Xue family

965
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,940
and remove the Prince Yin.

966
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:34,940
I'm afraid the Xue family

967
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,940
will not know

968
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,940
what other people do.

969
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,940
Indeed.

970
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,940
But the Palace of Justice is under the case.

971
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,940
We are well-known.

972
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,940
He knows your identity.

973
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,940
It's hard for us to get together.

974
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,940
Let Daoqing find the Palace of Justice as soon as possible.

975
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,940
I must see him.

976
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,940
We have a lot of things to do today.

977
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,940
You can think about how to stay here tomorrow.

978
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,940
If His Majesty finds out

979
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:57,940
about your case of the Hou family,

980
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,940
we must find the original statement.

981
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:01,940
Don't worry.

982
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:03,940
I'll take care of it.

983
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,940
Sir.

984
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,940
Why are you here?

985
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:08,940
How is the Palace of Justice?

986
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,940
It's a coincidence.

987
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,940
I'm going to follow your order

988
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,940
to send Chen Ying to your palace.

989
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,940
Who sent the people to

990
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,940
arrest the suspect?

991
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:18,940
What is the motive?

992
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:19,940
It's a trap.

993
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,940
Ning'er is not a character who is a generation.

994
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,940
She must be able to make things worse.

995
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,940
The suspect accepted the case

996
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:29,940
but found that the suspect

997
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,940
was a new person in the palace.

998
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,940
He didn't want to let the other party go.

999
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,940
It's the beginning of the case.

1000
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:37,940
Chen Ying said he wouldn't arrest the suspect.

1001
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:38,940
He didn't want to go.

1002
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:39,940
But Zhang Zhen

1003
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,940
was also in the arrest.

1004
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,940
Chen Ying knew that he was the suspect.

1005
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:44,940
So she took him with her.

1006
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:45,940
Zhang Zhen?

1007
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:51,940
Your Majesty, please calm down.

1008
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,940
The suspect is very serious.

1009
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,940
He will be arrested one day.

1010
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,940
He is in a big trouble for this.

1011
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,940
Even His Majesty is shocked.

1012
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,940
You are so capable.

1013
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,940
Your Highness.

1014
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,940
The party is not over.

1015
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,940
The palace is full of people.

1016
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,940
Your Majesty and Your Highness are very kind.

1017
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:08,940
You should take care of it.

1018
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:14,940
Your Majesty.

1019
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:15,940
Your Highness.

1020
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,940
I ordered the He Cha Yangzhi to remove the paper.

1021
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:18,940
The Inner Affairs Bureau

1022
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:20,940
is only 16 channels of the White Path.

1023
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,940
The Royal Highness has the idea

1024
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,940
to guide the White Path for Jiang Xue Ning.

1025
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:25,940
It's been a long time.

1026
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:26,940
Cut the crap.

1027
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:27,940
You said that there was only one.

1028
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:28,940
That's right.

1029
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,940
There is one more.

1030
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:33,940
The evidence is clear.

1031
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,940
Now you are talking.

1032
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:36,940
Where is the other one?

1033
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,940
The one who is the most important person in the world.

1034
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,940
The one who is the most important person in the world.

1035
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,940
The one who is the most important person in the world.

1036
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,940
The one who is the most important person in the world.

1037
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:47,940
The one who is the most important person in the world.

1038
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,940
The one who is the most important person in the world.

1039
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:51,940
The one who is the most important person in the world.

1040
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,940
The one who is the most important person in the world.

1041
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,940
The one who is the most important person in the world.

1042
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,940
The one who is the most important person in the world.

1043
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,940
The one who is the most important person in the world.

1044
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,940
The one who is the most important person in the world.

1045
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,940
The one who is the most important person in the world.

1046
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,940
The one who is the most important person in the world.

1047
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,940
Use a piece of dark night

1048
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,940
to light up the fire in an instant.

1049
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:19,940
Take half of the clear-hearted dream to me.

1050
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:24,940
I would have been wrongly chosen by fate.

1051
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:28,940
I am not the one who is the most important person in the world.

1052
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:34,940
But I don't know the day when I fall.

1053
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,940
You came.

1054
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:46,940
Use a few tears to exchange another half worth.

1055
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:54,940
I thought I would let go of the best choice in memory.

1056
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,940
I was chased by a wind and a rain.

1057
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:01,940
I couldn't remove the ink.

1058
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:06,940
Although there are moments that drift away,

1059
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:11,940
grind them again in one empty moment.

1060
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,940
I will never forget you

1061
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,940
I will never forget you

1062
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,940
I will never forget you

1063
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:39,940
I will never forget you

1064
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,940
I will never forget you

1065
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,940
I will never forget you

1066
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,940
I will never forget you

1067
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,940
I will never forget you

1068
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,940
I will never forget you

1069
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:51,940
I will never forget you

1070
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,940
I will never forget you

1071
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,940
I will never forget you

1072
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,940
I will never forget you

1073
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,940
I will never forget you
