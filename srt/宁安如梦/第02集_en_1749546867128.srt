1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
As long as I can enter the Ning'an Palace

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,200
and pay all the price

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,600
I will be willing to do my best

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,400
The End

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,800
The End

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,800
Everything seems to be a dream

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,400
I have owed a lot of people

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,800
Chaozhe, help me

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,600
I will be a good person after this

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
The End

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
I will be the one to take the favor

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,800
There are some things you can't give me

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
But what about them?

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,000
The life you chose is for Mr. You

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,400
In this world, everyone has the right to escape

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,000
But I can't

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,000
I want to regret it

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,400
and do the wrong thing

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,200
and go back in time

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Does Mr. Zhang believe that everything is decided?

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I would rather believe in the future

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,000
Your Highness

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,800
Your Highness

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,200
The End

26
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,000
Ning'an, what are you doing?

27
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,000
In the Ming Dynasty

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,600
there was always a pair of hands

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,600
that could break everything

30
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,400
The revenge is long

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,600
Who are you in the end?

32
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,600
The Emperor of the mortal world is so long

33
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,000
and he is so ridiculous

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,600
so foolish

35
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,960
命乃轻

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Xii Zhang

37
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,600
The End

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,240
Stop now, Your Highness.

39
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,960
Stay calm!

40
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,020
Yaoning這個當然都知道我要要走的了

41
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,300
我等著也不知道

42
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:06,900
行 Сейчас就走

43
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,820
就走了

44
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,000
禮物

45
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,360
You cook here

46
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,160
How could I know I was a bad person?

47
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,560
I was not a good person for the emperor.

48
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,680
As for Your Highness,

49
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,720
the person you can live to this day

50
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,520
is already my biggest person.

51
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,960
When I was sick and confused,

52
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,560
I once had some grudges against Your Highness.

53
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,080
However, Your Highness was not in good spirits at that time.

54
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,720
I was heartless.

55
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,000
After returning to the army, I tried to talk to her.

56
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,400
But Her Highness didn't remember.

57
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,200
That's why Her Highness has been alive for years.

58
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,960
Otherwise,

59
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,400
the person Xie Mu Feng is,

60
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,200
Her Highness will be punished with her own hands.

61
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,360
Xie Wei didn't kill me in the future.

62
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,320
It's because I don't remember and I'm not smart.

63
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,880
But her performance today is very impressive.

64
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,560
If she finds out that she's useful,

65
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,880
she will immediately kill me.

66
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,000
Miss, what's wrong?

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,480
Oh, let me ask you.

68
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,280
Does that person Xie Mu Feng often come to your home?

69
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,680
Why didn't I think of him?

70
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,680
Master Xie Mu Feng is in the same court.

71
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,120
He came to me at the same time.

72
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,800
It's because of the fact that he and Miss Hu were in the same class.

73
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,160
He's even more good at breaking the rules.

74
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,000
But there are indeed good-natured people who haven't come to the manor.

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,080
Master Xie was born in the Xie family.

76
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,280
He has all the fame of the Wenhe family in the capital.

77
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,760
Even if you offend Yier, you don't have to worry too much.

78
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,520
Wenhe?

79
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,640
What happened today is what you saw.

80
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,360
How are you feeling?

81
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,960
Miss Jiang Er is smart.

82
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,600
She's a good-natured person.

83
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,960
She's a good-natured person.

84
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,200
She's a good-natured person.

85
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,080
She's different from the other people in the media.

86
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,040
Even you found out that Yan Lin didn't find out.

87
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,880
Don't you think it's a coincidence?

88
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,160
You went to Jiang's mansion to find out that Yan Lin is a good-natured person.

89
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,160
Yan Lin is in love.

90
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,720
She must be the one who hurt her.

91
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,160
She must be the one who hurt her.

92
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,480
She must be the one who hurt her.

93
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,320
This is your second city's mansion.

94
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,840
You're good at hiding things.

95
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,240
You can't hide it.

96
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,160
City's mansion?

97
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,720
I can see it with my own eyes.

98
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,280
But it's just a girl.

99
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,880
Sir, do you have any plans?

100
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,320
Four years ago, she was with me to the capital.

101
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,600
I've never found that she had such a face.

102
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,400
Even I can hide it.

103
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,920
It's not that she's a good-natured person.

104
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,160
Moreover, when she was in the capital,

105
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,680
I'm afraid she already knew about my divorce.

106
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,760
And I might be found out by her.

107
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,640
There's such a thing?

108
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,520
But if someone finds out,

109
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,480
she'll definitely reveal her identity.

110
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,760
I thought she was just a little girl who was unguarded.

111
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,280
Now it seems that Yan Zhi is not pretending to be a fool.

112
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,000
Send someone to keep an eye on Jiang's mansion.

113
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,120
If you have any intentions, report it immediately.

114
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,520
Yes.

115
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,840
Sir,

116
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,080
then, do you want to remind Yan Zhi?

117
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,080
Yan family and I can't show any mercy.

118
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,920
Don't tell Yan Lin about your second case.

119
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,360
Yes.

120
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,000
Last time, I only put on one piece of paper on the back.

121
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,400
I didn't notice anything else.

122
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,360
There were too many details.

123
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,200
I don't know what Xie Wei is doing now.

124
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,360
I don't know what's the relationship between Yan Lin and her.

125
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,960
What should we do now?

126
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,560
You're still pretending to be a fool?

127
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,080
The problem is, will Xie Wei believe it?

128
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,760
Or...

129
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,160
Or...

130
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,320
we'll rely on Xie Wei?

131
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,600
But what skills and tricks can I use to make her take care of me?

132
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,440
Or should I just do nothing

133
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,000
and just do what Xie Wei does?

134
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,280
Your Highness, you have something to say.

135
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,280
When do you want to turn me off?

136
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,760
The palace of Ning'an is the empress's place.

137
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,040
Your Highness has been working hard for years.

138
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,120
You can even use your true heart to fight for it.

139
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,080
Isn't it just to make the empress's place safe?

140
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,080
Everything is as you wish.

141
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,160
What else can you do?

142
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,080
To make the empress suffer is a big sin.

143
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,240
Your Majesty has ordered me to be a spy. How can you do this?

144
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,240
A spy?

145
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,160
Your Highness thinks that just by a single drop of blood,

146
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,840
you can make the world a new place?

147
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,920
When Your Highness entered the palace,

148
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,920
she was also a half-dead princess.

149
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,560
I also envied you as a guest.

150
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,360
It seems that the guests of the discussion

151
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,560
were all white-skinned.

152
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,760
What is your relationship with Yanling?

153
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,840
You can fight together.

154
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,680
You two are not against each other.

155
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,360
Your Highness only needs to know

156
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,160
why the people are united and why they are united.

157
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,360
It's not a matter of being united.

158
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,200
And you are not united either.

159
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,680
Forget it.

160
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,280
But if she can become my subordinate...

161
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,280
No. I can't have this terrible idea.

162
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,000
No matter what, this time,

163
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,400
I must take the chance to fight the first-class.

164
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,600
Your Highness.

165
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,680
You can leave now.

166
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,280
Father.

167
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,680
You came back just in time.

168
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,680
This is your wedding ceremony.

169
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
Please have a look.

170
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,680
It's not too late. There are two months left.

171
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,680
I have something else to tell you.

172
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,680
But for the girl of the Jiang family?

173
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,680
You already know?

174
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,680
My son is dying. Where is he?

175
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,680
How can I not know?

176
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,680
Where is he? How can I not know?

177
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,880
Don't worry. I will go to the Jiang family to propose to you.

178
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,480
Really?

179
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,280
Father, you can't regret it.

180
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,280
You are the only one in my heart.

181
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,880
If she doesn't marry, I won't marry her.

182
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,280
Good. You are so lucky.

183
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,080
I was the one who was in charge of the family.

184
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,080
But you can ask the girl of the Jiang family.

185
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,480
Don't worry. You will be happy.

186
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,080
You can come back to the palace.

187
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,480
I have already thought about it.

188
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,280
When the time comes, I will express my love to her.

189
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,280
Father, you should prepare the gift early.

190
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,280
Don't waste our Ningning.

191
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,680
The second girl has been very clear lately.

192
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,280
She has made many mistakes.

193
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,480
She should have cleaned the yard.

194
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,680
She is so messy.

195
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,280
The master doesn't have the master. The servant doesn't have servants.

196
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,280
Really?

197
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,480
But she has a few brain problems.

198
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,680
She didn't talk to the master.

199
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,280
She said that I am not good at managing the family.

200
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,080
I didn't hear that.

201
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,680
Actually, the second girl will grow up.

202
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,880
You should calm down and talk to her.

203
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,680
Maybe you can be happy.

204
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,480
She has said what she should say.

205
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,080
She is still in this noisy place.

206
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,280
What else can she change?

207
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,680
I don't know what's going on.

208
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,280
I just want to see her.

209
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,080
Whether she is talking or looking at God,

210
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,480
language, or attitude,

211
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,280
I will think of that bitch.

212
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,680
I am so stupid.

213
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,680
You said that the book is very high.

214
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,080
What use is it? It has been written for four years.

215
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,680
Why is it not working at all?

216
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,880
Madam, the doctor said that you should apply medicine.

217
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,880
I can't.

218
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,880
Madam.

219
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,880
The master is here.

220
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,280
You can leave.

221
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,480
Madam, I am so happy today.

222
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,680
What makes you so happy?

223
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,280
This case is still young and old.

224
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,480
But the Qi Yi is still not old enough.

225
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,680
I found a bad man and beat him to death.

226
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,080
Look at you.

227
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,680
Xie Wei is just a crown prince.

228
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,680
Why do you think he is so close to him?

229
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,280
You are talking about the woman.

230
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,880
The emperor is like this.

231
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,280
The crown prince has been a model for the emperor.

232
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,880
He is a model for the emperor.

233
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,880
But he is still young.

234
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,280
He is so young.

235
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,880
What's the future?

236
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,480
I see.

237
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,480
You are wise.

238
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,480
By the way,

239
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,680
you also told me that the empress dowager

240
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,280
will choose the half-dead princess.

241
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,680
In the capital, there are maids and maids.

242
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,280
They will choose a good person to be the model.

243
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,880
They will choose from the palace.

244
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,680
Princess Le Yang is the most favored by the emperor and the empress dowager.

245
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,880
If she can be the half-dead princess,

246
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,480
then the family will be very happy.

247
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,880
If we can have a good wife,

248
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:31,080
then the marriage will be very meaningful to her.

249
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,680
I think the future will be very bright.

250
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,280
No wonder your daughter said that.

251
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,680
You are so biased.

252
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,480
You dare to send her to the palace because of her personality?

253
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,080
Your daughter is so ungrateful.

254
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,480
If she makes trouble in the palace,

255
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,680
she will still be in our family.

256
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,680
You are right.

257
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,680
In fact, if we want to talk about the quality of the material,

258
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,080
we can do it in the old age. Of course, it is better to have a good wife.

259
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,480
Of course.

260
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,680
But you know your daughter's temper.

261
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,880
If she knows that we are behind her, then it is a big deal.

262
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,680
If she makes trouble, then she won't be embarrassed.

263
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,080
How can she have it?

264
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,880
How can her parents be the master?

265
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,080
Okay, okay.

266
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,880
Give me some time to think about it.

267
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,280
Find a good opportunity.

268
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,280
Find a good reason to tell her slowly.

269
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,280
Jiang Xue Ning.

270
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,680
You are such a liar.

271
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,280
What are you looking at?

272
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,280
Prince Yan Yan.

273
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,880
Why are you going there again?

274
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,280
I saw him at my house.

275
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,880
Prince Yan Yan.

276
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,880
Come down.

277
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,880
I saw Prince Yan Yan.

278
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,080
Miss.

279
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,480
Ning Ning, you finally came out.

280
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,880
Miss, Prince Yan Yan.

281
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,880
If you don't go, you can just open the door.

282
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,480
You even abandoned me.

283
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,480
You have to be the master.

284
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,480
You idiot.

285
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,880
You idiot.

286
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,480
Your daughter must be a little bit more partial to me.

287
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,480
Right, Ning Ning?

288
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,880
What are you thinking about?

289
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,480
Why are you here?

290
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,480
I have something to tell you.

291
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,680
The day after tomorrow is Chong Yang.

292
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,080
I have a meeting. I want to take you there.

293
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,080
Chong Yang meeting?

294
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,280
Isn't it the time I met Shen Zhi Yi?

295
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,480
He's gone too fast.

296
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,480
What's going on?

297
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,480
He's going to fall into the water.

298
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,480
What's going on?

299
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,880
At the beginning,

300
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,080
on the Chong Yang meeting,

301
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,480
the master of the Wushi Sect, Shen Zhi Yi,

302
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,680
secretly kissed me.

303
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,480
Later, when he entered the palace to do the poison,

304
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,080
he found that my girlfriend was in a difficult situation.

305
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,680
She was very difficult to me.

306
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,680
I can't pretend this time.

307
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,480
Are you going or not?

308
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,280
I won't go this time.

309
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,080
Next time, you can come to me

310
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,080
and I'll go with you.

311
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,680
You're talking weird.

312
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,080
What's the difference between this time and the next time?

313
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,480
It's just that the lights are different every time.

314
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,480
It's still the day you have another appointment at Chong Yang.

315
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,280
You can't go.

316
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,280
I'm not feeling well these days.

317
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,280
I want to stay at home for a few days.

318
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,480
Your face is not good to look at.

319
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,480
Fine.

320
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,680
You should rest at home these days.

321
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,280
I'll go and ask about the next time.

322
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,080
I'll make up for you.

323
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,480
You brat!

324
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,680
You're going to shoot the wall again?

325
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,880
Did you get kicked out?

326
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,080
Don't be unreasonable.

327
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,480
You're a man of the Wushi Sect.

328
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,880
You're here to shoot the wall every day.

329
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,880
Do you think you're unreasonable?

330
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,080
Master Jiang,

331
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,680
isn't the wall being shot by someone?

332
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,480
Let me tell you,

333
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,680
Marquis Qiao,

334
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,480
we Jiang's family are not just a daughter and a son.

335
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,080
But every time I come here,

336
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,480
I only see you.

337
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,480
You...

338
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,480
Hurry up.

339
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,080
You're just being stubborn.

340
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,080
Let me tell you,

341
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,480
don't be unreasonable anymore.

342
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,080
You're unreasonable.

343
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,080
Fine. Go away.

344
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,080
Master,

345
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,680
I'll say two words.

346
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,680
You...

347
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,280
I'll say...

348
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:44,880
You...

349
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,880
Go away.

350
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,280
You're not going to leave.

351
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,080
Calm down.

352
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,480
Don't touch my hands.

353
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,880
I'm not going to fight.

354
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,880
Go.

355
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,680
Master.

356
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,080
You're going to block it?

357
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,080
I...

358
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,680
Uncle.

359
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,680
Be careful, father.

360
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,680
This way.

361
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,080
Are you okay?

362
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,280
You're not doing well today.

363
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,680
I'll come to see you again.

364
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,080
You're not going to climb the wall again.

365
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,480
Even if you're going to come,

366
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,880
you can leave with us.

367
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,880
Remember that.

368
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,280
You're so fast.

369
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,880
Get up.

370
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,880
My dear.

371
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,280
You said...

372
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,280
You...

373
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,280
You...

374
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,080
What's going on?

375
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,280
Father,

376
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,480
you're not going to enter the palace.

377
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,680
You're going to be late.

378
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,680
That's right.

379
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,680
Okay.

380
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,680
You should go back to your room.

381
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,280
Last time, I was poisoned by the poison.

382
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,680
I was not only being punished by the gods,

383
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,080
but also by Master Zhijiao and Xie Wei.

384
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,280
This time,

385
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,280
I can't meet him again.

386
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,080
I'm soおちょ auxi.

387
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,280
You can't meet me.

388
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,280
I'm sorry that I can't meet you.

389
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,680
Be in the trap.

390
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,880
Please don't go second.

391
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,280
Lord Anparka.

392
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,440
House of Xuannang's prime minister,

393
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,120
This is a small cultural relic of the Ministry of Justice.

394
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,240
It's a good idea to go there.

395
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,360
I really can't stop it.

396
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,880
It's not my intention.

397
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,240
And...

398
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,320
Can't you be the chief of the Ministry of Justice?

399
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,120
If that's the case, you don't have to be the head of the Ministry of Justice.

400
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,560
Your Majesty, please don't be angry.

401
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,720
Your Majesty, according to what I've seen,

402
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,320
the King of Pingnan is a great traitor.

403
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,160
In the past, there were only five new guards to investigate.

404
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,680
Besides, the police could not be suspected of this case.

405
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:21,180
Only after their

406
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,020
ιά David Schniger is seriously prepared is they still can dig out the truth.

407
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,380
The Court has been following the rules of the Court,

408
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,640
providing reason.

409
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,560
Juan happens to have heard of the case,

410
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,560
to have the current state of Changjiu.

411
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,560
If Zhang Zhe is dismissed,

412
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,560
I'm afraid he'll be in a trance.

413
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,560
What do you think of this?

414
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,560
Your Majesty, I think Zhang Zhe is against your decision.

415
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,560
He should be punished.

416
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,560
You're not going to stop?

417
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,560
Since the new 5th position has been investigating the rebel party's case for many years,

418
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,560
you haven't seen the Prime Minister.

419
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,560
And you've been involved in many rebels in the capital.

420
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,560
Why don't you leave this case to the Ministry of Justice?

421
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,560
If the Ministry of Justice has any plans,

422
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,560
then let this person be in charge of the Yuan's position.

423
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,560
Then, you'll be in a trance.

424
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,560
You can balance the new 5th position.

425
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,560
If the Ministry of Justice has no plans,

426
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,560
and you've missed the chance to arrest the rebel party,

427
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,560
what should we do?

428
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,560
If that's the case,

429
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,560
then the whole court won't stop the new 5th position from being in charge.

430
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,560
If the new 5th position is in charge,

431
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,560
then the rebel party will be in a trance.

432
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,560
They'll be killed sooner or later.

433
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,560
Then, you'll be in a trance.

434
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,560
You'll be in a trance.

435
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,560
You'll never be in a trance.

436
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,560
As what Mr. Xie said,

437
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,560
Chen Ying, you've heard it clearly.

438
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,560
If there's any more trouble,

439
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,560
I'll first take your case.

440
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,560
Thank you, Your Majesty.

441
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,560
I'm really lucky to win that one.

442
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,560
Thank you, Your Excellency.

443
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,560
Minister Jiang, thank you for your help today.

444
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,560
I've prepared some wine at the Cangxiao House.

445
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,560
Please, Your Excellency, please...

446
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,560
I've been in charge of the Ministry of Justice for many years.

447
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,560
Even if there's no plan, I think I can take care of it.

448
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,560
I don't need to do that.

449
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,560
I hope you can get the rebel party and get the capital soon.

450
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,560
Minister Jiang.

451
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,560
The 3rd word of Xie Wei seems fair,

452
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,560
but it's the 10th power of the new 5th position.

453
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,560
Do you think he's the one from the Yan family?

454
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,560
So what if he is?

455
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,560
What if he isn't?

456
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:57,560
No one can turn a blind eye to the wind in the world.

457
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,560
You're right.

458
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,560
The country is a country with a manly and unruly spirit.

459
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,560
The country has a manly spirit.

460
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,560
The King of Pingnan, Pan Guo,

461
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,560
and the army are only in the capital.

462
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,560
The road is too narrow, even though it's been so many years,

463
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:23,560
it's still the happy moment for His Majesty.

464
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,560
Yes, fortunately, there are two families of Xueyan.

465
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,560
That's why we have something peaceful today.

466
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,560
Minister Jiang, a few days ago,

467
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,560
the new 5th position was in the Yan Army's military office.

468
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,560
They said they caught a rebel,

469
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,560
and are interrogating them now.

470
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,560
They're going to be in the bloodthirsty again.

471
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:47,560
Today, the Yan army is divided into two.

472
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,560
Minister Jiang should have made the plan earlier.

473
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:55,560
I'm afraid that no one can get away with it.

474
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,560
What do you mean by that?

475
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,560
I shouldn't have mentioned it.

476
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,560
But the 2nd Miss Fu Shang and the Yan family are close.

477
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,560
They're all right.

478
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:14,560
If you're heartless, why bother to interfere?

479
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,560
You're right.

480
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,560
Please.

481
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,560
I heard that the Yan army is going to look for you again.

482
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,560
What's the situation?

483
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,560
Both of you are already here.

484
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,560
Can you be more considerate

485
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,560
and think about your sister?

486
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,560
Okay?

487
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,560
If mother is calling me here for this,

488
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,560
then I don't need to say it.

489
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,560
I don't want to interfere with Yanling.

490
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,560
I don't have the right to interfere with her.

491
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,560
You...

492
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,560
Mother, you don't have to worry.

493
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,560
If Yan is here,

494
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,560
I'll definitely be considerate of your future marriage.

495
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,560
Maybe I'll be with Zhan Zhang Guang too.

496
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,560
I'm back.

497
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,560
I said the mansion is so quiet.

498
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,560
So you're all here.

499
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,560
Come on, let's go.

500
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,560
What's wrong?

501
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,560
You're here again?

502
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,560
I didn't get to go to the palace.

503
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,560
Mother,

504
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,560
today, Duke Dingxue's mansion

505
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,560
and Uncle Qingyuan's mansion

506
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,560
are also sent to the palace.

507
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,560
The two families' days are just right.

508
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,560
I want to take these two girls

509
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,560
to the mansion to have a feast.

510
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,560
I wonder how you'll be doing.

511
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,560
Uncle Qingyuan's mansion?

512
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,560
Your Highness,

513
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,560
you're wearing Fang Ying's palace maid's dress.

514
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,560
I'll go to the west of the door.

515
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,560
I'll definitely send you out of the palace by the back of my hand.

516
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,560
I'll drag them out of here.

517
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,560
Consort Pie, you're strong.

518
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,560
You're very brave.

519
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,560
Yanling is more into me.

520
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,560
I can hide for a while.

521
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,560
Can I hide for a while?

522
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,560
If you don't get to go to the palace,

523
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,560
I'm still a maid in the mansion.

524
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,560
You're so kind to me.

525
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,560
I can't believe you're dead in the palace.

526
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,560
Yes.

527
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,560
Fang Ying is the maid of the family.

528
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,560
The mansion is now closed.

529
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,560
The court is also closed.

530
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,560
I think

531
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,560
we Jiang family

532
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,560
need to take care of this.

533
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,560
My Lord,

534
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,560
you don't know that.

535
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,560
The mansion's funeral banquet

536
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,560
is the most important in the capital.

537
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,560
It's almost 18 o'clock.

538
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,560
If we don't do it,

539
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,560
it'll be too late.

540
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,560
My Lord,

541
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,560
we Jiang family

542
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,560
never have to be separated.

543
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,560
It's just that

544
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,560
we've been away from the Yan family for years.

545
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,560
It's hard to get a chance to get into the test.

546
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,560
If that's the case,

547
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,560
you two girls...

548
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,560
Let's have a separate banquet.

549
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,560
Father, I want to go to the You family.

550
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,560
Why are you talking back?

551
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,560
Mother went to the Xue family to see her husband.

552
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,560
If my life is in danger,

553
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,560
it won't affect the people around.

554
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,560
I'd rather not go

555
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,560
if I'm scolded by mother.

556
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,560
Enough.

557
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,560
My dear.

558
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,560
It's just that

559
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,560
the two families are in a bad mood.

560
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,560
I guess the family will be in trouble

561
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,560
by the day.

562
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,560
My dear,

563
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,560
you like to be in a hot mood.

564
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,560
But you won't...

565
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,560
After all, both families are in love.

566
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,560
You can't just be a good wife.

567
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,560
You're just a woman who's been in love

568
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,560
with your family for a long time.

569
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,560
That's great.

570
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,560
My dear,

571
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,560
you're really grown up.

572
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,560
You're getting more and more sensible.

573
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,560
You know how hard it is to be a father and a son-in-law.

574
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,560
Right, my dear?

575
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,560
This is a new kind of wedding dress.

576
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,560
It's so pretty.

577
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,560
It's so pretty.

578
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,560
It's so pretty.

579
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,560
It's so pretty.

580
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,560
Look at it.

581
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,560
It's so pretty.

582
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,560
Look at it.

583
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,560
Look at this color.

584
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,560
It's so pretty.

585
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,560
It's so pretty.

586
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,560
It's so pretty.

587
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,560
It's so pretty.

588
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,560
Why are there so many people?

589
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,560
Our family is a uncle.

590
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,560
Our ancestors were also in trouble.

591
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,560
We only see

592
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,560
the husband of the Xue family.

593
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,560
It's so pretty.

594
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,560
It's so pretty.

595
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,560
Look at it.

596
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,560
Second Miss Jiang Fu is here.

597
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,560
Why is she here?

598
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,560
Yes.

599
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,560
She's the girl

600
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,560
who's raised in the countryside.

601
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,560
I heard she's not in a good mood.

602
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,560
But she looks good.

603
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,560
Who do you think

604
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,560
she looks better?

605
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,560
Of course it's you,

606
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,560
born with a good image.

607
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,560
Miss,

608
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,560
Second Miss Yuan is there.

609
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,560
We're going to see her.

610
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,560
No rush.

611
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,560
I'll find someone first.

612
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,560
She did it on purpose.

613
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,560
A rough-skinned girl from the countryside.

614
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,560
I'll give her some noodles.

615
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,560
She's so insensitive.

616
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,560
She's not worth

617
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,560
to be a part of her.

618
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,560
By the way,

619
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,560
did you see

620
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,560
the woman who won the sword?

621
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,560
It's a normal job.

622
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,560
It's a normal job.

623
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,560
But don't let her

624
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,560
be so embarrassed.

625
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,560
Don't worry, Miss.

626
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,560
She's locked up in the room.

627
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,560
She just asked

628
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,560
the mother to teach her a lesson.

629
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,560
She seems to be hurt.

630
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,560
She's like her mother.

631
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,560
She's so insensitive.

632
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,560
She's so insensitive.

633
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,560
Third Miss,

634
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,560
time to eat.

635
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,560
Don't run.

636
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,560
Don't go.

637
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,560
I'll go see the woman.

638
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,560
She scared the tent down.

639
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,560
She just died.

640
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,560
She's so insensitive.

641
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,560
She's so insensitive.

642
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,560
She's so insensitive.

643
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,560
She's so insensitive.

644
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,560
Don't go out.

645
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,560
Hurry up.

646
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,560
Third Miss, run.

647
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,560
Hurry up.

648
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,560
Hurry up.

649
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,560
Hurry up.

650
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,560
Okay.

651
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,560
Your Highness.

652
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,560
Hurry up.

653
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,560
If you don't go out,

654
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,560
the banquet in the school is going to be canceled.

655
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,560
It's okay.

656
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,560
You can't go.

657
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,560
I'll go to see that woman.

658
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,560
Your Highness.

659
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,560
Your Highness.

660
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,560
Your Highness.

661
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,560
Your Highness.

662
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,560
I went to the Qingyuan Uncle's house to see Miss.

663
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,560
What?

664
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,560
You see through it?

665
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,560
I saw it clearly.

666
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,560
I told the Crown Prince

667
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,560
to send the medicine for the Second Miss.

668
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,560
So I just went out with her.

669
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,560
I followed her

670
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,560
to the Qingyuan Uncle's house to the banquet.

671
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,560
I asked her to see the banquet

672
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,560
on the 9th of September.

673
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,560
She said she wouldn't go.

674
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,560
She was so angry

675
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,560
with her husband in Chongyang Street.

676
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,560
These wretched little girls

677
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,560
are mad at me.

678
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,560
They're mad at me?

679
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,560
Maybe they made a deal with others.

680
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,240
We'd better go now.

681
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,560
We're running out of time.

682
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,560
Your Highness, go there yourself.

683
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,560
I'm going to the mansion to see what kind of ghost he can come to help me.

684
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,560
I...

685
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,560
Your son is so temperamental.

686
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,560
I'll go to see Uncle Qu Yuan as well.

687
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,560
Let's go.

688
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,560
Don't run!

689
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,560
I'm going to kick you!

690
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,560
I'll let you run!

691
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,560
Let you run!

692
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,560
Let you run!

693
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,560
Let you run!

694
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,560
Who are you?

695
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,560
I've been trying to save you for so many years.

696
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,560
Let you run!

697
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,560
Run!

698
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,560
I'll go see my mother and die.

699
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,560
I can't.

700
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,560
What are you doing?

701
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,560
If Second Miss runs away,

702
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,560
no one will be able to survive.

703
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,560
Let her go first.

704
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Look, look.

705
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,560
It's Prince Yan.

706
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,560
He came to see us.

707
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,560
He's looking for someone.

708
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,560
He must be looking for Miss You Jia.

709
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,560
Don't talk nonsense.

710
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,560
We can't find Prince Yan in the mansion.

711
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,560
Maybe he just passed by.

712
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,560
Prince Lin is here too.

713
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,560
Sister You,

714
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,560
your face is so big.

715
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,560
I'm so sorry.

716
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,560
I'm sorry.

717
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,560
I'm sorry.

718
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,560
I'm sorry.

719
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,560
Sister You, your face is so big.

720
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,560
Yan Lian.

721
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,560
Don't wait for me.

722
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,560
You're here.

723
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,560
Find me.

724
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,560
Greetings, Your Highness.

725
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,560
Greetings.

726
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,560
All right. You can go.

727
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,560
I'll ask you where Jiang Xue is.

728
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,560
Zhang Yanzhang.

729
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,560
Zhang Jian.

730
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,560
Stop it.

731
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,560
Prince Yan came here for Jiang Xue.

732
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,560
He's not...

733
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,560
Don't talk nonsense.

734
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,560
How could Prince Yan look like him?

735
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,560
Right.

736
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,560
He doesn't look like him.

737
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,560
Something's wrong.

738
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,560
Someone fell into the water.

739
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,560
Someone fell into the water?

740
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,560
Who fell into the water?

741
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,560
Who fell into the water?

742
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,560
Who fell into the water?

743
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,560
Let's go.

744
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,560
I can't find anyone.

745
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,560
I'll kill you.

746
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,560
Get away.

747
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,560
Prince Yan.

748
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,560
Prince Yan.

749
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,560
Who are you?

750
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,560
Why do you care about our mansion?

751
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,560
Prince Yan.

752
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,560
Prince Yan.

753
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,560
Prince Yan.

754
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,560
Prince Yan.

755
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,560
Prince Yan.

756
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,560
Hurry.

757
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,560
Someone's dying.

758
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,560
You still care about our mansion?

759
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,560
None of your business.

760
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,560
This...

761
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,560
Hurry.

762
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,560
Go and see.

763
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,560
What's going on?

764
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,560
How could you do this?

765
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,560
How could you do this?

766
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,560
I'm fine.

767
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,560
Wait.

768
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,560
Wait.

769
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,560
What's the matter with Miss Jiang Er?

770
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,560
She came to the guest house

771
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,560
but she was in a mess.

772
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,560
She's such a bad girl.

773
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,560
She's the one who came down.

774
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,560
She's the one who came down.

775
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,560
She's the one who came down.

776
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,560
This girl,

777
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,560
I'm the first one to see

778
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,560
the girl who bullied the master.

779
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,560
What's the matter with you?

780
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,560
It's just a few scoundrels.

781
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,560
You're so stupid.

782
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,560
She's your wife.

783
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,560
She's the one who came down.

784
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,560
She's a scoundrel.

785
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,560
How could you care about her?

786
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,560
My family will deal with it.

787
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,560
I'll save her.

788
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,560
I'll protect her.

789
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,560
Niu Yue.

790
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,560
If I see you using your own means

791
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,560
and bullying your sister,

792
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,560
I'll tell you what's worse.

793
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,560
Jiang Xu, you're so stubborn.

794
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,560
You're so cold-blooded.

795
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,560
But the girl's makeup

796
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,560
should be the girl from the You family.

797
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,560
I didn't expect the family's style to be so good.

798
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,560
It's not good to keep making trouble.

799
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,560
Let's get Miss Jiang to change her clothes.

800
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,560
All right.

801
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,560
A girl with a lot of water.

802
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,560
She's a good girl.

803
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,560
What are you talking about?

804
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,560
Get lost.

805
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,560
Let's go.

806
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,560
What's the matter?

807
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,560
Let's change the clothes.

808
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,560
Miss.

809
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,560
Miss.

810
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,560
What's wrong with you?

811
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,560
It's all my fault.

812
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,560
I lost you.

813
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,560
Wait a minute.

814
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,560
I'll go get the clothes for the back.

815
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,560
In that case,

816
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,560
I'll take the clothes of these three girls.

817
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,560
You...

818
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,560
What?

819
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,560
Do you want to see me changing clothes here?

820
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,560
You can do whatever you want.

821
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,560
It's not necessary for a man to enter the house.

822
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,560
I'll wait for you in the front.

823
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,560
Let's go.

824
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,560
You're really a good girl.

825
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,560
I get it.

826
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,560
You came to the You family.

827
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,560
I'm afraid it's because of Miss You.

828
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,560
When did they meet?

829
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,560
How come I don't know?

830
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,560
What?

831
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,560
You want to eat the girl's clothes?

832
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,560
You're so annoying.

833
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,560
You're so annoying.

834
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,560
You're so annoying.

835
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,560
Thank you for saving my life.

836
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,560
Stand up.

837
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,560
Don't be an unnecessary man anymore.

838
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,560
Sit down.

839
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,560
Here.

840
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,560
Thank you.

841
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,720
I heard you said you were going to see your mother.

842
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,120
Actually, I couldn't make it.

843
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,880
I just wanted to see her again.

844
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,600
To see her mother.

845
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,480
You know you're in pain.

846
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,920
But you don't know how much pain you've suffered.

847
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,920
You're really a Third Miss of the You family.

848
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,960
How dare those scammers treat you like that?

849
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,520
They want my mother to be a thief.

850
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,440
They also want me to be a Ye Zhong.

851
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,000
We've been living in a very small world.

852
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,000
Am I wrong?

853
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,480
You're right.

854
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,920
I can tell you're not dying.

855
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,800
You've been to the Yanwang Hall.

856
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,320
What's there to be afraid of?

857
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,640
You have to bear it no matter how hard it is.

858
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,480
At least you can live a life like this.

859
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,520
You can't live a life like this.

860
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,640
I... I need your word!

861
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,120
We shall have bowls of beauty.

862
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,360
Take the marbles of Yuezhen 951.

863
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,240
I hope it lasts for two nights.

864
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,760
Come.

865
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,200
Here is the delicious Margrsenissen.

866
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,560
I was also treated as a maid.

867
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,560
I was sent to the villa for more than ten years.

868
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,560
I was treated as a maid for more than ten years.

869
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,560
And...

870
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,560
We met before.

871
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,560
I know you are a good girl.

872
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,560
Let's live a good life together.

873
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,560
I will live a good life together.

874
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,560
Hurry up.

875
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,560
Report to Madam.

876
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,560
Princess is here.

877
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,560
Hurry up.

878
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,560
Yes.

879
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,560
Where is Prince Ling?

880
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,560
He went to get some flowers.

881
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,560
Good.

882
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,560
Tan'er, let's go get some flowers.

883
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,560
You have nothing to explain?

884
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,560
What?

885
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,560
You told me that you were not going to stay at home for two days.

886
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,560
And then you came to my house to get some flowers.

887
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,560
You were angry with me, right?

888
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,560
I also knew that you were going to be a maid after you left.

889
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,560
And you are here now.

890
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,560
Jiang Xuanning.

891
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,560
I was wrong.

892
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,560
That's not bad.

893
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,560
How is Miss You San?

894
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,560
You two are apart.

895
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,560
I have been to the hospital.

896
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,560
She is fine for now.

897
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,560
But you were too bold just now.

898
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,560
So many people are watching.

899
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,560
You just give me a break.

900
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,560
I don't know what kind of rumors they are going to spread.

901
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,560
Then let them spread.

902
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,560
I was in the hospital for a few years.

903
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,560
I was afraid that there would be some changes.

904
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,560
I was afraid that you would be tired from the rumors.

905
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,560
Now I have two months to go to the hospital.

906
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,560
I don't want to let the whole world know.

907
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,560
Hospital.

908
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,560
Since you are here today,

909
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,560
don't rush to go back.

910
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,560
But the maid is gone.

911
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,560
You can wait for me at the Cang Xia House.

912
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,560
I will come to you later.

913
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,560
I will take you to the lantern meeting.

914
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,560
Ye Lin.

915
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,560
Actually I...

916
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,560
Miss Jiang Er.

917
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,560
Prince.

918
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,560
There is a kueh kueh in the garden.

919
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,560
Madam is looking for you.

920
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,560
Okay.

921
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,560
You go there.

922
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,560
The maid is waiting for me to drink.

923
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,560
Don't forget to come to the Cang Xia House this afternoon.

924
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,560
But I...

925
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,560
This is the house you are looking for.

926
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,560
Meiko.

927
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,440
Princess.

928
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,280
Greetings, Princess.

929
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,480
Greetings, Princess.

930
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,960
Why is she here too?

931
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,720
It's so late.

932
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,960
I didn't expect that she wouldn't come here

933
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,080
when it's so crowded.

934
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:46,880
Miss.

935
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,160
Get up.

936
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,600
You're not in the palace.

937
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,600
Why are you like this?

938
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,560
What's going on?

939
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,560
What's going on?

940
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,560
I don't know.

941
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,560
What's going on?

942
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,560
What's going on?

943
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,560
What's going on?

944
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,560
What's going on?

945
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,560
I heard from the people that

946
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,560
Miss Liu is going to the funeral.

947
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,560
I came to see.

948
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,560
Everyone, please have a seat.

949
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,560
Because we two are so close,

950
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,560
you're so tired.

951
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,560
They're arguing about making a bet.

952
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,560
Princess and Miss Xue are here to fight.

953
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,560
Why don't we fight with them?

954
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,560
Uncle is so kind.

955
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,560
If he goes to the funeral,

956
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,560
what about the others?

957
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,560
Okay.

958
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,560
You can talk.

959
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,560
In that case,

960
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,560
you two should

961
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,560
make a bet

962
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,560
and thank Your Highness.

963
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,560
Now Miss Liu is married,

964
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,560
and Miss Liu is starting to

965
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,560
make a bet with Miss Tian'er.

966
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,560
There's no other way to make a bet.

967
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,560
It's not bad.

968
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,560
She's planning to fight for the funeral

969
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,560
on purpose.

970
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,560
I'm afraid she's going to

971
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,560
show her face in front of the princess.

972
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,560
Miss, what should we do now?

973
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,560
Sit there.

974
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,560
We'll take the sixth seat later.

975
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,560
What?

976
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,560
I can't take the sixth seat.

977
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,560
It's natural that we're going to the funeral.

978
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,560
Will it be embarrassing to stay here?

979
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,560
Princess, please.

980
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,560
Are you Jiang Xuening?

981
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,560
Raise your head.

982
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,560
I came here for you.

983
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,560
No wonder those two are so proud of you.

984
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,560
You're so pretty.

985
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,560
You even want to move when I see you.

986
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,560
You're really jealous.

987
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,560
It seems that Miss Jiang Er

988
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,560
and Prince Yan

989
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,560
don't know about us.

990
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,560
They even

991
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,560
went to the princess.

992
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,560
They're even more brilliant than the bad guys.

993
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,560
Yu'er.

994
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,560
I'm being too harsh.

995
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,560
I'm not.

996
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,560
I'm not.

997
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,560
I'm not.

998
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,560
I'm being too harsh.

999
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,560
Miss Jiang is a lady of the thousand gold.

1000
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,560
She's very important to us.

1001
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,560
How can she be so mean?

1002
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,560
Princess, please.

1003
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,560
Come on.

1004
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,560
Come on.

1005
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,560
Don't be polite.

1006
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,560
Come on.

1007
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,560
Sit down.

1008
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,560
Sit down.

1009
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,560
Come on.

1010
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,560
Come on.

1011
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,560
Ye Lin.

1012
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,560
You're so sneaky.

1013
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,560
You're not from the royal family.

1014
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,560
You're the princess's sister.

1015
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,560
Didn't the queen dowager

1016
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,560
go to the school to study?

1017
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,560
Why are you here?

1018
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,560
Miss Jiang would like to ask you this.

1019
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,560
Look at that Xue Shu.

1020
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,560
She's a bad girl.

1021
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,560
Don't scare her.

1022
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,560
No.

1023
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,560
I have to go.

1024
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,560
Forget it.

1025
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,560
You're still making trouble.

1026
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,560
You're a woman.

1027
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,560
Don't go there.

1028
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,560
No one will do anything to you

1029
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,560
if you and I are here.

1030
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,560
Let's go.

1031
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,560
Let's drink.

1032
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,560
Come on.

1033
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,560
Why don't you move?

1034
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,560
You can't do anything?

1035
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,560
A blind girl.

1036
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,560
What can she do?

1037
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,560
Shen Zhi Yi is so mad.

1038
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,560
She's not guilty this time.

1039
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,560
I told you to change.

1040
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,560
Don't you listen to me?

1041
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,560
I'm sorry.

1042
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,560
I'm sorry.
