1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
As long as I can enter the Ning'an Palace

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,200
and pay all the price

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,600
I will be willing to do my best

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,400
The End

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,800
The End

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,800
Everything seems to be a dream

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,400
I have owed a lot of people

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,800
Chaozhe, help me

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,600
I will be a good person after this

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
The End

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
I will be the one to take the favor

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,800
There are some things you can't give me

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
But what about them?

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,000
The life you chose is for Mr. You

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,400
In this world, everyone has the right to escape

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,000
But I can't

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,000
I want to regret it

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,400
and do the wrong thing

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,200
and go back in time

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Does Mr. Zhang believe that everything is decided?

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I would rather believe in the future

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,000
Your Highness

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,800
Your Highness

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,200
The End

26
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,000
Ning'an, what are you doing?

27
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,000
In the Ming Dynasty

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,600
there was always a pair of invisible hands

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,600
that could break everything

30
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,400
The revenge is long

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,600
Who are you in the end?

32
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,600
The Emperor of the mortal world is so long-winded

33
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,000
and so absurd

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,200
right in front of his shoulders

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,820
Black.

36
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,400
Śu bar fists with the law.

37
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,560
They are as soft!

38
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,380
They are extremely soft!

39
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,720
Looking at them equally,

40
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,240
so sweet and yummy.

41
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,120
When I tell my husband,

42
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,980
he doesn't Shh use to care

43
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,400
Whenyi be electron with His Majesty.

44
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,840
antes to

45
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,040
Youchun toigans.

46
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,440
Sing.

47
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,600
Shui you mask.

48
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,960
You守 the young man.

49
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,920
Although you are yourself,

50
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,240
I'm worried about you.

51
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,800
You should know

52
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,840
what kind of place is in the palace.

53
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,000
That's a place where the enemy can save.

54
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,800
So you have to do anything

55
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,600
to keep your words.

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,760
You should

57
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,240
change your temper.

58
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,640
Don't force yourself to do it.

59
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,440
Your parents are not around.

60
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,240
You should be safe.

61
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm tired.

62
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,240
I'm going to sleep.

63
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,840
Then...

64
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,400
You should go back and rest.

65
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,440
No.

66
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,880
What kind of place is apart is alone

67
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,880
but где?

68
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,400
Start.

69
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,320
Look around.

70
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,160
It's a place that can't say who's supposed to be Sheng Xiaofeng.

71
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,480
We are nearby,

72
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,160
she said her name.

73
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,960
Let's go back and be together.

74
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,640
Okay.

75
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,120
Then I'm going to interest you.

76
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,520
Sister Fu, hurry up, here are the time limit, hurry up.

77
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,120
If we can't call her Chen Yu'er,

78
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,320
Guo Guo can't.

79
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,620
Guo Guo should be with us.

80
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,380
Go and look for at your brother's fish,

81
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,920
cause everyone can hear you,

82
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,100
but Caitlin,

83
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,720
is not family that youוא�'er.

84
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,820
Can I just come in?

85
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,920
It must be the day when of the Rainy Festival.

86
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,280
See what happened!

87
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,560
We have already planned all of these.

88
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,900
But quickly, they weren't mentally stable.

89
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,200
Yet, all of this dressing up

90
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,700
wasn't over yet.

91
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:14,400
The topiker,

92
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,600
But why did everyone push me away?

93
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,440
No matter how hard I tried,

94
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,400
I always had a hand that was invisible.

95
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,680
I would never return everything to my original position.

96
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,840
What about Yan Ling and Zhang Zhen?

97
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,400
Will they still be the ending?

98
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,760
No.

99
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,400
It shouldn't be like that.

100
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,120
Jiang Xuning,

101
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,400
you can't admit defeat.

102
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,080
You must have a way to break a new path.

103
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,840
You can do it.

104
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,000
The Xue family has put their hands into the Marquis's Manor.

105
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,920
But I only know now

106
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,720
that this is your good job.

107
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,160
Mr. Jin is a law.

108
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
What are you doing?

109
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,720
You can't blame them all.

110
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,560
There are so many people in Xiwu.

111
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,520
The birth of Zhou is not safe.

112
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,280
He used to be a horse.

113
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,320
We didn't know that we were looking at such a person.

114
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,720
A horse-drawn manor?

115
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,200
Yes, a horse-drawn manor.

116
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
It's the one in the Jiangshi Manor.

117
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,600
It's the one who followed Miss Jiang Er

118
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,800
and came from the countryside.

119
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,960
By the way,

120
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,640
are you two

121
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,200
the gold we had in the past?

122
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,120
You don't know the one in the surname Zhou?

123
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,880
He was born in Hanwei,

124
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,320
and is a good man.

125
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,040
He is not weak.

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,200
I will go to the Marquis's Manor tomorrow.

127
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,520
I will talk to him personally.

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,640
By the way,

129
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,480
didn't you ask Dao Qin

130
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,560
to investigate the movements of the gold we had in the past?

131
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,400
What happened to you?

132
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,040
Why are you talking so much?

133
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,360
It's the palace-drawn manor.

134
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,600
That old bastard.

135
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,320
Since you left,

136
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,120
you have been talking bad things about the Prince.

137
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,120
I don't know what to do this time.

138
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,640
I got the Prince's order.

139
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,680
He wants to come to the capital.

140
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,040
He sent someone to assassinate you.

141
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,320
It's him.

142
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,080
He is just challenging you.

143
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,840
Don't forget your identity.

144
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,600
When will my identity

145
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,600
be revealed to him?

146
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,000
Come on.

147
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,720
I want to see

148
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,520
if he can go back alive.

149
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,520
Is Yang

150
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,680
at that time expected from you?

151
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,700
Sorry,

152
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,680
I have given trouble to my father.

153
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,680
Unfortunately,

154
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,880
your wife could not escape.

155
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,520
What should I do?

156
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,520
Yes.

157
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,120
Niannian.

158
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,440
How did Brother Zhou say that Wuyi is also good?

159
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,880
Is it possible for him to make a few moves with me?

160
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,440
He can make moves with you.

161
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,880
But because others dare not do anything to you.

162
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,240
How can I tell you?

163
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,560
Qi Feng!

164
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,920
You said I asked him to get a drink.

165
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,360
He didn't bring it back in such a short time.

166
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,560
Yes.

167
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,880
I'll go and have a look.

168
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,960
You guys sit first.

169
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,040
Sit first.

170
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,240
If I remember correctly,

171
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,200
I have reminded Lord Zhou last time

172
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,720
not to disturb Yanling.

173
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,040
You are so stubborn that you want to drink this soup.

174
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,280
Miss, you must have heard of a saying.

175
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,680
The tree is not straight.

176
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,440
Some things are not made by Zhou Yunzhi.

177
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,880
There must be a reason for Zhao Yunzhi to be here.

178
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Miss,

179
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,360
I know you are coming today.

180
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,160
So I stayed in the mansion last night.

181
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,320
I just want to meet you.

182
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,680
I want to ask you to give me a message.

183
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,880
How can I explain this to you?

184
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,240
It's Xue family.

185
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,240
They want to create evidence

186
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,800
of Yan family and Prince of Pingnan.

187
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
Right?

188
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,080
The emperor of Pingnan is very deep.

189
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,920
Xue family wants to move to Yan family.

190
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,640
They must be a big crime to super-move the family.

191
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,840
The Yan family is in the middle of the world.

192
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,120
They can't be happy.

193
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,240
So I guess they want to create evidence.

194
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,040
Miss, you are so naive.

195
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,920
I've heard you.

196
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,160
I won't steal it.

197
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,520
I won't go to find

198
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,360
the seal and the letter of the lord.

199
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,520
But the emperor is so stubborn.

200
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,800
I thought about it.

201
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,760
I can find some notes and make it up.

202
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,200
But I found something big.

203
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,920
What is it?

204
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,880
I'm sorry.

205
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,880
I'm sorry.

206
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,880
I'm sorry.

207
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,880
I'm sorry.

208
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,880
I'm sorry.

209
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,880
I'm sorry.

210
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,880
I'm sorry.

211
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,880
I'm sorry.

212
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,880
I'm sorry.

213
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,880
I'm sorry.

214
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,880
I'm sorry.

215
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,880
I'm sorry.

216
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,880
I'm sorry.

217
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,880
I'm sorry.

218
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
I'm sorry.

219
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,880
I'm sorry.

220
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,880
I'm sorry.

221
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,880
I'm sorry.

222
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,880
I'm sorry.

223
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,880
I'm sorry.

224
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
I'm sorry.

225
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,880
I'm sorry.

226
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
I'm sorry.

227
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,880
I'm sorry.

228
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,880
I'm sorry.

229
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
I'm sorry.

230
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
I'm sorry.

231
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
I'm sorry.

232
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,880
I'm sorry.

233
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Are you sure you didn't see it wrong?

234
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I didn't know who I was.

235
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I saw the king's return.

236
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
He's been here many times.

237
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
How could he see it wrong?

238
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Miss.

239
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
This is really a small matter.

240
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I should report it.

241
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
But if the imperial court finds out about it,

242
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
the Yin family will be in trouble.

243
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
What about me?

244
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm also the power of the north.

245
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So, Miss.

246
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What should Zhou Yunchi do next?

247
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Please explain.

248
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I can't take care of Lord Zhou's business.

249
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,120
Lord Zhou's business.

250
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,120
As you saw,

251
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,120
I want to help the Yan family.

252
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,120
But I'm like you.

253
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,120
It's all my fault.

254
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,120
I have nothing to help with.

255
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,120
Even though I don't have anything now,

256
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,120
I want to take your life.

257
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,120
But I'm too old to do so.

258
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,120
Do you believe me?

259
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,120
Yes.

260
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,120
Miss.

261
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,120
If you tell the monkey family,

262
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,120
I'll have a thousand times in my life.

263
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,120
That makes sense.

264
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,120
The landlady gave you.

265
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,120
You may not have the chance to think about it.

266
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,120
Besides, what you saw was just a record of a tragedy.

267
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,120
I don't know what the letter says.

268
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,320
I believe that

269
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,800
the Yan family is determined to rebel.

270
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,360
They must have the same intention.

271
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,520
In short,

272
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,280
the letter that was burned by the internal wind

273
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,160
can't be left to others.

274
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:16,960
Yes.

275
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,480
Mainly, it's from the Xue Palace.

276
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,480
If they want to make a rebellion,

277
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,960
they must use Lord Yan's notes and notes.

278
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,680
The notes are also good.

279
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,600
They are all in the book.

280
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,440
You should take some of the notes

281
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,560
and take some time to say it.

282
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,280
But it's not a long-term plan.

283
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,000
The letter is still a good person.

284
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,640
You said something good.

285
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,280
Even if you didn't know,

286
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,280
there will be others.

287
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,200
Tell Yan Lin everything you found.

288
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,680
It's time for him to grow up.

289
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,120
My lord.

290
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,360
My lord.

291
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,520
You are welcome.

292
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,160
My lord.

293
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,600
My lord.

294
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,160
I don't know why you came here.

295
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,360
I'm sorry.

296
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,320
It's okay.

297
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,040
You don't need to be so polite.

298
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,600
It's autumn now.

299
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,040
Why hasn't the tree bloomed yet?

300
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,400
This tree

301
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,000
is my aunt's favorite.

302
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,960
I made it myself.

303
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,920
20 years ago,

304
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,000
my aunt passed away.

305
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,320
This tree was scattered.

306
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,640
I haven't opened the flowers since then.

307
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,680
I feel like crying.

308
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,080
You are looking for your father.

309
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,080
He came to the camp to live in peace.

310
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,960
You should change your mind.

311
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,960
Why do you have a burnt smell?

312
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,760
Is it roasted meat in the cloud?

313
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,000
Sorry.

314
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,640
It seems that I'm here by chance.

315
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,360
I've been waiting for you for years.

316
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,640
You want to have a musketeer together?

317
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,660
The enemy

318
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,260
come to deny it?

319
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,080
All he seduces is Zhou Ying.

320
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,920
There must be a fight happening with her.

321
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,920
I'mify them.

322
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,640
Hurry and get him out of here.

323
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,200
It's not a good relationship.

324
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,000
Why do you want to cook?

325
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,440
Well,

326
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,000
I don't have much meat.

327
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,960
I'll get some for you later.

328
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,040
Hurry up.

329
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,080
Why are you so busy?

330
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,360
I'm afraid of the evil spirit.

331
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,840
I'm afraid of Mr. Xie.

332
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,760
I don't know what to do

333
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,880
when I get up or leave.

334
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,560
It's your meat.

335
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
Ming'er,

336
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,400
you usually treat Mr. Yan like this.

337
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,040
Are you okay?

338
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,160
Mr. Xie, don't get me wrong.

339
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,680
I'm the best at Yanling.

340
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,080
He likes to eat soup.

341
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,280
Right?

342
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,040
Come on.

343
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,960
Drink some wine.

344
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,920
Don't get burned.

345
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,680
Ming'er,

346
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,000
don't you know that you're ill?

347
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,600
Since you're a good friend,

348
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,720
you should be careful.

349
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,400
It's right that Mr. Chocolate.

350
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,200
Oops!

351
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,880
It's my fault.

352
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,160
I can us.

353
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,760
Ming'er,

354
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:38,800
I mean,

355
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,760
Mr. Yuan.

356
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,320
I...

357
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,520
I tried to leave

358
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,940
my brother's bed and then left.

359
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,160
Right?

360
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,400
Why are you dying?

361
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,320
Let me have some rest.

362
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,080
to ask for your help.

363
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,720
Miss Ning'er,

364
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,280
I can take you back.

365
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,600
In that case,

366
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,920
thank you very much.

367
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,240
Let's go.

368
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Have you installed it?

369
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,440
Get up after you've installed it.

370
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:29,960
Confirmed.

371
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,640
Dear everything.

372
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,040
You are anehmen.

373
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,880
Do youittell the benches that Zhou Yingzhi erwries?

374
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,760
I misunderstood you.

375
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,600
I didn't mean to say?

376
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,320
Its you losing hope if you continue to say it.

377
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,680
Have you said it,כול?

378
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,440
That rock was also rep runner

379
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,920
from theprem Wei's door.

380
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,100
When we first met inlebration and was eliminated,

381
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,160
all of us escaped to the front door.

382
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,280
We spent the night

383
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,400
in a frenzy

384
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
to meet the man who used the well

385
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,500
in order to take the relaxing JACKSON

386
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,160
and come find me.

387
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,720
So, there's always a little bit of friendship?

388
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,720
Just a little bit.

389
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,720
He has nothing to do with what he's about to do.

390
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,720
Do you know what he's going to do?

391
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,520
Help the Xue family deal with Yan family.

392
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,120
I already convinced him today. He won't do anything to Yan family anymore.

393
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,320
I believe you.

394
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,320
It's still a good thing for Yan Ling.

395
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,920
But the battle between the court is not as simple as you think.

396
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,320
I don't care what your relationship with Zhou Yingzhi or the person behind him is.

397
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,120
I hope you won't do anything to him anymore.

398
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,320
Otherwise, you won't have to wait for me to take your life.

399
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,320
You can't guarantee it.

400
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,520
Then, I also want to ask you a question.

401
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,120
What's your relationship with Yan Ling?

402
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,120
What do you mean by that?

403
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,320
You were born in Jinling County. You have nothing to do with Yan family.

404
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,920
In the past years, you and Yan family have been looking at each other.

405
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,320
But you have been taking care of Yan Ling.

406
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,720
And Zhou Yingzhi appeared. You were more personally investigating.

407
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,320
Xue Ning is only guessing.

408
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,720
The secret of Ming Xiao's hiding is related to Yan family.

409
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,520
What does it have to do with you?

410
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,520
Because Yan Ling is also my friend.

411
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,520
Just like Mr. Zhou's heart, I also don't want anything dangerous to happen to him.

412
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,120
Uncle Jian!

413
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,920
Sir!

414
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,320
Follow him!

415
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,720
Yes!

416
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,320
I sent someone to send you back.

417
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,320
You didn't see anything today.

418
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,320
Brother Zhou, why are you still here?

419
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
Your Highness, I have something to tell you.

420
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,320
What happened?

421
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,320
Zhou Yingzhi is a petty man who is greedy and greedy.

422
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,720
My sister, Your Highness,

423
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,920
was ordered by Xing Wei.

424
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,320
She came to investigate the evidence of the collusion between the Marquis and the King of Ping Nan.

425
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
I paid your trust.

426
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,320
I also ask for your heavy punishment.

427
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,320
Cheng Yingzhi, you didn't tell me earlier.

428
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,320
Why are you talking about it now?

429
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,320
It's Miss Jiang.

430
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,320
I saved her.

431
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,320
I met with Miss Jiang today.

432
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,320
I saw her as a woman.

433
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,320
She was worried about the safety of the Crown Prince.

434
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,320
So I must get rid of her.

435
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,320
Ning Ling?

436
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,320
It's Ning Ling.

437
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,320
It's Ning Ling.

438
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:56,320
I'm really grateful to you for your support.

439
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,320
If Marquis and King of Ping Nan have no problem,

440
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,320
I won't make any trouble.

441
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,320
But I didn't investigate the Marquis's manor today.

442
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:10,320
I found that Marquis is indeed in the past.

443
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,320
I wonder if you know about it.

444
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
What did you say?

445
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,320
He is our الك Ca Yuan.

446
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:34,320
The員.

447
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,320
These are some of the daho'sjobs.

448
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,120
In the present,

449
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:46,320
I should invite somebody to offer the goods that had been collected and stored the money to kill them in the story of people.

450
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,500
Actually you would rather��於小人的家庭面騙,

451
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,560
than to urinateadvide among His Majesty.

452
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,120
!

453
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,460
How dare you trick only Xiao,

454
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,560
who likes beating up such a petticoat.

455
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,520
relacion's true,

456
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,520
I can't forget them after 20 years.

457
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,520
I can't forget them after I've done what I've done.

458
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,520
Do you still remember your cousin, Xue Ding Fei?

459
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,520
I've heard from my father since I was young.

460
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,520
He said that 20 years ago, Prince of Pingnan was plotting against me.

461
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:37,520
He said that to protect His Majesty, I was killed by Prince of Pingnan's sword.

462
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,520
Father,

463
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,520
Father, is there a reason for the death of my cousin?

464
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,520
I don't know.

465
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,520
It's just that I received a letter from Prince of Pingnan.

466
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,520
The letter said that Ding Fei wasn't dead.

467
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,520
It was in his hands.

468
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,520
How is that possible?

469
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,520
It's impossible.

470
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,520
Prince of Pingnan was a traitor.

471
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,520
They said that to influence my father,

472
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,520
they wanted to destroy the Yan and Xue families.

473
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,520
They wanted to kill my father.

474
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,520
If the people are alive,

475
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,520
they can kill the others.

476
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,520
The rumor is not enough.

477
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,520
But 20 years ago, I did something wrong.

478
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,520
It wasn't the Yan family. It was the Xue family.

479
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,520
I burned the letter from Prince of Pingnan.

480
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,520
I asked the child's reply.

481
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,520
But it was in their hands.

482
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:47,520
The rumor in the capital is not a lie.

483
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,520
Why did father leave such a scar?

484
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,520
You said that.

485
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,520
How could I not ask?

486
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,520
I didn't know that before your aunt passed away,

487
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,520
she couldn't talk to me.

488
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,520
I just saw her eyes.

489
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,520
She kept staring at me.

490
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,520
It was the last time she saw me.

491
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,520
She didn't close her eyes.

492
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,520
She was a great emperor.

493
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,520
She wanted a 7-year-old child to stand out

494
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,520
and face the most cruel sword.

495
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,520
Is that fair?

496
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,520
There are things

497
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,520
that should make you know.

498
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,520
Sir, we've checked everything.

499
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,520
They're inside.

500
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,520
We need to get the informant back.

501
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,520
No need.

502
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,520
You're here.

503
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,520
I should call you Mr. Xie

504
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,520
or Du Jun?

505
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,520
Mr. Gong Yi,

506
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,520
I'm here to see you.

507
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,520
I'm here to see you.

508
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,520
I'm here to see you.

509
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,520
I'm here to see you.

510
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,520
I'm here to see you.

511
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,520
I'm here to see you.

512
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,520
Mr. Gong Yi,

513
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,520
long time no see.

514
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,520
How are you doing?

515
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,520
I still remember you.

516
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,520
I thought you forgot your identity

517
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,520
in the warm and kind home in the capital.

518
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,520
You were determined to enter the capital

519
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,520
four years ago.

520
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,520
How did you do that?

521
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,520
You're serious.

522
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,520
The years I've been in the capital

523
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,520
are all because of you.

524
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,520
I don't dare to forget it.

525
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,520
How dare I take it as my words?

526
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,520
The court's ambassador

527
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,520
has two hands in Yan Xue.

528
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,520
The ambassador of the royal family

529
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,520
must have been in the same boat with them.

530
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,520
We buried the case in the capital

531
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,520
to borrow the name of the Nidang Party

532
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,520
to punish the traitor.

533
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,520
The Yan family's army

534
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,520
is the best time for us to act.

535
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,520
You won't understand that.

536
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,520
I understand.

537
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,520
I've been in the capital for years.

538
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,520
I've been in the capital for years.

539
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,520
That's why I did it.

540
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,520
Nonsense.

541
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,520
If that's the case,

542
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,520
why did you stop the case?

543
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,520
Instead, you sent the emperor to the Ministry of Justice.

544
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,520
You're not a man.

545
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,520
If you're not a man,

546
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,520
you're in the capital.

547
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,520
Why do you need to be so suspicious?

548
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,520
But I came here today

549
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,520
to ask you a question.

550
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,520
What's the situation

551
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,520
in the assassins?

552
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,520
I've said

553
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,520
I will return the order of the Shen Lang.

554
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,520
But if you insist on doing it,

555
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,520
I will not stop you.

556
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,520
However, I have to say one thing.

557
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,520
If the emperor's name is killed

558
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,520
by the Nidang Party,

559
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,520
I will never

560
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,520
take the risk.

561
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,520
I will never stop you.

562
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,520
Sir.

563
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,520
This capital is a place of my gratitude.

564
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,520
You should be careful.

565
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,520
Remember to be careful.

566
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,520
Xue Wei.

567
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,520
Don't forget.

568
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,520
Your order was given by the emperor.

569
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,520
If you want to escape,

570
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,520
you will have to pay for it.

571
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,520
Miss.

572
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,520
Miss.

573
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,520
Miss.

574
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,520
The Qing Feng of the Marquis's Mansion is here.

575
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,520
But the Yan Prince is not well.

576
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,520
They said you locked yourself in the room.

577
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,520
How much did you drink?

578
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,520
Sorry.

579
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,520
I was blind.

580
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,520
Why is it so hot?

581
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,520
I'll go find the doctor.

582
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,520
Madam.

583
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,520
Don't go.

584
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,520
The day is the most beautiful day.

585
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,520
I will go to the doctor.

586
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,520
The day is the most beautiful day.

587
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,520
The snow is like a dream.

588
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,520
I will go to the capital in the name of the moon.

589
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,520
Sorry.

590
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,520
What are you talking about?

591
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,520
If it's my fault,

592
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,520
it's my fault for you.

593
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,520
You did this to me.

594
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,520
I'm not as good as you.

595
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,520
No, I was too stupid.

596
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:22,520
I thought there was nothing that could be put in my eyes.

597
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,520
I thought I would like you to let the whole world know.

598
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,520
But I forgot.

599
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,520
Times change.

600
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,520
No one knows what will happen tomorrow.

601
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,520
You didn't have to go into the palace to do everything.

602
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,520
But you sent me in.

603
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,520
Now everyone knows that we are close to each other.

604
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,520
If the Yan family is in trouble,

605
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,520
how can we deal with this?

606
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,520
How can we face those rumors?

607
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,520
You don't ask me.

608
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,520
When did you know that the Yan family is in trouble?

609
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,520
You don't ask me how to talk about Zhou Ying Zhi.

610
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,520
You don't care about me bullying you or hiding you.

611
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,520
You worry that I will say everything and harm you.

612
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,520
You just want to say sorry to me.

613
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,520
You want me to be good to you in the future.

614
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,520
I believe you.

615
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,520
You have always been like this.

616
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,520
You are really a fool.

617
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,520
You are the least fool in the world.

618
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,520
Because you are the Yan family.

619
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,520
You are the best person in the world except my father.

620
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,520
But I told you to know all this.

621
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,520
You are a helpless little monkey.

622
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,520
No one can be helpless forever.

623
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,520
I should have grown up.

624
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,520
But I am too old.

625
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,520
It's not too late.

626
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,520
I am still here.

627
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,520
Yan Ling, let's go through this difficult time together.

628
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,520
You are still the little monkey who is still living on his own.

629
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,520
Okay?

630
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,520
Don't cry.

631
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,520
Don't cry anymore, okay?

632
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,520
Okay.

633
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,520
My lord.

634
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,520
You are still awake.

635
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,520
Why are you standing here again?

636
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,520
You are sweating.

637
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,520
Your Highness.

638
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,520
Look at these leaves.

639
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,520
They look like big trees.

640
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,520
But the wind blows gently.

641
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,520
And it falls into you.

642
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,520
Who will remember the death of the leaves?

643
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,520
Did you encounter a heart attack?

644
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,520
No.

645
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,520
I was just thinking of a bet.

646
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,520
Then, did you think about which side you want to go?

647
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,520
No one in the world can be a forever one.

648
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,520
I have learned from nothing today.

649
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,520
I learned from both sides.

650
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,520
I can do nothing.

651
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,520
I can't be treated as a tool.

652
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,520
As long as I can win the final battle.

653
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,520
My lord.

654
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,520
My lord.

655
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,520
My lord.

656
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,520
It's not good.

657
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,520
Something happened.

658
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,520
We were in a hurry.

659
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,520
Look at you.

660
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,520
You are so calm.

661
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,520
You are so calm.

662
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,520
You are so good.

663
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,520
Why is the boat moving?

664
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,520
It's because of the rain.

665
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,520
I was greedy and made a mistake.

666
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,520
I was careless.

667
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,520
But in fact,

668
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,520
someone was moving on the boat.

669
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,520
Someone wanted to move on it.

670
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,520
Our boat is always secret.

671
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,520
It's hard to find out.

672
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,520
I'm afraid it's the lover.

673
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,520
Find out.

674
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,520
Find out which bastard did it.

675
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,520
Save it.

676
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,520
Clean it up.

677
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,520
I have sent someone to check it.

678
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,520
The Cao Yun.

679
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,520
It's the imperial court's business.

680
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,520
In the past years,

681
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,520
the Gu Palace House has been

682
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,520
a court official with many talents.

683
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,520
And in the position of the new emperor,

684
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,520
he has a lot of soldiers.

685
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,520
If this matter is found to be related to our Xue family,

686
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,520
he will be angry with His Majesty.

687
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,520
Now is the time for our Xue family

688
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,520
to deal with the Yan family.

689
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,520
So this matter

690
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,520
must be suppressed.

691
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,520
Don't worry, father.

692
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,520
I'll handle it.

693
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,520
Wait.

694
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,520
Tell Zhou Ying Zhi to catch up with time.

695
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,520
To deal with the Yan family,

696
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,520
we must fight it out.

697
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,520
Yes.

698
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,520
I said Xie Jun An,

699
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,520
how can you be so suspicious?

700
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,520
The palace has been closed.

701
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,520
What does this mean?

702
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,520
It means that the Jinling people

703
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,520
have started to be dissatisfied with you.

704
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,520
If they really want to attack,

705
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,520
you...

706
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,520
You will be killed by your traitor.

707
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,520
Your life, my life,

708
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,520
will be ruined.

709
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,520
What's the use of being afraid?

710
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,520
Yes, it's useless to be afraid.

711
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,520
But you don't need to

712
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,520
attack the old man in the palace.

713
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,520
What?

714
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,520
You're afraid that he won't attack you, right?

715
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,520
We've been in the capital for four years.

716
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:54,300
All the details and

717
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,520
the Yan family will be removed.

718
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,520
You're so calm.

719
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,520
Didn't you say that

720
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,520
you were anxious to burn your butt?

721
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,520
If we can make the palace

722
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,520
self-assured,

723
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,520
we can't let the palace

724
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,520
be in the wrong.

725
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,520
He can't be a part of the Yan family.

726
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,520
Sir.

727
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,520
Sir.

728
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,520
You guessed it right.

729
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,520
The thing that I want to hide

730
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,520
is indeed about the grass.

731
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,520
A few days ago,

732
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,520
the Xue family joined the capital

733
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,520
to buy the silk merchant

734
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,520
to lower the price of silk.

735
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,520
The price of silk was high

736
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,520
and the price of silk was low.

737
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,520
They were forced to buy silk

738
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,520
in the Jiangnan region.

739
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,520
They were forced to buy silk

740
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,520
at a high price in the capital.

741
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,520
I didn't think about it.

742
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,520
This time, they turned the tide.

743
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,520
The business of the Xue family

744
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,520
was a business of life.

745
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,520
So we've been investigating for so long.

746
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,520
We haven't found their crime.

747
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,520
But this time,

748
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,520
they joined the silk merchant to lower the price.

749
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,520
The thing about the silk merchant's transfer

750
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,520
is not a big deal.

751
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,520
There are many people involved.

752
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,520
There are many people involved.

753
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,520
You two,

754
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,520
go and search for the silk merchant

755
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,520
and the silk merchant.

756
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,520
As for you...

757
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,520
As for me,

758
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,520
of course,

759
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,520
before the news is spread,

760
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,520
the price of silk was high.

761
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,520
With the news spread,

762
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,520
the private family and the general

763
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,520
are willing to make a big deal of it.

764
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,520
Miss,

765
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,520
how long have you been sleeping?

766
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,520
I don't understand business.

767
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,520
Thanks to you,

768
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,520
I'm kind and kind.

769
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,520
I don't mind trouble.

770
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,520
I'm willing to call me a general and a general.

771
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,520
I should learn more from you.

772
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,520
This is the new chapter

773
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,520
for you.

774
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,520
I've made a mark on it.

775
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,520
You can see it.

776
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,520
It's a new chapter.

777
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,520
It's a new chapter.

778
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,520
It's a new chapter.

779
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,520
It's a new chapter.

780
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,520
It's a new chapter.

781
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,520
It's a new chapter.

782
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,520
It's a new chapter.

783
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,520
It's a new chapter.

784
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,520
It's a new chapter.

785
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,520
It's easier to read.

786
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,520
It's more clear.

787
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,520
But

788
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,520
it's a good idea

789
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,520
to read the books at night.

790
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,520
You said the books are secret.

791
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,520
Why do you read them all?

792
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,520
Aren't you afraid that

793
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,520
I'll show them out?

794
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,520
I'm a businessman.

795
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,520
I'm a good businessman.

796
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,520
I don't care

797
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,520
how I should be.

798
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,520
I'm not afraid of people.

799
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,520
Besides,

800
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,520
I'm a businessman.

801
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,520
I'm a businessman.

802
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,520
I don't care

803
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,520
what kind of person you are.

804
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,520
I know what I'm thinking.

805
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,520
Thank you, boss Xu.

806
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,520
But

807
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,520
Miss,

808
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,520
the price is still high.

809
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,520
Aren't you afraid

810
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,520
that the money will be lost?

811
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,520
If it's lost,

812
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,520
I'll pay it back

813
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,520
to the Dong family in the future.

814
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,520
You really

815
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,520
care about the Dong family.

816
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,520
According to the law,

817
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,520
the money is from the Dong family.

818
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,520
The business is also from the Dong family.

819
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,520
If the money is lost,

820
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,520
it's all from the Dong family.

821
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,520
How?

822
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,520
It's still lost.

823
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,520
I'll pay it back.

824
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,520
Boss Xu, I don't know.

825
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,520
He is my benefactor.

826
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,520
Although

827
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,520
I don't know why he helped me,

828
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,520
I don't know why

829
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,520
he always wears a cup

830
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,520
when he looks at me.

831
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,520
But the water is always

832
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,520
full of water.

833
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,520
Since he asked me to do business,

834
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,520
maybe

835
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,520
I'll do business well.

836
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,520
I'll earn a lot of money

837
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,520
and be happy.

838
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,520
Boss Xu,

839
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,520
I'm hiding the money from the family.

840
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,520
I'll stay here for a while.

841
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,520
I'll go back first.

842
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,520
I'll come back soon.

843
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,520
Okay.

844
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,520
Thank you.

845
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,520
As for my personal money,

846
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,520
no matter who comes to ask,

847
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,520
I won't buy it.

848
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,520
Thank you.

849
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,520
This time,

850
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,520
I'll do it.

851
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,520
This time,

852
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,520
I'll go see the house.

853
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,520
My经 Yeon and his accident will occur.

854
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,520
The marriage of GuIG människor

855

ilanity and SJS,

857
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,520
can I get any carcol田East suitable for the future generations?

858
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,520
No condition.

859
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,520
This is the first time

860
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,520
In an official relationship,

861
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,520
nothing is possible,

862
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,520
Whether it's extraction or不知道,

863
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,520
we were notOur direct political 새로 active

864
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,520
The shortipping at the living room

865
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,520
Don't be a coward.

866
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,520
It hurts.

867
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,520
It hurts.

868
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,520
What?

869
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,520
You look like you didn't do anything.

870
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,520
Half of it?

871
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,520
I'm so angry today.

872
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,520
Tell me honestly.

873
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,520
When did Cao He's story come out?

874
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,520
When did it come out?

875
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,520
Who knew?

876
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,520
The news came out yesterday.

877
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,520
It's just been two hours.

878
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,520
Except for the letter,

879
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,520
you, me, and Dao Qin

880
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,520
are still in Xue's family.

881
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,520
No way.

882
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,520
Someone bought the raw silk from Xu Wen Yi.

883
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,520
And the raw silk must be in the market.

884
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,520
I'm a very good person.

885
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,520
Xu Wen Yi didn't say much.

886
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,520
But I heard from the meeting room

887
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,520
that she was a girl.

888
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,520
Who are you?

889
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,520
No one in the family

890
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,520
heard of her.

891
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,520
Her name is You Fang Yan.

892
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,520
There's a thorn behind this girl.

893
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,520
It's a pity that we didn't find it.

894
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,520
Uncle Jin,

895
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,520
let Dao Qin go to check it out.

896
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,520
This Thorn in the family

897
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,520
and the person behind her.

898
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,520
Yes.

899
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,520
You said half of it is half.

900
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,520
What do you think?

901
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,520
Xu Wen Yi

902
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,520
sold only 400 silk.

903
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,520
And he left a piece.

904
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,520
He is also smart.

905
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,520
He wants to be a fan too.

906
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,520
He sold the rest of the raw silk

907
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,520
to me.

908
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,520
That's good.

909
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,520
The four families are moving.

910
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,520
It's hard to understand.

911
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,520
We are not doing this for the sake of the wealth.

912
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,520
It's okay to make less money.

913
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,520
You are a big fan.

914
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,520
I remember that

915
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,520
the Yan family's accident

916
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,520
was on Yanling's wedding ceremony.

917
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,520
I broke the flag of Zhou Ying Zhi

918
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,520
in advance.

919
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,520
And the Yan family's breakfast was ready.

920
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,520
I think there will be a chance.

921
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,520
But the Xue family

922
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,520
is not a day's sweat for the Yan family.

923
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,520
We should do more

924
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,520
to help the Yan family.

925
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,520
Sister Jiang.

926
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,520
Come in.

927
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,520
Sister Jiang.

928
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,520
Sister Jiang.

929
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,520
Sister Jiang.

930
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,520
Sister Jiang.

931
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,520
Come in.

932
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,520
There is a cook

933
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,520
who is a good cook.

934
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,520
He is the best cook.

935
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,520
I heard that

936
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,520
you grew up in Jiangnan.

937
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,520
I came to eat with you.

938
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,520
I am a cook

939
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,520
in the family.

940
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,520
I will come to see you.

941
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,520
It's really famous.

942
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,520
It's so unique

943
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,520
compared to the old silk

944
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,520
in the capital.

945
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,520
It's so delicious.

946
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,520
Don't you like it?

947
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,520
It should be delicious.

948
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,520
But I don't like

949
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,520
sweet taste.

950
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,520
I hope you don't get me wrong.

951
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,520
I just say

952
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,520
the snacks of the Yan family

953
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,520
are even liked by the empress dowager.

954
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,520
Well.

955
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,520
It's good that you don't like it.

956
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,520
Give me all these.

957
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,520
I just don't want to drink.

958
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,520
You should leave some for me.

959
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,520
Jiang Xue Ning.

960
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,520
I have something to ask you.

961
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,520
I have something to ask you.

962
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,520
I have something to ask you.

963
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,520
I have something to ask you.

964
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,520
I have something to ask you.

965
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,520
I have something to ask you.
