1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
As long as I can enter the Ning'an Palace

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,200
and pay all the price

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,600
I will be willing to do my best

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,400
The End

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,800
The End

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,800
Everything seems to be a dream

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,400
I have owed a lot of people

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,800
Chaozhe, help me

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,600
I will be a good person after this

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
The End

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
I will be the one to take the favor

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,800
There are some things you can't give me

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
But what about them?

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,000
The life you chose is for Mr. You

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,400
In this world, everyone has the right to escape

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,000
But I can't

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,000
I want to regret it

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,400
and do the wrong thing

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,200
and go back in time

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Does Mr. Zhang believe that everything is decided?

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I would rather believe in the future

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,000
Your Highness

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,800
Your Highness

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,200
The End

26
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,000
Ning'an, what are you doing?

27
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,000
In the Ming Dynasty

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,600
there was always a pair of invisible hands

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,600
that could break everything

30
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,400
The revenge is long

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,600
Who are you in the end?

32
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,600
The Emperor of the mortal world is so long-winded

33
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,000
and so absurd

34
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,300
I will give you a break

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,600
The End

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Welcome to the dream of peace.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The smart baby, He Feihe.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The flying baby, Nifeng.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Welcome to the dream of peace.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We've come together.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's not safe to be in Thailand.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
How about this?

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We'll split up.

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Mr. and I,

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Miss Zhang,

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
follow Huang Qian.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
No.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I only know you.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Even if we have to split up,

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
why do you want to separate us?

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Do you have to ask?

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It must be the heart of Fengming and Xiao Ren.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm afraid you two will run away.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
No, I'm not.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What you mean is,

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
you're worried about the mess

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
we've prepared

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
in the check-in room

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
in the capital.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You two should be together.

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
If you don't want to be in trouble,

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
you can't get into the city

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
if you don't care about the future.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So,

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
we'll split up.

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's better.

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's okay.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Just do as they say.

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But,

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
please protect your sister.

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Take care of yourself.

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay.

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You said you were the soldiers of the guard city.

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We're the fruits of the Hongmeng Hotel.

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So,

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
you two

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
are the contacts in the city.

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Sir.

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Zhang Zhe is in the city with Fengming Yu.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Dao Qin is watching over there.

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
General Yan Liu has searched the forest.

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But he hasn't found the clue of the fire.

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Now, I don't know

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
when Fengming Yu will be in action.

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Nian Er is too dangerous.

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Inform Xiao Bao

87
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and Jin Ye

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
to find a way to get Nian Er out.

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yes.

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Besides,

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
His Majesty has sent

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Duke Ding's commander,

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Wei.

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But,

95
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
His Majesty is planning to

96
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
cross the border with him.

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He's not afraid of the danger.

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
He's afraid of the danger.

99
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Didn't you say

100
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
His Majesty was planning to

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
cross the border with him

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
in a few days?

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Why did you mention money?

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's not strange.

105
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He's been in the army for 20 years.

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,400
He should have his own

107
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,400
full-fledged reputation.

108
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,000
But now,

109
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
he doesn't know

110
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
where Fengming Yu is hiding.

111
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He can't hide

112
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
his identity.

113
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He missed this opportunity.

114
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm afraid it'll be hard

115
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
to deal with them again.

116
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's okay.

117
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Inform Xue Dingfei.

118
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
As long as Fengming Yu is in action,

119
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
report it immediately.

120
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes.

121
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Miss,

122
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
why don't you eat?

123
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm not hungry.

124
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
At least,

125
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
you can eat for ten times.

126
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Miss Zhang,

127
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
it's a bit dirty.

128
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Come on.

129
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Let's eat while we're waiting.

130
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes. Let's try it.

131
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Let's see if the food is good.

132
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Sister,

133
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
drink some water first.

134
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm hungry.

135
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm hungry.

136
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm hungry.

137
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm hungry.

138
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm hungry.

139
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm hungry.

140
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm hungry.

141
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm hungry.

142
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm hungry.

143
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Oh, right.

144
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Miss Zhang and Mr. Zhang

145
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
are the same age.

146
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Why is the gender difference?

147
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
We're the cousin brothers.

148
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
My surname is Jiang.

149
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Miss Jiang?

150
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I don't know

151
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
if Miss Jiang

152
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
is growing up in the capital.

153
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Where is your home?

154
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I said you're done.

155
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You've been looking for my brother's news

156
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
for a long time.

157
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Hurry up and drop my tea.

158
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You're waiting for General Feng

159
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
to come over.

160
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I don't want to.

161
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm just thinking

162
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
you're a little girl.

163
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What if

164
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Mr. Feng brings you

165
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
with him?

166
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Let me tell you the truth.

167
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
We're close.

168
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
We're not in a family.

169
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's not just a mission.

170
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
We're just a division.

171
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So there's still a reason.

172
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
No wonder we're all the same.

173
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What else?

174
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You guys think

175
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
why Mr. Du Jun

176
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
is so obsessed with the gods?

177
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Why don't you

178
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
receive the news of the prince?

179
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I don't want to

180
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
talk to you about

181
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
my brother's love for Xi Yu.

182
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You guys

183
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
don't even ask me

184
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
about it.

185
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What?

186
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You're still looking

187
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
for these personal matters

188
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
because you're so filial to the prince?

189
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What does it have to do with me?

190
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What else do you love?

191
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Look.

192
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I told you not to ask.

193
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Now you've offended

194
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Mr. Du Jun's sister.

195
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
No.

196
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The future wife.

197
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What if you get to Jinling?

198
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
How would I know

199
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
there's such a thing?

200
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Feng.

201
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I didn't hear

202
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
that the prince is so experienced

203
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
in Tongzhou.

204
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
How could you

205
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
even get the passbook?

206
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You know

207
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
a lot about it.

208
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's nothing to do with

209
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
the passbook.

210
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's not long

211
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
before

212
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
the whole of Tongzhou

213
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
is ours.

214
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The Jin Army

215
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
is in the hands of the people.

216
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
If the prince wants to do something,

217
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
it won't be easy, right?

218
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
No matter how

219
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
the Yan Army

220
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
fights with the Yong Army,

221
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
it can't defeat my hand.

222
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Mr. Du Jun,

223
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
don't worry.

224
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Tomorrow

225
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
there will be a good show for you.

226
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What's the matter tomorrow?

227
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We're here.

228
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
This is the place.

229
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Are you ready?

230
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm starving.

231
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm starving.

232
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Huang,

233
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
have you cooked?

234
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Brother.

235
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Eat.

236
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Please use the new room.

237
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Brother.

238
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What's wrong?

239
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Nothing.

240
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Miss Jiang,

241
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
you're worried about you today.

242
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Eat.

243
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yes.

244
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Come on.

245
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Is that girl

246
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
wrong?

247
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
No.

248
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Her brother is normal.

249
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Don't ask her.

250
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yes.

251
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What happened?

252
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Nothing.

253
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I think

254
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
you'd better not know.

255
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The thing is,

256
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Feng Mingyu is a hundred percent right.

257
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's what Huang Qian should be like.

258
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Miss Jiang, please tell me

259
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
if Zhang Meiyu is ready.

260
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Are you sure?

261
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's nothing.

262
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
She asked me

263
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
what's the relationship between you

264
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
and me.

265
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Why did you take me

266
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
to such a dangerous task?

267
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
We've discussed this problem

268
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
on the way.

269
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
We discussed it.

270
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But I thought

271
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
a better answer.

272
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I said

273
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
we're close friends.

274
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We're just friends.

275
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What did you say?

276
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I said we're just friends.

277
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Nonsense.

278
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Eat.

279
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Eat.

280
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I said...

281
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
No, I said...

282
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I was afraid that Yan Duo and Bi Shi

283
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
would think of a excuse

284
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
to poison their mouth.

285
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Did I say it wrong?

286
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I didn't think of a good excuse

287
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
for a while.

288
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What if something bad happens to you?

289
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And you said

290
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
they misunderstood

291
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
our relationship.

292
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Didn't you say

293
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
they misunderstood our relationship?

294
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
They misunderstood.

295
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Tell yourself

296
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
if it's a good thing.

297
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's all my fault.

298
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I won't ruin your reputation.

299
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'll say whatever you want.

300
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Don't be angry.

301
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
What's the reputation of Zhang Meiyu?

302
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Jiang Er is going to marry someone

303
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
in the future.

304
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's so confusing

305
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
and confusing.

306
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What's the problem?

307
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I don't want to marry anyone anyway.

308
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Okay.

309
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Let's not talk about this.

310
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I heard what Feng Mi and Suo Yan said on the way.

311
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
They'll take action tomorrow.

312
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Miss Jiang,

313
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
it's not a long time.

314
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You're sick tonight.

315
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I know you can't rest assured.

316
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But it's dangerous.

317
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You're the only one who's left here.

318
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Zhang Meiyu is more heartless.

319
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I promised you

320
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
that I'll let you go back to the capital safely.

321
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I promise.

322
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I won't let you down.

323
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What's wrong?

324
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It hurts.

325
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's not comfortable.

326
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Miss.

327
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
How's the situation?

328
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Please tell us the truth.

329
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Look at Miss Jiang.

330
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
She's poisoned.

331
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Look at me.

332
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm a man of rage.

333
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I can't poison Miss Xiao.

334
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
This is your base.

335
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
The outside world is yours.

336
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You two are on the road

337
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
to the Zhang Meiyu's office.

338
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You're the one who's poisoned.

339
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I doubt you.

340
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
How can I believe you?

341
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Don't worry.

342
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
We're indeed

343
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
heartless.

344
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
But if we're really killed,

345
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
we're all in the outside world.

346
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Why do we need to do that?

347
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
We should

348
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
take the risk of being poisoned.

349
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's still bright.

350
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Where can we find the doctor?

351
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yes.

352
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The doctor in the pharmacy

353
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
lives in the shop.

354
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
We can send her there.

355
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
But we still need to be Xiao Bao.

356
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Xiao Bao,

357
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'll send you two people.

358
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It'll be nice to meet the officials.

359
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Please don't worry, Mr. Zhang.

360
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Xiao Bao will take good care of her.

361
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yes.

362
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Stop.

363
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What's wrong?

364
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Stop for a while.

365
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What's wrong?

366
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Stop.

367
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Miss Nian, this is the antidote.

368
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Ning'er.

369
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You're the one who attacked Xie Wei.

370
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You did it?

371
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
All right.

372
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Fortunately, you're safe.

373
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You're out now.

374
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,400
This is a little bit of a battle.

375
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,600
Later, I will ask you to go to the guest house in the opposite side of the street to stay for a night.

376
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,400
No matter what happens on the street tomorrow, don't come out.

377
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,000
Next, someone will come to pick you up.

378
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,200
Where is Master Zhang? What will he do?

379
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,600
Miss, don't worry. Master Ding Fei is with Master Zhang over there.

380
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,800
He won't be anything.

381
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,000
He is also a man of the line.

382
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yong Di's要扑有布置,

383
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,400
The court has long been in the hands of the Emperor.

384
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,400
Next, we will wait for Master Zhang to come out.

385
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,000
That will be fine.

386
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Thank you for saving me.

387
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,400
Okay. Thank you for saving me.

388
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,200
You are welcome.

389
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,600
You have been going for so long. Where is the person?

390
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,200
The presbyterial medicine has already been tested.

391
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,600
Those two people have left the medicine.

392
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,600
If there is anything, they can protect Sister.

393
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,600
That's good. Just keep an eye on her.

394
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,800
Come in. Get ready to go.

395
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,000
Father, this forest is so big.

396
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,400
Where is the secret party?

397
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,600
If it is attacked by Xie Wei,

398
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,000
wouldn't we just run away?

399
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,600
You go to the Four Seasons to check.

400
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,400
See if there are any clues.

401
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,400
Yes.

402
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,600
Eh?

403
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,000
Mister,

404
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,300
Xiao Bao already brought Jiao kung fils.

405
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,200
I am sure that it will tell him in a hurry.

406
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,800
It said the sky was bright.

407
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
And Feng Mягyu took them to the Goalstem.

408
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,200
It turned out over there

409
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,100
was the place that Feng M bearing the Fire element.

410
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,400
Saying it, it is even rise above theButter apprentice.

411
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,340
Alright, Cris.

412
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,000
Why didn't they fight against the Yan army

413
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
and set fire in the temple?

414
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,200
I'll inform Duke Ding to go to Shangqing Temple.

415
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,600
No need. Xue Yuan just closed his own door for the military.

416
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,800
He won't listen to us.

417
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,200
Dao Qing, you go to the rebel army.

418
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,800
Let them investigate.

419
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,000
Yes.

420
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Sir.

421
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Zhang Zhe has already found out the whereabouts of the rebel army.

422
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,800
We must kill him today.

423
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
Retreat!

424
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,400
Xiaobao is Xie Wei's man.

425
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,400
Consort Xue should be the same.

426
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:06,000
If that's the case, why didn't Xie Wei tell Zhang Zhe earlier?

427
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Is he afraid that Zhang Zhe will suspect that he has something to do with the rebel army?

428
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,200
If that's the case, Xie Wei will let Xiaobao take me out.

429
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,800
He will not expose himself in front of Zhang Zhe.

430
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,800
With his secret, he won't be so shameless.

431
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,600
You're a loser.

432
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,800
Sir, I've brought tea for you.

433
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,000
Come in.

434
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,200
What's the situation in the city today?

435
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,800
For example, the military camp is out of the army or the government is out of the army.

436
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,400
I've never heard that if the government has an action,

437
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,400
they will naturally raise the alarm and inform us and businessmen.

438
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,600
Please slow down.

439
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,400
Xiaobao brought me out last night.

440
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,000
It means that the government has already prepared for action.

441
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,200
But it's been a few hours now. Why hasn't it moved yet?

442
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,000
No, I have to go and see.

443
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
Is this the Yongding Medical Department?

444
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,400
Yes.

445
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,200
Miss, you're not in the army.

446
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,800
It's not me. It's Master Zhang.

447
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,400
He's in danger now. Please inform the reinforcements quickly.

448
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,000
What Master Zhang?

449
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,200
What reinforcements?

450
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,200
This is the medical department. It's not the military camp.

451
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,800
You don't know?

452
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,200
How is that possible?

453
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,000
Hurry and ask the doctor.

454
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,800
How many Yongding medical departments are in the city?

455
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,400
Only one of us.

456
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,000
I don't know.

457
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I don't know.

458
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,800
How many Yongding medical departments are in the city?

459
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,000
Only one of us.

460
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Miss, what are you doing?

461
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,600
If you don't want to see the doctor, don't disturb our business here.

462
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,800
It's Xie Wei who lied to him.

463
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,000
Xie Wei didn't plan to arrange for the Yongding Medical Department to rescue him.

464
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,600
He wanted to kill the killer.

465
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,600
He never thought of letting Zhang Zhenzhen leave the city alive.

466
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,800
Where is the Yanjia Army Camp?

467
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,400
I'm asking you, where is the Yanjia Army Camp?

468
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,600
Xiaobao,

469
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
don't follow them to the mountain.

470
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,800
Keep watch under the mountain.

471
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,200
If there is any movement,

472
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
report to them at any time.

473
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,200
SmokingMUSIC

474
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,400
This is where you can be the aluminium known as waste.

475
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,000
I came here secretly a year ago to occupy this place.

476
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I sent people here to train soldiers and gather news about the court and the camp.

477
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,200
There are many things to do today.

478
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,600
I can't tell, Lao Feng.

479
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,200
You're not on the way.

480
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,200
You've made such a big move in Tongzhou. I'm not sure if I can handle it.

481
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:20,400
These years, the King's north is already full of doubts.

482
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,400
At first, I thought it was Mr. Du Jun who betrayed the court.

483
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,000
So, I've been prepared all the way.

484
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Please excuse me.

485
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,000
Hurry!

486
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
General Feng has worked hard for the King.

487
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,400
It's good to be cautious.

488
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,200
But where is the good play that General Feng wants to show me?

489
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,000
The good play must be left until the end.

490
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,200
Why must you be anxious?

491
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,800
Please come in.

492
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,900
If a student hovers the Immortality Flamel,

493
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,600
they'll thought it as a memorable sight.

494
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,500
In fact...

495
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,500
I want to praise those fishy corpses who are still alive.

496
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,600
Sir.

497
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,900
Why don't you ask Mr. Du Jun to read the Until the Tucum sent for the Official?

498
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,500
Just take it.

499
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,500
Where is the right case?

500
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,700
I've left it in the bank.

501
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,800
So you need to take someone to take matter and get the down payment?

502
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:07,820
I can never imagine you are so lucky to have settled in one ком cm let's go

503
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,640
there is some ought to have an advise

504
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:23,300
광

505
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,900
After a long time, we got news.

506
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,900
The imperial court sent Duke Ding

507
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,260
to take a large group of five people to rob.

508
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,100
They came all the way here.

509
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,300
General Feng,

510
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,660
since we know about this,

511
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,780
why don't we tell them earlier?

512
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,980
We'll have a plan.

513
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,740
What are you afraid of?

514
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,820
There are many soldiers in Shangqing Temple.

515
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,660
There are a large group of firemen.

516
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,380
Who wins, who loses, who doesn't know.

517
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,700
I'm just thinking

518
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,580
that we should be careful on this road

519
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,820
and be careful.

520
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,420
Duke Ding has the ability to make a living.

521
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,140
How do we know if we're in the same boat?

522
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,220
You mean

523
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,460
there's a spy?

524
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,340
General,

525
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,660
a girl said she's a friend of His Lordship.

526
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,020
She wants to see you.

527
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,420
His Lordship?

528
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,900
She's still a girl?

529
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:20,700
Yes.

530
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,940
You're so ambitious.

531
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,180
Don't you want to say something?

532
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,020
General Feng told us the news.

533
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,740
You didn't explain it.

534
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,420
You came to ask me,

535
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,940
but it's hard.

536
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,260
Before I went to Shangqing Temple,

537
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,700
His Lordship suspected that you were a spy

538
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,500
and suspected the imperial court.

539
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,580
Now it seems that

540
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,220
Duke Ding's spy

541
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,900
might be you.

542
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,900
The clear-minded man is clear.

543
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:50,380
I'm flattered to ask you about the order.

544
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,100
Besides me,

545
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,580
does General Feng have any suspicion?

546
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:58,900
Me?

547
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,940
What do you mean?

548
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,620
I'm not sure.

549
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,740
Now General Feng is in a mess.

550
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,780
If you suspect me on the road,

551
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,140
why didn't you tell the imperial court

552
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,460
that you're asking for His Lordship's permission?

553
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,540
But it's not true.

554
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,220
The imperial court is in a hurry.

555
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,900
You should have got the news.

556
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,620
Let me ask you.

557
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,140
When you left the imperial court,

558
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,260
did His Lordship tell you

559
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,340
that I told you to only listen to Feng Mingyu?

560
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,300
No.

561
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,380
His Lordship only told me

562
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,260
that most of the imperial court's forces

563
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,500
were taught to Mr. Gong Yi

564
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,820
and Mr. Du Jun.

565
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:36,620
As for General Feng's

566
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,540
and the imperial court,

567
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,860
it's useless to use the imperial court.

568
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,420
But General Feng

569
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,420
is a spy and a spy.

570
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,020
I want to ask you.

571
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,020
What else do you want to know?

572
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:47,700
That's because...

573
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,500
Young Master Ding Fei,

574
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,100
do you still want to be a spy?

575
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,340
I don't want to be a spy.

576
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,580
Young Master, don't you want to blame me?

577
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,940
You're just a spy.

578
00:24:59,020 --> 00:24:59,940
I have the trust of His Lordship.

579
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,700
I can see it.

580
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,620
I'm not afraid of anything.

581
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,580
Zhang Mou is a spy.

582
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,580
If he doesn't want to be a spy,

583
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,220
he'll let Li Lu come to the base.

584
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:07,980
But you...

585
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,100
Why didn't you tell me

586
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,380
that you're asking for my permission

587
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,660
on the road?

588
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,380
Do you want to kill him?

589
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,580
Nonsense!

590
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,020
Don't listen to him.

591
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,260
This is a spy camp.

592
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,260
It's not a place

593
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,580
to borrow the Mountain Flower or buy the camp.

594
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,180
I...

595
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,780
I'm doing this for the sake of the capital.

596
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,060
The army of Fengzhou is full of soldiers.

597
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,300
The camp is wide and spacious.

598
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,100
The Mountain Flower will be buried easily.

599
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,980
You're always trying to break the barrier.

600
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,700
Young Master Ding Fei, don't do it.

601
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,300
Xue Ding Fei, are you crazy?

602
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,500
Huang Qian, what are you waiting for?

603
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,380
We'll die here

604
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,580
when he takes the pill.

605
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,100
Hurry up!

606
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,020
General Feng,

607
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,580
I didn't want to be your enemy.

608
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,980
But now it's complicated.

609
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,380
Can you two

610
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,660
go back to see the prince with me?

611
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,740
I'll tell the princess

612
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,900
to let the prince come to the base.

613
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,140
I'm innocent.

614
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,340
I can't ask for it.

615
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,100
No!

616
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,780
If you let such a cunning and treacherous thief

617
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:01,820
go back,

618
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,900
you don't know how to

619
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,100
get rid of him in front of the prince.

620
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,460
You can leave.

621
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,980
He must stay.

622
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,780
After General Feng leaves,

623
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,780
you can't tell me

624
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,780
about Duke Ding.

625
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:11,820
You...

626
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,380
What are you doing?

627
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,540
He's the one who's in trouble.

628
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,420
It's not me!

629
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:21,820
You...

630
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,940
You should tell yourself clearly

631
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,380
and tell me what you've done.

632
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,100
You two are stupid.

633
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,940
What are you waiting for?

634
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,260
Are you waiting for them to open the cage?

635
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,260
Go, go, go.

636
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,580
Sir,

637
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,100
Xueyue is in a critical condition.

638
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,620
She went to Shangjingguan all the way.

639
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,140
Why are there so many people today?

640
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,100
My Lord,

641
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,460
a girl came this morning

642
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,580
and said she had a clue about the rebel party.

643
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,380
She took the soldiers with her

644
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,460
and went to the mountain with her.

645
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,380
She's gone.

646
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:17,980
A girl?

647
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,660
Is she a girl

648
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,740
who's about 18 or 19 years old?

649
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,420
Yes.

650
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,660
She also said she was a member of the Yan clan

651
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,860
and said a lot of things about the clan.

652
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,940
She's really familiar with it.

653
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,740
How could she be?

654
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,260
Xiaobao should have planned it.

655
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,300
She's here.

656
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,100
It means she's found something wrong.

657
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,460
The soldiers are in a hurry.

658
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,340
They're in a hurry.

659
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,380
They're going to the mountain from the back.

660
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,060
They must bring her out

661
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,060
before they're killed by the fire.

662
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,060
Yes.

663
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,340
Aren't you going to go first?

664
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,260
You're not well.

665
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,060
It's too dangerous.

666
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,660
I want it.

667
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,060
Give it to me.

668
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,460
What are you waiting for?

669
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,620
Open your eyes.

670
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,820
The soldiers are still here.

671
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,780
Why is Young Master Ding Fei not here?

672
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,140
Idiot.

673
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,780
Why don't you trust me?

674
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,580
They're obviously from the same clan.

675
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,100
Xue Dingfei has been arrested by the government.

676
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,020
What?

677
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,500
General, it's bad.

678
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,460
The new guard is out of the game.

679
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,620
He's already killed the gate.

680
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,460
Stop.

681
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:38,940
Kneel.

682
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:41,820
Stop.

683
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,420
Stop.

684
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,380
Hurry.

685
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,820
Didn't Xiaobao guard the mountain?

686
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,660
He's too much.

687
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,780
Now you know how to panic.

688
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,900
Don't panic.

689
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,860
I have a plan.

690
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,780
I don't have any plans.

691
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:55,860
Today,

692
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,100
we're going to bury this place.

693
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,340
Go fight with them.

694
00:28:59,340 --> 00:28:59,860
Stop.

695
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:07,980
You guys.

696
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,700
Come with me.

697
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,260
Let's go.

698
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,340
Hurry.

699
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,420
Xue Dingfei.

700
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,500
Are you from the south or the north?

701
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,580
It's important to be alive.

702
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,060
We can go down the mountain.

703
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,260
We can't wait for them to come back.

704
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,420
We can't run away.

705
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:25,940
Let's go.

706
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,260
If we leave like this,

707
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,300
what about the people of the new guard

708
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,820
and the innocent people of the military force?

709
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,900
What can you do?

710
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,780
Just like you,

711
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,780
the first one to die

712
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,300
when you see Wen Ru Shu's wound.

713
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,820
What are you doing?

714
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:41,900
Did you see that?

715
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,300
I won't die

716
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,340
if he finds out.

717
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,860
I won't die.

718
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,580
Let's go.

719
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,620
Kill him.

720
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,980
Don't let him go.

721
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,420
Now,

722
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,340
I'm going to kill he's army

723
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,940
just to make the watching over then everyone is gone.

724
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:20,900
Listen to me.

725
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,180
Don't be afraid.

726
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,700
Now,

727
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,380
there is only one way out.

728
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,140
Head 1.

729
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,740
Exactly the same thing.

730
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,260
Is it important to help him?

731
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,060
Ready.

732
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:41,860
Go.

733
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,860
Don't chase after them.

734
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,500
The enemy is obviously in the middle of the mountain.

735
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,060
We have fire in our hands.

736
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,340
You're so timid.

737
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,220
What do you know about the situation?

738
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,060
Move aside!

739
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,260
No, Young Master Xu!

740
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,260
Young Master Xu!

741
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,140
There's a young master in front of us!

742
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,140
Young Master Xu!

743
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,900
Go!

744
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,900
Everyone, run!

745
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,620
Mr. Du Jun, how are you?

746
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,620
Who is the dog of the court?

747
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,460
You've already seen it.

748
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,620
What else do you want to say?

749
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,660
You're a bunch of thieves.

750
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,860
How dare you shout?

751
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,140
Now that you've saved the money,

752
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,420
I'll spare your life!

753
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,380
You don't know how to live.

754
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,380
Shoot!

755
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,900
Protect the Prince!

756
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,580
Young Master!

757
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,580
The enemy is in the middle of the mountain.

758
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,580
They have high positions.

759
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,580
They're not good at us.

760
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,580
Are you afraid?

761
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,580
I'm not good at this.

762
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,580
If my father comes,

763
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,580
I'll kill him.

764
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,580
No, they have fire in their hands.

765
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,580
They deliberately call us here to kill.

766
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,900
They'll kill us here.

767
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,580
If they let the Duke down,

768
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,580
we'll kill them.

769
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,580
We'll kill them.

770
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,580
We'll kill them.

771
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,580
We'll kill them.

772
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,580
We'll kill them.

773
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,060
If they come here,

774
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,580
we'll destroy this place.

775
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,380
Don't shoot!

776
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,380
Prince Xin!

777
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,380
It's the new Wei's message.

778
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,380
They're here, too?

779
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,380
It's time to send them off.

780
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,380
Young Master,

781
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,380
we're here for the first time.

782
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,380
It's too late to do so.

783
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,380
How about I take a team of people

784
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,380
to save Lord Zhang?

785
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,380
No.

786
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,380
The Yi-Demons brought him here.

787
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,380
There must be a specific point.

788
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,380
If you split up,

789
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,380
the Gu Army will be in danger.

790
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,380
There must be another conspiracy.

791
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,380
We must not only save Lord Zhang,

792
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,380
but also stop this.

793
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,380
General!

794
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,380
I'm really Lord Zhang.

795
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,380
I'm really a brother.

796
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,380
It hurts!

797
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,380
Don't!

798
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,380
It's you!

799
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,380
Young Master, you know him.

800
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,380
He's the one.

801
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,380
You know him?

802
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,380
When we were looking for him,

803
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,380
we found out that he was suspicious.

804
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,380
We asked him before,

805
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,380
what Lord Zhang was he?

806
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,380
I thought he was not like him.

807
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,380
So I pushed him over.

808
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,380
Okay, okay.

809
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,380
I misunderstood.

810
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,380
I mean,

811
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,380
I'm here to save Lord Zhang.

812
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,380
Where is he?

813
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,380
Over there.

814
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,380
Father!

815
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,380
Mother is here!

816
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,380
Ying'er!

817
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,380
Father!

818
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,380
Father!

819
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,380
Mother, be careful not to come over.

820
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,380
We don't want to.

821
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,380
Father!

822
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,380
Father, save me!

823
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,380
Father!

824
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,380
Ying'er, are you okay?

825
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,380
rar

826
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,980
Episode 44

827
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:01,380
You misunderstood me.

828
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,380
Lord Zhang!

829
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,380
You are here to save the望 King Shi?

830
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,380
Yes.

831
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:12,020
I can't bear to re 這個所謂的事情的主要是讓所有人ート 都房嫁出手ソAPPLAUSE

832
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:17,940
Why are there so many people?

833
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:18,880
Dad

834
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:19,620
We put out the code

835
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,340
You've wanted the death of this government

836
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,460
It's not that easy

837
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,160
I'm not worried about you all gettingツ metaphoric

838
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,240
We're depending on the Crown Prince

839
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:34,680
Ushan will kill theobot我濥個笑我來

840
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:35,820
Yes

841
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,820
Kill them all!

842
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,820
Don't even talk about it!

843
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,820
Yes!

844
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,820
I've seen it.

845
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,820
The road to the mountain is destroyed.

846
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,820
The fire in the mountain is still burning.

847
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,820
Sir, they should be up there.

848
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,820
Sir, you're not feeling well.

849
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,820
Just wait here.

850
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,820
We'll bring Jiang Neng back.

851
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,820
Don't talk too much.

852
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,820
Hurry up and get out of here.

853
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,820
Yes, sir!

854
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,820
Sir!

855
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,820
Don't come over!

856
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,820
Go!

857
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,820
The Yan Army is here.

858
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,820
They're trying to kill me.

859
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,820
Protect Minister Zhang!

860
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,820
Go!

861
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,820
Go!

862
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,820
What are you doing here?

863
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,820
We'll leave together.

864
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,820
I can't leave you here alone.

865
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,820
I planned to kill Xing Hui first.

866
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,820
But I didn't want to kill the Yan Army.

867
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,820
I didn't expect to do this myself.

868
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,820
It's great.

869
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,820
Even if we're the same, what's the point of fighting?

870
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,820
General, what do you mean?

871
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,820
Are you trying to kill us?

872
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,820
We're afraid of death.

873
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,820
How can we achieve great things?

874
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,820
The whole mountain is full of good medicine.

875
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,820
As long as I think about it again,

876
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,820
the mountain will be destroyed.

877
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,820
The army of the people and the people can't run away.

878
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,820
General, so many people have died.

879
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,820
How can you fight with the prince?

880
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,820
The prince is in the big city.

881
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,820
The whole Jinling will remember my name.

882
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,820
He's gone mad.

883
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,820
Stop!

884
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,820
You two are going to betray the prince?

885
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,820
Father, save me!

886
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,820
Go!

887
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,820
Go!

888
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,820
You're afraid of death?

889
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,820
Give me back the shield!

890
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,820
I'll kill you if I die.

891
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,820
I'll kill you!

892
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,820
General, Miss Jiang, I'll take you out.

893
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,820
Don't worry about us now.

894
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,820
As long as we can stop the Fengbin Army from attacking,

895
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,820
we'll have a chance to survive.

896
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,820
You two, follow me!

897
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,820
Yes!

898
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,820
Lord Mu!

899
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,820
It's not the time to escape.

900
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,820
Please lead the guards to the mountain to help the Yan Army.

901
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,820
Otherwise, we'll be in trouble.

902
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,820
Don't bother him.

903
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,820
I'll separate the troops and punish them.

904
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,820
I'll inform all the new guards to leave the country.

905
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,820
Duke Ding! Duke!

906
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,820
We're in the war.

907
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,820
They just want to retreat.

908
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,820
Retreat! Retreat!

909
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:26,820
Retreat!

910
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,820
Retreat!

911
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,820
Retreat!

912
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:28,820
Xie Wei, kill him!

913
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,820
Master Shao Shi.

914
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:00,820
All the rebels, kill them all!

915
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:01,820
Yes!

916
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:10,820
Are you all right?

917
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:11,820
Stop the nonsense!

918
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,820
Retreat!

919
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,820
No one can stop me.

920
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,820
I'm afraid I'll die.

921
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,820
I'm afraid I'll die.

922
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,820
I'm afraid I'll die.

923
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,820
I'm afraid I'll die.

924
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,820
I'm afraid I'll die.

925
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:09,820
I'm afraid I'll die.

926
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,820
I'm afraid I'll die.

927
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:13,820
I'm afraid I'll die.

928
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,820
I'm afraid I'll die.

929
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,820
I'm afraid I'll die.

930
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,820
I'm afraid I'll die.

931
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,820
I'm afraid I'll die.

932
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,820
I'm afraid I'll die.

933
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,820
I'm afraid I'll die.

934
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:27,820
I'm afraid I'll die.

935
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,820
I'm afraid I'll die.

936
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,820
I'm afraid I'll die.

937
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:33,820
I'm afraid I'll die.

938
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:35,820
I'm afraid I'll die.

939
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,820
I'm afraid I'll die.

940
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,820
