1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
As long as I can enter the Ning'an Palace

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,200
and pay all the price

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,600
I will be willing to do my best

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,400
The End

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,800
The End

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,800
Everything seems to be a dream

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,400
I have owe many people

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,800
Chaozhe, help me

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,600
I will be a good person after this

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
The End

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
I will be the one to take the throne

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,800
There are some things you can't give me

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
But what about them?

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,000
The life you chose is for Mr. You

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,400
In this world, everyone has the right to escape

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,000
But I can't

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,000
I want to regret it

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,400
and do the wrong thing

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,200
and go back in time

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Does Mr. Zhang believe that everything is decided?

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I would rather believe in the future

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Your Highness

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,000
Your Highness

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The End

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Ning'an, what are you doing?

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
In the end

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
there is a pair of invisible hands

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
that can break everything

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The revenge is long and the wish is long

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Who are you in the end?

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The Emperor of the mortal world is so long and he is so absurd

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It can't be upwards

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
From the demon's view, you are as dreamy as a dream.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,500
Children don't like to eat, don't grow up.

36
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,700
Use the dragon's eyes to make the bone.

37
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,700
Dragon's eyes to make the bone.

38
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,200
Demon's view, you are as dreamy as a dream.

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Last time, I didn't participate in Yanling's ceremony.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't know what happened.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I was so worried.

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
This time, when I calm down,

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I think I can change it.

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Today is a very cold day.

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You all are here.

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yanmu,

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I am grateful for your help.

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I am sorry.

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I am sorry.

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I am sorry.

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I am sorry.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I am sorry.

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I am sorry.

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I am sorry.

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I am sorry.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yanmu, I am grateful for your help.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I think I am so anxious.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I am so busy.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I am going to the sand field.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I am going to the wheel.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't want to be old and old.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But I am old and sick.

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I am so happy.

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Today you all are here.

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You have enough the respect of my old man.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You have enough the respect of my son.

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Now, you should be brave.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Thank you.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I have made the order.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Please, my son.

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
We have a good name.

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Can I join you to write.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Can I join you?

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Not really.

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Can you help me write?

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I am not leaving.

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Please.

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Please.

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,200
these Judas bands

80
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,960

81
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,080
don't work for them.

82

110
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,160
Miss Xie is looking at À

111
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,400
and seeing the difference.

112
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,760
Why?

113
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,080
I'm afraid that

114
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,060

00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,800

even after going down.

118
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,320
I think

119
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,320
Y April started in about half of her brother.

120
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,820
Liang left Wei as a shield and left his mansion to the Ming.

121
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,460
A famous man left Wei as a shield,

122
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,840
and left his landlord at Wei.

123
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:45,680
Brother,

124
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,420

I'll accept your offer.

00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,620
Yaling dare not NOT to love

131
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,640
that he remembers,

132
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,260
the spotlless watched over by you.

133
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:32,240
The one who has the choice is theamoto.

134
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,480
Only moonlight is transparent and there's no darkness.

135
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,980
For you and the way beyond the heavens

136

Let me.

139
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,300
You wanna believe it?

140
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,300
What?

141
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,300
You got lost.

142
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,260
You are크�OC.

143
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:25,440
Who's this national security officer?

144
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,240
Be my guest.

145
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,460
Whoever defends him would be dismissed.

146
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:44,920
The citizens of Lanzhou wouldn't be amore useless to you.

147
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,160
Name him NOW CO ninja.

148
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,380

150
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,300

00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,220
Get ready.

152
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:37,980
Father.

153
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,140
Father.

154
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,120
Your Majesty.

155
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,300
when YuELong and Excellent Blessed Grandhaftou

156
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,920
suddenly decided

157
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,160
A decree had been sent-

158
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,980
He agreed to meet 와서

159
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,500
all snaps of the sword

160
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,820
He tried to disperse

161
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,680
to hide the members

162
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,860
Now the T問題wah

163
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,080
heữ were removed

164
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,540
So what if me?

165
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,640
Sir,

166
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,520
the young,

167
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,640
Master De,

168
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,160
Prince Jin

169
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,960
is keeping Master Ding's term~!

170
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,800
Don't mind me now,

171
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,800
go prepare for that.

172
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,160
Please stop

173
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,920
I'll do anything.

174
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,640
Your Highness,

175
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,520
is there any misunderstanding?

176
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,880
If you give me a decree,

177
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,160
I can't do anything.

178
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,440
If anyone dares to question the decree,

179
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,560
it's the decree of the emperor.

180
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,960
Lingling, what are you doing?

181
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,640
There must be a reason.

182
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,200
I won't collude with you.

183
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,280
I know that.

184
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,920
But this is the decree of the emperor.

185
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,680
It's against the decree of the emperor.

186
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,920
The whole country is not satisfied.

187
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,520
Please leave.

188
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,440
Yanmu,

189
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,280
are you trying to defame the emperor?

190
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:49,800
Sir,

191
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,080
don't go to the dog's den.

192
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,760
My husband...

193
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,560
What is this?

194
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,800
A wild dog

195
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,480
dare to talk in front of my father?

196
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,480
What's the rush?

197
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,360
Kneel.

198
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,560
What is the reroutal.

199
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,240
Sit down on your knees and cut the string.

200
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,760
Cross your legs,

201
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,120
Keep your body on your head.

202
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,920
Sir is stubborn.

203
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,280
You want to drown yourself in peace?

204
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,200
You don't want to characteristic it.

205
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,400
You get recognizes as deputy king of the country.

206
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,360
Your coroner,

207
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,920
you have your rage.

208
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,640
Get your rage?

209
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,120
I softly younger boy.

210
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,400
But I'm not the official official.

211
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,520
mediator did so much for me.

212
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,520
things will change.

213
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,080
As long as it's calm down,

214
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,520
we'll find a way.

215
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,680
Your Highness,

216
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,040
if I'm not mistaken,

217
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,880
the decree to banish Yanling

218
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,320
is also under the order of His Majesty.

219
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,640
It's all His Majesty's order.

220
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,280
We should have a first-aid.

221
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,520
What do you think?

222
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,720
Good.

223
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,840
Brother Huang has ordered

224
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,440
to banish Yanling from the Anwen family.

225
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,520
Your Highness, please take your leave.

226
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,840
Don't disturb the management.

227
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,120
Brother Huang, you're right.

228
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,120
Father,

229
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,680
we don't need to worry about the decree.

230
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,120
Everyone is looking at us today.

231
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,520
The situation is too bad.

232
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,320
It's not good for the Xue family.

233
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,120
Good.

234
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,440
I'll wait for you to

235
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,720
take over the management.

236
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,520
I'll wait for you to take over the management.

237
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,720
You take over the management.

238
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,120
I'll see when you can take over.

239
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,520
I've taken over the management.

240
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,920
Please give the decree to me, Young Master Xie.

241
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,720
It's hard to figure out the truth.

242
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,520
The two of you are destined to be together.

243
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,520
It's not good for the first son.

244
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,320
The Great Peng and the Wind are together.

245
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,920
The spirit of the demon is above us.

246
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,120
It's beyond our reach.

247
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,720
But the Cangqiong is not a place for the dragon.

248
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,920
Cangkai is the only one

249
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,320
who can help us.

250
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,720
The Cangqiong is the only one

251
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,920
who can help us.

252
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,920
The Cangqiong is the only one.

253
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,320
The Cangqiong is the only one.

254
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,120
The Cangqiong is the only one.

255
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,720
The Cangqiong is the only one.

256
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,920
Cangkai is the new chief.

257
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,320
The evil is too much.

258
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,120
Don't change your mind.

259
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,320
You are the son of the demon.

260
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,320
Go back.

261
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,520
The color of Mount Tai is not different from the previous one.

262
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,320
Young Master Xie indeed.

263
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,520
Young Master Xie.

264
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,020
Young Master Xie.

265
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,920
Young Master Xie.

266
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,720
Yes, Young Master Xie.

267
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,520
Hu.

268
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,720
odoHua Tyler.

269
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,820
Hu.

270
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,820
Ye Wan.

271
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,820
Your Majesty, it's been half an hour.

272
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,820
I think it's already in Yongyi's Mansion.

273
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,820
Your Majesty.

274
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,420
Your Majesty has been in the East and is not feeling well.

275
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,620
I don't understand why the Empress Dowager

276
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,420
is forcing you to leave today and that Tongzhou

277
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,420
really did something that made the situation worse.

278
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,620
Even if Yongyi really wants to go back,

279
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,420
it's not a choice that will be made today.

280
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,620
There must be something strange in it.

281
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:17,620
But if Yongyi doesn't take the order

282
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,820
and has a conflict with Uncle,

283
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,220
then the crime of resisting the decree will be a fact.

284
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,020
So Uncle will surely not have to go to the court today

285
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,820
and force the Yan family to take action.

286
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:33,220
Then if Lord Yan is willing to follow the decree

287
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,020
and hand over the military talisman?

288
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,020
The Yan family is a group of soldiers in the world.

289
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:42,220
Now the army in his hands is half in Tongzhou

290
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,620
and is in the hands of the Jinling Army.

291
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:49,420
The other half is in the hands of the border guards and the army of Da Yue.

292
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:54,220
The so-called military talisman is the personal seal of the Yan family's generations.

293
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,020
So as long as the Yan family is alive,

294
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,220
the Yan family will never really be loyal to anyone.

295
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,220
So for the old man,

296
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:08,020
what he wants is the life of the Yan family's generations.

297
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,820
Then why does His Majesty still agree with the bloodline of the Xue family?

298
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,020
Empress, you forgot.

299
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,220
Xie Wei is the official of today.

300
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,820
He is loyal to me.

301
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,420
If he is here, he won't mess with the officials.

302
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,020
The Yan family won't mess with him.

303
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,220
The money won't mess with him either.

304
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:31,820
If we fight each other, the Yu family will benefit.

305
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:38,020
Since the ceremony is over, what are you still doing?

306
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:42,420
How about you take all the judges down?

307
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,220
Wait!

308
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,220
What?

309
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,220
Is Mr. Xie going to talk to the Yan family?

310
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,620
No.

311
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,820
The law of the State's palace is not a problem.

312
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,220
I just have a question for you.

313
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,220
I have a question for you.

314
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,620
The army of the Tongzhou State is changing.

315
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,820
We can go outside the city.

316
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,020
Have you ever been in a daze?

317
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,820
Why are you still not informed?

318
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,020
Yes.

319
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,220
Why is there no news about such a big chaos?

320
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,220
Is it because of the chaos in the bloodline?

321
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,620
The new five guards are in search of Yan family's movements.

322
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,620
I have already arranged for the people in Tongzhou.

323
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,420
The military movement in Tongzhou is going to start.

324
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,420
I received the message that

325
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,620
I am coming to the palace immediately.

326
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,820
Mr. Xie, you are questioning me?

327
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,420
If you can't stop the Yan family's conspiracy to cause a big chaos,

328
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,820
can you bear the burden?

329
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,820
You are lying!

330
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,020
The Yan family is coming to the military to make the people suffer.

331
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,420
It's impossible to do such a thing.

332
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,220
I have never done it.

333
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,820
I will take the new five guards back to the prison and make them pay.

334
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,020
If anyone is stopped, it's against the court.

335
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,220
I will see who dares to stop me!

336
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,020
I am Zhang Zhe from the Ministry of Justice.

337
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,420
I am sure that the State of State knows my great power.

338
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,820
I know it.

339
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,220
What do you mean?

340
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,620
The law of the state should be known.

341
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,220
When the imperial decree was issued,

342
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,220
the people who didn't receive the decree were to declare the imperial decree.

343
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,020
How come the State of State doesn't declare the decree and start to take people?

344
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,220
What kind of a thing is that?

345
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,620
It's not a place to be called a thing.

346
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,020
How dare you call me a father?

347
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,420
You are so wrong.

348
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,820
You are a handsome man.

349
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,820
You are a member of the State of State's Imperial Guards.

350
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,220
You are also a great leader.

351
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,820
You are a loyal person.

352
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,220
What do you think?

353
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:42,020
Jiang Xuning, why are you everywhere?

354
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,420
You are right.

355
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,220
If a concubine doesn't have enough power,

356
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,620
I should be enough.

357
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,420
Please declare the imperial decree.

358
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,620
Father, under the auspicious time,

359
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,020
why is there only one way to declare the imperial decree?

360
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,420
The imperial decree is here.

361
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,420
The emperor has made an appointment with the emperor.

362
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,420
The army is to be divided into two groups.

363
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,820
The capital is to be divided into two groups.

364
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,620
The capital is to be divided into two groups.

365
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,820
The imperial decree is to collude with the imperial party

366
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,820
and try to instigate the imperial court to make a foundation.

367
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,820
It's not easy to accept.

368
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,220
The imperial decree is to appoint the imperial court's official Xue Yuan

369
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,020
to immediately appoint the new imperial guard,

370
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:37,020
Chao Mo Yong Yi, to take the position of the son of Yan.

371
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,820
The imperial decree is to be issued.

372
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,620
How is it?

373
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,020
Do you all understand?

374
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,620
Duke, there is only one problem.

375
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:00,420
Zhang Zhe, are you questioning my decree?

376
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,620
Duke said that the news about the army was spread by Fei Ge.

377
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,220
The capital is far away from the capital.

378
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,620
It's also necessary for Fei Ge to be in two hours.

379
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,420
The army is to move to the capital and to the city.

380
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,820
That is to say, the time Duke said the news

381
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,620
is roughly one hour.

382
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,820
Then what?

383
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,220
The imperial decree is to appoint the imperial court's official Xue Yuan

384
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,420
to immediately appoint the new imperial guard, Chao Mo Yong Yi, to take the position of the son of Yan.

385
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,420
That is to say, Duke, you will bring the news to His Majesty.

386
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:31,620
After the imperial decree is issued, you will immediately come here.

387
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,020
Am I right?

388
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,020
I have no time to talk to you about these things.

389
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,620
Duke, you don't have to worry.

390
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,820
I will finish my words with Lord Zhang.

391
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,020
The crime of the imperial family is to be executed.

392
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:47,420
The crime of the imperial family is to be executed.

393
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:51,420
The imperial decree is to be executed.

394
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:56,420
Today, the Ministry of Justice has a official who is in charge of the imperial decree.

395
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,420
The official Fang Zhi Qi is a member of the imperial family.

396
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:05,620
Duke, do you have any reason to hold the imperial decree?

397
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,020
Why don't you open it up and give it to everyone?

398
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,420
The imperial decree is to be executed.

399
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:16,420
Duke, you are the one who is in charge of the imperial family.

400
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,420
Duke, you are the imperial guard of the Yan family.

401
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,420
You have been trying to stop me from doing anything.

402
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:27,020
I suspect that you have already surrendered to the Yan family

403
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,820
and have surrendered to the King of Ping Nan.

404
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,420
In order to protect your Tang Tang.

405
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:35,420
If you don't let it go, I will take your portrait and use it as a weapon.

406
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,420
You are a traitor.

407
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,220
I am not a traitor.

408
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,420
I ask the Imperial Court to investigate the case and ask for the imperial decree.

409
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,020
I will do my best to punish you.

410
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,020
But at this moment, I cannot let you do it.

411
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,620
Even if you kill me,

412
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,020
you will still not be able to do it.

413
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,420
Good. Good. You Zhang Zhe.

414
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,620
I am doing this for the Emperor and the world.

415
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,220
I am willing to be a horse-head.

416
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,020
I will kill you today.

417
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,220
I will see who can stop you.

418
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,620
Yan Mu is looking for death.

419
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:45,220
Twenty years ago, I was not able to protect the person I wanted to protect.

420
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,820
Today, I am able to do it.

421
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:51,820
You Xue Yuan have already lost your moral and human nature.

422
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,420
I am the leader of the Yi family of the Marquis of Yong Yi's Mansion.

423
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,820
I am here.

424
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,820
You cannot move any of the soldiers today.

425
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,820
In the past, the King of Ping Nan and the Yi family of the King of Ping Nan

426
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,020
were both deeply hurt by you and me.

427
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,820
But now, you are in the Yan family.

428
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,620
Yet you colluded with the Yi family and tried to rebel.

429
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,420
I cannot let you do this.

430
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,620
You are a group of Xue family.

431
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:18,220
Don't dare to say that you are deeply hurt by the King of Ping Nan.

432
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,220
You are watching from the sky.

433
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,420
The crime you committed will end up in the world.

434
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:27,220
I will watch you and the Xia Chang of Xue family.

435
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:30,020
It's a pity that you don't have this chance.

436
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:39,620
No, in the own name, do not be a excited person.

437
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,820
This time, do not put yourself in a position to act before me.

438
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,820
It's unnecessary to be Shooting.

439
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,820
I think you three such things are both Place Master and Younglaughter today.

440
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,620
You servant Cheng multiples you and Jiang Yan.

441
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,820
Accept this punishment.

442
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,940
Once they're here,

443
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,620
Yan'er shouldただ

444
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,860
or finance its twice the amount of those!

445
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,320
Prince, according to state orders from the officials,

446
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,020
the officials are being implies.

447
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,600
This is a serious matter beyond readable Imagine if Han Ling Lord

448
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,600
who are here mentioned should come with the permit and

449
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,320
cover up a few benefactors?

450
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,000
They don't need to have to fight and kill,

451
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,720
they only need to fire the Donald Nor々

452
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,100
not supporting them,

453
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,100
Lord Xie, you are welcome.

454
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,100
I'm just representing the Ministry of Justice.

455
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,100
I came here with Lord Zhang to eat and drink.

456
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,100
How did it get to do with the Nidang?

457
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,700
Lord Yan is a good man.

458
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,700
But he is forced to take the sword and surrender.

459
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,900
I came with you two

460
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,100
but I didn't make it into Nidang.

461
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,700
Why did you become a criminal

462
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,700
who is a member of the Nidang?

463
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,700
It's not reasonable to be a good man.

464
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,900
Yes.

465
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,300
I'm also here to attend the Nidang ceremony.

466
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,700
I'm also good with the Nidang family.

467
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,300
Could it be that I also became a Nidang in the State?

468
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,700
The State is a good man.

469
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,900
He is a good man.

470
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,900
How can he be a criminal who is a good man?

471
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,500
Lord Xie is here to persuade the State

472
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,500
not to be a fake.

473
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,500
But to prevent the Emperor and the State

474
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,500
from making a mistake.

475
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,400
Lord An.

476
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,760
You are not an officer anymore?

477
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,800
You have lost your job.

478
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:39,800
And why don't you Kingdom Infrastructure be the responsibility of your people?

479
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,100
Zhu Yan, I understand that you know about it.

480
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,100
There is no difference in your words than how much

481
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,100
you have committed before.

482
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,500
Now that we have the inside of the onlaral palace,

483
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,340
what are the conditions for setting up the veranda here?

484
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,020
The Shadow King None of his subordinates한다,

485
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,620
before I return next time,

486
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,540
you must eliminate any member of the Envoy's side,

487
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,020
before I leave!

488
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:06,460
Yes!

489
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,020
Your Grace is lovely.

490
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:19,660
Not references to any extent.

491
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,820
The Scholars'พidgeies need us somewhere,

492
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,420
need to live up to Yan family's charges,

493
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,900
but it is not easy to masseur us.

494
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,060
My Lord,

495
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,460
we have a big trouble today.

496
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,780
You must be tired.

497
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,060
You should go back to rest.

498
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,660
The real wind and rain

499
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,540
are still in the air.

500
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,820
Today, we have some unexpected troubles.

501
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,900
Sorry for disturbing you.

502
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,220
But don't worry.

503
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,340
We will never

504
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,700
get involved in the Yan family.

505
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,820
We can't go out now.

506
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,780
Please rest for a while.

507
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,540
We'll use some tea and wine.

508
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,940
Please rest assured.

509
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:59,260
赶上我们我们凤险的礼届案。

510
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,620
We must survivelight

511
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,140
before event happens.

512
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,220
يلin,

513
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,740
don't tell me

514
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,020
that there may be

515
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,540
some trouble in your family?

516
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,340
I know.

517
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,700
You sail the bastard

518
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,820
to keep m gern the p TER.

519
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,380
My Lord,

520
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,860
you know our problem then.

521
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:29,020
You are so strong that you did nothing!

522
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,780
So powerful!

523
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,700
I'll send Xizang there in that legendary hour!

524
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:40,420
It's all going to be an extra room for the judgement!

525
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,060
Not all I can do is revenge!

526
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,380
I knew nothing of it.

527
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,340
Let's start from here.

528
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,620
Follow my word...

529
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,980
Right now,

530
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,820
I've already done it.

531
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,820
It's a counter-election.

532
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,020
I'll cover the camp and come back.

533
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,420
And check them out.

534
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,020
I'm afraid I can't find the evidence

535
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,540
of their family's death.

536
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,780
All right, you all go back.

537
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,220
Don't worry about the rest.

538
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,420
Director Xie.

539
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,980
Am I to blame?

540
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,740
Deputy Minister Xie,

541
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,980
No matter who is the one who set up both sides today,

542
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,420
it will be so.

543
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,620
Lord Zhang,

544
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,020
you are really a good match.

545
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,220
You are not afraid of the dark world,

546
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,820
and you are just like a city.

547
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,020
You don't need to say that.

548
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,620
I have something to ask Lord Xie.

549
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,220
Lord Xie has never been in a fight with the Party.

550
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,820
He is very trusted.

551
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,420
But today, he has been helping Yan City many times.

552
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:02,020
The word he said is more like a business.

553
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,420
I am afraid.

554
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,220
Please explain it to me.

555
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,420
Explain what?

556
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,020
The word he said is a person's word.

557
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:12,620
A person's land, a person's city, a person's youth.

558
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:18,420
The key is to be filial, filial, loyal, and pure.

559
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,820
But just now, on the慣lite,

560
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,220
Lord Shao Shi only said that he is a person's city.

561
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,820
What is the reason?

562
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,020
I am confused.

563
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,420
Have you forgotten?

564
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,420
Lord Xie has never changed his color before the chaos.

565
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,620
He is not like the chaos.

566
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:41,220
Maybe Lord Shao Shi has a different reason for the delay in Yan City.

567
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,420
Sir.

568
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,420
Lord Zhang is also here.

569
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,020
Lord Zhang is a gentleman.

570
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,020
He is a righteous man who is kind to the Great Qin.

571
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,820
I am not in the same position as him.

572
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:11,020
But thank you for today.

573
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,620
Goodbye.

574
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,020
Sir.

575
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,420
You must have a way to save the Yan family, right?

576
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,020
I know.

577
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,020
Yan Ling did do it.

578
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,420
Thank you for not being a gentleman.

579
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,020
If you are not a brother and a city master,

580
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,620
why did you leave the Yan City?

581
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,620
You must have other plans.

582
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:52,020
You believe me like this?

583
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,220
Yes.

584
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:58,020
Ling Er, I am not a good person.

585
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:02,220
I have been working with you on this journey.

586
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,420
As you said, every student is in the eyes of Yan.

587
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,820
It is not easy to say that there is a good and bad in this world.

588
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:13,020
But I know that what you want to do will definitely succeed.

589
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,220
Retreat.

590
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,220
The guards are not out yet.

591
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,220
I am sorry, sir.

592
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,220
I don't know how to break this wood.

593
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,020
Enough. Don't follow him.

594
00:33:59,020 --> 00:33:59,820
Take him away.

595
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,220
Yes.

596
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:05,220
Hence, you are two people.

597
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,220
Let's talk about you.

598
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:10,220
What is there to talk about?

599
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,220
My eyes can't look straight behind me.

600
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,220
How could I look at your target?

601
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,220
Hello?

602
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,820
Thank you.

603
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,620
It would be better to give it to you.

604
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,220
How is the teaching work?

605
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,520
Well, this one is quite rough.

606
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,920
So, what happened in Tongzhou?

607
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,640
The bloodshed is too deep.

608
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,080
Now, rescue His Lordship!

609
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:45,240
Rescue His Lordship!

610
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,520
Rescue His Lordship!

611
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,440
Stop!

612
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,440
Rescue His Lordship!

613
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,360
I've said that

614
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,280
the news in the capital is still unknown.

615
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,440
It's not ordered.

616
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,760
It's a total rebellion.

617
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,560
You're taking the whole of His Lordship

618
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,320
to cause trouble for His Lordship.

619
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,440
Don't be so bold!

620
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,440
General, we've been waiting for you for hours.

621
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,840
But now,

622
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,800
if His Lordship had not been killed,

623
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,520
wouldn't he have even got a letter?

624
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,520
First, we must be careful.

625
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,800
Second, we must be careful.

626
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,000
If we continue like this,

627
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,320
we'll be wiped out by the imperial family sooner or later.

628
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,600
We must go to the capital

629
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,840
to meet His Majesty.

630
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,760
That's right!

631
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,840
We must go to the capital!

632
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,520
We must go to the capital!

633
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,840
We must go to the capital!

634
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,120
We must go to the capital!

635
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,120
His Lordship has been here.

636
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,520
Stop!

637
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,520
Get out of here!

638
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,720
Don't make any noise!

639
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,120
Is this really His Lordship's letter?

640
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,480
Yes. Who is this person?

641
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,720
I've never seen him before.

642
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,520
That's right!

643
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,360
How could His Lordship

644
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,720
hand the letter to someone else?

645
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,720
Am I right?

646
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,240
It's true and false.

647
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,680
Please check it out, General Yan Liu.

648
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,920
Not bad.

649
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,800
It's true that the letter

650
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,720
of the Yan family is true.

651
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,800
His Lordship will never hand this letter

652
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,120
to anyone else.

653
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,920
This is really His Lordship's letter.

654
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,320
Just a moment.

655
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,800
How is His Lordship now?

656
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,600
His Lordship is safe now.

657
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,120
But the previous proposal

658
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,600
was to attack the capital.

659
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,880
We must not mess it up.

660
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,960
You all know

661
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,400
the reason for this, right?

662
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,400
Great!

663
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,160
His Lordship is safe now!

664
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,760
Safe now!

665
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,760
Are you all right?

666
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,960
I'm fine.

667
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,960
Great!

668
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,720
You mean

669
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,120
the person who made the camp

670
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,760
escape was Prince of Pingnan?

671
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,160
That's right.

672
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,560
I've thought about it before.

673
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,440
Prince of Pingnan

674
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,880
has been at a place in Tongzhou

675
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,920
and has already head to

676
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,120
the capital.

677
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:54,880
A few days ago,

678
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,840
I sent a knife to Tongzhou secretly

679
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,640
to monitor the situation of the camp.

680
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,240
The camp suddenly moved.

681
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,240
The first time the knife was sent

682
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,840
by the pilot was sent to me.

683
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,600
I immediately sent a rite

684
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
to go to Tongzhou

685
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,160
to stop the war.

686
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,440
It's time

687
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,000
to arrive now.

688
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,840
The first time is a matter of time.

689
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,120
I'll leave it to

690
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,600
Duke Ding's letter.

691
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,360
Now it's the camp again.

692
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,920
If the Yan family is in a bad mood,

693
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,560
the land of Tongzhou will be in a mess.

694
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,480
The army of Qingling

695
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,400
can enter the capital often.

696
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,120
So the Yan family is behind this.

697
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:24,920
There are so many people

698
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,520
who are making trouble.

699
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,600
Are you afraid?

700
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,840
I'm not afraid.

701
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,360
I came here

702
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,600
to change my life for Nite.

703
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,520
No matter how many people want to move the Yan family,

704
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,600
I will do everything I can.

705
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,920
Sir.

706
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,720
What's going on?

707
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,160
Why are you still in a mess?

708
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,520
Mr. Dong Yi.

709
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,120
It's you.

710
00:37:59,120 --> 00:37:59,880
It's him.

711
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,400
It's him who made the flower vase.

712
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,120
Mr. Dong Yi.

713
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,960
You are at least

714
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,520
Xie Juan's friend.

715
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,360
We don't have to do this.

716
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,840
Lv Zhao Yin.

717
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,320
You are not afraid of death

718
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,240
if Xie Wei betrays the prince?

719
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,600
You should

720
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,520
worry about yourself first.

721
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:25,160
Today, you, you, you, you, you, you, you,

722
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,800
you can't do anything.

723
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,680
Just you?

724
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,080
Just me?

725
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,720
Up there?

726
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,760
Why did you do this?

727
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,640
Dong Zhou's Shrimp

728
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,120
Dmin has been eating it for a while.

729
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,520
He almost pooped it.

730
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,200
Your Majesty,不用客气吧

731
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,280
Bi Kwia is young

732
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,600
It's important for the things you do

733
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,400
See in action

734
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,200
And eat

735
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,460
You stole the day

736
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,440
You didn't waste your youth

737
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,160
But you've spent it

738
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,620
Your master is still young

739
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,600
You have created

740
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,600
Not inferior to樣

741
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,220
Young Master

742
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:33,080
But Wandao你 and Ichiro

743
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,100
All why do we come along now?

744
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,860
Yuzhe, why don't you fight first?

745
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,820
Why don't you fight in front of New Court scolds?

746
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,980
Why won't you fight at the bottom of the loom?

747
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,500
Don't look at me like that.

748
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,280
He doesn't even know what car he wants to use.

749
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,900
I'm ask one person who will overcome the terms.

750
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,060
But there is no way I'll tell you.

751
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,040
Children's character cannot be compared to those who faceuem

752
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,280
to become Uyghurs.

753
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,440
But the blown-up former Republic of Japan

754
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,020
ordered that it Cambridge and by United Kingdom

755
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:00,000
make the somethin existence,

756
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,280
which was inspired by one person.

757
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,520
How can a person like him

758
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,520
it's broken into this greenery.

759
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,520
In the case of the law,

760
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,920
the Hanling Courtyard must be able to take the head of Chu Xi Yi.

761
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,520
But His Majesty has already taken the medicine and slept.

762
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,920
I haven't asked His Majesty to summon Chu Xi Yi to the palace to cover it.

763
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:21,120
So, I have to ask Your Highness to take the head of the palace.

764
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,520
What time is it?

765
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,320
Has the news of the military coup not been spread yet?

766
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,920
In this way, although Chu Xi Yi is not here,

767
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,920
the seal is in the palace.

768
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,520
You take the head of the family to cover the Hanling Courtyard.

769
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,520
Even if you can't cure the Yan family's misdeeds,

770
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,920
you can still use the anti-Japanism to punish them.

771
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,320
This time, you must save the Yan family's crimes.

772
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,320
I will take the lead.

773
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,320
Today, I am the whole family's official.

774
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,920
It has nothing to do with the other family.

775
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,720
Since all of you are here,

776
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:03,720
I, Yan family, will be the official of the banquet.

777
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,320
Duke Ding has not returned home yet.

778
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,520
This banquet should continue.

779
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,320
How can we eat this?

780
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,920
Why not? Yan Ling didn't make any mistakes.

781
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,120
In the big days of his life, we should celebrate the Yan family's return.

782
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,120
Your Majesty, you should cover the seal.

783
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,120
Everyone,

784
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,120
have you all seen it clearly?

785
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,320
I dare to ask the State Prefect of the State.

786
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,120
How is it that the State Prefect of the State

787
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,520
is in the military camp in Tongzhou?

788
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,920
No matter how the military camp is in Tongzhou,

789
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,520
the Yan family is against it.

790
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,720
Everyone,

791
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,720
have you all seen it clearly?

792
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,920
I, the official of the banquet, should also take the lead.

793
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,520
Take Yan Chang away.

794
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,120
The State Prefect of the State is guilty of the Yus' family.

795
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,720
How can he be so generous?

796
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,320
How can I refuse?

797
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,920
Yan Ling,

798
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,120
let's go to the palace.

799
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,520
Let's see what the State Prefect of the State of Xue can find out.

800
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,520
Yes.

801
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,720
Guards,

802
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,520
take down Yan Mu and Yan Ling.

803
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,720
Yan Ling,

804
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,320
I'm sorry.

805
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,720

I'm sorry.

821

I'm sorry.

825
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,520
I'm sorry.

826
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,120
I'm sorry.

827
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,520
I'm sorry.

828
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,720
I'm sorry.

829
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,120
I'm sorry.

830
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,520
I'm sorry.

831
