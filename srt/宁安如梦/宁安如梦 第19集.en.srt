they died a few days ago.

They then immediately reported it to the government.

But, they didn't discover

including the faces of their accomplices.

60
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,430

On the surface, it looks like they killed each other

because the loot was not distributed equally.

00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,830
Mr. Zhang hasn't been on the case for long,

115
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,310
You're right.

What we got this time

121
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,530
was just the location of the strongholds near the capital.

122
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,030
If we had managed to capture Gongyi Cheng alive,

123
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:09,060
I am sure we would have found out more about the whereabouts of the rebels.

124
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,400
It would be good if

125
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,090
we could capture him alive.

126
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,880
But now that he's dead,

127
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,090
he might still

128
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,470
come in handy.

129
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,200
What are you thinking of, Mr. Xie?

130
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,990
When you hadn't mentioned it just now,

131
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,650
I didn't give it much thought.

132
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,400
But now that you have mentioned it,

133
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,900
I have an idea.

134
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,180
It's just a little risky.

135
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:34,900
What is it?

136
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,310
So far, Gongyi Cheng's death

137
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:40,190
is only known to the court and the government.

138
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,030
If we pretend that Gongyi Cheng

139
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,270
is not dead,

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,430
but he was just caught by the government

141
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,560
and is currently being interrogated,

142
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,290
they will definitely send someone to rescue him,

143
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,900
because they are afraid of secrets being leaked.

144
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,250
By then, we just need to ambush

145
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,820
and catch them all.

146
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,600
Or...

147
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,730
we could be even riskier.

148
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,870
So what's the riskier plan?

149
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,040
Mr. Gu,

150
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,810
have you previously heard of the name Dujun, the Hermit?

151
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,460
Are you talking about

152
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,740
the top strategist of Lord Pingnan?

153
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:14,630
Yes.

154
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,710
Previously, when we managed to capture some of these rebels,

155
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,120
they all mentioned Dujun, the Hermit,

156
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,030
after several rounds of interrogation.

157
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,550
They all said that he’s mysterious

158
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,680
and rarely appears.

159
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,230
Other than Lord Pingnan and his trusted subordinates,

160
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,960
the rest of the rebels have never seen him before.

161
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,150
So, I am thinking,

162
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,010
what if we send someone

163
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,190
to pretend to be Dujun, the Hermit in prison,

164
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,510
and wait for the rebels to come and rescue Gongyi Cheng,

165
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,060
then leave the capital with them?

166
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,320
Wouldn't that allow us

167
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,930
to find more strongholds?

168
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,000
That’s a great idea, Official Xue.

169
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,140
It's bizarre and crafty,

170
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,810
and it leaves the rebels nowhere to hide.

171
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,130
But it is extremely dangerous for the impersonator,

172
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,430
who will be infiltrating deep into the enemy's camp.

173
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,710
He will need to be observant of people,

174
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,770
and be able to control the situation.

175
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,250
It's not a simple task.

176
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,590
If we are talking about wisdom and wits,

177
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,700
only Junior Preceptor Xie can take up this position.

178
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,620
He would be the first person I recommend.

179
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,060
But Junior Preceptor Xie is famous and prominent,

180
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,520
and his name is well-known in and out of the court.

181
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,300
If you want to be the impersonator,

182
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,000
it would take a lot of effort and might arouse suspicion.

183
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,840
I do have a candidate in mind.

184
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,060
He studied the files of rebels

185
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,010
and knows a lot about them.

186
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,730
Perhaps, he may be of service.

187
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,490
Who are you referring to?

188
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,200
It's Zhang Zhe.

189
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:28,910
I...

190
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,330
accept this position.

191
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:43,760
Today,

192
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,650
he suddenly proposed that you

193
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,450
pretend to be Dujun, the Hermit.

194
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,840
I didn’t discuss with you beforehand.

195
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,890
Do you mind?

196
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,310
No one could have predicted what Junior Preceptor Xie

197
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,570
would have said today.

198
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,110
Naturally, we can't discuss it beforehand.

199
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,960
We could only respond flexibly.

200
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,670
It would be great if we could use this opportunity

201
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,870
to find out the truth.

202
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,720
I don't mind it at all.

203
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,220
I'm just wondering

204
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,320
why he proposed such a plan.

205
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,790
Initially according to your plan,

206
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,600
we will make use Ministry of Justice

207
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,070
to hide the death of Gongyi Cheng,

208
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,150
and then we will follow

209
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,390
the people sent by Lord Pingnan

210
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,020
and follow them to their strongholds in Tongzhou.

211
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,270
In this way, we can get rid of Lord Pingnan's people,

212
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,670
while claiming a share of credit

213
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,770
in the court.

214
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,270
Then we'll take Marquis of Yan's letter

215
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,610
to convince the people at Tongzhou camps.

216
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,250
But now,

217
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,110
Zhang Zhe is plugged right in the middle of such a mess.

218
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,910
I'm afraid things will go wrong.

219
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,920
Junior Preceptor Xie

220
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,990
might look indifferent,

221
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,890
but he has his own motivations

222
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,600
and is quite shrewd.

223
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,040
I can't tell

224
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,790
what he's thinking either.

225
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,590
It's just that this time,

226
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,580
I will need to trouble you.

227
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,270
It's within my duties.

228
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,530
It's no trouble at all.

229
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,790
You're too kind, Sir.

230
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,510
It's a blessing to the Ministry of Justice

231
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,450
and the imperial court to have you, Zhang Zhe.

232
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,320
How about

233
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,390
we take advantage of the chaos and kill him?

234
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,770
No.

235
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,220
Why?

236
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,510
If you continue to let this man go on,

237
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,630
he'll be a threat

238
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,190
with endless troubles.

239
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,880
This was all my idea.

240
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:19,830
In future, Shen Lang will let me control the whole situation.

241
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,950
Besides, Zhang Zhe is an official in the imperial court.

242
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,430
If I don't uncover anything and lose a life in the midst,

243
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,030
I'm afraid

244
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,630
I'll only be held accountable and attract criticism.

245
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,130
Let's wait for a while.

246
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,110
Let's see what he can find

247
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,170
after he infiltrates the enemy camp.

248
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,830
That's not right.

249
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,150
You're letting a variable go unaddressed.

250

Why are you always so violent

341
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,830
every time we meet?

342
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,190
No?

343
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:30,990
It hurts our relationship.

344
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:31,590
Come here.

345
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,430
But,

346
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,770
for an official like you

347
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,220
to come to such a messy place,

348
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,020
wouldn't it be

349
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,430
inappropriate?

350
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,600
Why did you come to the capital?

351
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,160
I didn't want to come here.

352
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,490
It's Lord Pingnan.

353
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,230
It's been a long time since you've made any progress.

354
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,360
He was afraid you had betrayed him.

355
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,860
He asked me to come to the capital to check on you.

356
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,350
He said that if you had indeed betrayed him,

357
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,250
he wanted me to expose your identity

358
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:02,990
in public.

359
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,520
I told you before that

360
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,960
there will be only one Xue Dingfei.

361
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,600
If my identity is exposed,

362
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,090
how long do you think you can live?

363
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,510
That's absolutely right.

364
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,080
I'm your substitute.

365
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,580
Of course I'm on your side.

366
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,140
Lord Pingnan is now old.

367
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,330
He's not in his right mind,

368
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,660
and he is in poor health.

369
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,440
I'm counting on you

370
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,780
for the rest of my life.

371
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,630
Don't talk nonsense with me.

372
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,990
If Lord Pingnan wants to expose me,

373
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,830
he just has to write a letter to the imperial court.

374
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,140
He didn't need to send you all the way out here to find me.

375
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,810
Of course I'm useless.

376
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:34,760
However,

377
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,870
what Lord Pingnan is most worried about now,

378
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,650
is still

379
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,280
the fortress of Tongzhou.

380
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,000
By the way,

381
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,670
Lord Pingnan gave me this half of a letter.

382
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,460
He said

383
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:43,930
kill Yan Mu.

384
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,390
Where is the letter?

385
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,560
I lost it.

386
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,050
Jian Shu?

387
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,970
Don't, please don't!

388
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,000
Miss Jiang.

389
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,070
Cut to the chase.

390
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,160
You came to see me this late.

391
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,960
Did something happen to Yan Lin?

392
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,840
Yes.

393
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,470
When I was on duty tonight,

394
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,330
I found someone

395
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,020
sneaking around in front of the doors of Xingwu Guards.

396
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,150
So I took him away.

397
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,520
Then I found out that

398
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,870
he's part of the rebels of Lord Pingnan,

399
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,800
and a subordinate of Gongyi Cheng.

400
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,820
Gongyi Cheng?

401
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,270
Isn't he...

402
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,430
If he's a rebel,

403
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,390
you should take him back to Xingwu Guards for them to deal with him.

404
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,270
Why are you looking for me?

405
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,810
Yes, I should have.

406
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:36,840
But when I asked,

407
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,590
he told me

408
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,920
he has the second half of the letter

409
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,310
that proves the collusion between the Yan family and Lord Pingnan.

410
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,140
Have you got the letter?

411
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:45,820
No.

412
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,720
He's just here to gather information.

413
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,650
He didn't bring anything with him.

414
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,280
Where is he?

415
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,360
Take me to see him.

416
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,070
What took you so long, Sir?

417
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,560
That gangster made a lot of noise.

418
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,860
I'm afraid it would be bad

419
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,120
if someone overheard.

420
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,660
Greetings, Miss.

421
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,400
Missy,

422
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:05,510
you have no business here.

423
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,230
Go back first.

424
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:06,599
Okay.

425
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:10,030
You shall be the one to interrogate him.

426
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,520
Find out the whereabouts of the letter,

427
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,480
and their plans.

428
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:13,660
Okay.

429
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:23,460
I've told you everything I know.

430
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,680
I don't have the letter.

431
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,880
What else do you want?

432
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,700
Although you guys have been working separately in the capital,

433
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,700
you guys must still keep in contact.

434
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:30,930
Two things.

435
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,490
First,

436
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:34,930
where are your accomplices?

437
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:35,830
Second,

438
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,770
where is the letter?

439
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,350
Let's get this straight,

440
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,750
and I will keep you alive.

441
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,460
It's hard to explain.

442
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,300
Xingwu Guards have plenty of ways to make you talk.

443
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,200
I'm just a nobody.

444
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,840
I don't know anything else.

445
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,670
They only asked me to go to the Xingwu Guards government office and gather information,

446
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:52,200
and then,

447
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,120
I was to pass on the information

448
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,460
to Baiguo Temple.

449
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,460
I really don't know anything else.

450
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,400
If they had only assigned the task of gathering information to you,

451
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
there is no need to mention the letter to you.

452
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,470
Even up to this point,

453
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,670
you still want to lie?

454
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,280
Aren't you afraid of death?

455
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,470
Tell me the truth!

456
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,990
Please spare my life, Sir!

457
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,590
I'll tell you, I'll tell you.

458
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,950
It's really not my fault.

459
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,470
Lord Pingnan doesn't trust you

460
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,600
nor Gongyi Cheng.

461
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,430
They only gave the first half of the letter to Gongyi Cheng.

462
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,750
It's because things haven't progressed for a long time

463
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,290
that they pushed me out here.

464
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,870
I know you want to protect the Yan family,

465
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,790
so I didn't even dare to take the letter.

466
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,430
And then?

467
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:27,420
Then,

468
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,230
I gave this letter

469
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,300
to someone else.

470
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,250
I...

471
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,590
I was just thinking that if I don't have it, I won't have to worry about it.

472
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,850
Even if something goes wrong,

473
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,380
it wouldn't be my fault.

474
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,100
But I didn't expect

475
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,580
the person who took the letter was Gongyi Cheng's subordinate.

476
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,220
He wouldn't listen to me at all.

477
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,230
He probably wants to take that letter

478
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,030
and claim credit from Gongyi Cheng.

479
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:47,970
That's why

480
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,470
I ran away halfway through.

481
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,200
You're a smart one, aren't you?

482
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,120
But do you want to know

483
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,830
how many times you will die,

484
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,110
if Lord Pingnan finds out about this?

485
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,700
Sir,

486
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,160
I was so scared these days.

487
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,040
I didn't even dare to mention a single word of what happened to Huang Qian.

488
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,610
Sir,

489
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,410
I beg you to save me.

490
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,240
I'll do anything

491
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,690
to save my life.

492
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,000
My brothers and I

493
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,160
came to the capital to find Mr. Gongyi,

494
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:18,440
and to give the letter from the Yan family to Duke Xue.

495
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,270
But after entering the capital,

496
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,120
I couldn't contact Mr. Gongyi.

497
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,870
Hence, we couldn't pass the letter to Duke Xue.

498
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,780
We are not familiar with the place here.

499
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,950
We were worried that we will cause trouble

500
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,280
if we acted rashly,

501
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,690
so we split up.

502
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,390
Therefore, it was my responsibility

503
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,120
to find out more about Duke Xue,

504
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,940
and then look for a suitable opportunity

505
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,570
to hand the letter over.

506
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,940
If what you said is true,

507
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,850
the letter should still be in your brothers' hands.

508
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,120
As long as you tell them

509
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,590
you've found out Duke Xue's whereabouts,

510
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,020
they will pass the letter to you,

511
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,760
is that right?

512
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,350
This...

513
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,430
Miss is asking you.

514
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,330
Is that true?

515
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,820
Yes.

516
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,090
That's easy.

517
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,120
Mr. Zhou,

518
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,980
just do as I said.

519
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,150
Get him to write a letter

520
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,680
and send it to Baiguo Temple tonight.

521
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,980
Be careful not to alert them.

522
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,330
No.

523
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,110
No, no you can't.

524
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,510
If the higher-ups find out,

525
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,250
my life will be in danger.

526
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:06,770
Miss,

527
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,020
how about

528
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,290
you step aside for a while?

529
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:24,950
Miss,

530
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,970
please have a look.

531
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,580
[I have found out Duke Xue's whereabouts. Proceed as planned.]

532
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,200
Be very careful.

533
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,430
If anything happens,

534
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,230
come to Jiang Mansion to find me.

535
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:40,300
Mr. Zhou,

536
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,260
I don't care about all the news you previously reported to the Duke of Xue

537
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,720
regarding the Yan family,

538
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,780
whether they were important or not.

539
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,760
But you must not

540
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,110
report about this letter.

541
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,150
I understand.

542
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,420
Mr. Zhou,

543
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,390
exactly who are we arresting?

544
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,190
We've been waiting for two days.

545
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,220
Is this some kind of big case?

546
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,510
Don't ask questions you shouldn't.

547
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,340
It's all arranged by the higher-ups.

548
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,540
If this is leaked,

549
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,010
we will all suffer.

550
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,030
[To Lord Pingnan]

551
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:05,580
Mr. Zhou,

552
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,530
what should we do with him?

553
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,640
Find a remote place

554
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,160
and kill him.

555
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,520
Why are you so happy?

556
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,740
My life is cheap.

557
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,620
I am not worthy of your anger.

558
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,210
But the one you took

559
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,430
was just a piece of blank paper.

560
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:21,730
If I die today,

561
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,540
you will never get to see

562
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,110
what I'm holding.

563
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,600
How did they figure it out?

564
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,180
It was the letter written by the rebel.

565
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,630
That letter didn't bear their emblem.

566
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,560
The person with the letter knew it was a trap.

567
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:43,830
These people

568
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,150
have been in the capital for a long time,

569
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:47,260
but still couldn't get in touch with Gongyi Cheng.

570
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,330
Hence, they are thinking of making a fortune.

571
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,360
How much do they want?

572
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,470
50,000 taels of silver.

573
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,460
They want it in banknotes.

574
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,250
Three days later,

575
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,090
we will exchange the money for the letter.

576
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,090
If we don't buy it,

577
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:59,260
are they planning to take advantage of the Duke of Xue?

578
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,590
These rebels

579
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,250
are really too much.

580
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,640
It's my fault.

581
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,800
I didn't see through these gangsters' schemes earlier.

582
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,640
But now,

583
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:09,630
it's not easy for us to get things done

584
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,490
when we are led around by the nose.

585
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:20,830
Tang,

586
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,640
take this Jiao'an.

587
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,320
and sell it at Youhuang Store.

588
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,930
Are you going to sell the qin too?

589
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:28,190
Aren't you going to keep it as a souvenir?

590
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,010
We'll see what happens after this.

591
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,140
For now, let's get through this first.

592
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,190
Remember,

593
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,210
no matter what,

594
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,340
you must sell this qin at Youhuang Store.

595
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,400
Do you understand?

596
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,440
Is it the news of the letter

597
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,550
from Xue Dingfei?

598
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,030
There's no sign of the letter.

599
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,070
However,

600
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,920
I got a qin.

601
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,820
What happened?

602
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,250
A maid from the Jiang family

603
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,140
came to sell it.

604
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,340
I think

605
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,210
you scared her too badly.

606
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,540
She doesn't want to learn the qin from you anymore.

607
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,940
Yan Lin gave her this qin.

608
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,760
Even if she was upset,

609
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,700
she wouldn't sell it at will.

610
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,180
Something must have happened.

611
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,200
Aren't you the one who knows

612
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,460
all the news about her?

613
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,060
What?

614
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,580
After that night,

615
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,710
she wouldn't tell you anything.

616
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,410
You've always been a wise man.

617
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,910
How are you being led around

618
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,440
by a little girl these days?

619
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:31,290
Okay.

620
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,430
I'll stop talking.

621
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,900
You know You Fangyin well.

622
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,900
Go and ask around.

623
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,870
If she really needs money urgently,

624
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,090
she will definitely use money from the account belonging to the salt well.

625
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,350
Junior Preceptor Xie,

626
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,260
are you asking me for a favor?

627
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,550
If you don't want to,

628
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,490
the money for the other few qins...

629
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:49,490
Yes, I am willing.

630
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,520
Between the both of us,

631
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,220
can I even reject you?

632
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,160
I am off.

633
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,600
No, you can't.

634
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:10,760
Miss Jiang said

635
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,840
this is our ledger.

636
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,870
Outsiders must not take a look at it.

637
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,970
That's not very nice of you to say.

638
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,980
Who taught you to do business?

639
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,350
Who helped you monitor the salt well

640
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,450
on Ren Weizhi's side?

641
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,910
Now, I'm the outsider?

642
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,300
Show me the ledger.

643
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,050
Ledger-

644
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,050
Other than Miss Jiang,

645
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,500
everyone else is an outsider.

646
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,180
Mr. Lyu,

647
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,700
I'm very grateful to you.

648
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,630
But I was entrusted with this task.

649
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,500
If I let you see the ledger today,

650
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,220
what should I do if

651
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,020
someone asks me to do something against you

652
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,030
in the future?

653
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,070
I just said one sentence,

654
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,830
and you talked back to me with eight lines.

655
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,880
And you said you were stupid.

656
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,460
I think

657
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,120
you are the smartest.

658
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,100
You...

659
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,690
Let me tell you the truth.

660
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,380
Jiang Mansion

661
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:59,480
has taken out a lot of things and sold it at a low price.

662
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,150
Even the qin that Yan Lin gave her

663
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,170
was being sold.

664
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,960
I’m afraid

665
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,750
Miss Jiang

666
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,510
is really in trouble this time,

667
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,970
yet find it hard to talk to us about it.

668
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,110
I know

669
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,520
you really care about her,

670
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,440
but isn't it the same for Xie Wei and I?

671
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,690
How about this?

672
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,690
I don't have to see the ledger,

673
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,900
but you must tell me

674
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,040
what happened to her.

675
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,090
Father,

676
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:28,940
is there any news

677
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,210
regarding the favor I asked you a few days ago?

678
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,610
Those few boxes of things

679
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,110
are valuable enough.

680
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,720
But because we were in a hurry to cash it,

681
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,900
it's inevitable that others take the opportunity to undercut us.

682
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,700
Fortunately,

683
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,160
we managed to gather 25,000 taels.

684
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,160
It's all here.

685
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,140
You managed to gather so much?

686
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,550
It goes without saying how well Yan Lin

687
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,030
has been treating you

688
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,110
all these years.

689
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,540
If it wasn't for fate playing games,

690
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,670
you two would have been married by now.

691
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,420
I have only

692
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,080
seen Yan Lin as a friend.

693
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,000
I just hope this money

694
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,780
can really help him.

695
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,730
Early this morning, Miss Jiang went to the prison.

696
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,590
She took 20,000 taels of silver

697
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,320
from the salt well ledger that was with Fang Youyin.

698
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,270
I heard that she looked very cold.

699
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:27,370
Not only that,

700
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,560
I also

701
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:31,090
heard from some friends at the calligraphy and antique stores that

702
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:33,780
the Jiang family has cashed out

703
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:37,460
almost 20,000 to 30,000 taels worth of items in recent days.

704
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,820
She urgently needed money.

705
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,060
She even sold the qin.

706
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:44,820
Sir,

707
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,270
stop wasting your time and energy

708
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:47,950
on others,

709
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:48,480
will you?

710
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,020
Just one Xue Dingfei,

711
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,310
and the imperial court's plan to eliminate the bandits,

712
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,770
is enough trouble for you.

713
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,350
Miss Jiang won't accept your help either.

714
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,350
Why do you bother?

715
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:01,630
Sir.

716
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:02,800
How is it?

717
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,960
We still haven't found the person who stole the letter.

718
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,890
I was referring to the other issue.

719
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,700
Miss Jiang and Zhou Yinzhi have been meeting frequently these days.

720
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,610
It's as if they are talking about something in secret.

721
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:13,720
Dao Qin, Jian Shu,

722
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,180
you two keep an eye on Jiang Mansion and Zhou Yinzhi,

723
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,580
especially Zhou Yinzhi.

724
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,190
If Ning'er wants to do something,

725
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,990
it will definitely be through his hands.

726
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,440
-Yes.
-Yes.

727
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,160
Here's 50,000 taels of silver banknotes.

728
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,890
When you make payment tonight,

729
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,470
keep a low profile.

730
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,870
Now that the Yan family has been exiled,

731
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,130
if this gets out of hand,

732
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,150
there might be a retrial

733
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,620
in order to sentence them to death.

734
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,220
Secondly,

735
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,610
after you get the letter,

736
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,070
you must check carefully.

737
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,850
If the letter that they handed over was sealed with inscription rubbings,

738
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:46,980
arrest them immediately,

739
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:47,910
and report to me.

740
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,780
Remember,

741
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,730
no one else must know of

742
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,230
the content in the letter.

743
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,640
Yes, I know that.

744
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,430
These

745
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,450
are for you and your brothers.

746
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,100
I know it's not easy for you.

747
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,330
I have to trouble you

748
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,670
for such an important matter today.

749
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,470
Thank you Miss Jiang in advance.

750
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:09,030
After this is done tonight,

751
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,130
are we still keeping an eye on

752
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,150
those gangsters?

753
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,390
Just do what I have asked you to do.

754
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:14,210
I'll take care

755
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,030
of the rest.

756
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:16,750
Okay.

757
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,280
Here.

758
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,610
Check it.

759
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,050
Mr. Zhou,

760
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,030
are you just going to let them take the money and leave?

761
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,160
Cut the crap.

762
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,590
We need to go back and report.

763
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,660
Not that I want to mention,

764
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,490
but people in the capital are  indeed rich.

765
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:57,130
They can take

766
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,190
50,000 taels out so easily.

767
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:58,920
Isn't that great?

768
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,830
Let's go down the hill and drink.

769
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,360
Let's go.

770
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,250
Brother!

771
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,900
Save me!

772
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,860
Who are you?

773
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,160
What do you want?

774
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,150
My master has something to ask you all.

775
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,660
Come with me.

776
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:19,470
Sir,

777
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,680
I've interrogated them in detail.

778
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,680
These people are really something.

779
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,870
They are the ones

780
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,030
who stole Viscount Dingfei's letter.

781
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,570
What about the letter?

782
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,260
We've searched everywhere.

783
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:31,820
There was no letter.

784
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,070
Instead, we found these silver banknotes.

785
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,410
The leader of the rebels said

786
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:38,300
the letter was handed over to an officer from Xingwu Guards.

787
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,560
It must be Zhou Yinzhi.

788
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,750
These silver banknotes were from the other party to buy the letter.

789
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,280
All of this makes sense now.

790
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,370
The thing we couldn't find

791
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,280
happened to end up in her hands.

792
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,120
She did everything she could

793
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:52,930
to buy this letter through Zhou Yinzhi's hands.

794
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,620
But she's still young and gullible.

795
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,620
She doesn't know how evil people can be.

796
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,310
If it weren't for you this time,

797
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,310
I wonder what else

798
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:01,790
those rebels would do.

799
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,140
What a great plan, Ning'er.

800
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,090
What are you laughing at?

801
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:36,950
Take a look.

802
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,290
What is this?

803
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,110
And you still say Ning'er doesn't know how evil people are.

804
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:46,850
I think

805
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,160
she has already considered you and I as part of her plans.

806
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,490
She eliminated a menace

807
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:51,630
through our hands.

808
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,850
What do you mean?

809
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,860
First, she purposely took Jiao'an

810
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,300
and sold it at Youhuang Store,

811
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,680
so as to make us suspect that something really happened to her.

812
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,810
If she hadn't instructed You Fangyin,

813
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,690
and with You Fangyin's loyal personality,

814
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:07,400
did you really think you could have gotten an answer?

815
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,200
Also, if you consider Zhou Yinzhi's whereabouts,

816
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,260
the actions of Dao Qin and Jian Shu...

817
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:12,740
I'm afraid

818
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,520
all of these events

819
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,740
were part of her plan.

820
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:18,910
Not to mention,

821
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,750
how are we going to gather

822
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,390
50,000 taels of silver banknotes in such a short time?

823
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,590
Who knows if these gangsters

824
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,750
will use the same letter and sell it to someone else after this?

825
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,270
So,

826
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,350
we must not let them leave the capital.

827
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,560
We must eliminate the problem at the root.

828
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,780
I've already chosen my most trusted brothers

829
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,920
in Xingwu Guards.

830
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,920
But if we want to get rid of them completely,

831
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,510
I'm sure it's going to be a tough fight.

832
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,630
If we make a big fuss,

833
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,550
news will spread to the Duke and-

834
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,020
There's still some money leftover from when

835
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,870
we extorted the You family previously.

836
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:47,090
Take that money and give it to this man first,

837
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:47,890
and let him go.

838
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,790
Tell him

839
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,540
I will raise the rest of the money for him

840
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,130
within the next three days.

841
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,940
As for eliminating the problem...

842
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,070
I have an idea.

843
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,190
Maybe, we can get someone else

844
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,570
to do it for us.

845
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,240
Wait,

846
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,870
she's just a daughter of a noble family.

847
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,570
How can she be so smart?

848
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:07,420
Whether she's smart or not,

849
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,390
we will find out tomorrow once we ask.

850
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:10,920
Jian Shu?

851
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:14,070
Go to Jiang Mansion tomorrow morning

852
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,260
and ask her to come and learn the qin.

853
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,310
Yes.

854
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,450
Also,

855
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,310
take care of Gongyi Cheng's men as soon as possible.

856
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,200
The plan for Tongzhou is imminent.

857
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,250
The most important thing

858
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,390
is to let the Yan family leave the capital safely.

859
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,520
When the time comes,

860
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:30,260
even if they have the means to do so,

861
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,060
they won't be able to stir up  any trouble.

862
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:37,800
[To Lord Pingnan]

863
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,250
What did Mr. Zhou send you

864
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,350
that could get you all worked up?

865
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,840
It's a letter that everyone wants.

866
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,720
All right, you can step down now.

867
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,960
We have to leave tomorrow morning.

868
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,410
Yes.

869
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,660
You are telling me about Dingfei's whereabouts,

870
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,960
so that we could meet.

871
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:13,040
That year, it was too late by the time I returned to the capital.

872
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,739
Dingfei must have been forced,

873
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:15,889
and died in fear.

874
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:19,870
This matter also troubled my sister until she died.

875
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,370
You and I have different paths.

876
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:23,590
We were not meant to stand on the same side.

877
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:26,850
But you got me hooked when you said that Dingfei is not dead,

878
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,310
and that there's more to the case.

879
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:32,400
I hope you could please tell me the truth.

880
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,190
If so,

881
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,300
we could discuss the matter of

882
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,900
enlisting the people of Jinling into the army,

883
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:40,420
which you mentioned in the letter.

884
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,909
No wonder the rebels would think

885
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:45,870
that the second half of the letter is related to the Yan family.

886
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,800
In order to reassure Lord Pingnan,

887
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,699
Marquis of Yan included a few words of pretense,

888
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:52,560
while asking about the whereabouts of Xue Dingfei.

889
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,940
If others see it,

890
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,630
I'm afraid it will be considered

891
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,830
as evidence of colluding with the rebels.

892
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:58,490
But,

893
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,550
given the character of Xue Dingfei,

894
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,010
if Marquis of Yan sees him,

895
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,260
he would probably think

896
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,520
it's probably better not to look for him.

897
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,350
Greetings, Your Majesty.

898
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:28,540
Oh, this is Her Majesty?

899
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,300
Who are you?

900
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,560
Who allowed you to stare at me with like that?

901
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,230
Calm down, Your Majesty.

902
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,680
From a distance,

903
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,950
I thought a fairy from heaven had came to the mortal world,

904
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,220
so I wanted to steal a few more glances.

905
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:46,200
I thought my sister was already one of the most beautiful,

906
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:46,930
I didn't expect

907
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:49,590
there is a woman like Your Majesty in this world.

908
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,250
Shut up!

909
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:53,280
How dare you offend Her Majesty?

910
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,140
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

911
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,860
This is the viscount that

912
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,190
Duke Xue had just found.

913
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:02,270
His Majesty has just granted him a position of an official earlier today.

914
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:04,130
Please forgive us, Your Majesty,

915
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,010
and spare him this time.

916
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,350
So you're Noble Consort Xue's brother.

917
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,340
Seeing that all of you are so uncultured,

918
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:15,240
you guys are without a doubt from the same family.

919
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,330
Your Majesty is right.

920
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,370
There's not a single good person

921
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,260
in the entire Xue family.

922
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,600
Where was he found?

923
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,720
Jiang Xuening,

924
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,060
what else do you remember from the previous life,

925
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,520
besides being an empress?

926
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:34,980
Forget it.

927
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,290
In a year or two,

928
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,340
Xue Dingfei surely will come back.

929
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,040
At least this time, Marquis of Yan is still alive.

930
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,570
We'll meet again sometime.

931
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:53,440
[Xie Mansion]

932
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:54,570
Sir,

933
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,600
Miss Jiang wants to see Junior Preceptor Xie.

934
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,670
Please inform him.

935
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:08,420
Greetings, Sir.

936
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,450
Where is the letter?

937
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,830
Of course, I wouldn't carry something

938
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,320
so important with me.

939
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:18,090
Then why are you here?

940
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,640
I was worried that you had questions to ask,

941
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,840
so I came early in the morning.

942
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,200
Aren't you going to at least serve me a cup of tea?

943
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,200
I don't think it's tea you're after.

944
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,690
But, it's Jiao'an,

945
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,120
50,000 taels of silver banknotes,

946
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,180
and the eradication of those rebels.

947
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:33,720
Ning'er,

948
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,360
you're really something, aren't you?

949
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,580
I learned all this from you, Sir.

950
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:40,520
It's also so that you can experience for yourself

951
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,380
how it feels to be kept in the dark.

952
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:45,200
That other half of the letter is very important.

953
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,390
It's not something you can play around with.

954
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,950
What if your plan fails,

955
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:50,950
or what if the rebels had a backup plan?

956
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:53,050
What will happen to the Yan family then?

957
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:53,580
Ning'er,

958
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,610
have you forgotten

959
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:56,850
what I told you before?

960
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:57,190
I...

961
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,550
That's why I let you know on purpose.

962
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,140
I have told you before.

963
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,450
I'm not an immortal.

964
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:09,530
I can't predict everything that's going to happen.

965
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,060
What if something happens?

966
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:13,420
I was careless this time,

967
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,310
and I had made use of you.

968
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,460
I apologize to you.

969
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:17,520
But Sir,

970
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,240
you seem to have forgotten

971
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,170
some things too.

972
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,640
We promised to trust each other,

973
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,770
and reciprocate with assistance.

974
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,770
Didn't I explain to you what happened last time?

975
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:28,880
What else do you want?

976
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,030
From now on,

977
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:31,110
I hope that

978
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,470
we can discuss things beforehand,

979
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,270
and be accountable afterwards.

980
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,810
Aren't you afraid that

981
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:37,570
the more you know,

982
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,340
the faster you'll die?

983
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,540
If I were afraid of death,

984
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,470
I wouldn't have walked this path with you for so long.

985
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,760
I can promise you,

986
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,350
but give me the letter first.

987
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,890
Actually, I can handle the letter myself.

988
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,980
Fine,

989
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:04,370
I'll give it to you.

990
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,060
From now on,

991
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,080
if you continue to be so bold,

992
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,330
and continue to do things you are not supposed to-

993
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,470
-I understand.
-I...

994
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:12,270
I will remember your teachings.

995
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,950
Thank you, Sir.

996
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,350
I'll go back first.

997
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,830
Are you seeing something that I can't see?

998
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:44,100
I really don't understand.

999
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,420
Jiang Xuening is neither obedient nor gentle.

1000
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,010
She is sharp-tongued and mean.

1001
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,790
She always finds trouble for Mr. Xie.

1002
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:52,120
Why does Mr. Xie treat her so differently?

1003
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,720
You...

1004
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,840
are still too young.

1005
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,300
People have

1006
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,990
their limits.

1007
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,340
Think about it.

1008
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:06,600
Xie Ju'an has experienced

1009
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,410
so many horrible things in his childhood,

1010
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,660
and carries so many secrets now.

1011
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,530
He's still living on a knife's edge every day.

1012
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:16,640
Xie Ju'an is carrying too much weight.

1013
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,160
If Mr. Xie needs a listening ear...

1014
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,560
You...

1015
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,030
Can't I do it?

1016
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:20,770
If not,

1017
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:21,990
Dao Qin can also do it.

1018
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,760
You?

1019
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,500
Neither of us can do it.

1020
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:28,600
There's too much awe and trepidation.

1021
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,400
But Jiang Xuening is different.

1022
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,530
Although

1023
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,940
she's still young,

1024
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,640
they are evenly matched.

1025
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:35,900
Both of them

1026
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:37,660
may seem cold,

1027
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,340
but actually, they are really loyal people.

1028
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,860
They are opposites that attract each other.

1029
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,800
Perhaps,

1030
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,120
Xie Ju'an hasn't figured out himself

1031
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,020
how he feels about Miss Jiang.

1032
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,300
But, you just wait.

1033
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,850
One day,

1034
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,380
they will definitely be together.

1035
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,070
Xie Wei

1036
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,170
always reacts strangely

1037
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,170
when it comes to matters of the Yan family.

1038
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,820
[Yan]

1039
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,910
As expected, the rumors back then

1040
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,510
weren't the complete truth.

1041
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,730
Marquis of Yan knew the news,

1042
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:36,460
but didn't tell the Xue family.

1043
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,370
Could it be that the people who killed Xue Dingfei

1044
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,030
were also from the Xue family?

1045
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,640
Back then, Xie Wei and Yan Lin fought their way into the Imperial City,

1046
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,320
and slaughtered the entire Xue family.

1047
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,000
If Yan Lin wants to avenge for his father and aunt,

1048
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,460
then what role does Xie Wei

1049
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:50,150
play in this matter?

1050
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,330
Where is she?

1051
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,040
She left after putting down the letter.

1052
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,320
She must be afraid of your punishment,

1053
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,450
so she didn't dare to come and meet you.

1054
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:00,900
I see.

1055
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:01,880
You may leave.

1056
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:02,500
Yes.

1057
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:36,550
Your Highness,

1058
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:37,790
my mother said

1059
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:39,690
men shouldn't cry easily.

1060
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:40,820
You mustn't cry.

1061
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:41,900
What do you know?

1062
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:44,070
There are rebels outside.

1063
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:45,930
They will kill us.

1064
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,610
What are you doing?

1065
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,600
This is the Tiger Head shoes that

1066
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,460
my uncle brought from the border.

1067
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,140
My uncle said

1068
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:01,450
anyone who fights tigers are heroes.

1069
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:03,930
Your Highness, you and I will each wear one.

1070
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:05,870
Then we won't be afraid anymore.

1071
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:15,490
Your Majesty,

1072
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,360
he hasn't even celebrated his seventh birthday yet.

1073
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,620
My son is the emperor.

1074
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:21,380
He is just a subject.

1075
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:23,510
It's natural for subjects

1076
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:24,880
to die for the emperor.

1077
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,870
-Mother!
-Just because there's a difference between those who are inferior and those who are not,

1078
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:29,070
and between the noble and the lowly.
