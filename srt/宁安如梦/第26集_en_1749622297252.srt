1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
As long as I can enter the Ning'an Palace

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,000
and pay all the price

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,400
I will be willing to do so

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,400
The End

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,800
The End

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,800
Everything seems to be a dream

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,400
I have owed a lot of people

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,000
Chaozhe, help me

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,600
I will be a good person after this

11
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,400
I will be a good person after this

12
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,400
I will be a good person after this

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,400
You can't give me something

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
But what about him?

15
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,400
I have to help you

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,400
when you are alive

17
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,400
Everyone has a right to escape in this world

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,400
But I can't do it

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,400
I want to regret it

20
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,400
and do the wrong thing

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,400
and try my best to return to the past

22
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,400
Do you believe that everything is decided?

23
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,400
I am willing to believe in the future

24
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,400
Your Highness

25
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,400
Your Highness

26
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,400
The End

27
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,400
Ning'er

28
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,400
What are you afraid of?

29
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,400
But in the name of the fate

30
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,400
there is always a pair of hands that are invisible

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,400
and everything is gone

32
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,400
The revenge is long

33
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Who are you in the end?

34
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,400
The Emperor of the mortal world

35
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,400
is so long

36
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,400
and so ridiculous

37
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:39,620
And he

38
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
Dream.

39
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,960
Smart baby, He Feihe.

40
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,800
Feihe is your fan.

41
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
I hope you can see her as a dream.

42
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,840
Do you know

43
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,440
what happened?

44
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,760
No.

45
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,240
I didn't even send her a bath.

46
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,240
I was worried about this.

47
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,480
I was thinking

48
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,000
to wait until she was gone.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,880
When?

50
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,640
What else do you want to do?

51
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,440
No.

52
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,360
I...

53
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,080
Miss.

54
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,080
All right.

55
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,080
Get out.

56
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,760
I need to talk to Fang Ying alone.

57
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,360
Close the door.

58
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,520
Fang Ying.

59
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,440
Marriage is not a game.

60
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,880
So you can't mess with your family

61
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,520
just to avoid the Azash family.

62
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,360
You don't like Lv Xian.

63
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,120
You can't be so careless.

64
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,720
I'll talk to Mr. Xie.

65
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,960
After the oil-fired broadcast,

66
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,320
I'll let you two get along.

67
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,000
Don't worry about Lv Xian's money.

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,440
I'll return it to him.

69
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,440
I won't let you owe him a favor.

70
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,400
Fang Ying.

71
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,600
Miss.

72
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,240
I know you're doing this for my own good.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But Fang Ying has thought about this.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,880
I grew up in a family.

75
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,360
My father is a good boy.

76
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,840
He has many mothers.

77
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,880
He has to be treated by his wife all day.

78
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,600
My mother told me

79
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,160
that you can't be a concubine

80
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,040
and you must be a normal woman.

81
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,680
That's the point.

82
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,680
But you can't mess with Lv Xian.

83
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,080
It's not a mess.

84
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,240
You like him?

85
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,160
When?

86
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,440
No, I don't like him.

87
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,640
No.

88
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,440
I don't like him.

89
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,920
I think

90
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,320
marriage is the best way

91
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,920
for me to leave the oil-fired.

92
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,840
Besides,

93
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,600
Mr. Lv is good to me.

94
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,840
He treats me well.

95
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,840
He teaches me to do business.

96
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,480
He is the only one

97
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,640
who truly cares about me

98
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,680
except for you.

99
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,680
Fang Ying has no big ambition.

100
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,680
Now,

101
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,520
I want to help you

102
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,080
to take care of Yan Jing's business.

103
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,440
I don't think

104
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,640
marriage is a good thing.

105
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,600
And...

106
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,120
He promised me

107
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,240
that he will let me

108
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,480
leave the oil-fired business

109
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,080
as soon as possible.

110
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,040
If I don't want to,

111
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,880
he will do anything for me.

112
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,280
He is a gentleman.

113
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,680
You think it over?

114
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,280
Yes, Miss.

115
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,080
Fang Ying has thought it over.

116
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,880
Miss...

117
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,280
Miss Jin'er.

118
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,480
If you want to make him

119
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,680
do business for Yan Jing,

120
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,880
I can give you a big reward.

121
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,880
I love money,

122
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,680
but I don't want to

123
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,080
pay for my marriage.

124
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,280
So,

125
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,080
you are sincere to Fang Ying?

126
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,080
If I say I am not fond of you,

127
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,280
I am fond of you,

128
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,080
you won't write it.

129
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,080
But...

130
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,080
Miss You is kind and pure.

131
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,480
Lv Mou has been

132
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,880
used to the self-righteous

133
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,480
and self-righteous people.

134
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,280
I never thought

135
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,480
there would be such a kind woman in my world.

136
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,880
I really want to help her.

137
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,080
You just want to help her?

138
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,480
If it's just a test,

139
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,480
how can you be sincere?

140
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,880
If you take her away,

141
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,880
she will be a daughter

142
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,280
and will be a good daughter.

143
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,080
What will you do to her?

144
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,080
Miss, you misunderstood.

145
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,880
I know you are sincere to her.

146
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,480
So, Lv Mou won't be satisfied.

147
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,680
Since you married her,

148
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,880
I, Lv Zhao Ying,

149
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,880
swear to God today.

150
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,680
From now on,

151
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,880
I won't let her be bullied

152
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,080
and suffer from all kinds of grievances.

153
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,480
That's the best way.

154
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,680
If you dare to be disobeyed,

155
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,080
I will...

156
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,080
Then I will be a burden for my whole life.

157
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,680
I won't be able to earn money with my life.

158
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,480
Sir, your health is finally better.

159
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,880
The doctor is the third master.

160
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,680
You can't eat anymore at this hour and night.

161
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,680
Let's go, everyone.

162
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,080
You even came here.

163
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,080
I wanted to ask Uncle Jian to find you.

164
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,080
How are you doing over there these days?

165
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,080
Don't mention it.

166
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,080
Xueyan's old friend is really capable.

167
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,880
I used the name of Duke Ding's Mansion

168
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,880
to make a reservation in Qinglu.

169
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,880
I didn't mean to give a favor to Xue's wife.

170
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,880
I thought that this would make them excited.

171
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,480
But the person who was chasing the debt

172
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,680
was already chasing the door.

173
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,880
Xueyan didn't even say a word of it.

174
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,280
Xueyan has been in the court for many years.

175
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,680
He is a man of nature.

176
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,880
He is much better than the commoners.

177
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,880
You are a man of wisdom and a man of wisdom.

178
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,680
Plus, Xinyu Wei has been in a lot of trouble recently.

179
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,080
He knows the truth of the secret of the secret.

180
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,680
I really don't understand.

181
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,880
You tried so hard to get me back to the capital

182
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,280
just to make me angry?

183
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,280
Of course not.

184
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,480
In the 300-year civil case,

185
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,880
Xueyan was greedy and committed a crime.

186
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,880
But this dress is not of the Qin's.

187
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,680
Xue's been in the court for many years.

188
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,480
He is a man of nature.

189
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,480
He is easy to get revenge.

190
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,680
He is a man of nature.

191
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,480
He is ambitious and unparalleled.

192
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,280
He asked you to find out the truth.

193
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,080
He wanted to make a fuss about the secret.

194
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,480
He wanted to find out the truth.

195
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,680
When the Ministry of Justice finds out the crime of Xueyan,

196
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,080
we will be in trouble.

197
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,480
But that Zhang Zhe

198
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,680
went to the court.

199
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,680
I'm afraid the case of Xue's will be delayed.

200
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,480
That's why I asked you to delay the investigation.

201
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,680
I have my own arrangement.

202
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,480
I used all the methods I could use.

203
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,680
I really don't know how to make this old-fashioned dress.

204
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,080
Xueyan

205
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,080
wants to do everything he can.

206
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,880
I will go to the palace tomorrow

207
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,080
and give you a chance.

208
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,680
Xie Zhou.

209
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,480
How is it?

210
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,480
What is Lv Xian doing recently?

211
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,680
Right.

212
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,280
After he returned, he didn't even see his ex-boyfriend.

213
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,480
He seems to be in Jinling.

214
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,680
He likes to be with you the most.

215
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,480
Lv Xian got married to Miss You Fangying.

216
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,280
No.

217
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,480
Lv Xian and Miss You...

218
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,080
Lv Xian is successful.

219
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,080
He is so smart.

220
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,280
Dao Qin, which girl

221
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,880
is so hard to get?

222
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,880
Dao Qin, do you know?

223
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,280
Who is Jiang Jia's girl?

224
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,280
When I first went to Lv's family,

225
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,480
I just saw her with Miss Jiang.

226
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,880
When she left, her face was not good.

227
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,280
Look.

228
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,280
She only put this on your head.

229
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,880
Who told you to be so considerate of her?

230
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,480
Lv Xian is your person.

231
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,680
She doesn't take you with her.

232
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,880
Of course, she doesn't take her ex-boyfriend.

233
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,480
Poor Lv.

234
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,480
It's rare for a married woman to marry a married woman.

235
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,680
She still wants to marry you.

236
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,480
Are you done talking?

237
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,880
Are you done talking?

238
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,280
Why are you still not leaving?

239
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,680
Have you finished what you should do?

240
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,680
Fine. Let's go.

241
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,480
No need to go.

242
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,480
I'm busy.

243
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,480
Let's go.

244
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,480
Lord Gu.

245
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,080
Lord Xie, why are you here?

246
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,880
His Majesty has sent me to the palace.

247
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,880
He has given me a reward for the food and water.

248
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,880
Lord Gu is also in the process of receiving the edict.

249
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,280
He is waiting for me here.

250
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,680
He wants to discuss with you.

251
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,680
His Majesty is talented and has his own business.

252
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,280
If you want to help him,

253
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,080
I'm afraid you are mistaken.

254
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,280
Lord Gu, you misunderstood.

255
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,280
I'm not waiting for myself.

256
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,080
I'm waiting for Lord Zhang Zhe.

257
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,880
Zhang Zhe is just in time.

258
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,280
He is really in a relationship with you.

259
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,080
Why do you want to help him?

260
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:31,280
Remember, you should reward him with your grace.

261
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:36,280
Now, there are bloodline in the court.

262
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,480
There are also the Nidang Hushi of Pingnan King.

263
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,280
How can you fight against the bloodline and Pingnan King

264
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,080
with only one person?

265
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,480
Lord Zhang is a clear and upright man.

266
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,280
He is a man of justice and is a man of justice.

267
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,480
It's a rare battle.

268
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,280
With him around, I'm sure I can help you

269
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,680
to help His Majesty to solve the problem and stabilize the court.

270
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,680
Young Master, you really think so?

271
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,680
As a person, I should be the one to do it.

272
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,080
I hope you won't be too worried.

273
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,480
What do you mean?

274
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,080
Okay, if it's okay, it's okay.

275
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,980
Then, I won't complain anymore.

276
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,620
the three-year-old Ding You's wife?

277
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,060
Gu Qing,

278
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,940
you are very fond of your disciple.

279
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,700
Your Majesty,

280
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,260
I have a word.

281
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,460
Tell me.

282
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,740
I think

283
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,700
you should avoid

284
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,580
the three-year-old Ding You's wife.

285
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,500
You think so?

286
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,220
Your Majesty,

287
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,300
the court is now in a state of internal and external conflict.

288
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,580
It's just like Mr. Zhang's

289
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,860
personal talent.

290
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,180
Although Mr. Zhang is not low-key,

291
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,620
he is just in the position.

292
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,140
He never disobeyed the imperial decree.

293
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,460
With him here,

294
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,820
he will definitely

295
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,580
treat His Majesty well.

296
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,620
I think

297
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,540
Mr. Gu will be very kind to His Majesty.

298
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,140
That's what he meant.

299
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,340
Exactly.

300
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,620
Your Majesty,

301
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,500
I am already old.

302
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,860
Although I help His Majesty

303
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,740
to clear his mind,

304
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,500
I can't stop him.

305
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,700
With Zhang Zhe here,

306
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,060
I can help him

307
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,140
to help His Majesty

308
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,860
to stabilize the court.

309
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,340
You are right.

310
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,780
But Ding You's wife

311
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,940
is a general.

312
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,460
If it's not allowed,

313
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,020
you mean

314
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,780
His Majesty has summoned Xie Wei

315
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,140
and Gu Chunfang,

316
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,060
but he hasn't summoned the State Preceptor?

317
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,660
Exactly.

318
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,580
He has sent the letter to the Palace of the Xue Shu.

319
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,540
He said

320
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,380
he wants to see the court.

321
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:42,700
Yes.

322
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:52,420
Uncle,

323
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:56,860
my,

324
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,380
It's all right.

325
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,540
At the end of the article,

326
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,340
I have my own responsibilities.

327
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,260
Let's do that.

328
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,300
To back the latearkan's message,

329
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,780
In life we're already missing the Shangxi C sostant.

330
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,580
If you can give the dueanna for the☆

331
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,280
cost even a few officials.

332
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,880
You can proclaim your fate.

333
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,880
It'sTake JingERShapenal myگ!

334
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,480
You possibly have yet to accept falseospitation ofгорi sphere on the first place,

335
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,840
and you're either willing to let Mr. Zhang

336
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,560
be this once salty?

337
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,440
What you think, Your Majesty?

338
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,320
I agree with what Xie Qing just said.

339
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,520
He's a criminal officer now.

340
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,720
balls during the sweep of the hostile 다시es

341
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,020
it is a lot harder than knowing the painstaking experience we saw with Yanzett

342
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,920
at Lord Yan's Band,

343
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,880
The Five Lords have been talking about this for billions,

344
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,260
CA has卡ed 1 million mortgage debt,

345
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,120
and it will return 4 million mortgage debt.

346
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,120
As for重 зак slapped horses,

347
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,700
Just have to endure this pain and compete to make you a slot for a good qin?

348
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,180
Thank you, your majesty.

349
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,980
Allow me to knock around

350
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,840
I believe that you yourself

351
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,140
are still in need of competitors in Th especially the five masters.

352
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,620
Though the Biyin don't have much aspect in this life,

353
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,480
if these two can benefit,

354
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,360
fear their hearts will not be peaceful.

355
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,060
But, if there are many

356
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,860
I'm afraid Duke Ding will be worried.

357
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,540
Your Majesty, I have a plan.

358
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,740
I can accept it.

359
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,900
Look at this.

360
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,300
Aunt.

361
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,060
This is...

362
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,660
It's from the Ministry of Rites.

363
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,460
It's from the royal family of the Imperial family.

364
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,460
It's suitable for the royal family's reputation.

365
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,540
I've read it.

366
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:35,180
It's all soft and gentle.

367
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,980
Don't worry.

368
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,460
Because Zheng Fei's chamado is still yours.

369
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,060
As for deserters,

370
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,420
you can choose from their positions.

371
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,100
What do you mean, Aunt?

372
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,740
Today, she told me that...

373
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,020
She is a famous girl in Jiang when sheilà.

374
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:54,940
As for men.

375
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,700
They all like fresh cotton.

376
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,020
It's a shy party for them.

377
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,060
Build a saying

378
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:02,940
around the house

379
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,020
on your name.

380
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:08,020
Why not choose a sweet and unlovable one now?

381
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,020
The Jiang family is a noble family.

382
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,020
The eldest daughter is a good example.

383
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,020
Since Ji'er is his own son,

384
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:20,020
I don't want to be in this world and have a relationship with Ji'er.

385
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:24,020
So, could you choose the girl from the Jiang family?

386
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,020
I'll arrange it.

387
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,020
Good girl.

388
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:39,020
The Emperor of Fengtian,

389
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,020
the Emperor of Fengtian,

390
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,020
the Emperor of Fengzhou,

391
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,020
the Emperor of Fengzhou,

392
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,020
should be executed in public.

393
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,020
Xue Dingfei is not a good example.

394
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,020
The Central State of China,

395
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,020
the Emperor of Fengzhou,

396
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,020
is a noble and noble person.

397
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,020
Thank you, Your Majesty.

398
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,020
Please rise.

399
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,020
What are you doing?

400
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,020
Take the stuff.

401
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,020
Yes.

402
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,020
Eunuch Wang,

403
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,020
how else can I say?

404
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,020
You are my lucky star.

405
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,020
Every time I meet you,

406
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,020
I'll be sure to have a good time.

407
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,020
I can't be the crown prince.

408
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,020
It's the crown prince's blessing.

409
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:51,020
It's the best gift for the world.

410
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,020
Long'en is so generous.

411
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,020
Ridiculous.

412
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,020
Eunuch, you come to the general's office.

413
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,020
Do you have any rules?

414
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,020
Send Eunuch back to the palace.

415
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,020
Yes.

416
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,020
Eunuch, please.

417
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,020
Wait.

418
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,020
Why are you so anxious?

419
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,020
It's the Imperial Palace's mansion.

420
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,020
Eunuch Wang came here to visit.

421
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,020
It's so hard.

422
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,020
You didn't show your true colors.

423
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,020
You are so stingy.

424
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,020
What did you say?

425
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,020
Eunuch Wang,

426
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:23,020
I'm so happy.

427
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,020
I forgot my gift.

428
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,020
I'm so happy.

429
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,020
I forgot my gift.

430
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,020
Eunuch, please.

431
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,020
Thank you, madam.

432
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,020
Thank you, Eunuch.

433
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,020
Thank you, crown prince.

434
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,020
I'll go back to the palace

435
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,020
and give my order to the emperor.

436
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,020
Eunuch, please.

437
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,020
Why are you standing here?

438
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,020
Give the crown prince's reward

439
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,020
to the crown prince's room.

440
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,020
Yes.

441
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,020
Go.

442
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,020
The emperor is the emperor.

443
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,020
I can see

444
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,020
who is the emperor.

445
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,020
You...

446
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,020
Ye'er.

447
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,020
Stop.

448
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,020
Let me ask you.

449
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,020
Where were you

450
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,020
in the mess last night?

451
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,020
Nailu,

452
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,020
the beautiful scenery

453
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,020
is just like a flower.

454
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,020
What's wrong?

455
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,020
What's wrong?

456
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,020
Eunuch,

457
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,020
you want to go, too?

458
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,020
Xue Dingfei,

459
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,020
you are the crown prince's wife.

460
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,020
You can't do this kind of thing again.

461
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,020
You can't do it.

462
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,020
Don't ruin my reputation.

463
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,020
You think I'm embarrassed?

464
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,020
Really?

465
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,020
Since you think I'm so troublesome,

466
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,020
how about I change my surname?

467
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,020
You bastard.

468
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,020
You...

469
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,020
Xue Dingfei.

470
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,020
How dare you

471
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,020
to be so rude to your father?

472
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,020
Don't you know how to respect and despise?

473
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,020
Xue Dingfei.

474
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,020
How dare you to be my Ye'er?

475
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,020
What do you want?

476
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,020
Why are you so bold

477
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,020
to talk to your father?

478
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,020
I don't want to teach him

479
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,020
how to use his name.

480
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,020
How to...

481
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,020
What are you doing?

482
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,020
You bastard.

483
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,020
Let me tell you.

484
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,020
If I don't teach you well,

485
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,020
I'm not the master of the Xue family.

486
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,020
He killed me.

487
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,020
He killed me.

488
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,020
Xue Yuan,

489
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,020
you are the only one who loves me.

490
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,020
How dare you to hit me?

491
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,020
Don't forget.

492
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,020
I'm the most filial son of the emperor.

493
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,020
What are you doing?

494
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,020
Niezhang,

495
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,020
I'm telling you.

496
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,020
Don't talk about filial piety.

497
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,020
Even if you go out,

498
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,020
you won't be the master of the Xue family.

499
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,020
You are a bastard.

500
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,020
Stop.

501
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,020
Help.

502
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,020
Stop.

503
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,020
Help.

504
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,020
Master.

505
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,020
He killed me.

506
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,020
Father.

507
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,020
Master.

508
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,020
Master.

509
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,020
Father.

510
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,020
Let me go.

511
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,020
My waist.

512
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,020
My waist.

513
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,020
Are you okay?

514
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,020
Master.

515
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,020
You bastard.

516
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,020
Master.

517
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,020
I'm the master of the Xue family.

518
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,020
Come here.

519
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,020
Come here.

520
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,020
Is anyone here to see him?

521
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,020
Father.

522
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,020
Let me see.

523
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,020
You must be busy all day.

524
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,020
You still have time to ask me to come here.

525
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,020
You are not tired.

526
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,020
I'm not trying to hide it from you.

527
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,020
But it happened suddenly.

528
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,020
He didn't want to be a man.

529
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,020
So he did it.

530
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,020
Don't be sad.

531
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,020
I have a wife now.

532
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,020
But I won't forget you.

533
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,020
There are many ways to save people.

534
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,020
You choose this way.

535
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,020
Have you been with him

536
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,020
for the first time in the negotiation?

537
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,020
You are quite tacit.

538
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,020
You are quite tacit.

539
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,020
He asked me the same question.

540
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,020
I...

541
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,020
If you really don't like him,

542
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,020
it must be not true.

543
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,020
But if you really like him,

544
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,020
it's not a big deal.

545
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,020
I just think

546
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,020
he is different.

547
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,020
What's different?

548
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,020
He is a dead man.

549
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,020
So you like him.

550
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,020
You have met him before.

551
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,020
You don't know that.

552
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,020
He is very affectionate.

553
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,020
If you are right,

554
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,020
he can repay you with a thousand percent.

555
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,020
It's like

556
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,020
he treats you like a girl.

557
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,020
What about you?

558
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,020
You Fang Yin.

559
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,020
She is a timid and weak person.

560
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,020
But she dares to do anything

561
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,020
for her love.

562
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,020
If she is the one who is obsessed with her,

563
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,020
she won't leave.

564
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,020
She is so mad.

565
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,020
But because of her temper,

566
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,020
she is so heart-broken.

567
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,020
So I think

568
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,020
there should be someone

569
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,020
who can help her.

570
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,020
So you want to be that person.

571
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,020
How long do you plan to be?

572
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,020
Since I married someone,

573
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,020
I am responsible for it.

574
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,020
But he might not like you.

575
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,020
You are a little man, right?

576
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,020
I am so charming.

577
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,020
I can't fool him.

578
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,020
Fine.

579
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,020
I wish you and your wife

580
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,020
a long and long life.

581
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,020
Don't mind me.

582
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,020
You should follow the etiquette.

583
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,020
Did I get to know your wine?

584
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,020
Who told you to stay?

585
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,020
So I didn't get to know your wine.

586
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,020
You...

587
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,020
You really don't follow the etiquette?

588
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,020
How much do you want?

589
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,020
Here.

590
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,020
Here you are.

591
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,020
Qin Xi.

592
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,020
Qin Se?

593
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,020
Qin Hun He Li.

594
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,020
I am a little bit worried about the plan.

595
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,020
Where is Dao Qin and you?

596
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,020
Dao Qin, don't run.

597
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,020
Where is your gift?

598
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,020
You are lying to me, right?

599
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,020
You are a gift to me.

600
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,020
Don't run.

601
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,020
Noble Consort, you are so tall.

602
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,020
You can't live in the palace without an outsider.

603
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,020
We can't be poisoned by the princess.

604
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,020
I thought it would be hard to see you.

605
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,020
But I didn't expect you to be so depressed today.

606
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,020
Actually, I am not depressed.

607
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,020
There is no such thing in the world.

608
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,020
I just think that

609
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,020
if you like to learn Buddhism,

610
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,020
you will come here to visit.

611
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,020
I will be here every day.

612
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,020
I will see you one day.

613
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,020
Your Highness,

614
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,020
I can't take care of you.

615
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,020
I said you can take care of me.

616
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,020
Actually, I am waiting for you here.

617
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,020
I have something to tell you.

618
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,020
What do you want to say to me?

619
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,020
Miss Jiang,

620
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,020
I don't think you are doing this for me.

621
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,020
I hope you can come here to visit.

622
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,020
You don't want to?

623
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,020
I thought we were in the same boat.

624
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,020
I didn't expect it to be my wishful thinking.

625
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,020
I am sorry, Miss Jiang.

626
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,020
Thank you for your kindness.

627
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,020
But,

628
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,020
everyone knows that

629
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,020
your princess

630
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,020
is the eldest daughter of Xue family.

631
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,020
But in my heart,

632
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,020
I have already found out the meaning.

633
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,020
My princess

634
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,020
must be the one I love.

635
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,020
I am afraid

636
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,020
that I will not be able to follow you.

637
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,020
I am afraid that

638
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,020
I will not be able to follow you.

639
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,020
I am afraid that

640
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,020
if I didn't pass the test,

641
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,020
I will not be able to follow you.

642
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,020
Okay?

643
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,020
Miss,

644
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,020
there is news from Wei Zhong.

645
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,020
Prince Ling has been coming to Liu Lian every day.

646
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,020
It is for Miss Jiang.

647
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,020
I am afraid that you are too shameless.

648
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,020
This matter

649
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:24,020
must be told to the Duke and Empress Dowager.

650
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,020
This is a trivial matter.

651
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,020
You don't need to trouble me and your aunt.

652
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,020
It is just a general meeting.

653
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,020
Let's go.

654
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,020
Yes.

655
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,020
Ning Ning.

656
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,020
You finally came to see me today.

657
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,020
Tell me how many letters

658
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,020
I have written to you.

659
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,020
You didn't reply me.

660
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,020
Did you not take me as your friend?

661
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,020
Your Highness,

662
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,020
a few days ago,

663
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,020
my sister asked me to go to the city to get some clothes.

664
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,020
So I spent a few days in the temple.

665
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,020
After I came back, I was sick again.

666
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,020
Your Highness,

667
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,020
I haven't seen your letter.

668
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,020
Sick?

669
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,020
Is it good now?

670
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:08,020
It is good that I can come to see you in the palace.

671
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,020
Since so,

672
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,020
I won't blame you.

673
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,020
But if there is anything,

674
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,020
you must tell me.

675
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,020
Yes.

676
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,020
Thank you for your magnanimousness.

677
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,020
Where are you going?

678
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,020
Empress Dowager is waiting for you.

679
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,020
I want to talk to you.

680
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,020
I can't wait for a while.

681
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,020
Why are you still polite with me?

682
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,020
I have seen you.

683
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,020
Uncle, you are here.

684
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,020
Your Highness.

685
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,020
What a coincidence.

686
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,020
Why are you here?

687
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,020
We were all poisoned.

688
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,020
Miss Xue is here.

689
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,020
We are here naturally.

690
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,020
Miss Jiao'er is joking.

691
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,020
I came to take care of my aunt.

692
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,020
Today,

693
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:51,020
the new-born Prince Ling Zi's favorite meat,

694
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,020
my aunt changed me to have a try.

695
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,020
So,

696
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,020
didn't you hear that?

697
00:28:56,020 --> 00:29:00,020
His Majesty has chosen Prince Ling Zi as his consort.

698
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:03,020
But Prince Ling Zi is a noble person.

699
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,020
He is not a noble person.

700
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:09,020
I'm afraid that someone wants to fly to the capital

701
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:12,020
but he is in the valley of the bones.

702
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,020
Miss Xue is right.

703
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,020
But I think

704
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:20,020
only a phoenix can fly to the capital.

705
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,020
Some mountain birds are also birds.

706
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,020
They are just a few feathers.

707
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,020
They are wrong to be a phoenix.

708
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,020
In the end, they are just a joke.

709
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,020
Your Highness.

710
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,020
Empress Dowager is waiting for me.

711
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,020
I'll leave first.

712
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,020
What's wrong with him today?

713
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,020
Who doesn't know that he is the queen of the empress?

714
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,020
Who can be his consort?

715
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,020
What's the point of saying something so unkind?

716
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,020
Yes, Your Highness.

717
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,020
Help.

718
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:05,020
I have a son.

719
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,020
Let me go.

720
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,020
What's the matter, Xuan Na?

721
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,020
Your Highness.

722
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,020
Your Highness.

723
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,020
Your Highness.

724
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,020
Your Highness.

725
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,020
Your Highness.

726
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,020
What's the matter, Xuan Na?

727
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,020
Your Highness.

728
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,020
He is dead.

729
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,020
Your Majesty.

730
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,020
The loyal and filial guards are waiting outside.

731
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,020
They want to see you.

732
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,020
They said they want to report you.

733
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,020
Report you?

734
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,020
What report?

735
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,020
I don't know.

736
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,020
Let him in.

737
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,020
Yes.

738
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,020
Your Highness.

739
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,020
You must follow my order.

740
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,020
Your Highness.

741
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:43,020
Duke Ding beat me.

742
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,020
Look.

743
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,020
He is the one who wants my life.

744
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,020
Duke Ding is so weak.

745
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,020
Why?

746
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,020
Duke Ding has been arrogant and arrogant.

747
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,020
I even got the reward for his birthday.

748
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,020
But I didn't get the credit for his and the news.

749
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,020
That's so embarrassing.

750
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,020
Nonsense.

751
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,020
Your father is a Duke.

752
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,020
He won't be so polite to you.

753
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,020
Your Majesty.

754
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,020
I'm so sorry.

755
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:12,020
He doesn't only treat me well.

756
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,020
But also...

757
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,020
What?

758
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,020
What did you say?

759
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,020
I said I forgot

760
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,020
his kindness to you.

761
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,020
I was so jealous.

762
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,020
Now you are so mean to him.

763
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,020
You want to kill him.

764
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:31,020
What a good father.

765
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,020
I want to ask him.

766
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,020
As a son of a minister,

767
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,020
how dare you say thanks to the emperor?

768
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,020
What's the purpose of his loyalty?

769
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,020
Let's go to Duke Ding's palace.

770
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,020
Your Majesty, don't be angry.

771
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,020
Zhong Yongxiao was wronged.

772
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,020
He was just being rude.

773
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,020
Duke Ding has been in the palace for years.

774
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,020
You are the Empress Dowager's brother.

775
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,020
Why are you so selfish?

776
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,020
It's not like that.

777
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,020
How could I be rude?

778
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,020
Although he is my father,

779
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,020
I can't see him.

780
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,020
But he is the father of the emperor

781
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,020
and the empress dowager.

782
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,020
He is a bloodthirsty man.

783
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,020
And he is the military official

784
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,020
who couldn't be known for 20 years.

785
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,020
Besides,

786
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,020
what else did he do for the emperor and the court?

787
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:12,020
What is the military official who couldn't be known for 20 years?

788
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,020
Do you know anything else?

789
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,020
Your Majesty,

790
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,020
I know that

791
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,020
you are the loyal and loyal one.

792
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,020
I want to find out the truth.

793
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,020
So I can't stop my business.

794
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,020
Finally,

795
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,020
I remember that when I was trapped in Jinling,

796
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,020
I heard the news of the former emperor.

797
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,020
I only heard a few words.

798
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,020
But I find it strange.

799
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,020
What is it?

800
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:35,020
There was a monkey who led 30,000 troops.

801
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,020
Duke Ding only led 5,000 troops.

802
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,020
Even though the army of the southern king

803
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,020
was in the east,

804
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,020
and the Yan army was in the east,

805
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,020
Duke Ding had to use the battlefield

806
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,020
to get the first hand of the first broken city.

807
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,020
When he went through the pain,

808
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,020
I thought that

809
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,020
he had a hand-to-hand with other than the打er.

810
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,020
He is not like that.

811
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,020
Your Majesty,

812
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,020
the incident was over.

813
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,020
Duke Ding's words are a guess.

814
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,020
If you come here to question Duke Ding's attack,

815
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,020
I'm afraid it's inappropriate.

816
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,020
You can't mention it to anyone.

817
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,020
Xie Qing,

818
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,020
Duke Ding is in a bad mood.

819
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,020
Take him to the imperial hospital to see if he is injured

820
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,020
in case he gets a cold.

821
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,020
Yes.

822
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,020
Your Majesty,

823
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,020
you must protect Chengyuan.

824
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,020
I will send him off.

825
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,080
Don't worry.

826
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,020
He is your little seven-year-old prince.

827
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,020
I know your great interests.

828
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,020
But do not go back to him.

829
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,020
Please.

830
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,020
I'm sorry.

831
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:52,200
Why do

832
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,420
you sing 시작at

833
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,020
among your whole family?

834
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,020
generator.

835
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,020
Over every last week,

836
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,020
I'm not doing it all because of him.

837
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,020
You heard that.

838
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:06,620
Even Princess Consort Ling, Princess Consort of Dongmu Rourou,

839
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,120
is a loser.

840
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,120
I'm doing it because I admire you and want to be a part of the selection.

841
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,820
But if I fail,

842
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,220
I won't only lose face by myself,

843
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:18,220
but also become a filial son-in-law of Jiangfu.

844
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,420
A person shouldn't live for others' sake,

845
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,420
but for their own sake.

846
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,420
Since you saved Noble Consort Qin,

847
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:28,620
you've already decided to take this path.

848
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:31,420
Why are you so angry now?

849
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:40,720
Xue Ning, not everyone is as brave as you.

850
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,820
In this world, except for others' eyes and their own interests,

851
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:48,420
there is one more thing.

852
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,820
It's called fate.

853
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:53,820
If fate is destined to be like this, even if I'm against it,

854
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,020
how can I do it?

855
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,820
Just do it.

856
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,620
Fate?

857
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:22,420
The

858
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:39,280
The

859
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,260
Yeah.

860
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,700
Jiao Er.

861
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,740
Jenny.

862
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,820
Who's this pretty girl here?

863
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,420
She'sınızi, Prince Confuciun.

864
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,540
She's so beautiful,

865
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,540
can't fly, right?

866
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:22,620
What have you been doing these days?

867
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,620
Have you been studying?

868
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:27,620
I was studying in the house.

869
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,620
I didn't have the time to let you down.

870
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:33,620
Since you met him, you should come back with me.

871
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,620
I have something to tell you.

872
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,620
There's still something urgent in the student's family.

873
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,620
I'll go visit you another day.

874
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,620
There's a letter from Huangzhou.

875
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,620
I don't want to know.

876
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,620
Yan Lin?

877
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:53,620
Sister Zhang, I have something to do in the Xishang City.

878
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,620
I'll go to my sister's home.

879
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,620
I'll go to my mother's home.

880
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,620
Sister Jiang.

881
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,620
Why don't you just burn me?

882
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,620
Yes.

883
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,620
Xie Wei!

884
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,620
Jian Shu!

885
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,620
Wei!

886
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,620
Mother.

887
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,620
Sister.

888
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,620
Why did brother get hurt?

889
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,620
You can have a look.

890
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,620
What happened?

891
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,620
Sister, you don't know.

892
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,620
That Consort Xue is so impulsive.

893
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,620
She won't let me and mother stay in her eyes.

894
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,620
I'll go to the Palace and let my mother take her position.

895
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,620
I'll see how she'll get into trouble.

896
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,620
No!

897
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,620
No!

898
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:50,620
Consort Xue was a mess in the Pinyin King's case.

899
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,620
But His Majesty was in a state of disaster.

900
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,620
It was a chaotic and chaotic palace.

901
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,620
Now, she's in a state of crisis.

902
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,620
She's in a state of crisis.

903
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:04,620
If we send a message to the Duke of Ding's Mansion,

904
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:09,620
it'll only make father and aunt look down on the court.

905
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,620
What should we do?

906
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,620
She's so loyal to His Majesty.

907
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,620
Then, what about your brother's crown prince?

908
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,620
Mother, don't worry.

909
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,620
As long as aunt and aunt are on the same side,

910
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:28,620
His Majesty won't go against Empress Dowager Wu for a long time.

911
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,620
Moreover, Yan family has lost.

912
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,620
She has no mother.

913
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:37,620
Shu'er, this is not as simple as you think.

914
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,620
When she didn't show up,

915
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:44,620
the late emperor made his crown prince position.

916
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:48,620
This is a very common thing.

917
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,620
It's all my fault.

918
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:59,620
These years, I thought she was dead.

919
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:03,620
I thought that after your brother's crown prince position,

920
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,620
I would ask your father to get her married again.

921
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,620
But he didn't die.

922
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:12,620
He came back without any reason.

923
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,620
Shu'er, you're always smart.

924
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:20,620
You must think of a way to protect your brother's crown prince position.

925
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,620
Mother, don't worry.

926
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,620
Let me think about it.

927
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,620
It's all because of Xie Wei and Jiang Xue Ning.

928
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,620
If they didn't protect Xue Ding Fei in Tongzhou,

929
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,620
how could there be such a bad thing today?

930
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,620
What did you say just now?

931
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:38,620
You said that Jiang Xue Ning also went to Tongzhou?

932
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,620
Yes, she did.

933
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,620
Why didn't you say it earlier?

934
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,620
Father didn't want to offend Xie Wei,

935
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,620
so he did this in a pure way.

936
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,620
He's a woman of the rules.

937
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,620
He's always with you.

938
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,620
Who knows what will happen on this journey?

939
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,620
Mother.

940
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,620
Mother, don't worry.

941
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,620
The one in the Imperial Noble Consort's belly

942
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,620
is not a man or a woman.

943
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:10,620
Prince Ling is still the most likely to be in that position.

944
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:14,620
As long as I become Prince Ling's concubine,

945
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:21,620
no one can escape from my family.

946
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,620
The people in the imperial court have me.

947
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,620
They have some arrangements.

948
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,620
You don't have to worry too much.

949
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:39,620
It's just that the north is in a difficult situation.

950
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,620
The Marquis's family has been in a state of recovery for a while.

951
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:46,620
Fortunately, he's fine now.

952
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:49,620
Yan Lin's character should be good.

953
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,620
Although the imperial court is not as prosperous as the capital,

954
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:56,620
it's not a good thing to let him have a good time.

955
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,620
What about you?

956
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,620
You also want to leave the capital

957
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,620
and find some freedom.

958
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,620
I grew up in the countryside.

959
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,620
I used to be a fan of the capital.

960
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,620
But after walking here,

961
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,620
I found that the fan is still a little suspicious.

962
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,620
I don't dare to ask for freedom.

963
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:27,620
I'm lucky that no one can escape from me.

964
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,620
I'm afraid.

965
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,620
As you said,

966
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,620
I can know that this letter has been written for a while.

967
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,620
Now you show me.

968
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:42,620
It's not because of this that you called me out of the palace.

969
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:46,620
So you want to tell me what you want to say?

970
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,620
Since you don't want to say anything,

971
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,620
I'll leave first.

972
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,620
I'm sorry.

973
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,620
I'm sorry.

974
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,620
I'm sorry.

975
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,620
I'm sorry.

976
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,620
I'm sorry.

977
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,620
I'm sorry.

978
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,620
I'm sorry.

979
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,620
I'm sorry.

980
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,620
I'm sorry.

981
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,620
I'm sorry.

982
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,620
I'm sorry.

983
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,620
I'm sorry.

984
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,620
I'm sorry.

985
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:14,620
I'm sorry.

986
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,620
I'm sorry.

987
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,620
I'm sorry.

988
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:20,620
I'm sorry.

989
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,620
I'm sorry.

990
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,620
I'm sorry.

991
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,620
I'm sorry.

992
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,620
I'm sorry.

993
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,620
I'm sorry.

994
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,620
I'm sorry.

995
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,620
I'm sorry.

996
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,620
I'm sorry.

997
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,620
I'm sorry.

998
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,620
I'm sorry.

999
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,620
I'm sorry.

1000
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,620
I'm sorry.

1001
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,620
I'm sorry.

1002
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,620
I'm sorry.

1003
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,620
I'm sorry.

1004
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,620
I'm sorry.

1005
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,620
I'm sorry.

1006
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,620
I'm sorry.

1007
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,620
I'm sorry.

1008
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,620
I'm sorry.

1009
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,620
I'm sorry.

1010
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:04,620
I'm sorry.

1011
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,620
I'm sorry.

1012
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,620
I'm sorry.

1013
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,620
I'm sorry.

1014
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,620
I'm sorry.
