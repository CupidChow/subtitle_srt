1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
As long as I can enter the Ning'an Palace

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,000
and pay all the price

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,400
I will be happy

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,400
The End

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,400
The End

7
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,400
Everything seems to be a dream

8
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,400
I have owe many people

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,400
Chaozhe, help me

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,400
I will be a good person after this

11
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,400
I will be a good person

12
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,400
I will be a good person

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,400
You can't give me something

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
but he

15
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,400
I want to help you

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,400
when you are alive

17
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,400
Everyone has a right to escape

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,400
But I can't

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,400
I want to regret

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,400
and do the wrong thing

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,400
and try my best to return

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,400
Do you believe that everything is decided?

23
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,400
I believe in the future

24
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
Your Highness

25
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,400
Your Highness

26
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,400
The End

27
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,400
Ning'an

28
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,400
What are you doing?

29
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,400
But there is always a pair of hands

30
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,400
that can destroy everything

31
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,400
The revenge is long

32
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Who are you?

33
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
The Emperor of the mortal world

34
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
is so long

35
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,400
and so absurd

36
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,400
So crazy

37
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,120
The light is warm and warm.

38
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,360
It's very considerate.

39
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,960
I welcome you to see the dream of peace.

40
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,760
As you wish.

41
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,400
Zhang Zhe is going to marry my family.

42
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,880
Si Feng is a close friend.

43
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,080
Zhang Zhe is very close to her.

44
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,200
He is more than a courtier.

45
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,400
Xu Qing is also a lover.

46
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,320
I'm grateful to you for your kindness.

47
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,200
I dare not forget.

48
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,760
But the situation is different.

49
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,320
He treat group leaders like farmingYou are good with others.

50
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,320
See the king first.

51
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,720
And鏡頭難撤.

52
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,040
Fortunately, we never give up.

53
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,160
I confide in my love in the summertime.

54
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,920
Toiat to intentionally read this book.

55
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,160
Pray that the work toim follows my love.

56
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,360
I can choose to deserve coaching to die easily.

57
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,240
Zhang Zhe will soon qualify for it.

58
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,960
What she said to you was just like that moon and wind.

59
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,160
But I missed such a good person.

60
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,560
I even almost made a mistake of not being able to meet her. Are you satisfied?

61
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,760
But I do want to ask Miss Jiang Er.

62
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,160
You told me that if I didn't want to accept this marriage, I would wait at home and wait.

63
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,560
You clearly know that Zhang Zhi will be the one to cancel the marriage, right?

64
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,460
What is your relationship with her?

65
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:19,060
You were the one who wanted to cancel the marriage. Now you are the one who regretted it.

66
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:25,460
Instead of being angry with me, you should ask yourself what exactly you want.

67
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,060
I don't know.

68
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,660
She gave her father a divorce. Although she did it to cancel the marriage,

69
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,060
she was afraid that she might have changed.

70
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,460
She was afraid that I might get married to her and suffer with her.

71
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,460
She is a noble and considerate person.

72
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,260
Isn't the most important thing in a girl's family is to marry a noble person?

73
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,860
Wait for someone else. Yao Xi is not suitable for her.

74
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,660
Don't care about others. Go and get Zhang Zhi over here.

75
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,060
Zhang Zhi, help me.

76
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,260
I will be a good person after this. Okay?

77
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,260
Miss Yao, I made a big mistake.

78
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,660
It's hard to get a good response from a lost person.

79
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,460
If you can save Ying Yuan from Mr. Zhang, you will surely be very happy.

80
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,860
You... You really think so?

81
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,260
I didn't stop her from having anything to do with her.

82
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,260
I just can't bear to see the person who regretted it.

83
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,060
Mr. Zhang is a person who is better than anyone in this world.

84
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,660
If you decide, please treat her well.

85
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,260
I... I was wrong about you.

86
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,260
I will write a letter to my father now.

87
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,060
Thank you.

88
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,060
Zhang Zhi, for you,

89
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,860
what right do I have to fight for you?

90
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,260
Your Highness, look. What is this?

91
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,060
Uncle, how did you know that I like this?

92
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,860
I don't know if you and I grew up together.

93
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,260
We will go home and look for it.

94
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,060
It's good that Your Highness likes it.

95
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,260
I heard that you like Mr. Gu Qi's words.

96
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,060
There is a treasure in the house. Your Highness, look.

97
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,660
I also have a good book of red wood.

98
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,660
I also prepared something for you.

99
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,660
Everyone has prepared something.

100
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,260
I'm so happy now.

101
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,660
I will find something for you later.

102
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,660
Thank you, Your Highness.

103
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,460
Miss Jiang Er is not talking.

104
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,460
Is she preparing something special?

105
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,460
I didn't prepare anything.

106
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,660
No way.

107
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,060
No way.

108
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,060
Your Highness, you are so kind to Miss Jiang Er.

109
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,460
You didn't even prepare a gift.

110
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,460
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

111
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,860
Don't say that.

112
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,460
Ning Ning, I know.

113
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,860
I know everything.

114
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,060
What do you know?

115
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,860
There is nothing to prepare for the gift.

116
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,260
You have told me everything about the difficulties at home.

117
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,860
I think you are not good at it.

118
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,460
You must have gone back to suffer.

119
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,860
You misunderstood. I just...

120
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,860
I know. I know everything.

121
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,860
Anyway, you can come and read.

122
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,260
That will be the best gift I have received.

123
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,260
You can take all of these you like.

124
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,860
Don't worry. I will not let you suffer.

125
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,660
So this is the feeling of being a good official?

126
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,060
Why are they still not back?

127
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,060
It's already so late.

128
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,060
If they don't come back, I will go back to sleep.

129
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,460
I'm already sleepy.

130
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,060
Sir, there is news about Cao Yu.

131
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,260
This boat is not a trap.

132
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,060
It's a human.

133
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,060
Do you think who will be the biggest in this boat?

134
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,060
The boat is a private boat.

135
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,060
Of course, the person with the private one is the best.

136
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,060
The private one also has a private one.

137
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,860
In your opinion,

138
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,880
for a yoj و

139
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,460
I am afraid I will have to lie to the spare other person.

140
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,460
Let's go by myself.

141
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,580
Youell...

142
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,580
Here, try one both on the side.

143
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,260
Okay, you are good now.

144
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:21,960
Are they taking the

145
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,460
bikes?

146
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,700
and you are so selfish.

147
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,500
Xue Yuan should know about this.

148
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,420
Go tell Dao Qing

149
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,780
that Wu Biqiang found this man before Xue Yuan.

150
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,220
Let him be our witness.

151
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,460
Don't kill me.

152
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,580
I won't do it again.

153
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,300
Please spare me.

154
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,780
Please spare me.

155
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,020
Here he comes.

156
00:08:59,180 --> 00:08:59,820
Sir.

157
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,420
How is it?

158
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,340
He's caught.

159
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,860
Mr. Guozhu's information

160
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,780
is a secret weapon

161
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,820
that Xue Yuan's subordinate, Si Shou Shang,

162
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,460
has been in trouble lately.

163
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,980
He's been using it to make trouble.

164
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,220
That's why he's in danger.

165
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,340
Xue's family has sent people to kill him.

166
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,860
The killer has been killed by us.

167
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,900
That Si Shou Shang

168
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,260
has been trying to kill Xue Yuan

169
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,260
to save his life.

170
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,220
He's been killed.

171
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,260
It's not a good thing

172
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,260
to know about Xue's family.

173
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,700
No wonder you told them

174
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,900
not to catch him first

175
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,620
but to kill Xue Yuan first.

176
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,580
If you do this,

177
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,580
you'll be caught by

178
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,820
the killer of Xue's family

179
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,060
and be caught by Si Shou Shang.

180
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,780
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

181
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,820
You're so kind.

182
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,140
Is there any news?

183
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,460
Have you found it?

184
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,620
Yes.

185
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,860
But...

186
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,380
Why are you so sad?

187
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,300
Tell me.

188
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,180
Miss You San is in trouble.

189
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,100
She's not in the mansion.

190
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,220
She's just a friend

191
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,140
who has nothing to do with it.

192
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,580
I've never been in contact with her before.

193
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,100
The only thing she's been doing

194
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,580
is to stay in Chongyang.

195
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,980
She's been bullied by the evil.

196
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,140
She was saved by someone.

197
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,300
Saved?

198
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,540
Who?

199
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,100
A few days ago,

200
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,700
I saw Mr. Gu

201
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,780
and Miss Jiang Er

202
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,660
meet up with her.

203
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:10,980
And the person who saved her

204
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,180
was Miss Jiang Er.

205
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,220
So it was the day

206
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,580
when Xue Ning bought the piano.

207
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,620
And she was the one who bought the silk.

208
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,340
Xie Jun,

209
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,340
it's not easy

210
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,900
to find Miss Jiang Er.

211
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,820
What's the relationship between

212
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,900
Xue Ning and the silk merchant?

213
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,780
I haven't found anything.

214
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,540
The witness of this case

215
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,340
is not left to the Ministry of Justice.

216
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,300
The former party of the opposition

217
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,460
has no progress in the Ministry of Justice.

218
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,900
It's time to make some progress.

219
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,860
Otherwise, it won't be safe.

220
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,740
But the matter is about the Xue family.

221
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,340
Do you think Chen Ying will accept it?

222
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,820
Chen Ying is in this position today.

223
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,380
She's a smart person.

224
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,380
She has her own opinion.

225
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,860
Yes.

226
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,780
What about you, Jiang Xue Ning?

227
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,420
Greetings, Mr. Gu.

228
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,180
Greetings, Mr. Gu.

229
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,460
You're my classmates.

230
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,780
Don't give me

231
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,180
more than once.

232
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,500
I'm tired of you.

233
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,500
Please sit down.

234
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,460
Ning Ning, why are you sitting at the back?

235
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,780
I'm a little bit late.

236
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,620
I'm not good at studying.

237
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,500
I'm sitting in front of you.

238
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,860
I'm afraid that you'll get upset.

239
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,420
You called me to leave

240
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,300
and I'm not good at it.

241
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,620
I'm here.

242
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,660
Who wants to take you away?

243
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:44,900
Come.

244
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,780
Uncle, I have something to tell you.

245
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,900
Let Jiang Er sit in my position.

246
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,740
If so,

247
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,140
you'd better be more comfortable with her.

248
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,020
Miss Xue, sit here.

249
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,980
It's better to talk to the princess.

250
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,540
You want to hide in the back and eat snacks?

251
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,660
If you know, I'll punish you.

252
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,580
You Yue,

253
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,340
why don't you give her a seat?

254
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,260
Me?

255
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:35,980
Come.

256
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:36,860
Sit.

257
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,060
Alright.

258
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,340
Let's do it like this.

259
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,380
Hero Hezu

260
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,240
Welcome Mister Guo.

261
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,340
No need to stand by, time to sit.

262
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,580
and never mentioned the documents.

263
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,100
So I'm not interested in the business with the masters.

264
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,860
I won't be attending today.

265
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:29,220
I just want to let you know what the content will be after half a year.

266
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,420
That's indeed the one.

267
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,060
Sir, there's something I don't understand.

268
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,100
Please tell me.

269
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,260
My father once said,

270
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,100
the world is divided by its own bones and its own life.

271
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,380
There's a need for a good reason.

272
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,860
A man is a good person, and a woman is a good person.

273
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,220
The status of a man should not be changed.

274
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,140
The right is that a man should learn.

275
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,740
The students are very beautiful.

276
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,500
The world is divided by its own bones and its own life.

277
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,580
Is it reasonable to teach me to be a woman?

278
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,460
I'm also not sure.

279
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,340
The Empress Dowager was born in Xue family.

280
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,100
When the King of Ping Dan was in trouble,

281
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,780
the Empress Dowager was in the palace.

282
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,140
She was in danger and she was in the capital.

283
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,700
She was in the capital today.

284
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,140
Then I wonder if Miss Xue

285
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:15,860
is the female and the female virtue that the Empress Dowager has.

286
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,820
Or is it the thing in the book?

287
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,660
But my father also said...

288
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,740
Miss Xue, I know that

289
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,180
Han Lin Yuan is a rich man.

290
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,060
He has a low relationship with the Xue family.

291
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:29,020
But remember, this place is not a place for the country.

292
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,540
If Miss Xue doesn't want to learn, she can leave.

293
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,180
What's wrong with Xiaowei?

294
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,620
She suddenly lost to Qi Xue.

295
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,940
Is it because of the Yan family?

296
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:52,020
Miss Ning'er, you have an opinion?

297
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,060
I dare not.

298
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,260
Then what do you want to say?

299
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,780
This is to force me to express

300
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,700
the line between Hua Qing and Xue family.

301
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,020
The student just wants to read it.

302
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,740
The teacher of the county chose the perfect one.

303
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,300
He will write the name of the ancient town.

304
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,420
He knows the history of the world.

305
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,460
He knows the way of life.

306
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,700
He used the two words in this book.

307
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,700
Princess is a phoenix girl.

308
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,300
I am her companion.

309
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,780
I am not a normal girl.

310
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,260
I am not suitable for the language.

311
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,060
I am just a few people.

312
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,060
I am not in a hurry.

313
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,460
Miss Jiang'er, you are too much.

314
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,020
I have no choice.

315
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,540
I can only do it.

316
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,420
I can only do it.

317
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,780
Miss Ning'er, you are so good.

318
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,180
You are very good today.

319
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,220
office

320
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,100
Huh地

321
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,380
Ah Zhu

322
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,100
Ah Zhu

323
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,100
In fact, miss Jiang'er is not bad.

324
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,900
But she is my beams are short.

325
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,900
Do not consider in your heart.

326
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,020
Really short.

327
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,340
I might be wronged.

328
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,700
What's your opinion?

329
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,180
I do not know exactly.

330
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,960
Do you remember what you did

331
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,380
when Miss Jiang'er rejected the formulange식탭?

332
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,400
It has the same bullet as the Shithiş.

333
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,900
He said that it got along with xie氏.

334
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,540
Xie was theiniíemame drummer in the court.

335
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,740
to stand and rest.

336
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,420
A See,

337
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,540
you have taken a long walk in the palace.

338
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,340
You havejas Elementality.

339
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,800
Yet you have taken the

340
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,680
second leave to go to the driveway

341
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,040
of imperial palace.

342
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,980
With your nature,

343
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,820
Zhangkhuan ning is still

344
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,600
investigating between you and Zhang Zhi's engagement.

345
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,200
But they have similar reasons for my change.

346
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,440
By chance,

347
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,820
it would be really complicated.

348
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,800
I wasn't completely lost

349
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,800
It's not something you can do without a long mind.

350
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,000
You must be careful.

351
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,600
Uncle.

352
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,000
Your Highness.

353
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I just thought about it.

354
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,600
I still have something to tell you.

355
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
I came after you.

356
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,000
It's for today.

357
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,800
You've suffered a lot today.

358
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,800
But I didn't think much just now.

359
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,800
I just want you and I to be close.

360
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,000
But Ning Ning might be in the palace at once.

361
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So I...

362
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,600
Your Highness, don't feel guilty.

363
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,400
As long as you're happy.

364
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,200
You're still a big fan of Uncle.

365
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,600
I hope you won't be angry.

366
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
Your Highness, this way please.

367
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,000
Brother Wang.

368
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,000
Brother Wang.

369
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,800
Brother Wang.

370
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,800
Why are you here?

371
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,800
I just went to the palace to greet you.

372
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,600
You just got off school.

373
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,200
Yes.

374
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,600
Let's go.

375
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,800
I'll take you to see my classmates.

376
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,000
No, this is the palace.

377
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,200
It's okay.

378
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,400
There will be a chance to leave.

379
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,600
Let's go.

380
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
Brother Wang.

381
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,800
This is not something you men use.

382
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,000
Which girl?

383
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,600
Don't talk nonsense.

384
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,000
Just tell me.

385
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,200
If you like it, you can't be shy.

386
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,400
I can help you tell Huang Xing.

387
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,200
Don't be so greedy.

388
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm going to leave.

389
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,800
Brother Wang.

390
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,600
Miss Ning.

391
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,400
Please stay.

392
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
What's your address?

393
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,400
I didn't come to class.

394
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,000
I heard someone from Yong Yi's mansion said it was a outbreak.

395
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,000
Why are you sick?

396
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,800
Sir,

397
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,800
I don't know anything about the emperor.

398
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,800
I don't know.

399
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,800
But you went to the mansion first.

400
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,400
You didn't come for long.

401
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,400
The Yan family found the doctor.

402
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,400
You know me and the Yan family?

403
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,200
No.

404
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,600
Zhou Yingzhi is a person from Xue family.

405
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,200
You visited him once.

406
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,000
You talked to him alone in the mansion.

407
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,400
But Xue family didn't have any action.

408
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
So it means

409
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,800
you stopped Zhou Yingzhi from being against the Yan family.

410
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,000
You finally believe me.

411
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Believe it or not,

412
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,400
you still have to see if you are honest.

413
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,800
You have nothing to say to me.

414
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,400
What?

415
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,400
You asked You Fangying to buy Xu Wenyi's life.

416
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,400
It's also for the Yan family.

417
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,000
You even know that?

418
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,400
But I just want Fangying to earn more money.

419
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,000
Her life is too hard.

420
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,000
Actually, I want to know

421
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,800
how you know the price of life and death.

422
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,400
It must be high.

423
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,400
The private father in the capital

424
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,400
was so clever to tell the truth.

425
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,600
But how can he explain it to Xie Wei?

426
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,800
If you want to make a reason,

427
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,600
you can make a little bit of a comparison.

428
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,600
Is it weird?

429
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,200
My father is a nurse.

430
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,200
He is in charge of money.

431
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,200
I am a businessman.

432
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,600
I believe that

433
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,000
the reason is right.

434
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,800
The private father has no father.

435
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,800
If he begs for the money, he will return.

436
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,600
Besides, Yan Lin mentioned it before.

437
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,200
The water is not good in the river.

438
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
I thought that

439
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,400
if something happens,

440
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,200
I will be lucky.

441
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,800
The private father must be powerful.

442
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,200
I just bet on it.

443
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Bet on it?

444
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,800
Should I believe you?

445
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,800
Why do you only believe that

446
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,000
there is a plan in the mortal world?

447
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,000
But you don't believe that there is a real misunderstanding?

448
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,000
Is it because you are used to the defense?

449
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,600
What makes you so stupid?

450
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,400
Is it related to the secret you told me?

451
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,400
I am the chief of the case.

452
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,800
It's useless to talk about these tricks.

453
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,000
I only remind you one thing.

454
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,600
Don't interfere in the matter.

455
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,000
I can find out the money.

456
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,800
I think Wei Bu is not the one who knows.

457
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,800
It's him.

458
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
Go!

459
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,400
Hit him hard!

460
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,820
This is family Wen Fang's son.

461
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,200
Invite him all the way to fight.

462
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,200
You said it was a miscarriage.

463
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
You're new?

464
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,200
No reason.

465
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,200
What a miscarriage.

466
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,200
Do you know that I'll be in the capital today?

467
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
What do you think?

468
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,200
You didn't even take the death in your hand.

469
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,200
I'll take another one.

470
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
I can't hit it.

471
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,200
Lv Zhao Ying,

472
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
can you do anything else?

473
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,200
You've already figured out what the public office is doing.

474
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
I don't know what to do with this kind of work.

475
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,200
No wonder the two of you are the second one.

476
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
No, you...

477
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,200
You're the first one. You can't afford it.

478
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
Why did you make him do it?

479
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
Did you see that?

480
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
The new position of the head of the State of Dingguo

481
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,200
is still not satisfied with the official's office.

482
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
He even killed the person who was involved in the operation

483
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,200
when he was in the operation.

484
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,200
You didn't think that

485
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,200
you were going to do anything?

486
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
Your Majesty.

487
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,200
Your Majesty.

488
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,200
I've never been suspicious of you.

489
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
I don't know what to do with this.

490
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,200
Please give me some time.

491
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,200
I'll find out what's going on.

492
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,200
I've been suspicious of my uncle's loyalty for a long time.

493
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,200
But these years,

494
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,200
Yan family has been guarding the army.

495
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,200
They've been fighting in the court.

496
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,200
I have no close relatives around me.

497
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,200
If my uncle was also found by others,

498
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,200
who else would believe me?

499
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,200
Your Majesty, I know my fault.

500
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,200
This is all my fault.

501
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,200
I was kind and kind to the people who were in charge of this.

502
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
It's not what I mean.

503
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,200
Please rest assured.

504
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,200
I'll find out what's going on.

505
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
I'll give you an explanation.

506
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,200
Forget it.

507
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,200
I'll stop the operation this time.

508
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
I'll show the officials.

509
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
But if there's another time,

510
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
I won't forgive you.

511
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,200
I understand.

512
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,200
I'll take my leave.

513
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,200
I'm sorry.

514
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,200
I should have left earlier.

515
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,200
But I'm sorry.

516
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,200
My son will not forgive me.

517
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,200
I'm sorry.

518
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,200
I will forgive you.

519
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,200
I'm sorry.

520
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,200
I'm sorry.

521
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,200
I'm sorry.

522
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,200
I'm sorry.

523
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,200
I'm sorry.

524
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,200
I'm sorry.

525
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,200
I'm sorry.

526
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,200
Your Majesty is wise.

527
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,200
If you want to suppress this matter,

528
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,200
you must give the Ministry of Justice some respect

529
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,200
and seal their mouths.

530
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,200
In any case,

531
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,200
the Ministry of Justice will take the life and death case to the Palace

532
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,200
and the rest of the people will be added.

533
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,200
Before that, the party's case will no longer be investigated.

534
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,200
We will wait for the officials to close down the case.

535
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,200
Yes.

536
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,200
The Empress Dowager's palace is located there.

537
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,200
It's so strange.

538
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,200
Today, the Empress Dowager said she wanted to see all of you.

539
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,200
There is still a distance from the Empress Dowager's palace.

540
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
Don't play around.

541
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,200
Or you'll miss the time.

542
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,200
Yes, what she said is right.

543
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,200
Let's go.

544
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,200
What's going on?

545
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,200
Your Majesty,

546
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,200
it's been a while since the Empress Dowager punished you.

547
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,200
It can't be.

548
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,200
I said it was a mess.

549
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
Even if you're angry,

550
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
you have to go.

551
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,200
The Ministry of Justice?

552
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,200
His Majesty's decree and the edict have been sealed.

553
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,200
His Majesty has to go through the Ministry of Justice.

554
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,200
How lucky is he?

555
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,200
I saved him before I was at the Imperial Palace.

556
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,200
I was so lucky to save him.

557
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,200
He's so lucky.

558
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,200
How lucky is he?

559
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,200
I saved him before I was at the Imperial Palace.

560
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,200
From now on,

561
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,200
the Ministry of Justice is the most loyal person in the palace.

562
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,200
Life and death are irreversible.

563
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,200
I don't believe that.

564
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,200
He's really a blood-sucking person.

565
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,200
This is the day Shen Jie took the Ministry of Justice.

566
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,200
If I can save him this time,

567
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,200
will I be the one to do it?

568
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,200
You're pretending?

569
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,200
You're talking too much.

570
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,200
You're just so happy.

571
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,200
How about I do it for you?

572
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,200
But Shen Jie was the Prince of Lin.

573
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,200
What's the point of talking?

574
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,200
Your Highness, it's late.

575
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,200
Let's go.

576
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,200
Nian Nian, are you okay?

577
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
Why are you so pale?

578
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,200
Your Highness,

579
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,200
is this how you do it in the palace?

580
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,200
I'm going home.

581
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,200
Don't be afraid.

582
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,200
The eunuch is wrong.

583
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,200
It's good that he's punished.

584
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,200
Let's go.

585
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,200
No.

586
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,200
Your Highness,

587
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,200
I'm thinking that

588
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,200
if I make a mistake in the future,

589
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,200
will I be punished like this?

590
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,200
He's been drunk for so long.

591
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,200
He won't be able to bear to die.

592
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,200
I don't think so.

593
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,200
If you don't know,

594
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,200
the monk in the temple said that my father was a criminal.

595
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,200
If he dies,

596
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,200
he'll definitely find out about me.

597
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,200
I'm so scared.

598
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,200
I know.

599
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,200
Do you knowhesive?

600
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,200
Yeah.

601
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,200
Put the flyingacaks pick the fly drums.

602
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,200
I see.

603
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,200
Go ahead.

604
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,200
I just want to marry the Princess.

605
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,200
What?

606
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,200
I can't make a mistake.

607
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,200
To have my way,

608
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,200
the Princess is full of laughter by herself.

609
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,080
Yes, yes, yes.

610
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,480
Go help her.

611
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,640
Ningning, have you seen it?

612
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,680
I said I would protect you.

613
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,800
I will protect you.

614
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,320
So you won't be afraid.

615
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,920
Thank you, Your Highness.

616
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,280
Your Highness is so kind.

617
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,720
This is enough.

618
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,480
Let's go.

619
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,320
Mother, sister-in-law.

620
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,760
I brought all the servants.

621
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,640
Greetings, Your Highness.

622
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,280
Greetings, Your Highness.

623
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,040
Shu'er is here.

624
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,360
Get up.

625
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,680
Come to aunt's place.

626
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,200
You are so kind.

627
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,600
You just remembered to visit aunt.

628
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,440
I told your father

629
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,640
to let you in.

630
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,160
He said it was not a rule.

631
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,440
But he said it was not a rule.

632
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,720
Did you see your father in the palace

633
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,640
because they heard the imperial edict?

634
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,680
No, you didn't see my father in the palace.

635
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,520
His printed letter looks like a wrong thing.

636
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,720
I haven't seen him in a while.

637
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,640
Why does the letter of imperial edict

638
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,280
look like Jonathan's?

639
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,120
He has nowhere to go.

640
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,800
I can't tell you

641
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,920
except the spray spray from .

642
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:49,960
It smells nice here.

643
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,560
I think it's better for theズ ACE.

644
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,000
There's a good smell there.

645
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,440
Thanks, Your Highness.

646
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,800
Is there something that you don't want me to do?

647
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,000
Don't say so.

648
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,160
I don't want to.

649
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,160
I dare not.

650
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,760
I...

651
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,360
The empress will be a man.

652
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,120
Mother, I have no intention of doing this.

653
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,960
You know what you are doing.

654
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,000
You know it.

655
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,360
Forget it.

656
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,160
His Majesty is sick now.

657
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,320
He can't be with anyone.

658
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,360
You can go back.

659
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,960
I'll take my leave.

660
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:39,000
I'll go

661
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,120
and invite the Godmother to drink hot tea.

662
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,000
Be good.

663
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,360
Zhiyin, come here.

664
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,680
You may all rise.

665
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,160
Yes, ma'am.

666
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,760
You grew up in the Empress Dowager's room.

667
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,960
She can listen to you the most.

668
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,640
Why don't you persuade the Empress Dowager not to be angry?

669
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,440
I understand.

670
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,360
Mother, you always scare me like this.

671
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,320
They are all playing with me at home and studying together.

672
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,000
They are not brave at all.

673
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
If you get sick for them, who will play with me?

674
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,880
I'm just happy all the time.

675
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,600
If I forget to let them get up,

676
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,880
how can I become a servant?

677
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,400
Is this a baby girl?

678
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,480
It's been a long time since I saw her. She has grown up a lot.

679
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,560
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

680
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,680
I heard that

681
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,720
there is a girl named Jiang Xue Ning in this band.

682
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,280
You really like her.

683
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,640
Which one?

684
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,680
Stand out and let me see.

685
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:58,080
I saw Empress Dowager Jiang Xue Ning.

686
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,080
Yan Ye is too much.

687
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,280
She is a real family.

688
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,280
She is not quite a girl.

689
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,680
I was born to be like this.

690
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,480
It's your grandchild.

691
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,880
Empress Dowager, I am lucky to have you.

692
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,680
My parents sent me to the field to grow up.

693
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,480
I am not so good at it. I am not good at it.

694
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,480
Today, I saw Empress Dowager Jiang Xue Ning.

695
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,480
She is so brave and has no mistakes.

696
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,480
I will make a promise to myself in the future.

697
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,680
I will not let you be a servant.

698
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,280
You are so calm.

699
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,480
Forget it. I heard that

700
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,680
you are the one on Yong Yi's mansion, the young prince.

701
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,480
Yong Yi's mansion is not easy to see.

702
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,680
If you are the one on Yong Yi's mansion,

703
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,080
how can you be so calm?

704
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,480
Go back.

705
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,080
Yes.

706
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,080
Aunt, tea is here.

707
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,080
Empress Dowager, Eunuch Liu from the Imperial Household Department is here.

708
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,080
I want to see her.

709
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,680
Let her in.

710
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,080
Yes.

711
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,280
Greetings, Empress Dowager.

712
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,680
Eunuch Liu, what brings you here?

713
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,880
Empress Dowager said that

714
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,880
she broke the jade jade seal.

715
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,680
His Majesty has a good news today.

716
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,080
He is looking for you.

717
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,680
He asked me to find the jade seal

718
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,880
from Qinghai Palace last year

719
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,280
and send it to you.

720
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,280
Where is the man?

721
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,080
Take this jade seal down.

722
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,680
Send it to the Imperial Household Department.

723
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,880
Ask the Yan family.

724
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,080
Your Highness, don't be angry.

725
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,280
I just came to send the jade seal.

726
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,680
How can I be called a jade seal?

727
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,080
Your Highness, I am wronged, Your Highness.

728
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,080
I am wronged.

729
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,480
Your Highness, I am wronged, Your Highness.

730
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,080
I am wronged.

731
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,080
You all go out.

732
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,280
Yes.

733
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,280
Listen up.

734
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,280
Search thoroughly for the evidence.

735
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,280
You can't let go of anything.

736
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,280
Yes.

737
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,280
How is it possible that the Imperial Household Department sent it?

738
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,680
Yes. I also find it strange.

739
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,880
There are some people in the Imperial Household Department

740
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,680
who are not in the same position.

741
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,680
But they haven't sent any message yet.

742
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,680
The 300-star-dark men are also the forbidden ones in the imperial court.

743
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,680
Who could be so bold and angry with Empress Dowager?

744
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,680
What is this for?

745
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,680
What is this for?

746
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,080
The Imperial Household Department is still in the capital.

747
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,480
Due to the deep case,

748
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,280
Shen Lang has stopped the execution of Xue Yuan.

749
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,880
Now that the capital is too peaceful,

750
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,480
he can't be the one to be the one.

751
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,080
Oh, no.

752
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,480
The people he used in the palace must be the one we sold.

753
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,080
If we keep looking,

754
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,680
wouldn't we be able to find out who he is?

755
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,280
Sir.

756
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,480
This is bad.

757
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,480
The imperial court sent a message to let you enter the palace immediately.

758
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,880
Thank you, Your Excellency.

759
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,080
Thank you, Your Excellency.

760
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,480
Please wait for me inside.

761
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,880
The imperial court sent a message to let you enter the palace immediately.

762
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,680
Today, the Imperial Household Department

763
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,280
has someone pretending to be my name

764
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,280
to give this to Empress Dowager.

765
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,080
Empress Dowager is in a hurry to leave.

766
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,280
The people who are in the Imperial Household Department are now going to the capital.

767
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,680
The Imperial Household Department actually has someone who has been involved in the Pingnan King?

768
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,080
Xie Qing's order is the Prince of Pingnan's order.

769
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,880
The 300-star trap is a big money business.

770
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,880
But Prince of Pingnan is a thief.

771
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:48,080
I really didn't expect that someone would do this.

772
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,280
Xie Qing is right.

773
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,680
But how can the Prince of Pingnan

774
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,480
be able to put his hand into the imperial city?

775
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,480
This clearly shows that their province has already been promoted to the palace.

776
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,680
During this period of time, there have been many rebels in the capital.

777
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,480
They are indeed just some small criminals who have been assassinated.

778
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,880
Now it seems that they are just trying to make a living.

779
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,680
They are using the rebels' assassinations to cover their situation in the palace.

780
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,880
No wonder that a few days ago, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Justice

781
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,680
didn't find any results.

782
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,680
So they are just trying to prove it?

783
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,280
That's the truth.

784
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,280
I am indeed very concerned about my old skin.

785
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,880
It is not easy to cure it.

786
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,880
Your Majesty, Prince of Pingnan

787
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,080
is trying to cause a big chaos in the capital. He is trying to make a move on the capital.

788
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:40,080
It is like a case of investigation.

789
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,680
But you cannot investigate it with a lot of effort.

790
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:47,280
Otherwise, the people of Dongyao will be in a mess.

791
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,080
That's right.

792
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,480
I know what to do.

793
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,080
I am very concerned about De Qing.

794
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,680
You should go back and rest.

795
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,680
Lord Xie is here.

796
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,680
Please wait for him inside.

797
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,680
Uncle, are you relieved now?

798
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,680
Yes, I am.

799
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,680
But the Imperial Eunuch of Jinye Huang found out

800
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,480
that the Imperial Eunuch of the Inner Court received the decree of the Empress Dowager.

801
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,480
It was someone who pretended to be the Emperor of the Imperial Palace.

802
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,480
He said that he was the one who was the Emperor of the Imperial Palace.

803
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,280
But someone pretended to be the Emperor of the Imperial Palace.

804
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,880
That means that there must be someone around the Emperor.

805
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,080
There must be someone who is in trouble.

806
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,080
Also, when the Imperial Eunuch of the Inner Court entered the palace,

807
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,080
it was just that Master Xie

808
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,280
suggested that he should be the one to attend the lecture for the Princess.

809
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,880
This matter is very important.

810
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,480
So, the Empress Dowager and the old minister are more cautious.

811
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,280
That's why I think that it is him who is the Master.

812
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,280
I know what Mother is thinking.

813
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,680
But Xie Qing is not in a good mood.

814
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,280
She won't be in trouble.

815
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,480
It's getting late.

816
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,480
The old minister is still in the palace.

817
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,680
You can go back now.

818
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,080
I will take my leave.

819
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,480
Mother.

820
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,480
We have been waiting for more than an hour.

821
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,880
What can't we go back and talk about?

822
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,280
Miss Liu, there is a big event in the palace.

823
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,680
Your Highness the Princess is still here to ask for your opinion.

824
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,680
You two should wait a little longer.

825
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,880
Then how can Sister Xue be in the palace?

826
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,880
We have to kneel here.

827
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,880
I will go to the palace.

828
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,880
I will go to the palace.

829
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,880
I will go to the palace.

830
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,880
I will go to the palace.

831
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,880
I will go to the palace.

832
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,680
We have to kneel here.

833
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,080
They ask about what they want to do.

834
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,280
When is the time?

835
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,880
Just don't say anything.

836
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,080
Aunt, the Empress Dowager is keeping us here.

837
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,880
She is probably in a bad mood.

838
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,280
But the girls are weak.

839
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,880
If she gets sick, I am afraid that the Empress Dowager's wish is hard to fulfill.

840
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,280
Moreover, the Empress Dowager is secretly investigating this matter.

841
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,280
I think she doesn't want to get involved.

842
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,480
Why don't you let me wait for a while?

843
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,080
Okay.

844
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,680
Then you two just wait a while.

845
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,480
Yes.

846
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,280
Your Highness.

847
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,480
It's okay. It's okay.

848
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,280
Your Highness, you finally came.

849
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,280
The Empress Dowager is still waiting for you inside.

850
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,680
Aunt Xu, the night is too cold.

851
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,880
Why don't you let them go back first?

852
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,680
Yes, Aunt Xu.

853
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,280
The capital is in the palace.

854
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,480
Uncle Heng can't leave.

855
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,280
If there is anything, let them pass on their message.

856
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,480
If they are sick, the Empress Dowager will be worried.

857
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,680
Since Your Highness and Miss Xue are talking about it,

858
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,680
you two just go back first.

859
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:25,080
Remember, you must not mention anything to others about today.

860
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,280
Yes.

861
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,480
I will go back to the palace.

862
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,480
I will go back to the palace.

863
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,480
I will go back to the palace.

864
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,480
I will go back to the palace.

865
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,480
I will go back to the palace.

866
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,480
I will go back to the palace.

867
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,480
I will go back to the palace.

868
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,480
I will go back to the palace.

869
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,480
I will go back to the palace.

870
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,480
I will go back to the palace.

871
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,480
I will go back to the palace.

872
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,480
I will go back to the palace.

873
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,480
I will go back to the palace.

874
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,480
I will go back to the palace.

875
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,280
You have come.

876
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:41,280
I am here to exchange the other half of my worth with the share.

877
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,080
I thought I would let go of the memory.

878
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,880
The best choice.

879
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:56,280
I am here to chase after the dream that I cannot open.

880
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:06,780
But any enchantment islaw in on.

881
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,280
I will never forget you

882
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,280
I will never forget you

883
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,280
I will never forget you

884
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,280
I will never forget you

885
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,280
I will never forget you

886
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,280
I will never forget you

887
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,280
I will never forget you

888
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,280
I will never forget you

889
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,280
I will never forget you

890
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,280
I will never forget you

891
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,280
I will never forget you

892
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,280
I will never forget you

893
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,280
I will never forget you

894
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,280
I will never forget you
