1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
As long as I can enter the Ning'an Palace

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,200
and pay all the price

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,600
I will be willing to do my best

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,400
The End

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,800
The End

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,800
Everything seems to be a dream

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,400
I have owed a lot of people

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,800
Chaozhe, help me

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,600
I will be a good person after this

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
The End

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
I will be the one to take the favor

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,800
There are some things you can't give me

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
But what about them?

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,000
The life you chose is for Mr. You

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,400
In this world, everyone has the right to escape

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,000
But I can't

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,000
I want to regret it

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,400
and do the wrong thing

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,200
and try my best to return

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Does Mr. Zhang believe that everything is decided?

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I am more willing to believe in the future

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,000
Your Highness

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,800
Your Highness

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,200
The End

26
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,000
Ning'an, what are you doing?

27
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,000
In the Ming Dynasty

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,600
there was always a pair of hands

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,600
that could break everything

30
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,400
The revenge is long

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,600
Who are you in the end?

32
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,600
The Emperor of the mortal world is so long-winded

33
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,000
and so absurd

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,180
the

35
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,000
You like Zhang Chao

36
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,800
When was the first time Singh 3 know that

37
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,200
I am just a friend to him

38
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Zhang Chao and I are lovers

39
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,800
On the fifth stage of the Z чемt,"WOut,"

40
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,520
The demon is like a dream.

41
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,840
If you are hungry, eat good-hearted bread.

42
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,640
Good-hearted bread.

43
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,600
The demon is like a dream.

44
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,120
The exclusive development patent 9-1

45
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,400
is designed by Dr. Yi.

46
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,240
It's the best.

47
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,640
The demon is like a dream.

48
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,160
The beauty is like a cup of wine.

49
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,200
Use holy treasure.

50
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,040
The holy treasure of the bad guy.

51
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,800
The demon is like a dream.

52
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,040
Thank you, Your Majesty.

53
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,560
I've already pretended to be stupid.

54
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,920
I've already admitted to this mess.

55
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,040
What else do you want?

56
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,760
Speaking of that night,

57
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,600
I heard that after you left Taiyuan Hall,

58
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,960
you met Mr. Xie.

59
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,120
Not only that, I also heard that

60
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,800
the two masters of the Han Lin Academy

61
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,600
have punished you.

62
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,200
It seems that the holy treasure is not needed.

63
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,160
I'm just going to tell you

64
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,760
that I'm going to tell you

65
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,000
that I'm going to tell you

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,320
that I'm going to tell you

67
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,520
that I'm going to tell you

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,440
that I'm going to kill Xie Wei.

69
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,600
And we're also

70
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,720
a couple of gods.

71
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,080
If Shen Lang finds out

72
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,800
that he's a bad guy,

73
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,680
both Yan and I will be in trouble.

74
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,120
In fact, I also think

75
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,320
Mr. Xie is a little different from me.

76
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,400
Oh, how is it?

77
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,040
He and his father are good friends.

78
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,200
We met at home before.

79
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,360
But I don't know why

80
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,320
after entering the palace,

81
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,360
it seems to be even more different.

82
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,440
Do you know that

83
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,520
Mr. Xie let me learn the chess alone?

84
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,640
It's so bad.

85
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,720
Why are you laughing at me?

86
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,840
I'm just going to tell you this

87
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,040
to the Holy One.

88
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,520
I can't let others know.

89
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,760
Forget it.

90
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,080
Don't think too much.

91
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,640
Since you're here to study,

92
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,680
you should put your heart

93
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,880
into the study.

94
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,840
Did you hear that?

95
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,680
Yes.

96
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,480
I'll teach you.

97
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,600
You can leave now.

98
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,320
Beauty is beauty.

99
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,720
It's just a character.

100
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,040
It's just a character.

101
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,320
It's really a child's play.

102
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,120
If it weren't for Xie Qing,

103
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,320
he wouldn't have been able to

104
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,320
get married in time.

105
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,320
It's said that Shen Lang is very suspicious.

106
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,720
I'm just pretending to be stupid.

107
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,480
It's a bit too much.

108
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,920
Although the palace maid is dead,

109
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,520
the bloodshed won't stop because of this.

110
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,520
We have to face the danger first.

111
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,920
Tell her to listen to you.

112
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,120
Xie Jue,

113
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,920
you owe me this time.

114
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,120
You have to pay me back.

115
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,920
Qi...

116
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,320
He's really a skillful man.

117
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,320
Yes.

118
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,720
You're really going to marry Yao?

119
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
Yes.

120
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,720
I've already retired from my wedding.

121
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,120
I'll ask someone to send my

122
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,320
engagement gift back to me

123
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,720
in a few days.

124
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,720
It's a skillful and elegant skill.

125
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,720
You're a skillful man.

126
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
Are you crazy or stupid?

127
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,520
My lord,

128
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,520
this is a personal matter.

129
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,520
Don't follow me.

130
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,120
It's not because you've already

131
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,520
offended the new five.

132
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,920
Now, it's your chance to

133
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,520
reward you for your efforts.

134
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,520
We have many people here.

135
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,520
You're all in the hands of Mr. Yao.

136
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,520
If you offend him,

137
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,520
it's hard to get married again.

138
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,520
I came here by chance.

139
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,520
I can't be a high official and

140
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,520
a candidate.

141
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,520
If I can't be a good official,

142
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,520
I'll go back to the county of the old house

143
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
and be a good official.

144
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,520
My lord,

145
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,520
last time you and I were in a bad relationship.

146
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,520
You just listen to me.

147
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,520
Jiang Zhe, stop right there.

148
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,520
You...

149
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,520
You're so stubborn.

150
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,520
You're so stubborn.

151
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,520
Why are you always running around?

152
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,520
You quit your business.

153
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,520
What business?

154
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,520
I'm always busy with business.

155
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,520
I've just got a few good money.

156
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,520
He took all of them away.

157
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,520
I'll have to take them back today.

158
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,520
Da Qin,

159
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,520
why don't you find a job in the city?

160
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,520
Any news?

161
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,520
No.

162
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,520
Can you hurry up?

163
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,520
Hurry up.

164
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
Mr. Chen,

165
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,520
why are you here?

166
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,520
Mr. Xie is inside.

167
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,520
I have something important to ask you to give me.

168
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,520
Come in.

169
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,520
What's wrong?

170
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,520
Someone is falling into the jails.

171
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,520
crabs.

172
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,420
crabs.

173
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,420
It's anotherssssssssssss-

174
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,420
a drunk man and allowed to nächstenssssess.

175
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,520
Not allowed to say shit, bro.

176
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,520
I told you to pass by.

177
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,520
You stop,

178
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,520
stop.

179
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,520
Hey,

180
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,340
you stop.

181
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,280
You stop.

182
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,280
I'm grateful for your help.

183
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,280
But I have to remind you.

184
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,280
Do you know how Zhang Zhe is in the White Mountain?

185
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,280
How did he get into the court?

186
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,280
I didn't ask other things about Li Kao.

187
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,280
Zhang Zhe has his own family.

188
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,280
He gave up on Kekao to stop him from taking care of his mother.

189
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,280
He turned to Li Kao.

190
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,280
Li Kao is not a official official.

191
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,280
He is a good man.

192
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,280
But Gu Chunfang, a spy in the north,

193
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,280
he is a good man.

194
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,280
He gave his opinion to the court.

195
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,280
Gu Chunfang is not only a good person,

196
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,280
but also a good person for his father.

197
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,280
This is not a big deal.

198
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,280
You have been investigating Zhang Zhe.

199
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
You are so meaningful.

200
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,280
He has been a spy for many years.

201
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,280
He has to return to the capital in a day.

202
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,280
He has been a spy for many years.

203
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,280
Does His Majesty have any intention to let him go?

204
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,280
Mr. Xie is so weak.

205
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,280
He is as good as a leader.

206
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,280
He is so good at walking and closing.

207
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,280
Mr. Chen, you are serious.

208
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,280
I'm just curious about you.

209
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,280
If you have any news about him,

210
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,280
please tell him to have something to do with him.

211
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,280
Don't worry, sir.

212
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,280
I will do my best to help you.

213
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,280
Miss.

214
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Miss.

215
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,280
Miss, you are finally back.

216
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,280
What's wrong?

217
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,280
Did someone bully you?

218
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,280
This morning,

219
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,280
the palace sent many people to come here.

220
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,280
The master asked someone to come to check on you.

221
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,280
You were wronged in the palace.

222
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,280
I was just worried about you.

223
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,280
I'm back safely.

224
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,280
Let's go to ask father for his good news.

225
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,280
Don't worry about him.

226
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,280
I saw father and mother.

227
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,280
I want to ask for your good news.

228
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,280
It's good that you are back.

229
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,280
What's going on in the palace?

230
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,280
Tell father and mother.

231
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,280
You are so big.

232
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,280
You should know your family first.

233
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,280
Do you know how worried I and your sister are?

234
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,280
I don't understand.

235
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,280
There are so many people in the palace.

236
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,280
Why are you in trouble?

237
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,280
You should ask him

238
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,280
what he did.

239
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,280
Okay, I will ask him.

240
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,280
I will tell him.

241
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,280
You didn't agree to enter the palace.

242
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,280
You are so stubborn.

243
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,280
You will only make trouble.

244
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,280
You are so bold.

245
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,280
Look, something happened.

246
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,280
Are you afraid?

247
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,280
I often give you the rules

248
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,280
to keep your family safe.

249
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,280
What about you?

250
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,280
You will only be Er Pongfeng.

251
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,280
I will tell you,

252
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,280
can you risk your life

253
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,280
to make the whole family worry about you?

254
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,280
You are so stubborn.

255
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,280
In mother's eyes,

256
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,280
it's all my fault.

257
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,280
You always make me worry.

258
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,280
You talk to mother like this?

259
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,280
What's your attitude?

260
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,280
Stop it.

261
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,280
Okay, Nian.

262
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,280
You just came back from the palace.

263
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,280
You must be tired.

264
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,280
Go back to your room and rest.

265
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,280
Come on, send your sister back to rest.

266
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,280
Look at him.

267
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,280
Look at him.

268
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,280
What's he like?

269
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,280
Stop it.

270
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,280
Stop talking.

271
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,280
Look at them.

272
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,280
Are they cats and mice?

273
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,280
Or tigers and pigs?

274
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,280
We must eat one before we finish.

275
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,280
Mother.

276
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,280
You are here.

277
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,280
What's wrong?

278
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,280
Are you still angry?

279
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,280
I heard a saying.

280
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,280
Love is deep,

281
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,280
and it's a sin.

282
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,280
I don't understand

283
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,280
what you mean.

284
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,280
Can you please tell me?

285
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
You are

286
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,280
so stubborn now.

287
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,280
You are talking to me.

288
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,280
Mother.

289
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,280
Actually,

290
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,280
we all know

291
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,280
what's going on in the palace.

292
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,280
We didn't see it for real.

293
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,280
It's not necessarily

294
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,280
your sister's fault.

295
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,280
I know

296
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,280
it's not her fault.

297
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,280
But don't forget.

298
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,280
It's in the palace.

299
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,280
What's the place?

300
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
It's where you put your head

301
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,280
on the waistband.

302
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,280
You can't keep it

303
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,280
until you are sick.

304
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,280
But look at his temper.

305
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,280
If he has

306
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,280
your half of the rules

307
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,280
and the status,

308
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,280
I won't be like this.

309
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,280
Actually,

310
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,280
your sister is old.

311
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,280
She is also in the palace.

312
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,280
I think

313
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,280
you should be more at ease.

314
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,280
Since you are old,

315
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,280
you should be more at ease.

316
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,280
Come.

317
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,280
Look at your sister.

318
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,280
She is already old.

319
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,280
It's time to

320
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,280
raise the marriage.

321
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,280
But look at his temper.

322
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,280
I'm so ugly.

323
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,280
What kind of person

324
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,280
will you ask for her?

325
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,280
Don't worry, mother.

326
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,280
Father is a good friend in the court.

327
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,280
He will look after you

328
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,280
as a good sister.

329
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,280
Don't worry.

330
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,280
Alright.

331
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,280
Let's not talk about him.

332
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,280
Let's talk about you.

333
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,280
You should

334
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,280
seek a good person

335
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,280
with your own conditions.

336
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,280
That's definitely not a problem.

337
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,280
But now,

338
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,280
you will be affected by your sister.

339
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,280
How can I be good?

340
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,280
I can't.

341
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,280
You are destined to be a good girl.

342
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,280
I want you to be my brother.

343
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,280
Since we're married,

344
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,280
IESSI fight against memories more.

345
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,280
Your Motor has been broken stability.

346
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,280
My brother

347
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,640
has never been so calm

348
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,080
as he was once when he was not young.

349
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,280
Take our family.

350
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,280
Take everybody.

351
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,040
See how my world is upside down.

352
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,040
Save yourself.

353
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Don't come too soon.

354
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,880
I'm coming over some things.

355
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,240
You are already after05 millions

356
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,120
I don't need to clear that water off.

357
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,680
Don't spare me.

358
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,480
Stop achieve.

359
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,600
Master,

360
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,200
Father.

361
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,400
I knew you would come to me.

362
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:07,800
Come on.

363
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,520
Goodbye.

364
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:20,760
Good.

365
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,040
Good.

366
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,000
Father is worried about

367
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,720
the relationship between Jiangjia and the Yan family.

368
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,800
The case of the Nian Palace

369
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,680
is indeed that Empress Dowager Xue

370
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,920
wanted to pass on her daughter

371
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,720
and take the blame to the Yan family.

372
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,640
But luckily,

373
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,880
Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Justice

374
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,640
has already cleared the suspicion for my daughter.

375
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,080
The matter in the palace has been settled.

376
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,800
But a few days ago,

377
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,720
something happened to Marquis Yongyi's manor.

378
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,880
Have you heard about it in the palace?

379
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,400
The sword of a daughter

380
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,800
may not know the Marquis's injury,

381
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,440
but the Xue family was searched at night.

382
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,040
That shows that the relationship between the two families

383
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,880
is already at the brink of fire.

384
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,280
The sword of a daughter has grown up in the palace.

385
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,480
The sword is the pillar of the sword.

386
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,920
There is no need to say anything.

387
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,120
The news of the Yan family

388
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,560
has been accumulated for 20 years.

389
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,800
They are willing to give it up.

390
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,520
I'm afraid it's hard to explain.

391
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,640
Moreover, there is...

392
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,640
Father wants to say

393
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,200
about Consort Ding's son.

394
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,520
I heard about the rumors about the 300-cent soul.

395
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,920
They said that the two families

396
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,440
had broken up after this.

397
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,160
But I always think

398
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,240
many details are not reasonable.

399
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,680
Father knows about that time?

400
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,600
That time,

401
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,040
Prince of Pingnan

402
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,760
was in danger

403
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,280
and was killed in the palace.

404
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,120
Many things are

405
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,680
sent out from the mouth of the only one who exists.

406
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,040
You know that

407
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,880
there are many suspicious things in this world.

408
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,600
Later,

409
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,680
the evil spread the evil.

410
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,200
They have made the truth

411
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,400
and the rumors

412
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,000
a real and fake.

413
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,040
What we can see is

414
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,760
the late emperor was killed by the disease.

415
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,680
The right emperor ascended the throne

416
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,920
and the Empress Dowager was implicated.

417
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,160
He was convinced by the evil.

418
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,440
Until the first marriage of the first few years,

419
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,400
the emperor was in a trance.

420
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,760
And these are the facts

421
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,440
that we can see with our eyes.

422
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,000
Now the Xue family is in a trance.

423
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,840
Is it really true

424
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,440
that there is no solution?

425
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,280
It's true our family starting to surpass Bleكh1.

426
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,280
Cheng ui!

427
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,640
Don't worry I won't tell you

428
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,080
if I tell that.

429
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,760
It's a pity that

430
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,060
Mr. Zhou 我是

431
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,680
I think

432
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,200
totally wrong su Phew

433
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,120
Don't love such a shadow

434
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,320
as in your previous days

435
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,780
everything in Hangzhou

436
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,980
I'm afraid that this marriage won't work out.

437
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,380
I'm afraid that you won't be able to think of it.

438
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,580
I'm afraid that you'll feel sad.

439
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,380
But I promise you,

440
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,180
if you're willing,

441
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,180
I will definitely learn another marriage for you.

442
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,980
I won't be able to take back my own maid.

443
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,380
In the future, no matter what happens,

444
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,180
I won't even be able to have you in my arms.

445
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,580
Father, don't worry.

446
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,580
I have only friends in Yanling.

447
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,780
I won't be able to have you in my arms.

448
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,980
I won't be willing to marry you for this matter.

449
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,780
I'm willing to beg you, Father.

450
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,980
I have a favor to ask of you in Yanling.

451
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,580
If you are in trouble,

452
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,780
I will also do whatever I can to help you.

453
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,580
I will definitely not be able to get you in my arms.

454
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,380
I hope that you will promise me that you won't be able to love me.

455
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,180
Okay.

456
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,380
Okay.

457
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,180
I thought you were still that little girl with no heart and no heart.

458
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,780
I didn't expect that you have become so wise now.

459
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,980
And you know how to repay your kindness.

460
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,180
I really am very happy.

461
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,580
I promise you.

462
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,780
If there is a chance in this court,

463
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,980
I will choose to stand at the Yan family's side.

464
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,980
Father.

465
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,580
Father.

466
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,580
Who is it?

467
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,380
There. Chase them!

468
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,580
Yes! Chase them!

469
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,380
Father.

470
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,980
Father.

471
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,980
I love the Heavens and the Heavens.

472
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,380
Guards, enter the palace.

473
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,980
Yes!

474
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,380
Greetings, Your Majesty.

475
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,580
Duke.

476
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,180
Xie Qing, look at this.

477
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,980
Duke Ding received a secret report today.

478
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,980
Someone has submitted a letter to Prince Yong Yi and Prince Ping Nan.

479
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:48,980
Xie Qing thought how to get rid of the crime of betraying the country.

480
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,580
I thought that the letter was not clear.

481
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,980
But according to the letter,

482
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,580
someone was just asking Prince Ping Nan about the fact that the Xue family wanted the prince.

483
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:01,180
There was no evidence of the Yan family's hard faith and no evidence of the betraying the country.

484
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,180
It was not a fact.

485
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,580
If someone is suspicious,

486
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,780
the letter is written by Duke Ding.

487
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,780
It's not a fake.

488
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,780
You suspect that Duke Ding's mansion is a spy?

489
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,380
No.

490
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,980
I suspect that Duke Ding's mansion is a spy.

491
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:24,380
I still suspect that I am going to be framed by the Yan family.

492
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,780
The center of the country is the secret of the world.

493
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,780
What I mean is,

494
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,980
since the letter has a superior version,

495
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,980
there will be a lower version.

496
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,980
Why don't you give me more time to search?

497
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,380
When I find the lower version, I will be able to get the letter from Duke Yong Yi.

498
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,980
Or, if the Marquis Yan is in trouble, I will make the crime of the Yan family.

499
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,980
The Yan family's ambition is to take over the people.

500
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,380
What evidence do you need?

501
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,180
Your Majesty, the rebellion has been going on for many years.

502
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,380
There is no progress until now.

503
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,980
And now, the palace is in a mess because of Yu Ruyi.

504
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,780
Isn't that right? It means that the rebellion has been going on.

505
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,580
The Yan family is in the palace.

506
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,980
If we continue to drag on like this, I am afraid that we will be in a big trouble.

507
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,380
Your Majesty, you have been waiting for 20 years.

508
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,780
You don't need to worry about it for a few months.

509
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,980
What else do you want to wait for?

510
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:22,580
If the Yan army is waiting for the Yan army to join the Pingnan Army and attack the capital together,

511
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,580
then everything will be late.

512
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,180
Okay.

513
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,580
Xie Qing is right.

514
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:34,180
The important thing is that we need a clear reason.

515
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,980
But the time is over. I can't let it go.

516
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,380
From now on, the Yan family will be in the palace.

517
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,780
We need to cooperate with the new Wuwei investigation.

518
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,580
Until the day the truth is revealed,

519
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,980
we can't have a private threat.

520
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:51,780
Uncle, you must find the letter of the letter to the rest of the people.

521
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,780
Search this matter thoroughly.

522
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,780
I will stop it.

523
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,580
Xie Qing, what are you doing at the second half of the night?

524
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,380
The Yan army is coming.

525
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,580
We need to look into the situation.

526
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,980
The Yan family colluded with the Pingnan King to attack.

527
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,780
We need to cooperate with the new Wuwei investigation.

528
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,380
You go and look for father first.

529
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,780
Don't let this matter bother him.

530
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,180
Tell me more.

531
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,580
Yes.

532
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,380
What are you still talking about?

533
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,380
Hurry and tell the Yan family to get out of here.

534
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,780
I want to go in and search.

535
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,980
Young Master Xue,

536
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,780
the order of His Majesty is just to let the Yan family cooperate with the investigation.

537
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:58,180
It's not that the Yan family's crime is not decided.

538
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,780
It's just that the Yan family's crime is not decided.

539
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,780
It's just that the Yan family's crime is not decided.

540
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,780
I will go and search.

541
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,780
I will go and search.

542
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,380
Young Master.

543
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,740
Stop it.

544
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:22,080
Are you going to give whatever if I吉 birthday presents?

545
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,080
Tawny,

546
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,780
look at that.

547
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,440
Before this,

548
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,800
I will speak a thousand хар medieval selling and

549
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,480
it to persuade others to kill Bed stall

550
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,620
Give me your watch

551
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,740
A snake can also escape

552
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,900
Everything right

553
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,500
Well, why do you suddenly insecurity our situation

554
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,840
If we follow you around for long

555
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,820
You might lose track

556
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,460
practice and fight

557
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,500
We are in the same boat.

558
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,140
Mr. Zhang,

559
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,420
can you say something?

560
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,100
The case of the Zhao-Mozhi case

561
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,700
is nothing to do with me.

562
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,620
What?

563
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,020
I didn't hear from His Majesty

564
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,860
that Yan's family is in the same boat.

565
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,980
It's not a good news.

566
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,820
Besides, you finally

567
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,580
got the imperial edict today.

568
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,020
You have a lot of attempts.

569
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,980
Don't bother with these things.

570
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,900
How can that be?

571
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,260
The court has decided

572
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:27,940
whether you are going to

573
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,980
file a case against the people.

574
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,820
Mr. Zhang,

575
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,740
it's not His Majesty's fault.

576
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,740
It seems that

577
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,140
you are not satisfied with the imperial edict.

578
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,420
Mr. Yao,

579
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,460
we just

580
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,100
have a few more talks for the imperial edict.

581
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,300
You have a lot of people.

582
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,500
Don't be so weird.

583
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,980
I only know

584
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,700
what the company is like.

585
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,540
Mr. Zhang,

586
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,820
you are talented.

587
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,220
But if you really want to

588
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,420
be a real agent in the court,

589
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,500
I'm afraid you need to practice more.

590
00:25:59,220 --> 00:25:59,980
Yes, yes, yes.

591
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,500
He is always so professional.

592
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,540
I don't know how many people he has offended.

593
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,260
Last time,

594
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,500
His Majesty was in a difficult position.

595
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,900
Thanks to you for taking care of him,

596
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,980
we are not afraid to be in trouble.

597
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,860
Am I right, Mr. Zhang?

598
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,660
Yes, yes.

599
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,180
Thank you.

600
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,260
Thank you.

601
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,020
No need.

602
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,860
Look at you.

603
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,380
What a good marriage.

604
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,820
What a good official disciple.

605
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,220
You have to take the blame,

606
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:34,940
right?

607
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,660
I did it on my own.

608
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,260
I'm here to do it for my own good.

609
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,940
I will continue to pursue the case.

610
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,620
As for the private matter,

611
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,580
please don't mention it, Mr. Chen.

612
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,380
It will ruin the reputation of the female family.

613
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,940
Okay, I'll do it.

614
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,420
What are you looking at?

615
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,060
Zhang Zhong.

616
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:58,740
A letter?

617
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,460
Where did you get the letter?

618
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,980
Isn't it from Xue's family?

619
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,740
No.

620
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,740
Until now,

621
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,460
I didn't cut off His Lordship's seal.

622
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,740
That letter was sent by someone

623
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,540
to the Palace of Palace construction.

624
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,620
As for the person behind it,

625
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,420
even the Palace of Palace doesn't know.

626
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,220
If you didn't investigate it before,

627
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,740
Lord Yan did pass the letter to Prince Pingnan.

628
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,900
Then this letter

629
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,380
will be from Nidang.

630
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,340
Yes, I think so.

631
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,100
It's useless to say anything now.

632
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,380
Someone is going to stir up the capital's water

633
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,980
and it's hard to find a place.

634
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,420
Lord Yan is currently cultivating.

635
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,340
If the new position is difficult,

636
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,180
I'm afraid that he will be in trouble.

637
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,340
Do you have any idea?

638
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,340
Lord Zhou.

639
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:43,820
Since ancient times,

640
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,060
people who have been wandering around

641
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,740
will not have a good place.

642
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,420
The more you go to my ship,

643
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,700
the more you should go to the bottom.

644
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,420
Can you still make it

645
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,420
if you don't rely on Xue's family now?

646
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,540
Miss, you're too much.

647
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,100
We are just a ship.

648
00:27:59,140 --> 00:27:59,940
You're too old.

649
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,340
I'm the one who's talking.

650
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,540
But the reason why this award

651
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,300
can still be held in Zhaizhou

652
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,340
is because this award

653
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,300
didn't get a promotion.

654
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,700
Since the investigation of the Houfu,

655
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,300
the Palace of Palace has been very busy.

656
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,220
If I don't get any more

657
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,180
reliable news,

658
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,900
the Palace will definitely suspect me.

659
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,980
If I treat a suspicious person as a useless person,

660
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,300
the Palace will not only resign,

661
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,780
but also resign.

662
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,860
If I lose this award,

663
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,780
who will I replace?

664
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,060
What you mean is,

665
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,140
if I lose the award,

666
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,820
the ship will also be taken to the bottom.

667
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,860
Without you,

668
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,060
I won't be able to control

669
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,460
the next one.

670
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,020
Miss, you're too serious.

671
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,380
I didn't mean that.

672
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,740
Then tell me directly.

673
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,540
What are you going to do?

674
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,660
From now on,

675
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,980
I will tell you

676
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,100
about the news of the investigation of the Houfu.

677
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,700
I will tell you

678
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,940
that the Palace of Palace

679
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:51,860
will also be held in the same way.

680
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,900
Shall I tell the news of Eight Gang?

681
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,020
I'm moving out of variousachteons.

682
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:56,980
Don't worry.

683
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,140
Mr. Zhou,

684
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,340
I heard that one with a costume set

685
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:04,900
at the game scene,

686
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,460
that we are strict with attention.

687
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,660
The one who have the most likes

688
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,660
should be you.

689
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,380
I admit that

690
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,740
Zhou Hongzhi was一定

691
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,900
with the Mash Star.

692
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,740
But I'm afraid

693
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,020
I'm not yet able to

694
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,820
be a Tracker.

695
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,660
I will definitely give you my word.

696
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:28,660
Then, I will ask Lord Zhou to remember your promise.

697
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,660
Zhou Ying Zhi.

698
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,860
Don't let me down this time.

699
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,060
astes very disease are everywhere.

700
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,860
What are you thinking?

701
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,500
it could make more sense than human smartphones.

702
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,060
Do you think it banned use

703
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,780
of new phone strings?

704
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,140
Hey.

705
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,060
Where did you find this confession key?

706
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,460
Have you taken this as a good Management Exam?

707
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,020
You...

708
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,580
I don't have it.

709
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,580
I have 400 taels of silver.

710
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,580
I have 300 taels of silver.

711
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,580
So little?

712
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,580
How much can you pay

713
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,580
to buy these?

714
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,580
What are you talking about?

715
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,580
How can a girl with a big family

716
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,580
have a treasure?

717
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,580
Besides,

718
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,580
these are mostly from Master and Madam.

719
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,580
Or from the Yan's son.

720
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,580
Even if they are taken out,

721
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,580
no one will take them out.

722
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,580
What kind of man are you?

723
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,580
Maybe you can ask Master

724
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,580
to take care of them.

725
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,580
It's not the time to be shocked.

726
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,580
How about this?

727
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,580
Tang'er,

728
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,580
go to the mansion

729
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,580
and give some money

730
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,580
to the little silk from the back door.

731
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,580
Ask Fang Ying to bring a letter.

732
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,580
I'll wait for her at the inn.

733
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,580
Master, you are not drunk.

734
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,580
Go to sleep.

735
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,580
I'll go to work later.

736
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,580
No need.

737
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,580
Go tell Chen Ying

738
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,580
to let her arrange for a meeting

739
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,580
at the inn.

740
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,580
I want to meet Zhangzhe.

741
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,580
Yes.

742
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,580
Go.

743
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,580
I'll go to see Zhangzhe.

744
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,580
Yes.

745
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,580
Go.

746
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,580
Go.

747
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,580
Go.

748
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,580
Go.

749
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,580
Go.

750
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,580
Go.

751
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,580
Go.

752
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,580
Go.

753
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,580
Go.

754
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,580
Go.

755
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,580
Go.

756
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,580
Go.

757
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,580
Go.

758
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,580
Go.

759
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,580
Go.

760
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,580
Go.

761
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,580
See them knocked on both лoseYu嵆's steps.

762
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,580
Go.

763
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,200
Hai zabang

764
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,140
Imperial Imperial Inspector

765
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:57,580
Yeah.

766
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,580
Right.

767
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,580
It's not下落 on the other side of the城.

768
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,580
We've searched the town

769
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,580
we kept briefly.

770
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,580
I think the inside lok is black.

771
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,580
Excellent.

772
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,740
Then,

773
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,580
go and search on the wall over the stream.

774
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,880
It could happened that

775
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,580
he can easily leave

776
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,580
because of the lack of violence.

777
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,580
Yes.

778
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,580
Ni'er,

779
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,580
do you know

780
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,580
what's happened to Ni'er?

781
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,580
Great.

782
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,780
Yesterday,

783
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,500
we came back home

784
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,060
He knows everything about me.

785
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,580
Tell the doorkeeper

786
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,220
not to do anything to me.

787
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,220
Yes.

788
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,420
Four hundred taels of gold

789
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,980
is just one thousand and six hundred taels.

790
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,020
You even took the gold

791
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,300
and saved two thousand taels.

792
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,980
Where did these two thousand and five hundred taels come from?

793
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,620
The seller only earned one thousand and six hundred taels.

794
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,900
After selling the silk,

795
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,180
Boss Xu will win again no matter what.

796
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,140
So...

797
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,580
Xu Wenyi gave you money?

798
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,900
Boss Xu was afraid that I would be out of business

799
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,740
and only gave me three percent of the silk in his hand.

800
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,860
The rest

801
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,700
he sold to a man named Lv last year.

802
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,540
The man named Lv?

803
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,060
Then the price of the silk price

804
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,220
and the silk in his hometown

805
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,180
were sold out.

806
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,300
He earned a lot of money.

807
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,140
He and the talent department are very happy.

808
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,740
At first,

809
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,540
he was going to give me another thousand taels.

810
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,380
But I

811
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,580
made a good deal of money.

812
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,260
In the end, I agreed to give only five hundred taels.

813
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,780
Actually, what they want to thank are all you, Miss.

814
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,620
You are very good now.

815
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,740
But

816
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,260
you told Xu Wenyi and the private meeting?

817
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,980
When I first went there,

818
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,980
I didn't understand anything.

819
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,140
I told him.

820
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,340
But don't worry.

821
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,740
I didn't mention your identity.

822
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,020
They asked who you are.

823
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,460
I didn't tell him a word.

824
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,340
You asked Liu Fangying to buy Xu Wenyi's silk.

825
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,900
It's also for the Yan family.

826
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,300
And I want to know more.

827
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,820
Why do you believe

828
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,900
that the price of the silk

829
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,900
will be high?

830
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,140
Is he that kind of person?

831
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,340
You just said

832
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,660
what is the name of the person

833
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,740
who bought the silk with Xu Wenyi?

834
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:07,740
Lv Xian.

835
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:08,780
Lv Xian.

836
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,660
That man is Lv Xian.

837
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,500
He is a partner of the department.

838
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,540
Miss,

839
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,220
did I break into your house?

840
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,140
It's true that

841
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,620
this kind of news will spread out.

842
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,340
But this time,

843
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,700
he only knew it.

844
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:25,900
He?

845
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,740
Nothing.

846
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,540
It's over.

847
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,660
The 500 taels of silver

848
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,940
is your capital.

849
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,100
We have half the money left.

850
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,340
This is 1500 taels.

851
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,260
Take it.

852
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,980
What are you doing?

853
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,500
Fangying is so stupid.

854
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,300
She doesn't dare to bother you.

855
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,740
She is just thinking about the way

856
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,700
to earn money.

857
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,100
Even if she wants to break into my house,

858
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,420
I will never dare to take the money.

859
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,300
Where are you going?

860
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,660
I gave you money

861
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,980
to make you live in the family.

862
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,260
You will be returning to your home in a few days.

863
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,620
If you don't have more money,

864
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,220
I'm afraid you won't come out to see me.

865
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,260
Then,

866
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,900
I'll take back

867
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,580
the remaining money.

868
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,820
How can you do that?

869
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,340
Then you are even going to lose your capital.

870
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:17,980
Take it.

871
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,260
I'm also a girl.

872
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,620
Next time,

873
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,500
I will study harder next time.

874
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,060
I will make a lot of money for you.

875
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,420
Silly girl.

876
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,700
Fangying,

877
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,300
I don't agree with your fake lesson.

878
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,540
This time,

879
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,820
I indeed met a thing

880
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,060
that needs to be used urgently.

881
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,060
But this thing

882
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,820
can't be settled in a few days.

883
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,140
I asked you to come today

884
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,380
to ask you to help me

885
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,700
make another batch of pulse.

886
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,020
Are you willing?

887
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,620
But this time,

888
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,180
can you tell me about the pulse?

889
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,420
I will study with the boss for 19 years.

890
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,380
Or

891
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,460
can you help me to help you?

892
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,340
Anyone here?

893
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,260
Hello.

894
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,820
My dad.

895
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:21,860
Now,

896
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,340
the harshest case caused in our country

897
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,580
is even more challenging.

898
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,100
Mummy.

899
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:44,780
Take it.

900
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,820
I don't mind.

901
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,820
I hope you can...

902
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,820
Shut up!

903
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,820
Open your eyes and take a good look.

904
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,820
This is the marriage certificate that Zhang Jia gave back.

905
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,820
Now, he has returned all the documents.

906
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,820
Retreat?

907
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,820
How is that possible?

908
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,820
How is that possible?

909
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,820
Tell me.

910
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,820
What have you said in the palace?

911
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,820
What have you done?

912
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,820
You actually want to ruin the reputation of the Qingyue people.

913
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,820
You are so big.

914
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,820
I taught you nothing.

915
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,820
You are out of education.

916
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,820
It's not me.

917
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,820
What you did,

918
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,820
Mr. Zhang has known it for a long time.

919
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,820
It's just that he is worried about your face.

920
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,820
And he never said anything about you.

921
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,820
I learned this from others.

922
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,820
How can you do such a stupid thing?

923
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,820
Zhang Zhe is so stubborn.

924
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,820
I did lose my patience to him.

925
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,820
I should not have done that.

926
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,820
Father.

927
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,820
Don't call me father.

928
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:52,820
I have lost my face in the family.

929
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,820
Father.

930
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,820
Come on.

931
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,820
Come on.

932
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,820
Come on.

933
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,820
I'll treat you.

934
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,820
Mr. Li.

935
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,820
Come on.

936
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,820
Come on.

937
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,820
Come on.

938
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,820
Come on.

939
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,820
Come on.

940
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,820
Good wine.

941
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,820
Come on.

942
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,820
Come on.

943
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,820
I'm so happy.

944
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,820
I'm so happy.

945
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,820
Congratulations.

946
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,820
Come on.

947
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,820
Mr. Zhang.

948
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,820
Come on.

949
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,820
Let's have a drink.

950
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,820
Mr. Chen.

951
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,820
There is still something in the house.

952
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,820
I'll go first.

953
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,820
Mr. Zhang.

954
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,820
What can be done if nothing is done?

955
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,820
The colleagues in our department are all here.

956
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,820
It's rare to come out and drink.

957
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,820
Don't be so sad.

958
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,820
Come on.

959
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,820
Come on.

960
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,820
Come on.

961
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,820
Mr. Zhang.

962
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,820
Come on.

963
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,820
I've never drunk.

964
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,820
You drink it yourself.

965
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,820
You should give Brother Dang a face.

966
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,820
And then take half an hour.

967
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,820
Tomorrow.

968
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,820
Tomorrow I'll write you a hand order.

969
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,820
And you can continue to investigate the case of Nidang.

970
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,820
How?

971
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,820
Mr. Zhang, you don't need to write this.

972
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,820
You can go out and wait.

973
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,820
It's convenient to go out.

974
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,820
It's okay.

975
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,820
Let's drink.

976
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,820
Come on.

977
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,820
So big.

978
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,820
It's raining.

979
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,820
The carriage stopped at the right place.

980
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,820
The lady is waiting here.

981
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,820
I'll go in and come.

982
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,820
You are so beautiful.

983
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,820
Mypai.

984
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,240
I want to.)

985
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,820
It's time to leave.

986
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,820
Amitabha.

987
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,820
that it's alright.

988
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:06,160
It's that

989
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,920
he dismissed you for stealing from his��을.

990
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,640
Hope you can Champion Dou be better than me.

991
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,900
No need to worry.

992
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,940
First Prince, do you agree already?

993
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:31,540
Second Prince, do you think I am spying on me on Acting?

994
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,140
I dare not face you.

995
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,300
Are you afraid that I will eat you?

996
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,740
Your Highness, I am sorry.

997
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,020
I am an outsider.

998
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,260
I dare not offend you.

999
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,660
Please forgive me.

1000
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,540
Why didn't you leave?

1001
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,180
You can't speak.

1002
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,540
You don't want me to agree to it?

1003
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,220
How dare you bother her?

1004
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,540
Once I heard themaya tell me

1005
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,700
that human Nedom was known as a tiger in�

1006
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,220
but is no longer known as a tiger

1007
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:11,980
even at the moment since that,

1008
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,160
he often denies the bear from the pulling of god and

1009
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,300

Hurry up.

1018
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,780
Hurry up.

1019
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,780
Hurry up.

1020
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,780
Hurry up.

1021
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,780
Hey, are you okay?

1022
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,780
The car is over there.

1023
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:48,780
The rain is getting lower. Let's hurry and go back.

1024
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,780
Without your rain,

1025
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:55,780
I can wait for the winter to slowly

1026
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:59,780
slowly stay with you.

1027
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:05,780
I forget that I don't have you.

1028
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,780
I heard that he has been running out lately.

1029
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,780
What did he do?

1030
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,780
I don't know.

1031
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:26,780
I don't know what's the use of raising you.

1032
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:32,780
I have to see what this little piece of iron is doing.

1033
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,780
Come on.

1034
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,780
I'll take you to a good place.

1035
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:43,780
Let's go.

1036
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:50,780
Let me introduce you to the most trusted man in the world,

1037
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,780
Mr. Xie Wei.

1038
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,780
I know.

1039
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,780
But I'm sorry.

1040
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,780
I can't help you.

1041
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,780
I didn't say anything.

1042
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,780
Xie Ju'an, a person from Jinling.

1043
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,780
He was in the palace three years ago.

1044
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:10,780
He was appointed as Crown Prince of the Palace.

1045
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:13,780
In the court, he was in contact with the Ministry of Justice for four years.

1046
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,780
The latest case was a violent case.

1047
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,780
The case of Jincheng was closed until last night.

1048
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:21,780
You took the lead of Mr. Chen to see Zhang Meng.

1049
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,780
You don't need to say anything else.

1050
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:30,780
In the court, Mr. Zhang was in a violent situation.

1051
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,780
He was indeed very famous.

1052
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,780
You don't need to say anything else.

1053
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,780
If you want to do something in front of Zhang Meng,

1054
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:41,780
or if you want him to do something,

1055
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,780
you don't need to say anything else.

1056
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:45,780
I believe in my own words.

1057
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,780
Wei, you are right.

1058
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,780
With Mr. Zhang's words,

1059
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,780
I'm relieved.

1060
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,780
Now, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Justice

1061
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,780
are surrounded by the rebels.

1062
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,780
The guards are all out of their ways.

1063
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:03,780
I'm just worried that the truth will be revealed to the public.

1064
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,780
Mr. Xie, you are wrong.

1065
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:08,780
This is what Mr. Zhang should be investigating.

1066
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:13,780
I just know that the rebels are assassinating in the capital.

1067
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,780
Although it seems like nothing is related,

1068
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,780
there must be a cause for it.

1069
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,780
If we wait until the day of the assassination,

1070
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:24,780
I'm afraid that it will be difficult for us to get back to the south 20 years ago.

1071
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,780
This is not what I'm trying to say.

1072
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:30,780
I'm sure it's not what Mr. Zhang is asking for.

1073
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,780
I'll investigate it myself.

1074
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:33,780
But it has nothing to do with the rebels.

1075
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,780
Mr. Xie, you don't have to come to me.

1076
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:36,780
I'll take my leave.

1077
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:38,780
You...

1078
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:42,780
I've already said that you are a coward.

1079
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,780
If I didn't see Mr. Gu's sect leader,

1080
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,780
I would have kicked him out of the capital.

1081
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:50,780
The sword of Feng Li will always be useful.

1082
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:51,780
Besides,

1083
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:55,780
the court doesn't need people who are not panicking and uncooperative.

1084
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:57,780
Yes.

1085
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:44,780
I'm sorry.

1086
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,780
I'm sorry.

1087
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,780
I'm sorry.

1088
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,780
I'm sorry.

1089
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:52,780
I'm sorry.

1090
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:54,780
I'm sorry.

1091
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,780
I'm sorry.

1092
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,780
I'm sorry.

1093
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:00,780
I'm sorry.

1094
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,780
I'm sorry.

1095
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,780
I'm sorry.

1096
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:06,780
I'm sorry.

1097
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,780
I'm sorry.

1098
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:10,780
I'm sorry.

1099
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:12,780
I'm sorry.

1100
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,780
I'm sorry.

1101
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,780
I'm sorry.

1102
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,780
I'm sorry.

1103
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:20,780
I'm sorry.

1104
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:22,780
I'm sorry.

1105
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,780
I'm sorry.

1106
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,780
I'm sorry.

1107
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:28,780
I'm sorry.

1108
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,780
I'm sorry.

1109
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,780
I'm sorry.

1110
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:34,780
I'm sorry.

1111
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:36,780
I'm sorry.

1112
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,780
I'm sorry.

1113
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,780
I'm sorry.

1114
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,780
I'm sorry.

1115
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,780
I'm sorry.

1116
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:46,780
I'm sorry.

1117
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:48,780
I'm sorry.

1118
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:50,780
I'm sorry.

1119
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:52,780
I'm sorry.

1120
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,780
I'm sorry.

1121
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,780
