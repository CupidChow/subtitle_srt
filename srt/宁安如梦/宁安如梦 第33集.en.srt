Mr. Zhang, do you believe in predestination from the previous life?

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,400
I'd rather believe in what's in front of me.

But in the unfathomable,

28
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:56,150
there's always an invisible hand

29
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,720
that puts everything back to its original place.

30
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,610
You've taken revenge and paid your debts.

31

At the end of the day, who are you?

32

A bustling place, or a battleground.

We've entered the border city.

39
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,940
What should we do next?

40
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,000
Any instructions from Mr. Xie?

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,600
Naturally, we'll enter the General's Mansion

42
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,480
and take over Yan's troops.

43
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,330
The border is heavily guarded.

44
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,760
How can we mobilize without an imperial edict?

45
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,780
Even if the soldiers acknowledge me as a Marquis,

46
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,840
the court will surely hold me accountable in the future.

47
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,900
We mustn't do that.

How could His Majesty have allowed us to lead the army?

49
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,400
Is this imperial edict real?

50
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,570
But the contents of the letter

51
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,370
are in Xie Ju'an's handwriting.

52
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,060
What?

53
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,920
He forged the edict.

54
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,720
We came here

55

to prevent Xue Yuan from rioting

56
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,110
and to save the princess and pacify the State of Yue.

57
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,610
But if this means that Junior Preceptor Xie
has to bear the crime of forging the imperial edict,

58
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,680
how can we do that?

Are human lives so despicable to you?

at a post house 10 miles away from the border.

The grass has already grown up to a man's waist.

Moreover, the Yue people are nomads.

172
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,860
Take Miss Jiang to rest.

173
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,000
Treat her well.

174
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,430
Yes.

175
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,690
This way, please.

176
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,140
[Martial Arts and Benevolence]

177
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,180
Greetings,

178
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,490
my brother.

179
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,060
Yan Lin

180
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,450
is good at martial arts,

181
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,910
but he's also thoughtful.

182
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,090
In the past,

183
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,030
he'd already somewhat guessed it.

184
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,010
To this day,

185
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,290
I can't hide it from him anymore.

186
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:20,430
Get up.

187
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,320
If I'd known earlier,

188
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,690
I'd have shared some of your burden.

189
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,080
Every time I think about what a carefree life I led

190
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,270
in the capital

191
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,850
while my brother was suffering alone,

192
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,420
my heart breaks.

193
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:36,850
My child.

194
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,190
It must have been tough on you to be alone

195
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:41,980
all these years.

196
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,260
Although we're now far away from the capital

197
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,210
and there's no ancestral temple to witness this,

198
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,070
wherever we are

199
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,330
is home.

200
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,680
You're finally home.

201
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,340
Uncle.

202
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,080
It's good that you're back.

203
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,610
In that case,

204
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,490
I can finally explain to your mother.

205
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,250
Back then,

206
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,380
I couldn't protect you and your mother.

207
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,330
As your uncle, I'm sorry.

208
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,380
No.

209
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,710
The ones who should repent

210
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,690
and atone for it

211
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,710
are Lord Pingnan

212
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:32,830
and Xue Yuan.

213
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,210
You win.

214
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,770
In order to gain merit,

215
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,770
you even risked your own son's life.

216
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,950
I really underestimated you.

217
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,690
Fine.

218
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,180
You don’t care about this one,

219
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,710
but don’t forget, Xue Yuan,

220
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:54,660
that I still have

221
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,580
the lives of hundreds of children

222
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,120
and all the lives of the city's people in my hands.

223
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,820
Do you not care about them?

224
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,910
I'm warning you one last time.

225
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,160
Retreat immediately.

226
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,980
Otherwise,

227
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,940
I'll kill them all!

228
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,880
The safety of the Empress and the Crown Prince

229
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,140
concerns the country.

230
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,360
Even millions of people's lives

231
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,470
can't threaten me.

232
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,730
Besides, you can't find them anyway.

233
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,400
Otherwise, you wouldn't have been in the city for days

234
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,800
yet only found a fake one.

235
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,650
All soldiers,

236
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,020
listen to my order.

237
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,970
Take back the Imperial City

238
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,250
at all costs.

239
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,270
Attack!

240
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,810
Kill!

241
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,900
Yan Min is dead.

242
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,230
Xue Yuan remarried.

243
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,250
And you

244
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,930
died in the chaos in the capital.

245
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,760
I spared your life

246
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,220
because you're useful.

247
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,570
If you're useless,

248
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,200
you should die.

249
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:15,950
Do you know

250
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,620
what it means to you

251
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,520
to give up your last name?

252
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,860
Yes.

253
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,290
Are you still going to give it up?

254
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,070
My mother has passed away.

255
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,000
My father is unworthy.

256
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,910
I hate that I have the last name that he's disgraced.

257
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,820
I don't want

258
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,850
such a last name.

259
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,410
Thank God for your mercy.

260
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,180
In a crisis, one sees one's true nature.

261
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,880
I, Ju'an, dare not forget it.

262
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,490
-I'm willing to give up my old last name.
-I'm willing to give up my old last name.

263
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,880
-Abandon my old name
-Abandon my old name

264
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,450
-and my old identity.
-and my old identity.

265
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,770
-No matter how hard it is,
-No matter how hard it is,

266
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,430
-I won't change my mind.
-I won't change my mind.

267
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,050
I'm no longer Xue Dingfei,

268
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,970
much less a viscount of the Xue family.

269
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,230
All I have

270
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,660
is the Yan family's blood.

271
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,140
And my name

272
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,150
is Xie Wei.

273
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,650
Not only do I live for myself,

274
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,260
but also for the 300 Loyal Souls.

275
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,870
I vow

276
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,460
to never let it go

277
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,380
and seek justice for them.

278
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,360
Okay.

279
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,830
It doesn't matter what your name is.

280
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,060
You'll always be the child of the Yan family.

281
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,810
Uncle.

282
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,120
The current situation is turbulent

283
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,490
and the future is unclear.

284
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,550
In front of others,

285
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,300
we shouldn't make any changes.

286
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,160
I'm still your junior

287
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,660
and Yan Lin's teacher.

288
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,800
You don't want others to know

289
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,280
because you're afraid that someone might play tricks,

290
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,670
and also because you want

291
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,840
to take the blame for forging the imperial edict alone,

292
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,410
right?

293
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,290
Now that Yan Lin and I've come all the way here,

294
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,780
we're prepared to face the worst outcome.

295
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,570
You don't need to bear the responsibility alone.

296
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,360
The crime of forging the imperial edict

297
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,410
can be offset by the contributions

298
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,080
of saving the princess and pacifying the State of Yue.

299
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,390
It's not a dead end.

300
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,200
But now,

301
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,150
there's one thing I need to verify first.

302
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,200
What is it?

303
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,320
Yan Lin told me

304
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,130
that the State of Yue has been acting abnormally lately.

305
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,990
I suspect they are secretly in cahoots with someone

306
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,670
and are doing this on purpose.

307
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,650
If we can't guarantee the safety behind the front line

308
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:56,850
and blindly start a war,

309
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,010
it'll only make us vulnerable on both ends.

310
00:15:59,010 --> 00:15:59,750
I heard

311
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,030
that on your way here,

312
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,610
you were attacked by the Xue family.

313
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,340
Could it be them?

314
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,250
If the Xue family wanted to start a war,

315
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,040
they wouldn’t have tried to assassinate me

316
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,500
unnecessarily on the way.

317
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,330
Judging from the handwriting,

318
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,820
it looks like someone else did it.

319
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,320
My darling Hong Jian.

320
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,730
I missed you so much.

321
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,970
Xiao Bao? Xiao...

322
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:52,870
Lord...

323
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:55,790
Lord Pingnan?

324
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,790
W-Why are you here?

325
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:02,770
Why am I here?

326
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,540
You're becoming more and more independent.

327
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:09,319
You gave me such a big gift in Tongzhou.

328
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:10,609
Tell me.

329
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,369
How can I not visit you personally?

330
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,180
It's a misunderstanding.

331
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,280
A huge misunderstanding.

332
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,130
It was because the court's people were there that day.

333
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,369
Xie Wei and I

334
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,460
were afraid that we'd ruin your plan.

335
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,760
That's... That's why...

336
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,430
That's why?

337
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,460
Really?

338
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,720
You go by the name of Xue Dingfei,

339
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,290
but you're so uneducated.

340
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,650
If the actual Xue Dingfei were here,

341
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,520
he'd have come up with a reason

342
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,330
that I'd have to believe.

343
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,560
Yes.

344
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,250
You're right, Lord Pingnan.

345
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,290
I am stupid.

346
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,210
But I know

347
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,770
you've helped us a lot.

348
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,550
So...

349
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,050
Of course I'm loyal to you.

350
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,690
How could I go against you?

351
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,940
This is loyalty?

352
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,100
I raised you two as my own children.

353
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,630
But what about you?

354
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,770
Is this how you repay me?

355
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,270
Spare the rod and spoil the child.

356
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,260
Looks like it's time

357
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,670
to teach you two a lesson.

358
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,360
Have a look!

359
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,550
Have a look.

360
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,970
-Do you like spicy food?
-I'll leave the money here.

361
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,110
Flower cloth!

362
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:22,150
General Yan.

363
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,820
This is the first time you brought a lady here.

364
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,440
Enough. Stop talking nonsense.

365
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,370
I won't pay if you keep talking nonsense.

366
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,720
You brought your beloved one here.

367
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,940
How can I charge you?

368
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,530
Eat as much as you can.

369
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,790
Eat as much as you want.

370
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:33,820
I'll get back to work.

371
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,880
Get more yourself if it's not enough.

372
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,530
Looks like you're doing well here.

373
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,680
It's only been a while but you already get along with everyone.

374
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,000
This place is different from the capital.

375
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,240
There aren't many rules.

376
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,300
I feel more at ease.

377
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:47,510
Yan Lin.

378
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,070
You've really matured a lot.

379
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,710
What about you?

380
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,510
How have you been?

381
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,530
Of course I've been doing well.

382
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,290
Are you

383
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,400
with Mr. Zhang Zhe?

384
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:06,610
♫How many people can one love in a lifetime?♫

385
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,090
♫Can you understand the love and hate♫

386
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:14,520
♫In the eyes looking at you?♫

387

♫How much true love exists in this vast world♫

388
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,080
No big deal.

389
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,890
I just saw this by the street

390
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,420
and picked it for you.

391
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,830
♫To be worthy of so many poems?♫

392
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,680
Don't be upset.

393
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:28,940
♫There are too many stories to be written♫

394
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,190
♫Youths know no worries♫

395
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,660
So,

396
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:37,190
♫We drank under the moon amidst flowers♫

397
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,120
even without Mr. Zhang,

00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,870
it still isn't me, right?

399
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,170
♫We saw flowers blooming yesterday♫

400
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,740
♫And thought they'd still be blooming tomorrow♫

401
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,800
Yan Lin.

402
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,580
Find a girl who loves you

403
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,600
and live happily.

404
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,610
♫When we were young♫

405
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,410

♫We believed that as long as we could♫

407
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:51,570
I will.

408
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,650
By then,

409
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,660
♫Hold those warm hands♫

410
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:54,970
after I finish the war

411
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:55,890
and earn the marquis title,

412
00:19:55,790 --> 00:20:01,000
♫We could be with our beloved one forever♫

413
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,980
I'll marry a good girl

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,900
and dote on her endlessly.

415
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:06,450
♫Time flies and everything's like a dream♫

416
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:02,500
By then,

417
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,650
it'll be too late for you to be envious.

418
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:15,380
♫I traveled so far but still can't forget you♫

419
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,800
The rescue of the princess is imminent

420
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,400
and the war is about to start.

421
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:22,000
♫I spent half my life loving you but ended up being a joke♫

422
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,530
Yan Lin.

423
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,170
You must take care of yourself.

424
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,450
One can be easily harmed by weapons in combat.

425
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,490
Be careful.

426
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,610
Don't worry.

427
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,130
♫My heart is broken♫

428
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,890

♫But I never regret loving you♫

430
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,110
Miss Jiang.

431
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,640
Mr. Xie's looking for me?

432
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,090
Yes.

433
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,310
What's the matter?

434
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,530
You'll know when you get there.

435
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,180
Sir, Miss Jiang is here.

436
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,080
You're back.

437
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,700
Mr. Xie, this is...

438
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,080
I'm new to the border.

439
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,600
I'm not used to the food,

440
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,330
so I cooked myself some dishes.

441
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,480
I thought you haven't had dinner,

442
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:13,880
so I'm inviting you to join me.

443
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,700
Dinner?

444
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,170
But I've already...

445
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,630
Why? You don't want to eat?

446
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,120
If I'd known,

447
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,400
I wouldn't have eaten that bowl of wontons.

448
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,520
But if I say I've eaten,

449
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,720
it'll spoil his mood.

450
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,180
I'd rather die from eating too much food.

451
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:30,640
Of course not.

452
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,860
I just didn't expect

453
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,480
that you could cook so well.

454
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:37,040
I learned some skills in my early years of travel.

455
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,240
You're back so late.

456
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,590
You must be hungry.

457
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:40,740
Eat up.

458
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,870
Why is it so sour?

459
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,740
Is it sour?

460
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,690
I think it's okay.

461
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,800
I'm in a bad mood,

462
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:01,330
so it's natural that my food is seasoned a little too sour.

463
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,390
The border

464
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,740
is not as clean as the capital.

465
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,410
Don't eat outside again.

466
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,070
Otherwise...

467
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,460
I won't eat them.

468
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,470
Even if you force me, I won't eat them anymore.

469
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,340
Well, then, these dishes...

470
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,120
Take them to feed the dog.

471
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,950
What should we do if even the dog

472
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,290
wouldn't eat these dishes?

473
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,420
Either the dog dies,

474
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,220
or

475
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,110
you die.

476
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,430
Who are you?

477
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:47,800
What's going on?

478
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,070
-Let's go. Don't stay here.
-Okay.

479
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,860
What does it say?

480
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,520
Prince of Yue wants me to meet him tomorrow.

481
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,690
How did he know you're at the border?

482
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,240
Don't tell me someone conveyed the news to him?

483
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,450
How is the investigation in the capital?

484
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,980
I'm here to talk about this.

485
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,230
Xue Dingfei sent a letter that says

486
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,940
that the person who tried to assassinate you

487
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,470
was sent by Xue Yuan indeed.

488
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:26,490
But there were no further actions afterwards.

489
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:27,660
I also asked about the situation at Jinling

490
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,320
according to what you told me.

491
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,000
They said nothing happened.

492
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,800
Nothing happened on both sides.

493
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,360
That's even stranger.

494
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,470
Ju'an.

495
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,900
What should we do next?

496
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,640
Do you have any plans?

497
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,760
Keep the appointment as scheduled.

498
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,060
Are you crazy? This is obviously a trap.

499
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,010
How can you go?

500
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,400
We can't delay any longer

501
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,260
or the princess will be in danger.

502
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:53,820
Yan Lin.

503
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,660
Go to the army and order a troop of soldiers

504
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,400
to ambush near the post house tomorrow

505
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,450
and wait for the chance to move in for the kill.

506
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:00,910
Yes.

507
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,500
Mr. Xie?

508
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,510
I heard you didn't have dinner again.

509
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,090
I no longer go out to eat.

510
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,390
I just have no appetite today.

511
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,010
You don't have to cook again.

512
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,450
Your cooking skills are amazing.

513
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,560
I'm deeply grateful.

514
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,020
There's really no need...

515
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,780
Layered walnut cakes?

516
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:38,430
You don't even eat when you're troubled.

517
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,050
You're starving yourself,

518
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,350
yet you still want to take care of others.

519
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:54,030
Why does it taste so familiar?

520
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,060
It's delicious.

521
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,360
It's fragrant and not too sweet.

522
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,890
It tastes like it does in the olden days.

523
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:05,540
Mr. Xie.

524
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,770
Where did you buy it?

525
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,530
It was prepared in the palace.

526
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:09,460
The chef made it.

527
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,710
If you like it,

528
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,050
you can take them all.

529
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,730
Thank you then, Mr. Xie.

530
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,160
Back in the palace,

531
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,810
the layered walnut cakes you gave me

532
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,410
were personally made by you?

533
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,760
Why? Is it strange?

534
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,020
But...

535
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,110
But at that time, we were just...

536
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,330
Just what?

537
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,020
What about now?

538
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:39,980
What are we now?

539
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,850
We're going to bring the princess back tomorrow.

540
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:48,780
Stay in the city.

541
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,980
Don't wander around.

542
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,450
What about you?

543
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:53,860
I'm here to help you

544
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:55,510
bring your princess back.

545
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,230
You...

546
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,290
have nothing to say to me?

547
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:05,850
About what?

548
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,990
Yan Lin is skilled in martial arts

549
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,090
yet you knew to tell him to be careful.

550
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,680
Something is definitely strange about tomorrow.

551
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,410
Aren't you worried about me...

552
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,610
You're extraordinarily clever.

553
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:17,960
Since you've decided to go,

554
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,530
you must have a solution.

555
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,210
I don't trust others,

556
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,660
but I trust you.

557
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,000
Xie Ju'an may not win forever,

558
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,280
but he'll never lose.

559
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,420
I believe

560
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,670
you'll bring the princess back safely.

561
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,250
You and your eloquence.

562
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:32,970
Do I have to

563
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:34,690
thank you for your kind words

564
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:35,950
and your respect then?

565
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,410
What are you waiting for? Go back to sleep.

566
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,540
Mr. Xie, this is my room.

567
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,200
This must be Mr. Xie.

568
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,620
The prince ordered

569
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,640
that you can only go there alone.

570
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,240
These two are just my servants.

571
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:16,490
Don't tell me that the Prince of Yue is even afraid of the servants too?

572
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:18,710
Mr. Xie, you don’t have to provoke us.

573
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:20,740
This is

574
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:23,080
Dao Qin, who's good at archery.

575
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,270
This is

576
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,370
Jian Shu, who's good at close combat.

577
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,530
Both of them are brave and highly-skilled warriors.

578
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,190
We have to guard against them.

579
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,110
Besides,

580
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,610
the prince only invited you.

581
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,620
Of course,

582
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:38,290
the others aren't qualified to see him.

583
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:38,840
Mr. Xie.

584
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,470
-We...
-It’s fine.

585
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,590
I'll go by myself.

586
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,680
This way, please.

587
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,890
So this is Mr. Xie.

588
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,220
I thought it was someone

589
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,740
extraordinarily capable and powerful.

590
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,100
You seem to be just a weak scholar.

591
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,170
The State of Qian is skilled in literature
while the State of Yue has a strong military force.

592
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,460
They're fundamentally different.

593
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,850
But if military force alone suffices,

594
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,280
you wouldn't have

595
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,160
invited me here today.

596
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,310
Do you know why I want to see you?

597
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,920
According to the State of Yue's rules,

598
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,160
when the older brother dies, the younger brother ascends the throne.

599
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,550
Last year, the State of Yue's former king passed away.

600
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,900
Among all the princes in the State of Yue,

601
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,250
you're the oldest

602
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,610
and have received a lot of support.

603
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,540
Unfortunately,

604
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,400
over half of the 16 tribes in the State of Yue

605
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,940
support your uncle to ascend the throne.

606
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,700
Now that your uncle has the throne,

607
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,430
although you appear to have yielded,

608
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:24,040
deep down, have you really accepted it?

609
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,690
I’m afraid you're meeting me

610
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,610
for the position of King of Yue,

611
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,380
and perhaps...

612
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:33,930
even more.

613
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,700
Mr. Xie, you sure know a lot about what's going on

614
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,880
in our grasslands.

615
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,400
I dare not say that.

616
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,180
It's just that the battles of the world

617
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,090
are always about a few common themes.

618
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,000
You gave your uncle advice

619
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,480
and repeatedly tested the State of Qian's limit

620
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,290
and tried to help the State of Yue head south.

621
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:57,090
It seems like a plan for the State of Yue and the new king,

622
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:58,820
but in fact...

623
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:03,190
Go on.

624
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:04,510
In fact?

625
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:08,080
You took the chance to propose marriage in the name of the State of Yue.

626
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,810
In fact, you wanted to use the power and prestige of the State of Qian

627
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,870
to form an alliance

628
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,350
and seize the throne.

629
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,490
But you suddenly changed your mind

630
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,240
and didn't enter the State of Yue's imperial court.

631
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,360
Instead, you chose to stay here.

632
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,100
I'm afraid you changed your plan

633
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,360
because of some sudden changes.

634
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,520
But you have to think it through.

635
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,070
Compared to those empty promises,

636
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:36,270
what the State of Qian can give you

637
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,180
is more practical.

638
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,410
I’m here

639
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:43,620
to negotiate with you with His Majesty’s edict.

640
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,600
But

641
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:49,060
I need to see the princess first.

642
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,800
It’s said that the Qian people are arrogant and hypocritical.

643
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,260
Seeing you today has confirmed that saying.

644
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,580
You're right.

645
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,580
I want to seize the throne.

646
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:03,590
However,

647
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:06,190
it's a matter of the State of Yue.

648
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,730
What does it have to do

649
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:10,350
with an outsider like you?

650
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,410
What do you mean?

651
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:30,470
Under the guise of a negotiation with me,

652
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,600
you secretly got Yan Lin to surround this place.

653
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,890
You're capricious.

654
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,480
You really are a scoundrel.

655
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,100
Unfortunately,

656
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,880
I already expected it.

657
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,580
As for you,

658
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:46,000
you'll have to die here.

659
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,160
Get into formation!

660
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:11,610
Fight!

661
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,110
Kill!

662
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:20,860
Wait.

663
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,000
There’s one more thing I don’t understand.

664
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:26,730
Go ahead.

665
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:29,460
I won't let you die in vain.

666
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,480
Kill me

667
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,280
and you'll become the enemy of the entire State of Qian.

668
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,720
In front of you are tens of thousands of Qian soldiers in the border.

669
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,590
Behind you

670
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:41,490
is the imperial court's scheme.

671
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,040
Are you really not afraid of being attacked from both sides

672
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,450
and becoming destroyed for good?

673
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,770
Xie Wei!

674
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,030
You know about my State of Yue.

675
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:54,360
Do you think I'm just a good-for-nothing?

676
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,800
As long as you die,

677
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,600
Duke Xue will definitely do whatever it takes

678
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,060
to get rid of the Yan family's father and son.

679
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,930
Without the commander-in-chief,

680
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,890
the Yan's troops will be fragmented.

681
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:05,790
By then,

682
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,350
Lord Pingnan will lead his army north

683
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,640
and I'll take the chance to head south.

684
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,000
Then, the whole country

685
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,760
will be ours.

686
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,010
So you're really colluding with Lord Pingnan.

687
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,230
So what if you know?

688
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,280
You're

689
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,510
going to die soon.

690
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,310
You think?

691
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,100
No way.

692
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,750
How did you get in?

693
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,090
I clearly sent my men to keep guard!

694
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:01,410
If it's something that you can think of,

695
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:03,070
why do you think Mr. Xie can't?

696
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,400
Do you think you discovered

697
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,720
Viscount Yan's whereabouts and ambush because you're smart?

698
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,920
Mr. Xie deliberately let you find them.

699
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:09,580
Yan Lin.

700
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,040
Go to the army and order a troop of soldiers

701
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,770
to ambush near the post house tomorrow

702
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:14,960
and wait for the chance to move in for the kill.

703
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,670
However,

704
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,350
Yan Lin's troops

705
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:20,400
are just soldiers to distract Prince of Yue and arouse his suspicion.

706
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,920
Yan Lin is leading an army out of the city.
I'll follow them.

707
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,250
Send a message to the prince immediately.

708
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,090
To succeed tomorrow,

709
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,230
I still need your help, Uncle.

710
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,570
Let's go.

711
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:48,810
Go!

712
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,280
You thought you knew the whole situation

713
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,890
and was so sure of your victory that you got carried away.

714
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:15,920
You let your guard down and are doomed to lose.

715
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,210
If you don't want more casualties,

716
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:19,210
give up your weapons and surrender.

717
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,380
What? Surrender?

718
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,940
Just with you lot?

719
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,830
Do you think the Yue warriors are useless?

720
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,180
Kill them!

721
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,330
You are...

722
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,890
I'm Dao Qin.

723
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,560
Princess, by Mr. Xie's order,

724
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,330
I'm here to escort you back to the city.

725
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,400
Prince of Yue said he wants someone's life.

726
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,040
I'm afraid it's Mr. Xie he wants.

727
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,890
Go and save him now.

728
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:10,560
My mission

729
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,650
is to take you back.

730
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,640
As for the rest, Mr. Xie has his own arrangements.

731
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,270
But...

732
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,640
Princess, please pardon me.

733
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:02,990
Stop!

734
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,870
Don't get carried away too soon.

735
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,530
After the ambush outside the post house

736
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:16,810
deals with Yan Lin,

737
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,520
you'll die.

738
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,290
It's not too late for you to surrender.

739
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:25,420
I’m afraid I’ll have to let you down.

740
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,480
The State of Yue's cavalry and warriors are indeed invincible

741
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,990
in the grasslands.

742
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,810
But you

743
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,220
chose to stay here

744
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,690
because of your amibitious scheming.

745
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,550
Then you should know

746
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,280
that this is not a grassland after all.

747
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,080
Fighting in the mountain forest

748
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,510
is not just about fighting head-on.

749
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,060
Retreat!

750
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,540
Capture them!

751
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:22,960
Get up!

752
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,510
Despicable! Shameless!

753
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,620
Arrest him!

754
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,260
Let go of me!

755
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:32,490
I am a prince of the State of Yue.

756
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,870
How dare you offend me?

757
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,450
You killed so many Qian people

758
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,090
at the border of the State of Qian.

759
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,150
Let alone offense,

760
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,120
even killing you is letting you off easy.

761
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:40,960
Kill me?

762
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,880
You'll start a war if you do.

763
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,890
Do you dare?

764
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,980
Kill you?

765
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,230
Why would we kill you?

766
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,620
If we kill you,

767
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,510
who will pay for the humiliation

768
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,840
the princess suffered?

769
00:38:58,410 --> 00:38:59,810
What... What do you want?

770
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:02,090
I will send you to the State of Yue's imperial court

771
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,610
and tell your uncle

772
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,540
everything you did

773
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,160
to let him know

774
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,590
that instead of going south,

775
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,370
he should discipline the people

776
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:13,030
within the State of Yue first.

777
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,210
We'll send you there

778
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,090
as a first meeting gift.

779
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,640
The State of Qian helped him get rid of a huge time bomb.

780
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,170
We can ask for a new alliance

781
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,680
in exchange.

782
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:25,440
As for how the State of Yue will deal with traitors,

783
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,470
I don't think you need me to tell you.

784
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,250
Xie Wei! Xie Wei!

785
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,980
Why don't you kill me now?

786
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,820
Kill me.

787
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,590
Xie Wei.

788
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,880
Kill me.

789
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:34,700
Kill me!

790
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,440
Take him away.

791
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,690
Xie Wei. Xie Wei!

792
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,160
Xie Wei! Why don't you kill me now?

793
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:42,280
Kill me, Xie Wei! Kill me!

794
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,400
For the King of Yue to consolidate his throne,

795
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,120
he must eliminate the corruption from within first.

796
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,180
In the near future,

797
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,770
he won't be able to think about heading south.

798
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:52,350
When the King of Yue is done with it,

799
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,040
the strength of the State of Yue will have suffered.

800
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,510
Now, the King of Yue's only choice

801
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:00,390
is to re-establish the alliance with the State of Qian.

802
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,900
The border can finally settle down for some time.

803
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,560
Ju'an.

804
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:05,660
Well done.

805
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:14,990
[Yan]

806
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:09,670
Princess!

807
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,840
-Ning!
-Princess.

808
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:17,060
Princess!

809
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,110
I thought I'd never see you again.

810
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,370
You're so ridiculous.

811
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,050
How dare you come to the border?

812
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:40,650
Aren't you afraid of danger?

813
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,000
You're not afraid.

814
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,740
Why should I be afraid?

815
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,950
Luckily, you're fine.

816
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:48,550
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to live in peace.

817
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:51,940
Princess.

818
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,570
The soil of your homeland,

819
00:41:58,790 --> 00:41:59,690
your country,

820
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,020
and your capital.

821
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,450
Welcome, Your Highness.

822
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,380
Congratulations on returning to the capital of our homeland.

823
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:33,210
Welcome, Your Highness.

824
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:36,710
Congratulations on returning to the capital of our homeland.

825
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,900
Welcome, Your Highness.

826
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:42,590
Congratulations on returning to the capital of our homeland.

827
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:01,230
Ning, you silly girl.

828
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:14,010
Duke! Duke!

829
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:15,550
Bad news!

830
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:16,950
The spy sent a message.

831
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:19,040
Not only did the Yan family's father and son not get exiled,

832
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,040
but they even went to the border and took over Yan's troops.

833
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,840
Here, take a look at this letter.

834
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:28,940
Lord Pingnan's emblem?

835
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:31,240
When did you get in touch with Lord Pingnan?

836
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,330
Read carefully.

837
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,100
Xie Wei is the real Viscount Dingfei?

838
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:43,570
I suddenly received this secret letter today.

839
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,670
In the letter,

840
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:49,600
not only did it report about Xie Wei forging the imperial edict,

841
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,170
but also revealed his true identity.

842
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,140
No wonder Xie Wei always protected the Yan family

843
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:57,880
and always went against me.

844
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,080
No wonder the Xue Dingfei in his mansion was always acting weird.

845
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,160
It turns out he's a fake.

846
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:06,670
It seems that

847
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:08,720
they all work for Lord Pingnan.

848
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:12,990
I’m afraid that was the case before.

849
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:16,700
But this time, Lord Pingnan purposely sent a letter

850
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,510
to expose their real identities.

851
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:22,350
It should be that they have

852
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,680
an internal strife.

853
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:29,600
Xie Wei has made many contributions with regards to the rebels.

854
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:32,320
I think he ruined Lord Pingnan's scheme

855
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:34,140
and enraged him.

856
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,210
He didn't hesitate to sacrifice his right-hand men.

857
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:39,390
He wants to use me

858
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,430
to subdue Xie Wei.

859
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:45,380
Duke, no matter what Lord Pingnan wants,

860
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,380
Yan's troops have regained military power.

861
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:51,080
If Xie Wei allied with Yan's troops,

862
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,800
when they return to the capital,

863
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,330
we'll be the ones to suffer.

864
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,650
Lord Pingnan knew that

865
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,490
I have to take this bait.

866
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:03,910
How despicable.

867
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:06,960
But now that things have come to this,

868
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,450
the damage to our father-and-son relationship

869
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:12,510
is irreversible.

870
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,720
Now, I'm afraid Xie Wei

871
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,050
hates me the most.

872
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:21,530
So no matter what,

873
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:23,960
we can't let him return to the capital again.
