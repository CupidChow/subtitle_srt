1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
As long as I can enter the Ning'an Palace

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,200
and pay all the price

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,600
I will be willing to do my best

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,400
The End

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,800
The End

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,800
Everything seems to be a dream

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,400
I have owed a lot of people

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,800
Chaozhe, help me

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,600
I will be a good person after this

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
The End

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
I will be the one to take the favor

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,800
There are some things you can't give me

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
But what about them?

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,000
The life you chose is for Mr. You

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,400
In this world, everyone has the right to escape

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,000
But I can't

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,000
I want to regret it

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,400
and do the wrong thing

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,200
and go back in time

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Does Mr. Zhang believe that everything is decided?

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I am more willing to believe in the future

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,000
Your Highness

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,800
Your Highness

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,200
The End

26
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,000
Ning'an, what are you doing?

27
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,000
In the Ming Dynasty

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,600
there was always a pair of invisible hands

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,600
to break everything back to the original position

30
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,400
The revenge is long and the wish is long

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,600
Who are you in the end?

32
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,600
The Emperor of the mortal world is so long

33
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,000
and he is so ridiculous

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,200
He is so treacherous

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
absorbance

36
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,400
an honest woman

37
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,000
Why do you have to face me like that?

38
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,600
Are you afraid that I willget a lover from you?

39
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
It is not your chance

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,600
so I dare not feel hurt

41
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,800
PleaseSi Zhou

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:03:13,780
The bad person will have even a good soul pack and sweet

43
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,380
Xiao Dian is really not enough to make you a great Buddha.

44
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,180
You should find another place.

45
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,980
Manager!

46
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,180
What is this?

47
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,580
You are so generous.

48
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,180
A few days ago, someone said that someone is going to enter my bamboo flute.

49
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,580
This time, he will definitely...

50
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,980
These words, when he came back and listened to my son, he was already getting a few pieces of paper.

51
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,780
You are busy everyday and have made a lot of appointments.

52
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,180
But no one is willing to pay for your bamboo flute.

53
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,180
You should find a decent voice sooner.

54
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:40,980
What are you saying?

55
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,180
He is just a liar.

56
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,580
This...

57
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,980
You are not good at performing your performance.

58
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,180
That's why you are here to find a good voice.

59
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,580
For hundreds of years, so many people have never thought of

60
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,780
the way to play the piano in the deep of their eyes.

61
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,980
You are the only one who can do it.

62
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,380
Xiao Dian is giving you money to make you panic.

63
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,180
What do you know? As long as my bamboo flute is made,

64
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,780
I can play three times.

65
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,580
No!

66
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:00,980
Five times!

67
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,580
You are so good at playing. Who believes you?

68
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,780
You are so bad at playing.

69
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,980
No!

70
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,780
I believe you.

71
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,580
You are so good at playing.

72
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,980
What is this?

73
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,980
Don't be so serious.

74
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,780
I have paid for Mr. Ren's bamboo flute.

75
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,580
Please take it.

76
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,180
And prepare a set of clean clothes for him.

77
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:19,980
A pair of bamboo flute.

78
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,980
It's all in my account.

79
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,780
You are so good at playing.

80
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,380
Mr. Ren,

81
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,780
your bamboo flute,

82
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,980
maybe

83
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,980
I can make it for you.

84
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,580
Miss.

85
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,980
This little bitch

86
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,380
has really gone out again.

87
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,580
Miss, don't worry.

88
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,180
I have followed your instructions

89
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,780
and asked the people in the door

90
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,580
to follow you secretly.

91
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,580
I'm sure you know where she is.

92
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,380
She is a bitch.

93
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,580
Maybe she has some money.

94
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,980
You guys check her room carefully.

95
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,780
See if there is anything

96
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,980
that is left to be taken.

97
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,180
Yes.

98
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,780
Miss,

99
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,980
you are so good at playing.

100
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,980
Miss.

101
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,180
Miss, look.

102
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,380
So many money.

103
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,380
I'm sure they stole from the property.

104
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,380
I followed her all the way to the inn.

105
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,780
I found that she went to the inn.

106
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,980
You little bitch.

107
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,980
You're so stubborn.

108
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,780
Thank you for helping me out.

109
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,380
I'm grateful for your help.

110
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,580
I don't know how to address you.

111
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,180
I'm lucky.

112
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,380
You don't have to thank me.

113
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,780
I'm also a person who is grateful.

114
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,980
I heard that you've developed a new way of mining.

115
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,180
You can re-start the waste and re-open it after many years.

116
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,380
It's called the copper-picking.

117
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,780
Miss, are you also from the Yan family?

118
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,380
I don't know, but I know the Dong family.

119
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,980
I hope that I can help you to reopen the waste.

120
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,380
You can open all the stores and sell them to the Dong family.

121
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,580
But it's hard to find.

122
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,580
Please tell the young master to get the seven-year-old red rice out of the rice.

123
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,180
Seven-year-old?

124
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,180
No, this...

125
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,180
This is too dark.

126
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,780
Seven-year-old?

127
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,380
Miss, this is too dark.

128
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,980
It's a very long time. I can only use very long-term.

129
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,380
It's a bit dark.

130
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,980
But if it's a difficult time, the risks ahead are all on us.

131
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,580
We should be able to pay for what we have.

132
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,580
But how do you know that the human body lives in this giant inn?

133
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,580
And you seem to know the copper-picking.

134
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,180
You also know about the last time you were alive.

135
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,980
I'll tell you everything when the time is right.

136
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,980
The red rice I want is high, but the copper-picking risks are also very high.

137
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,580
Whether it can be successfully created or open-up is not known.

138
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,380
As for how much production and profit, I'm not sure.

139
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,780
If not, you wouldn't have lost your capital.

140
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,980
You would have been so quiet.

141
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,580
Everyone else doesn't believe that they wouldn't dare to enter the valley.

142
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,980
Only I, the Dong family, would be willing to pay a thousand or two hundred taels of silver.

143
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,180
If this is a chance, if it's a mistake,

144
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,380
I'm afraid it's hard to have.

145
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,980
Fine.

146
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,580
Seven-year-old is seven-year-old. But I want to limit it.

147
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,580
And you can't interfere with my work.

148
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,580
That's right.

149
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,380
Thank you, Miss You.

150
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,380
Second Sister.

151
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,580
Take this piece of paper to your home.

152
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,180
You're under my control! What are you doing?

153
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,580
You poor uncle. I'll ask Ze, you're blaming our daughter, Si Tao.

154
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,180
You should ask Miss Wen first. You deserve it.

155
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,780
Second Sister, I don't have Si Tao. I have nothing to do with Master Ren.

156
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,580
Don't look!

157
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,180
Look, isn't this the person who was kicked out?

158
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,980
If you don't tell me, it's Si Tao.

159
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,380
It's fine to be in the house and be in a mess.

160
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,180
There are some people who are not in a good mood and are not in a good mood.

161
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,780
They are only being taught by the wolves.

162
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,380
Don't move.

163
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,380
Don't be afraid of being a nuisance to uncle.

164
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,180
Take them away. Don't stay here and be a little bit embarrassed.

165
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,180
Second Sister.

166
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,580
No way!

167
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,980
Who is it?

168
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,580
Are you sure?

169
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,780
I'm sure.

170
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,580
I asked Master Ren about the position of the manager.

171
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,180
They said that he was taken away by You Yue.

172
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,580
Master Ren was also beaten up.

173
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,180
This is bad.

174
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,380
According to the character of You Yue,

175
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,980
no matter how much you can get up and get up,

176
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,180
Fang Ying must be punished by him now.

177
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,180
I don't know what kind of person she is going to be.

178
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,480
I'm sorry.

179
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,980
How many wrong-doers in the manager's family are women?

180
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,780
Although the rumors are hard to read,

181
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,980
it's a family matter.

182
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,580
If you go in, I'm afraid that you will burn yourself.

183
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,980
I don't know what you are talking about.

184
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,580
But if it's not because of me,

185
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,980
Fang Ying won't be so quiet.

186
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,780
I must find a way to save her.

187
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:47,780
How about letting Master Ren talk to you?

188
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,580
If you are in a hurry now,

189
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,380
you will surely be able to sell Master Ren's face.

190
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,580
If you can sell Master Ren's face,

191
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,180
you can let Fang Ying go to the capital and make a good deal out of it.

192
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:01,380
I must find a way to save her.

193
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,980
I remember that when I was cleaning up the jewelry,

194
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,380
I had a pair of two-hander gold sandals.

195
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,980
Oh, yes.

196
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,780
That was the gift from Master Ren when you were giving her the birthday present.

197
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,980
Didn't you say that you were too protective?

198
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,180
Don't bring it with you.

199
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,180
You go find it out.

200
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,580
This time, Fang Ying will rely on her.

201
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,980
Jiang Xue Ning, which door do you want to draw?

202
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,580
What are you here for?

203
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,180
I am also a copper window.

204
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,380
Why must I face this wind?

205
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,380
Fang Ying is in the house.

206
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,980
Why don't you take out one?

207
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,580
You are so coincidental that she went out to pray.

208
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,380
Tang Er.

209
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,780
This is a good deal.

210
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,980
You can sell it in the lake.

211
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,780
In the future, we will have some misunderstandings.

212
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,780
Today, I gave you a gift to express my feelings.

213
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,780
Fang Ying...

214
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:07,580
Anyway, I hope that you won't mention about yesterday's matter again.

215
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,580
Tell me about it in the palace.

216
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,780
You also know that I am in charge of the house.

217
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,780
I am not as responsible as you.

218
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,780
I am not as responsible as you.

219
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,780
I am not as responsible as you.

220
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,180
If my parents find out about this,

221
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,180
I am afraid that...

222
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,380
Xue Ning has thanked you.

223
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,780
They are so nice.

224
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,380
They are so nice.

225
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,180
Okay.

226
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:56,180
The second floor of the river is a famous place.

227
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,980
It's so nice.

228
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,180
It's still the same.

229
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,980
Okay, please wait.

230
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,780
When we are here,

231
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:06,580
there is another coffin to find her.

232
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,380
Young Master Yu.

233
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,380
Miss Tang Er.

234
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,980
You are so generous.

235
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,980
How is it going?

236
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,180
I am so glad to see you.

237
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,780
Miss, this Miss Jiang Er is a bad temper.

238
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,780
Why is she so weak today?

239
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:28,180
Yes. She and Fang Ying were together for decades.

240
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,380
She also said that yesterday's matter.

241
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,780
What did they do in the dark?

242
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:36,580
How could Fang Ying, the little bitch, not even dare to say anything?

243
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,180
I saw that there were some cats in there.

244
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,580
If she wasn't so heartless, why would she do that?

245
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,180
I asked the tent to cooperate.

246
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,380
The house didn't lose any money.

247
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,180
How did Fang Ying and that Ji Bai Liang come here?

248
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,180
And this Jiang Xue Ning, a girl from the countryside.

249
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,180
Even if there is a cloth in the house,

250
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,980
she wouldn't be able to send such a valuable gift.

251
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,980
That's not right.

252
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,180
Xiao Cui, go to the inn to find out what happened yesterday.

253
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,780
Yes.

254
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,580
It was all for me.

255
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,580
Didn't Miss Fang Ying tell you that

256
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,580
we are here to do business and make a fortune together?

257
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,580
How can we be so fake?

258
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,580
Okay.

259
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,180
It turns out that Jiang Xue Ning was secretly doing business in the house

260
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,980
and made money from the private property.

261
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,180
No wonder she was so generous to send a gift.

262
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,380
No wonder everyone in the palace likes her and gave her to her.

263
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,780
It turns out that she has money to be a ghost.

264
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,380
Miss San is right.

265
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,580
Since she knows that she is a person of the human nature,

266
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,380
she won't tell us that she has money to make money.

267
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,180
Isn't that because she can't find a way out?

268
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,580
It's the same with the building.

269
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,180
I was just looking at her.

270
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,780
When I received the money from Jiang Xue Ning in the palace,

271
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,180
she was so happy.

272
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,780
Miss, why don't we tell Bo Yan

273
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,380
that Madam will marry that little bitch to an old husband?

274
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,780
Idiot. Is it time to punish her?

275
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,980
Since business is so bad,

276
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,780
why can't I do what Jiang Xue Ning did?

277
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,780
That's right.

278
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,580
But we don't have money, Miss.

279
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,880
Jiang Xue Ning, for the sake of Yan Shitong's

280
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,080
ability to do business,

281
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,180
you are willing to pay such a huge price.

282
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,180
If there is another big thing,

283
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,180
she will not just give me the money.

284
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,380
Second Sister, where are you taking me?

285
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,380
Second Sister, what do you want me to do?

286
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:00,180
Third Miss, you should stay in the room.

287
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,380
When the time comes, we will of course ask you to go back.

288
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,380
Okay?

289
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,180
But...

290
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,980
How can you talk so much nonsense?

291
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,180
I will give you a chance to be punished.

292
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,580
Later, if you listen to me, I will not trouble you.

293
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,980
Okay?

294
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,180
Third Miss, go in.

295
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,980
Miss, don't worry. I have already called Xiao Er over there.

296
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,180
Later, when the people's will comes back,

297
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,180
I will let her go to the room and give her some wine.

298
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,780
Miss, you are not married yet.

299
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,580
You are living with strangers for a whole day.

300
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,380
Is this a marriage or what?

301
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,780
In this battle, there are people coming and going.

302
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,580
I think that one day, you will be able to spread the word of the whole city.

303
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,180
By then, I will go to Jiang's Mansion and report to Jiang Xue Ning.

304
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,580
I will tell her that the girl in my mansion is a bad girl.

305
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,380
Even if she is trying to make things worse for the sake of Xishi,

306
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,780
she will still not let me make a mistake.

307
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,380
You are so smart.

308
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,380
It seems that you are not able to read the book in the palace.

309
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,180
If you know about Qing Yuan's work,

310
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,380
you will be the last one to think about it.

311
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,380
Jiang Xue Ning, you...

312
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,980
Why are you here?

313
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,980
I came to see your good play.

314
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,980
It's such a waste to make a smart play.

315
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,580
You are a prince.

316
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,180
What exactly do you want to do?

317
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,180
I should ask you this.

318
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,980
Fang Yi is your sister.

319
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,780
I am not a sister.

320
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,380
I should ask you this.

321
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,380
Fang Yi is your sister.

322
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,180
I didn't expect that you would do such a thing.

323
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,180
You are not only a leader, but also a person who will destroy the people.

324
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,380
You are really a traitor.

325
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,380
Miss You, why are you hitting people?

326
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,180
I...

327
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,980
You are crazy. Who are you going to show me?

328
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,780
Fine. I will really hit you today. How can you do that to me?

329
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,180
Did you hit Miss Jiang?

330
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,980
Oh my god. Who would do this to me?

331
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,780
Say it again.

332
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,380
You can bully me as you like, but Miss Jiang is a good person.

333
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,380
I don't want you to bully her.

334
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,180
You are crazy!

335
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,380
Let go of me!

336
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,980
Miss!

337
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,980
Miss!

338
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,580
Miss, wait for me!

339
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,980
Let go!

340
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,780
Miss, Miss, let's not go up and stop for a while.

341
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,780
You can't come. You don't want to be punished by the court.

342
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,980
More importantly, you want to make Fang Yi understand.

343
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,980
Stand up.

344
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,180
That's why she wants to get a hold of herself.

345
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,980
It's for the sake of the memory.

346
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,980
You little brat. You dare to hit me? You are dead.

347
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,380
I am hitting you.

348
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,380
Miss!

349
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,780
In the future, you dare to bully Miss Jiang again.

350
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,780
Miss!

351
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,180
Miss Jiang! Miss Sun, stop hitting our Miss Jiang!

352
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,180
No, no.

353
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,980
I think you even forgot your surname and everything.

354
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,580
And you, Jiang Xue Ning.

355
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,380
I never saw you being so despicable and despicable.

356
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,180
Miss You Er.

357
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,180
You are just a bloody liar.

358
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,380
I am just a commoner.

359
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,580
I came here today to thank you.

360
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,380
Who knows that I will meet Fang Ying and get hurt?

361
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,580
Miss Jiang Xue Ning.

362
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,580
Miss.

363
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,580
What did you say?

364
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,980
You are the enemy. She is the tree.

365
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,580
You are the leader. She is the right.

366
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,980
The enemy teaches the tree girl to be the best in the world.

367
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,180
But the sun shines on the earth and the sun rises.

368
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,580
She is so rude.

369
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,180
She is not only being rude to you,

370
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,780
but also hurt your life.

371
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,180
Is there any way to do it?

372
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,780
Everyone, is that right?

373
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,180
That's right.

374
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,380
What is it?

375
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,380
What is it?

376
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,380
What is it?

377
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,380
What is it?

378
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,380
What is it?

379
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,380
What is it?

380
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,380
What is it?

381
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,380
What is it?

382
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,380
What is it?

383
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,380
What is it?

384
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,780
Miss, don't worry.

385
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,380
We will make it.

386
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,380
That's right.

387
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,380
What is it?

388
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,380
What is it?

389
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,380
What is it?

390
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,380
What is it?

391
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,380
What is it?

392
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,380
You are in such a big trouble.

393
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,380
How can you be so easily embarrassed?

394
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,380
Let's call the police.

395
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,380
What?

396
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,380
Are you crazy?

397
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,380
Look.

398
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,380
You are so muddleheaded.

399
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,380
You are not a good person.

400
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,380
If you don't let him be punished by law,

401
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,380
you can't let all the girls in the capital

402
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,380
come to the school.

403
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,380
Who will be able to follow the court?

404
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,380
We must lock him up in the jail for several months.

405
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,380
To keep him safe.

406
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,380
That's right.

407
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,380
Keep him safe.

408
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,380
We must keep him safe.

409
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,380
That's right.

410
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,380
We must keep him safe.

411
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,380
Who is it?

412
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,380
Who wants to keep him safe?

413
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,380
Why is there a new guard?

414
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,380
Why is there a new guard?

415
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,380
Why is there a new guard?

416
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,380
Such a big problem.

417
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,380
What is going on?

418
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,380
Why is there a new guard?

419
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,380
The guards are all here.

420
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,380
I don't know.

421
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,380
The guards are the most cruel and cowardly.

422
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,380
I'm afraid this girl is going to be in trouble.

423
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,380
Is that so?

424
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,380
I'm so lucky.

425
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,380
She is so serious.

426
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,380
Speak.

427
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,380
Didn't you hear what our lord said?

428
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,380
Who wants to report?

429
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,380
Him.

430
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,380
It's nothing.

431
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,380
Don't talk nonsense.

432
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,380
You were so loud just now.

433
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,380
You heard the deaf.

434
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,380
My lord.

435
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,380
But it's a small matter.

436
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,380
Don't report it.

437
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,380
How can it be a small matter?

438
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,380
Miss Yuan'er was so loud just now.

439
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,380
But the deaf is calling for help.

440
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,380
Is what he said true?

441
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,380
Please investigate it.

442
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,380
The person who did it is actually my uncle's daughter.

443
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,380
And he didn't call for help.

444
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,380
Go back.

445
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,380
Go back and let my father punish her.

446
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,380
Don't chase after her.

447
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,380
How can that be?

448
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,380
There are laws and regulations in the country.

449
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,380
If you are in the uncle's office,

450
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,380
you can't control the others.

451
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,380
But if you are in the outside office,

452
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,380
you need to control the laws and regulations.

453
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,380
It's a fight and a fight.

454
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,380
If you are in the wrong,

455
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,380
you want to kill someone and kill them.

456
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,380
Isn't that serious?

457
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,380
What's wrong with you?

458
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,380
She said she won't pursue you.

459
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,380
What do you want?

460
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,380
What do you want?

461
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,380
Recently, there are rebels in the capital.

462
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,380
His majesty has been ordered by the emperor.

463
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,380
Don't believe in the information.

464
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,380
You are...

465
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,380
You are ordered by the emperor?

466
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,380
You are colluding with the rebel party.

467
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,380
Guards.

468
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,380
Take them all back to the prison.

469
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,380
Yes.

470
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,380
Xiao Cui.

471
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,380
Xiao Cui.

472
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,380
Xiao Cui.

473
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,380
Xiao Cui.

474
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,380
Let me go.

475
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,380
Let me go.

476
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,380
Let me go.

477
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,380
Let me go.

478
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,380
You are the rebel of the princess.

479
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,380
You are the enemy of the Qingyuan's government.

480
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,380
You are against me.

481
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,380
Let me go.

482
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,380
Let me go.

483
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,380
Let me go.

484
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,380
Where are you taking me?

485
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,380
Let me go.

486
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,380
I didn't do anything.

487
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,380
I didn't do anything.

488
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,380
Let me go.

489
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,380
Let me go.

490
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,380
Let me go.

491
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,380
How dare you take me like this?

492
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,380
Who are you? Go inside.

493
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,380
Go inside.

494
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,380
Let me go.

495
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,380
Go.

496
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,380
Why did you lock me up?

497
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,380
Let me go.

498
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,380
I didn't do anything.

499
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,380
I didn't do anything.

500
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,380
I didn't do anything.

501
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,380
Look.

502
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,380
Someone is coming.

503
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,380
Miss.

504
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,380
Miss.

505
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,380
Miss.

506
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,380
Miss.

507
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,380
What's wrong?

508
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,380
I can't find her.

509
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,380
Go inside.

510
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,380
Miss Jiang.

511
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,380
Miss Jiang.

512
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,380
Did you arrange all these?

513
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,380
Miss.

514
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,380
I am the most familiar brother in the world.

515
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,380
You can talk slowly.

516
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,380
I will wait outside.

517
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,380
Miss Jiang.

518
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,380
What happened today?

519
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,380
You were acting well in the inn.

520
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,380
Did you make a decision?

521
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,380
You want to act well.

522
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:43,380
But why do you help them?

523
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,380
Not only help them.

524
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,380
Help ourselves.

525
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:56,380
You saved everything that happened today.

526
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,380
Fang Ying.

527
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,380
Fang Ying.

528
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,380
I am willing to be a servant.

529
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,380
No one is good to you.

530
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,380
I just want to ask you something.

531
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,380
If you lose the reputation of the mansion,

532
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,380
and you are in this prison,

533
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,380
would you like to do it?

534
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,380
It's okay.

535
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,380
Miss Jiang.

536
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,380
If it wasn't for you,

537
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,380
I might have died in the mansion.

538
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,380
I don't want any reputation.

539
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,380
I am willing to live here forever.

540
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,380
I will never go back.

541
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,380
I know what to do

542
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,380
with your words.

543
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,380
You are in this place.

544
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,380
If you need anything,

545
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,380
just tell Mr. Zhou.

546
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,380
I will arrange the rest.

547
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,380
But...

548
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,380
But my second sister won't be embarrassed.

549
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,380
She will definitely take revenge on you.

550
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,380
And what's more,

551
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,380
this...

552
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,380
Silly girl.

553
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,380
Don't you believe me?

554
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,380
You are not willing to be embarrassed.

555
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,380
That's good.

556
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,380
I will return your injury to her.

557
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,380
Miss.

558
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,380
The oil is not a burden anymore.

559
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,380
What should we do with the two in prison?

560
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,380
I am the one in prison.

561
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,380
Mr. Zhou, you can do it.

562
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,380
As for the other one,

563
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,380
he is not kind and stupid.

564
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,380
If he doesn't learn to be good,

565
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,380
he will be a bad person in the future.

566
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,380
The uncle's family is in trouble.

567
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,380
I heard that he has three shares of the wealth.

568
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,380
The daughter of the Ta family is always willing to be punished.

569
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,380
Mr. Zhou, you are right.

570
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,380
Yes.

571
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,380
Mr. Zhou, you are willing to see me?

572
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,380
Of course, I am grateful to you.

573
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:36,380
Sir, there are three thousand taels of silver here.

574
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,380
Please take care of my daughter.

575
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,380
Please take care of my daughter.

576
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,380
Please take care of my daughter.

577
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,380
Why do you say that?

578
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,380
If you really have nothing to do with the Xunxin Bureau,

579
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,380
of course, there will be nothing.

580
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,380
If you really have nothing to do with the Xunxin Bureau,

581
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,380
of course, there will be nothing.

582
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,380
Then, send her back.

583
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,380
The most time is seven or eight days.

584
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,380
Well...

585
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,380
Boye, you really have taken my surname Weiya.

586
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,380
You are so casual in the city.

587
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,380
Is your relationship with the Nidang?

588
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,380
We will find out.

589
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:21,380
I can't do anything about the surname Weiya.

590
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,380
You should go back.

591
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,380
No, no, no.

592
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,380
Well...

593
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,380
Nidang?

594
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,380
My daughter will never have any relationship with the Nidang.

595
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,380
Sir, did you make a mistake?

596
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,380
Well...

597
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,380
Sir,

598
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:41,380
there are 13,000 taels of silver in total.

599
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:44,380
It's already my uncle's ability.

600
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,380
My daughter was born and raised.

601
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,380
She didn't suffer much.

602
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,380
She has always been in love at home.

603
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,380
Even if she makes a mistake,

604
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,380
she can't love anyone else.

605
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:58,380
Sir Zhou, please forgive me.

606
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,380
Boye, you really love your daughter.

607
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,380
You make me feel so sorry for you.

608
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,380
Well, I sent someone to help you.

609
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,380
Tomorrow morning, you will lead the way.

610
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,380
Thank you, sir.

611
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,380
Boye, there is a brief explanation.

612
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,380
If Miss Weiya is released,

613
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,380
what about the other one?

614
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,380
As long as you can't love uncle,

615
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,380
how can you deal with the silver?

616
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,380
I will never interfere.

617
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,380
That's good.

618
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,380
Xu Yan.

619
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,380
Someone is here.

620
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,380
Who?

621
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,380
Miss Jiang.

622
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,380
Hello, Miss Ren Ying.

623
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,380
What are you doing here?

624
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,380
Me?

625
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,380
I'm changing the jewelry for you.

626
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,380
Go and check.

627
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:17,380
What is she doing these days?

628
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,380
Yes.

629
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,380
I just heard that there are five of these.

630
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,380
You have so many.

631
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,380
You are so stubborn.

632
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,380
Don't be so hard-hearted.

633
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,380
You wasted such a good time.

634
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,380
Get out.

635
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,380
You are so stubborn.

636
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,380
You are so stubborn.

637
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,380
You are so stubborn.

638
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,380
You are so stubborn.

639
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,380
You are so stubborn.

640
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,380
You are so stubborn.

641
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,380
Come on.

642
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,380
Eat out, brother.

643
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,380
Miss.

644
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,380
This sum is 10,000 taels.

645
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,380
I'm sure I'll be relieved.

646
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,940
Today, the people in the Manor

647
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,860
took that oil moon away.

648
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,060
But it's not worth mentioning to Miss You San.

649
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,180
You spent a lot of oil moon.

650
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,420
The Manor won't draw another round of wrongs.

651
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,500
So it's hard to let go.

652
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,500
Please give me more points

653
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,220
in the Manor.

654
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,220
Although we can't solve all the problems,

655
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,140
at least

656
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,180
it's worth it to let the monkey master

657
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,020
to talk less about some mistakes.

658
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,460
The monkey master is in a bad health.

659
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,940
Please take care of him.

660
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:49,420
Yes.

661
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:49,940
Yes.

662
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,860
Thanks to your help,

663
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,300
we can help you.

664
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,300
This is for you.

665
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:54,900
Well,

666
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,940
you should be my son.

667
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,100
I told you,

668
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,660
you're a small man.

669
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,900
I'm doing this for you.

670
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:02,940
I won't treat you badly

671
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,180
if you help me.

672
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,380
Please take it.

673
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:07,820
Okay.

674
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,980
As for the rest,

675
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,980
please give it to Fang Ying for me.

676
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,260
She needs to stay here for a few days.

677
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,740
She needs to do something for me.

678
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,580
You don't need to stop her.

679
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,260
Well, don't worry.

680
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,420
I'll take care of Miss You San.

681
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,420
But

682
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,340
you've done so much for her.

683
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,300
How about I help you

684
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,220
bring a painting to her?

685
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,220
No need.

686
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,340
Don't mention anything.

687
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,100
It's better not to let her know

688
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,220
it's my intention.

689
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,580
I'm doing this

690
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,540
because I owe her.

691
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,660
I don't want anything else.

692
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,500
You.

693
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,580
Wu Wei.

694
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,740
Your Majesty and Duke Xue

695
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,940
are the most ruthless people

696
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,580
in the world.

697
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,620
Jiang Boyou

698
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,260
is also a master of the imperial court.

699
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,940
What's the point of our family?

700
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,620
It's good to be able to help the emperor

701
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,180
to pass down the imperial edict.

702
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,620
Do you want to

703
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,060
die with us?

704
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:58,980
I'll kill you.

705
00:30:59,060 --> 00:30:59,820
Don't hit me.

706
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,620
Don't hit me.

707
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,220
Don't hit me, Master.

708
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,100
You're going to

709
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,420
attack the imperial palace.

710
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,780
My lady.

711
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,660
This is a new place.

712
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,940
It's a place of concubines.

713
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,780
If you make a mistake,

714
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,660
you'll be in trouble.

715
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,500
My lady.

716
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,060
Besides,

717
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,660
he did this.

718
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,780
How can you get into the palace?

719
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,580
I'm willing to die

720
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,700
if I'm defeated again.

721
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,340
You can't abandon this person.

722
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,460
Listen.

723
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,660
From now on,

724
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,900
you just stay in the mansion

725
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,580
and stay here forever.

726
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,100
You can't go out.

727
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,100
Or I'll break your legs.

728
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:36,980
Master.

729
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,980
Master.

730
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,780
Father.

731
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,060
Father.

732
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,620
You...

733
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,660
Master Xie.

734
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,460
Why are you here?

735
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,060
I've known about

736
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,180
the new place for a few days.

737
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,380
Thank you, Master Zhou.

738
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,660
You've taken care of me.

739
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,540
Yes.

740
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,100
No.

741
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,260
I'm just...

742
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,260
It's just

743
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,940
the prison is a mess.

744
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:05,980
It's not convenient

745
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,180
to see a woman

746
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,140
enter and leave the house.

747
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,020
Please keep an eye on me.

748
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,420
Don't say what you shouldn't.

749
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,180
Yes.

750
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,180
Don't worry.

751
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,700
I'll deal with it.

752
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:17,660
Let's go.

753
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,580
Where to?

754
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,420
I sneaked out.

755
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,100
I'll be waiting for me.

756
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,860
You'll tell me when you see the letter.

757
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,980
You haven't been in love for a long time.

758
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,660
You're still using me

759
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,860
to teach you the way to get into the prison.

760
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,060
You're so talkative.

761
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,020
But I didn't bring the letter.

762
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,140
Come to me if you need anything.

763
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,500
Your Highness.

764
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,060
Here.

765
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,500
This is from Miss Jiang.

766
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,500
Take it away.

767
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,220
This...

768
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,220
Your Highness.

769
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,740
You left 3000 taels of money.

770
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,940
If Miss Jiang finds out...

771
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,260
Who said she didn't know?

772
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,180
There are some things

773
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,900
that I can't find.

774
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,140
It's okay.

775
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,580
Did you know where you made the mistake?

776
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,580
Yes.

777
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,740
I made the money for the police

778
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,500
and the money for the family.

779
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,940
It's all for the Yanling.

780
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,500
This is what you should tell me.

781
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,340
But you've been assassinated by His Lordship.

782
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,740
Didn't you tell me?

783
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,780
I'm not in a hurry.

784
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,020
What about the second day?

785
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,780
You entered the palace early in the morning.

786
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,020
You were scolded by the teacher

787
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,500
and scolded me with a head-to-head.

788
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,020
Didn't you say you were serious?

789
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,340
Sir.

790
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,140
We're in the same boat now.

791
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,180
We're in the same boat.

792
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,380
If you hide and hide anything from me,

793
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,540
how can I cooperate with you?

794
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,660
I've been in a lot of trouble these days.

795
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,820
Before I left the palace,

796
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,740
His Lordship asked me to go to the trial.

797
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,380
I was not smart.

798
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,340
I was already suspected.

799
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,500
He said I was wrong.

800
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,780
It's obviously you who's wrong.

801
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,580
Forget it.

802
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,540
I'm a little girl.

803
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,940
Since you said you were in a good mood,

804
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,220
let's have a good time.

805
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,180
Let's talk about what happened on the day.

806
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,780
Did you see that?

807
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,460
What do you mean?

808
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,140
You're a devil.

809
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,380
Mr. Kui is still worried about you.

810
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,380
He's so rude.

811
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,540
Enough. Let's go.

812
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,220
Let's go.

813
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,500
I will tear you up if you want to.

814
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,140
Let me see.

815
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,300
It's so strange.

816
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,100
The first Light Excavcrosnuts

817
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,500
came with all those news.

818
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,660
He gave everything.

819
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,460
What makes them sell the Yan family?

820
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:40,900
Didn'turas sell them couldn't get any good?

821
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,780
Let's see over that.

822
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,780
It's on the way back to the capital from Tongzhou.

823
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,780
The Xue family secretly knows about this

824
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,780
when they know that someone is guarding the camp.

825
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,780
They are planning to buy a house in the middle of the road.

826
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:53,780
But how did the Nidang know about this?

827
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,780
Can they have time to see the poison?

828
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,780
Unless...

829
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:01,780
Unless the Nidang is also in the Tongzhou camp.

830
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,780
This is troublesome.

831
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:05,780
The Xue family is struggling to find the evidence to prove the Yan family's rebellion.

832
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,780
If there is any evidence of the Yan family's rebellion,

833
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,780
then how can the Yan family be able to wash it off?

834
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,780
I have a clue about this.

835
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,780
After the day of the ceremony, you should go to school.

836
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,780
I am here to help you.

837
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:21,780
Also, your business is not good enough to help the Lv Xuan.

838
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,780
If she is here, there should be no trouble.

839
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,780
Thank you for your help.

840
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,780
Also, after you enter the palace,

841
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,780
the Empress Dowager and the Xue family must be careful.

842
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,780
Sheng Xing Ci's palace maid is dead.

843
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,780
Next, their plan will be on your side.

844
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,780
Don't worry, sir.

845
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,780
I have my own plan to deal with them.

846
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,780
Great Princess,

847
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,780
let's go to home.

848
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,780
Then you may just have a time out.

849
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,780
Okay.

850
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,780
motive B

851
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,780
You seem to come pick me up today.

852
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,780
What's the matter?

853
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,160
MC

854
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,740
Don't raised

855
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,480
So in this way, I was the one to decide

856
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,860
But someone cut me clean

857
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,560
There's something wrong

858
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:47,780
But that person has always been afraid of the treasure.

859
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:52,780
What do you think he is for?

860
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,780
Do you know who is the one who is afraid of himself?

861
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,780
I do.

862
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,780
You know?

863
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:16,780
I saw him three months ago.

864
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,780
I was so surprised that I knew who he is.

865
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,780
Why didn't you tell me?

866
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,780
What can I say?

867
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,780
I just met him.

868
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,780
I couldn't even recognize him.

869
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,780
Can I take him to Pan's Mansion?

870
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,780
It turns out that Jiang Xue would have known Shen Jie's identity.

871
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,780
She knew that I intentionally kicked her.

872
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,780
But she didn't take me in.

873
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,780
She didn't take me in.

874
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,780
She would have been so proud of me.

875
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:53,780
So, you know everything.

876
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,780
You know that I'm stealing your things.

877
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,780
But you never say anything.

878
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,780
You never make any moves.

879
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,780
You even think that you don't know anything.

880
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:09,780
But you were always making me feel sorry for you.

881
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,780
I'm not making you feel sorry.

882
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,780
I owe you.

883
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,780
I always want to give you back.

884
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,780
So, I can feel better.

885
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,780
You feel better.

886
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,780
What about me?

887
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,780
You never say anything.

888
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,780
You think that you are a man of honor.

889
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,780
You feel sorry for me.

890
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,780
But you treat me as your brother.

891
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,780
You are the good sister on the cliff.

892
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,780
You are the one who is not a man of honor.

893
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,780
You are the one who is always making me feel sorry for you.

894
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,780
I didn't think that much.

895
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,780
I don't care how you treat me as your brother.

896
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,780
But I don't need you to use this method to make me feel sorry for you.

897
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,780
You are the one who is afraid of others.

898
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,780
You are the one who is not afraid of others.

899
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,780
I will ask Tang Er to send her a letter.

900
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,780
Ask her to go to Baiguo Temple.

901
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,780
Do you want to go to the blind spot?

902
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:59,780
Why did you tell me this?

903
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,780
I am not a good person.

904
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,780
But I always want to make sure of your feelings.

905
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,780
If you love this person,

906
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:12,780
then I will not use you for what I want to do.

907
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,780
Your Highness, we have been waiting for half an hour.

908
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,780
Miss Jiang Er said that she can find the person you want to see.

909
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,780
I am not lying to you.

910
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,780
And how did she know about this?

911
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,780
It was a decree to tell her.

912
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,780
It's okay. She is here.

913
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,780
Wait a minute.

914
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,780
Okay.

915
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,780
I will go to the blind spot.

916
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,780
I will go to the blind spot.

917
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,780
I will go to the blind spot.

918
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,780
I will go to the blind spot.

919
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,780
I will go to the blind spot.

920
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,780
I will go to the blind spot.

921
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,780
Wait a minute.

922
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,780
Okay.

923
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,780
Xiaoci, do you have a hand?

924
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,780
Wait for me here.

925
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,780
Remember, don't mess around.

926
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,780
The Xinyu Jiang School is like a garden.

927
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,780
It's so good.

928
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,780
I feel healthy.

929
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,780
I will stay in the palace safe and sound.

930
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,780
I am here.

931
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,780
I am very lucky.

932
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,780
I am lucky to have you here.

933
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,780
I have a good time.

934
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,780
I am very lucky.

935
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,780
Please take care of me.

936
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,780
I can get to know you

937
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,780
and know you better.

938
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,780
I will be happy.

939
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,780
This is the red one.

940
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,780
Let's go.

941
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,780
It's so cold.

942
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,780
Sir,

943
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,780
this is the safe place.

944
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,780
Please don't do this.

945
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:38,780
Miss You's life is so good.

946
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,780
You are hiding something.

947
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,780
You have seen it.

948
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,780
Excuse me, are you...

949
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,780
I am Lv Xian.

950
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,780
You are Mr. Lv.

951
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,780
Mr. Zhou told me

952
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,780
you are here to teach me business.

953
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,780
You are so good.

954
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,780
They say that money can be used to push the devil.

955
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,780
Miss You is not worth it.

956
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,780
It's more than my mansion.

957
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:08,780
It's worth the money.

958
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,780
Tell me.

959
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:24,780
Which step did you talk to Ren Weizhi?

960
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,780
I have signed the contract.

961
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,780
How much did you invest?

962
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,780
1000 taels.

963
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,780
1000 taels.

964
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:34,780
You are a rich man.

965
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,780
My ancestors.

966
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:38,780
The Chotong Police

967
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,780
failed to get to know the city.

968
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:43,780
You have to give it to them.

969
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,780
Don't you worry that he will be gone.

970
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,780
No, I have to go.

971
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,780
Chase him back.

972
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,780
Lv... Lv...

973
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,780
I am going back to the palace tomorrow.

974
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,780
You should be careful over there.

975
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,780
Don't make him suffer.

976
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,780
Don't worry.

977
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:01,780
But Miss.

978
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,780
Don't you go to see the result of Miss's visit?

979
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,780
Jiang Xuehui has been out for two hours.

980
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:06,780
She hasn't returned to the palace.

981
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:07,780
They must be looking at her.

982
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:08,780
What else can they see?

983
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,780
Let's go to see the Chotong Police.

984
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,780
Princess likes these fresh dishes.

985
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:13,780
You should bring her back.

986
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:14,780
Okay.

987
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,780
I am going to buy some.

988
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:17,780
There are many in front.

989
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,780
Zhang Zhe.

990
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:24,780
Ling'er.

991
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:25,780
You go buy the Chotong Police.

992
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:26,780
I will go there and look for it.

993
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:27,780
Let's meet in the mansion.

994
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:28,780
Miss.

995
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:29,780
Miss.

996
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:35,780
Mr. Zhang, look.

997
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,780
Why are you so angry?

998
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:38,780
It's the new fire in the palace.

999
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,780
The few little ones are cleaning up.

1000
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:41,780
There is no light.

1001
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:42,780
Is there anything you need?

1002
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,780
I just want to see.

1003
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:45,780
This time, I have to trouble you again.

1004
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,780
I can't talk about trouble.

1005
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,780
It's just a play.

1006
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:49,780
I have to do it.

1007
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,780
I don't have many treasures.

1008
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:52,780
Try your best.

1009
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:53,780
If you don't repair it well,

1010
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,780
the money you need to repair it

1011
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:56,780
will be less.

1012
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,780
Okay.

1013
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:24,780
Mr. Zhang, you are so strong.

1014
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:32,780
Miss Jiang, you come to see the ancient play?

1015
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,780
Then, please give me a word.

1016
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,780
I only know that you are good at the short-term case.

1017
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,780
I didn't expect that you would repair the ancient play.

1018
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:41,780
It's just that

1019
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,780
Xue Ning has some strategies for this.

1020
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,780
I don't know if I can help you.

1021
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:46,780
You can.

1022
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:47,780
I can't talk about the play.

1023
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:50,780
But it should be enough to help you.

1024
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:51,780
It should be enough.

1025
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:58,780
Have a seat, sir.

1026
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:52,780
The wind is blowing.

1027
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:56,780
The dream is not coming true.

1028
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:06,780
But the floating sand is falling down.
