Not only does Mr. Dingfei's identity

71
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,430
concern the Xue family,

72
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,300
but it also concerns state affairs.

73
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,900
Back then, Viscount Dingfei

74
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,370
was a loyal subject who protected his ruler.

75

And now, Mr. Dingfei

76
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,290
contributed to pacifying the rebellion.

77
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,420
Back in Tongzhou,

78
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,260
the Duke couldnâ€™t believe that he was Mr. Dingfei.

But I just don't understand.

If such a loyal and brave man

81
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,780
is not the son of the Duke,

82
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,510
who else could he be?

83
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,420
Your Majesty,

84
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,530
the scar behind his ear

85
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,980
is the same as my son's scar.

86
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,020
But I was focused on dealing with the rebels back then

87
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,050
and couldn't attend to other matters.

88
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,060
I have to thank Junior Preceptor Xie for this.

89
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,870
Ever since Dingfei was young,

90
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,520
I've taught him

91
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,000
to be loyal to the emperor and the nation.

92
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,740
Now that he has helped pacify the rebellion in Tongzhou

93
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,140
and returned with merit.

94
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,170

Heaven has blessed the State of Qian

and safely returned Viscount Dingfei to us.

102

The Duke's loyalty is unrivaled.

103
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,800
From now on,

104
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,170
you are Xie Wei's substitute.

105
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,920
From now on,

106
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,540
your name

107
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,950
is Xue Dingfei.

108
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,670
Back then, if it weren't for Dingfei,

109
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,690
I would have long died.

110
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,500
Now, it's thanks to you that the rebellion is pacified.

There's one more thing I don't understand.

114
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,890
Please answer me, Mr. Dingfei.

115
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,990
He is the Justice Minister, Mr. Gu Chunfang.

116
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,680
He is also Mr. Zhang's mentor.

117
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,280
Back when Lord Pingnan rebelled,

118
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,690
he wreaked havoc in the capital in order to find the Crown Prince.

119
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,360
Mr. Dingfei, you presented yourself in the name of the Crown Prince.

120
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,810
The rebels must have been wary of you.

121
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,350
How did you survive?

122
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,780
Your Majesty,

123
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,340
what happened back then

124
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,540
is related to the pursuit of the rebels.

125
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,170
So I think

126
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,430
we should discuss this in private.

127
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,750
You're wrong, Duke.

128
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,490
It's precisely because it's important

129
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,140
that we should make it clear in court.

130
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,800
The case of the 300 Loyal Souls

131
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,820
is a tragedy of the State of Qian.

132
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,650
All the officials need an explanation.

133
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,020
Official Zhang is right.

134
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:46,730
Dingfei.

135
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,070
Go on.

136
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,280
Yes.

137
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,190
I'm ashamed to say this,

138
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,900
but that battle back then

139
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,770
was particularly bloody.

140
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,570
I was only six or seven years old.

141
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,210
I was so scared, I passed out.

142
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,230
When I woke up,

143
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,280
I was already captured

144
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,440
by that rebel and taken to Jinling.

145
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,860
Even if you can't remember the battle,

146
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,720
you should still remember

147
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,740
what happened in Jinling, right?

148
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,270
That old man, Lord Pingnan,

149
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,230
imprisoned me in Jinling.

150
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,420
I sought death several times, but failed to do so.

151
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,480
So I wanted to know

152
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,980
what his plan was.

153
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,050
For many years, I pretended to obey him.

154
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,650
At last, I found out by chance

155
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,090
that he wanted to gain my loyalty

156
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,350
so that one day, he could

157
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,320
send me back to the capital,

158
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,210
and I could rely on my bloodline

159
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,420
to legitimately take over

160
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,350
the troops in Xingwu and Tongzhou.

161
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,690
Then, I'd become his puppet.

162
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,250
How could Lord Pingnan be so sinister?

163
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,640
You must have suffered

164
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,620
a lot of beatings and interrogations in the past few years.

165
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,980
It's all in the past.

166
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,159
I solely focused on

167
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,050
helping the court in secret.

168
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,740
I happened to find out that the rebel Feng Mingyu

169
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,800
brought a lot of gunpowder to Tongzhou.

170
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,580
I was afraid that if the plan had succeeded,

171
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,820
we would lose our line of defense against Jinling.

172
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,480
Therefore,

173
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,070
I tried my best to follow his men to the north.

174
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,390
I didn't expect to find Mr. Zhang

175
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,350
among the group traveling to Tongzhou.

176
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,270
That was the case.

177
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,350
The rebels suspected my identity several times when I was with them.

178
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,970
If it were not for Mr. Dingfei,

179
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,700
I would have been dead long ago.

180
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,090
You have been through a lot, Dingfei.

181
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,560
But I see your sincerity

182
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,930
and loyalty to the nation.

183
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,620
Since you've returned safely and made great contributions,

184
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,150
I shall appoint you as Commandant Zhongyong.

185
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,740
Receive your appointment from the Imperial Guards.

186
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,740
You can visit the palace as you like.

187
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,690
As for your place of residence...

188
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,820
May I ask

189
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,480
to be allowed

190
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,620
to return to the Duke's Mansion

191
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,789
so I may

192
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,450
reunite with and catch up with the Duke?

193
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,300
It's great that you're filial.

194
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:47,710
I approve of it.

195
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,610
Thank you, Your Majesty.

196
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,340
As for the other officials who contributed to matters in Tongzhou,

197
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,870
Official Gu and I will sort out the battle report.

198
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,540
Those with merits will be rewarded,

199
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,070
and those with wrongdoings will be punished.

200
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,070
Thank you, Your Majesty.

201
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,770
I prepared some wine tonight.

202
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,210
Hope you can visit my humble house, Viscount Dingfei.

203
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:15,500
That's right.

204
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,300
I'm glad you're fine, Viscount.

205
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,190
Viscount Dingfei.

206
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,540
I'm Chen Ying, Vice Minister for Justice.

207
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,540
Greetings, Commandant Zhongyong.

208
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,760
You're too polite.

209
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,840
Just call me Dingfei.

210
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,310
Nice to meet you.

211
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,240
Nice to meet you.

212
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,460
When you spoke of the past just now,

213
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,630
you referred to the Duke by his title,

214
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,040
but not as your father.

215
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,730
Is there a reason why?

216
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,020
Chen, there's something you don't know.

217
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,180
In the 20 years that I was in exile,

218
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,400
I never regretted being loyal to His Majesty.

219
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,660
But there is one regret

220
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,430
I will never forget.

221
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,440
What is it?

222
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,350
Madam Yan was my mother.

223
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,260
She passed away from worrying about me.

224
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,210
However, in less than three months,

225
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,520
the Duke remarried.

226
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,680
Even if it was the order of His Majesty,

227
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,900
I cannot help but hold a grudge.

228
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,630
You bastard!

229
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,410
What nonsense are you talking about?

230
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,340
To bring a bastard into this world,

231
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,250
you must not be a good person either.

232
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:04,720
You...

233
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,980
A nobleman from a noble family

234
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,610
remarried a woman

235
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,690
who immediately got pregnant.

236
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,700
She gave birth after just seven months,

237
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,390
but her daughter didn't have any defects.

238
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,650
In fact, she was very lively and healthy.

239
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:16,900
Duke,

240
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,010
you've let my mother down.

241
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,300
You're disrespecting your legitimate mother too?

242
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,640
How dare you!

243
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,570
I don't even want

244
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,470
to acknowledge the likes of you.

245
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,620
Let alone

246
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,400
that damn woman.

247
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,870
You unfilial son!

248
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,190
I...

249
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,310
What?

250
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,700
Are you trying to play the role of a strict father?

251
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,230
If you want me to be filial to you,

252
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,590
you might as well treat me as a rebel

253
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,410
and kill me.

254
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:48,730
Everyone,

255
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,620
today is my first day back in the capital.

256
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,620
I booked a banquet

257
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,020
at Cengxiao Restaurant.

258
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,620
If you are free,

259
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,220
we can drink together

260
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,340
and make friends.

261
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,090
Alright.

262
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,020
Viscount Dingfei.

263
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,740
Wait for me.

264
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,280
Let's go.

265
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,260
Tonight,

266
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,140
we'll drink to our heart's content.

267
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:12,770
Duke.

268
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,050
The Empress Dowager wants to see you.

269
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,820
You mean,

270
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:33,170
Duke Xue embezzled military supplies from Tongzhou's barracks?

271
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:34,820
I think

272
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,950
Duke Xue's fault is more than that.

273
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,980
Your Majesty, do you remember

274
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,970
the case of the Yan family

275
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,820
colluding with the rebels of Lord Pingnan?

276
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,280
I didn't find any evidence of their collusion

277
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,810
during my trip to Tongzhou.

278
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,060
Instead, I learned that the officer, Zhao Xin,

279
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,050
whom Duke Xue caught and claimed to be close to the rebels,

280
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,490
was the scholar who smuggled weapons

281
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,910
to the Xingwu Guards in the military supplies embezzlement case.

282
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,440
He is also Zhao Guang's son.

283
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,270
So I suspect

284
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,510
that Duke Xue did all this on purpose.

285
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,490
But Your Majesty trusted him

286
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,350
and misjudged the Yan family's case.

287
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,750
Zhang Zhe, how dare you!

288
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,970
Do you know what you are talking about?

289
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,410
Calm down, Your Majesty.

290
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,320
Mr. Zhang is a straightforward person

291
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,580
and spoke out of place.

292
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,290
But he is loyal and

293
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,280
did not mean to offend you.

294
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,940
Your Majesty.

295
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,520
Mr. Gu is right.

296
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,540
Mr. Zhang has contributed to pacifying the rebellion.

297
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,830
He is also a righteous man.

298
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,890
Please don't be angry, Your Majesty.

299
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,350
Forget it.

300
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,790
Considering your contributions this time,

301
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,450
I won't hold you accountable.

302
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,060
But don't mention

303
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,290
such nonsense again.

304
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,380
Your Majesty may not mention it,

305
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,590
but I must.

306
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,360
You...

307
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,880
The Yan family was wrongfully exiled

308
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,250
while Duke Xue hid the truth from everyone.

309
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:52,760
I

310
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,550
ask Your Majesty

311
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,460
to reopen and reinvestigate the Yan family's case.

312
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,260
Your Majesty,

313
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,220
I'm too old and weary.

314
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,140
Mr. Zhang must be tired too.

315
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,730
Let's talk about it another day.

316
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,570
Please allow

317
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,630
us to leave first.

318
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,090
Thank you, Your Majesty.

319
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:18,930
Your Majesty.

320
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,550
Let's go.

321
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,650
I don't care about the others,

322
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,080
but why did you testify for him too?

323
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,400
Your Highness,

324
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,040
when pacifying the rebellion this time,

325
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,500
the Xingwu Guards failed to handle certain matters properly.

326
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,400
His Majesty was already dissatisfied with me.

327
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,660
So I thought,

328
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,530
since we couldn't get rid of him on the way back,

329
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,450
we should keep an eye on him.

330
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,010
And this way,

331
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,600
his credit

332
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,570
naturally belongs to the Xue family as well.

333
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,950
It's not a bad call.

334
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,140
At first, there was just Zhang Zhe.

335
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,380
Then, Xie Wei went against the Xue family too.

336
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,980
Now, a bastard has returned.

337
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,440
Don't forget.

338
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,760
Back then, if it weren't for you,

339
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,090
would Lord Pingnan have killed everyone?

340
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,680
If he reveals what happened back then,

341
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,140
the entire Xue family

342
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,340
and I

343
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,190
will be targeted by the public

344
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,520
and spat on for thousands of years to come.

345
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,340
What do you think of

346
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,660
the matter reported in the book?

347
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,460
We cannot immediately conclude

348
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,750
that Due Xue was responsible for the theft of military supplies.

349
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,510
However,

350
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,340
no matter who stole it,

351
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,090
they are a hidden threat to the court.

352
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:36,920
I think

353
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,470
we should let Mr. Zhang find out the truth.

354
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,700
You're right.

355
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,670
Speaking of Duke Xue,

356
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,670
don't you think

357
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,800
his reaction in court

358
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,790
was weird today?

359
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,860
Did you notice it too?

360
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,840
Now that he's moving into my mansion,

361
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,790
if he tries anything funny,

362
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,080
I will definitely

363
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,270
get rid of him.

364
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,020
But since His Majesty

365
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,700
has conferred on him the title of loyalty and courage...

366
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,940
How about

367
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,710
we put this matter on the back burner for now?

368
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:08,240
It's not too late to take action

369
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,970
after Shu successfully marries Lord Linzi.

370
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:11,900
Now,

371
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,590
that's all we can do.

372
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:19,850
Your Majesty.

373
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,400
I heard that

374
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,900
His Majesty had invited

375
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,850
Old Imperial Physician Zhu who has already retired

376
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,370
to check Qin's pulse.

377
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,600
He said she might be pregnant with a boy.

378
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,310
If that's the case,

379
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,120
what should we do?

380
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,470
What do you want me to do?

381
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,300
Nowadays, His Majesty keeps a tight watch on her.

382
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,480
The whole Pixiang Hall

383
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,340
is guarded to the brim.

384
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,580
What else can I do?

385
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,150
Your Majesty,

386
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,840
how is His Majesty's

387
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,290
health lately?

388
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,460
What do you mean?

389
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,590
Listen.

390
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,770
Just focus on court matters.

391
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,180
I will handle matters in the harem.

392
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,250
The Xingwu Guards failed in their duties consecutively.

393
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,650
At this critical moment,

394
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,300
the Xue family must be careful

395
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,320
to avoid being targeted.

396
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,380
Do you understand?

397
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,700
Yes.

398
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,840
Logically speaking,

399
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,210
Xue Dingfei is Duke Xue's son.

400
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,220
No one in the court wanted

401
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,520
Xue Dingfei's safe return more than him.

402
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,290
But his expression in court today

403
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,340
was not one of joy, but...

404
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:31,730
Fear?

405
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:33,530
Yes.

406
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,980
I suspect that

407
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,310
the Xue family is hiding something from me.

408
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,460
And this something

409
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,020
is no small matter.

410
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,910
Your Majesty, do you think

411
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,730
the Empress Dowager

412
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,040
knows about this?

413
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,920
Mother and Uncle

414
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,070
have always been on the same side.

415
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,530
But I know,

416
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,890
in the end, the nation is surnamed Shen,

417
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,160
not Xue.

418
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,609
Official Xie, what are you doing?

419
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,700
Thanks to Your Majesty's grace,

420
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:14,849
I know where your filial piety lies.

421
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:17,160
Now that I know your determination,

422
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,099
I shall do my best

423
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,900
to protect Shen's nation for Your Majesty.

424
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:24,510
Official Xie, you're too serious.

425
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,210
May I

426
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,210
please ask you

427
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,740
to give me the seal to Yan's troops

428
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,150
for safekeeping?

429
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,870
Before we figure out the Xue family's intention,

430
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,940
Yan's troops must not fall into Duke Xue's hands.

431
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,600
This way, we can ensure your safety.

432
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:49,870
Okay.

433
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,710
We'll do as you say.

434
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,030
Thank you, Your Majesty.

435
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,130
You are too straightforward.

436
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,460
His Majesty is the Emperor, after all.

437
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,660
Even if he did something wrong,

438
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,660
you shouldn't have said it that way.

439
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,160
You are right.

440
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,930
But I still think the Yan family had been wronged.

441
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,390
We have to investigate it.

442
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,530
You've worked hard.

443
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,710
During your trip,

444
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,300
was Junior Preceptor Xie acting suspiciously in any way?

445
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,190
Although he is moody,

446
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,550
he is a righteous

447
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,490
and good man.

448
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,500
There were many things that didn't make sense along the way.

449
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,070
But he saved us today.

450
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,320
So can you

451
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,630
not tell the court about those things?

452
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:41,330
Today, he suddenly brought Xue Dingfei back.

453
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,580
I found it rather strange.

454
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,410
When did he

455
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,860
establish contact with the rebels,

456
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,120
and why didn't he tell us in advance?

457
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,380
Junior Preceptor Xie is devoted to the court.

458
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,460
He even risked his life

459
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,310
to save us at Shangqing Temple.

460
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,790
There was nothing suspicious about him.

461
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,940
In that case,

462
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,830
we'll put his matters aside for now.

463
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,310
Although His Majesty didn't agree to reopen the Yan Family's case,

464
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,920
before you came back,

465
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,240
His Majesty was angry about Xue Yuan

466
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,000
escaping in the face of danger.

467
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,350
I believe the Ministry of Justice

468
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,350
can investigate the case in secret.

469
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,500
When we get more evidence,

470
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,650
we can report to His Majesty.

471
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,240
I'll go to the Ministry of Justice now.

472
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:22,860
No hurry.

473
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,250
Your mother came to me before

474
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,830
and asked me what crime you committed.

475
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,520
I couldn't tell her the truth.

476
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,460
I'm sure she must be worried about you.

477
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,390
You should go back first.

478
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:45,920
I'm sorry.

479
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,580
Please punish me.

480
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:48,570
All right.

481
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,400
No need to bow.

482
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,240
Junior Preceptor Xie told me about it.

483
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,860
Actually, Ning contributed

484
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,540
to the pacifying of the rebellion this time.

485
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:58,870
But

486
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,700
they didn't mention it to His Majesty

487
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,570
to protect her reputation from harm.

488
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,500
But Junior Preceptor Xie promised me.

489
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,330
He has also reminded Mr. Zhang and Duke Xue

490
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,630
not to mention her involvement in this matter.

491
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,290
Alright.

492
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,540
As long as we are safe.

493
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,960
This matter is over.

494
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,560
Don't mention it again.

495
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,460
Don't blame yourself too much.

496
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,060
What did you say?

497
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,790
You're just letting her go like this?

498
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,710
How dare you mess with the rebels?

499
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,670
How many lives do you have?

500
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,770
Aren't you afraid of death?

501
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,350
Mother.

502
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,070
Don't take it to heart, Sister.

503
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,930
Mother is just worried about you.

504
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,750
What am I worried about?

505
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,390
Miss Jiang here

506
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:40,960
is very ambitious.

507
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,960
She never listens to

508
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,050
what I have to say.

509
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,640
I am worried...

510
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,140
I am worried that if something happens to her,

511
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,850
the whole Jiang family will be implicated.

512
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,380
What are you talking about?

513
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,450
Mother, don't worry.

514
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,900
I'll bear the consequences myself.

515
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:03,050
I won't implicate the Jiang family.

516
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,770
What did you say?

517
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,360
You...

518
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,370
Enough.

519
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,470
Madam, you...

520
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:11,820
Enough.

521
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,400
You're going to be the death of me!

522
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,320
-Ning.
-Calm down.

523
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,830
You must be tired

524
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,000
from your trip.

525
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,380
Go back to your room and rest.

526
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,640
Let's talk about other things tomorrow.

527
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,980
Madam, what were you thinking?

528
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,680
You were worried about her every day.

529
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,060
Now that she's back,

530
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,300
you insist on saying those things instead.

531
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,960
Why do you do this to yourself?

532
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,200
I'm worried about her...

533
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,260
Miss!

534
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,870
Miss.

535
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,920
You're finally back.

536
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,700
I thought I would never see you again.

537
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,260
I burned incense and prayed

538
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,900
for your safe return every day.

539
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,300
I know you're worried.

540
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,580
I'm back now, aren't I?

541
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,060
Don't worry. It won't happen again.

542
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,530
There's nothing in Tongzhou.

543
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,820
I haven't taken a proper bath for a long time.

544
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,700
Take a sniff.

545
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:14,720
I stink.

546
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:15,780
Won't you hurry and

547
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,580
prepare hot water for your lady?

548
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:18,560
Yes.

549
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,280
I'll go get some clothes.

550
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:37,690
Wait.

551
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,010
Why haven't I seen

552
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,370
this dress before?

553
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,790
This was from Nanny Yang

554
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:43,920
on your birthday.

555
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,600
First Young Lady and you each received a set.

556
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:55,120
I thought Mother wanted me to die outside.

557
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,650
But she remembered me after all.

558
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,140
Maybe Jiang Xuehui didn't want it, so it was given to me.

559
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,030
Miss.

560
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,460
It won't be good

561
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,140
if someone hears you say that about your elders.

562
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,230
[Zhang Residence]

563
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:24,990
Mother.

564
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:31,810
Mother?

565
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:33,640
Mother.

566
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,230
Mother!

567
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,040
Mother!

568
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,460
Mother...

569
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:15,890
Wake up.

570
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,620
I'm back.

571
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,340
Wake up.

572
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,190
Mother!

573
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,650
Mother!

574
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,910
Miss!

575
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,300
What happened?

576
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,010
Don't rush.

577
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,240
I heard

578
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,780
Mr. Zhang's mother had passed away.

579
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,560
Miss Jiang, you're here.

580
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,010
Mr. Chen.

581
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,560
Where is Mr. Zhang?

582
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,470
After setting up the mourning hall

583
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,070
and laying Old Madam to rest,

584
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,400
he locked himself in his room

585
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,150
and refused to come out.

586
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,500
Mr. Zhang is a filial son.

587
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,180
Everyone in the Ministry of Justice knows that.

588
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,710
But because of this matter,

589
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,010
he lost his mother.

590
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,760
When did it happen?

591
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:03,090
When you were in Tongzhou.

592
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,370
In order to carry out the mission,

593
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,300
Mr. Zhang didn't tell his mother the truth.

594
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,160
Old Madam thought Mr. Zhang was wrongly imprisoned

595
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:12,430
and tried everywhere to seek justice for his son.

596
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,920
It was fine at first.

597
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,030
But that day,

598
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,940
it happened to snow heavily.

599
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,940
It triggered an old illness of hers.

600
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,930
This was supposed to happen after Zhou Yinzhi joined the Xue family

601
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,420
and framed Zhang Zhe.

602
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,580
Why was it brought forward instead?

603
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,330
A snowy day,

604
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,640
seeking justice for her son,

605
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,880
it's all the same.

606
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,010
Mr. Gu.

607
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:37,420
Mr. Gu.

608
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:39,330
How is he?

609
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,280
He lived with his mother for many years.

610
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:44,540
Now, he is hating himself.

611
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,380
He wouldn't even drink a sip of water.

612
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,060
He has always been stubborn.

613
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,740
Once he has made up his mind,

614
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,270
no one can persuade him to change it.

615
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:55,700
I'm afraid it'll be even harder this time.

616
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:56,800
Mr. Gu.

617
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,730
Let me try.

618
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,400
This is Minister Jiang's second daughter.

619
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,800
She knows Mr. Zhang well.

620
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:17,870
Sir.

621
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,330
Chen Ying just sent a message saying that

622
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,490
Mr. Zhang's mother

623
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,050
has passed away.

624
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,580
What a pity.

625
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,010
Zhang Zhe has just started his career.

626
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,490
I'm afraid the mourning will delay his career for three years.

627
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,440
Then, do you need someone else

628
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,730
to investigate the Xue family?

629
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,530
Since you killed Gongyi Cheng,

630
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,010
you've been setting the stage.

631
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:43,900
Step by step,

632
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,900
everyone is your pawn.

633
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,480
You can abandon them anytime

634
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,140
and kill them to silence them.

635
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,650
Mr. Zhang is in mourning.

636
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,540
I should send him my condolences.

637
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,300
Prepare the carriage.

638
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,220
I'll pay him a visit.

639
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:58,730
Yes.

640
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,630
I'm sorry.

641
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,950
If you hadn't agreed

642
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:55,000
to investigate the Yan family's case,

643
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,230
you wouldn't have gotten involved in this.

644
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,180
Then, your mother wouldn't have...

645
00:28:59,180 --> 00:28:59,910
Mr. Zhang.

646
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,670
If you must blame someone, blame me.

647
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:03,800
It's not your fault.

648
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,090
It's me.

649
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,540
I killed my mother.

650
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,190
When I was young,

651
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,920
my father was framed and imprisoned.

652
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,740
He died of injustice.

653
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,360
At the mourning hall, my mother made me swear

654
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,410
that I would become a good and just official

655
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:26,780
and investigate all the injustices in the world.

656
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,340
You did it.

657
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,360
In court,

658
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,110
no official is better than you.

659
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:34,550
I lied to my mentor today.

660
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,470
I didnâ€™t tell him about Junior Preceptor Xie.

661
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,520
As a subject, I haven't been loyal.

662
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:44,090
Mother had suffered for a long time.

663
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,900
I knew that all her life,

664
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:49,100
she only hoped that I could stand upright

665
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,560
and never let people down.

666
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,320
But because of me, she died with hatred in her heart.

667
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,530
How can a disloyal and unfilial person like me

668
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,640
be considered a good official?

669
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,270
Mother gave birth to me and raised me.

670
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,190
But I resulted in her death.

671
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,450
I couldn't even send her off.

672
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,220
I'm unfilial.

673
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:13,980
I hate

674
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,960
myself.

675
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,670
Why should I live?

676
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:29,640
No.

677
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:31,880
It's me.

678
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,870
I made you disloyal and unfilial.

679
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,730
It's my fault your mother died.

680
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,830
You are a good official

681
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,090
and a good person.

682
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,980
You should be the bright moon in the sky.

683
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,810
You are not a good-for-nothing man

684
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,210
in this muddled world.

685
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,980
Everything

686
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,720
is all my fault.

687
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,340
Miss Jiang, you don't have to do this.

688
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,760
I made all the choices.

689
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,690
It has nothing to do with you.

690
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,810
That night, when it snowed in Tongzhou,

691
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,340
I should have thought of it.

692
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,310
I knew it.

693
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,190
I should have thought of it in advance.

694
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,150
Mr. Zhang.

695
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,520
When we were in Shangqing Temple,

696
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,220
I asked you

697
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,510
if you believed in past lives.

698
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,130
Believe it

699
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,120
or not,

700
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,080
I had a dream.

701
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,000
In my dream,

702
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,310
the world misunderstood you

703
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,720
and despised you.

704
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,230
On the same snowy night,

705
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,680
she sounded the same drum of justice.

706
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,590
Old Madam yearned for justice for her son

707
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,790
and died with hatred.

708
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,080
Everything

709
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,630
really happened.

710
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:13,780
It was just a dream.

711
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:14,990
No.

712
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,170
It's me.

713
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,960
I knew that keeping you in Tongzhou

714
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:24,330
would result in Old Madam's death.

715
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,270
But for the sake of the Yan family case,

716
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,390
I didn't tell you anything.

717
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,920
Say no more.

718
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,360
I know you're not that kind of person.

719
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,660
Not that kind of person?

720
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,360
Zhang Zhe.

721
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,540
Do you really know me?

722
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,860
Ever since we met in Tai'an Hall,

723
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,800
I've known that you're tough, straightforward,

724
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,730
and have great judgment of people.

725
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,750
Regarding your engagement with Yao Xi,

726
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,240
did you really think I was upholding justice?

727
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,450
You're such a capable and upright official.

728
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:03,850
Who doesn't want to pull you closer to them?

729
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,050
Didn't you say

730
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,190
that I have a plan for everything in Tongzhou?

731
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,600
That was because I knew,

732
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,460
as long as you were by my side,

733
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,700
I could rest assured!

734
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,420
Enough!

735
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,450
Stop talking.

736
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,990
I killed your mother.

737
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,960
Yet you're still protecting me.

738
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,240
How could there be such a stupid person like you?

739
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,990
Since you've been using me for so long,

740
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,710
why don't you keep using me?

741
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,660
A person like me

742
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,260
will only spare an effort

743
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,470
for someone useful to me.

744
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,980
Now that you're leaving your job to observe mourning.

745
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,180
You're useless to me.

746
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,820
I can't be bothered to put on a show anymore.

747
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,070
Zhang Zhe.

748
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,840
Last time, you hated yourself for your mother's death

749
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:17,389
and lost the will to live.

750
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,460
This time,

751
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,300
I'll take the responsibility

752
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:23,870
for killing your mother.

753
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,949
I thought I could change fate.

754
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:29,570
But in the end,

755
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,510
these things didn't change.

756
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,929
You once lost your reputation because of me

757
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,810
and paid with your life.

758
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,120
If we continue to be together now,

759
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:45,050
I'm afraid I'll hurt you again.

760
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:47,510
If so,

761
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:50,389
I'd rather be separated from you.

762
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:53,420
Zhang Zhe.

763
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,469
I'm sorry.

764
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,740
Hate me instead.

765
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,190
I just hope that you can live on.

766
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,270
Mr. Gu.

767
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,710
Mr. Xie, you're here too.

768
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,130
Ning'er.

769
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,760
Sir, please hold on. I'll go check on her.

770
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,050
Sir.

771
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:37,980
Don't follow me.

772
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,620
You are the best person

773
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,580
I've ever met.

774
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:50,490
In that case, Your Highness,

775
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,320
I beg of you.

776
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,080
Please leave.

777
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,960
What are you doing here?

778
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,470
Are you here to laugh at me?

779
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:23,220
Your body, skin, and hair are all bestowed on you by your parents.

780
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,020
Worrying hurts the spleen, and sadness hurts the heart.

781
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,350
No matter what happens,

782
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,520
you shouldn't be like this.

783
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:30,750
A man like you

784
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,180
won't feel sad.

785
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:36,900
But not everyone in this world is like you.

786
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:39,030
Everyone has their own ideas.

787
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,310
Why do you care about me?

788
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,580
If you're really that decisive,

789
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,580
I'll have to think highly of you.

790
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,550
But you obviously couldn't let go.

791
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,890
Why are you forcing yourself?

792
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:52,290
What kind of capability is this?

793
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,210
What do you know?

794
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,740
You're right, I don't know.

795
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,120
If you like him, you shouldn't let go.

796
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:59,230
But if you choose to let go,

797
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,620
then control your feelings.

798
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,850
Have you never ever

799
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,720
lost control of your feelings

800
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,050
over someone

801
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,790
or something?

802
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:12,100
Are you that good at detaching yourself from everything?

803
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,260
Why are you laughing?

804
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,510
You're right.

805
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,880
I can't control my feelings.

806
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,360
Do you know about the white jade vase?

807
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,170
It's made of white jade from Longzhou.

808
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,750
It's flawless

809
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,510
and perfect.

810
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:39,030
It should be the most beautiful thing in the world.

811
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,260
But if one day

812
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,740
the mouth of the vase is broken,

813
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:45,090
a flaw will be left behind.

814
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,680
Even the best method in the world

815
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,330
can't restore it to its past perfection.

816
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,660
So?

817
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,260
Too much has happened

818
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,480
between me and Zhang.

819
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:02,640
Too much.

820
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,100
I thought

821
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:08,370
I could pretend that nothing had happened.

822
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,960
I thought I could change things.

823
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,580
But it didn't work.

824
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,220
Some things

825
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:20,400
will always happen.

826
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,980
Even if I forcefully make amends,

827
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,200
cracks will still be left.

828
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:30,070
Just like a vase with a flaw.

829
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,350
He is such a good man.

830
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,290
He shouldn't have any flaws.

831
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,470
I'd rather he hates me

832
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:44,090
than let him hate himself.

833
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,910
But why can't I do it?

834
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,340
Why do I still

835
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,480
feel so sad?

836
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,900
Sir, you're knowledgeable

837
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,520
and know everything about people's hearts.

838
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,390
Can you give me an answer too?

839
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,470
Why?

840
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,750
â™«How much do I have to giveâ™«

841
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:19,100
â™«In exchange for the love I deserveâ™«

842
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:26,950
â™«I thought letting go was the best choice for memoryâ™«

843
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,770
Whether the vase is broken or not,

844
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,430
â™«Lend me a breezeâ™«

845
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,880
it's all in the past.

846
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:34,240
â™«To pursue the unsolved dreamâ™«

847
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:31,360
Ning'er.

848
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,780
Since you've made your choice,

849
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:40,140
â™«But it disappeared as the snow fellâ™«

850
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,460
just look forward.

851
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,360
But he is so good.

852
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:42,930
What if I can't forget him?

853
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,220
Then find a better one.

854
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,120
You're lying to me.

855
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:52,780
In this world,

856
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,690
there won't be someone better than him.

857
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:58,870
Then...

858
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:02,490
Find someone more suitable.

859
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,020
There will be one.

860
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:13,550
Ning'er.

861
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,360
There will be one.

862
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,000
I'm sorry.

863
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,130
Ning'er.

864
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:14,020
Since you've made your choice,

865
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,600
just look forward.

866
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,390
But he is so good.

867
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,990
What if I can't forget him?

868
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,200
Then find a better one.

869
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,080
I'd missed out on such a good person.

870
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,130
There won't be another one.

871
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:36,320
Miss.

872
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,820
Chang Zhuo is back.

873
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,280
Let him in.

874
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:45,210
Miss.

875
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,520
How is Mr. Zhang...

876
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,190
How is the Zhang family?

877
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,690
I visited the Zhang family

878
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:52,090
in the name of the Master.

879
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,660
Although the old madam left so suddenly,

880
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,290
thanks to Mr. Gu's help,

881
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,240
the funeral proceeded smoothly.

882
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,020
But...

883
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:01,410
Mr. Zhang locked himself in his room

884
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,060
and refused to see anyone.

885
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,410
But I heard that he ate and drank a little.

886
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,030
With Mr. Gu around,

887
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,180
the Zhang family

888
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,200
should be safe from trouble.

889
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,050
As long as he's eating.

890
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:15,170
As long as he's eating.

891
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:17,790
Keep an eye on them for me.

892
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:19,190
If something happens to Mr. Zhang,

893
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,650
report to me immediately.

894
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:22,910
If the funeral needs anything,

895
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,240
don't hesitate to help.

896
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,960
I'll talk to Father about it.

897
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:26,850
Yes, Miss.

898
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:32,130
Miss.

899
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:33,790
You haven't been eating well

900
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:35,380
for the past few days.

901
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,710
You'll damage your body like this.

902
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,740
Did something happen between you and Mr. Zhang?

903
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:40,840
If there is any misunderstanding,

904
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,430
you could just explain it to him.

905
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:43,560
Misunderstanding?

906
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:49,530
Since I've made my decision,

907
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,030
I shouldn't turn back.

908
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:52,940
Otherwise, it'll only

909
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,070
hold both of us back.

910
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,010
Why bother?

911
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:58,790
Miss.

912
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:00,490
Miss.

913
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,580
A servant came to deliver an invitation.

914
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,810
It seems that Miss Fangyin wishes to invite you over for a chat.

915
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:06,530
Fangyin.

916
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:12,120
[From: You Fangyin]

917
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:17,030
Why is she inviting me to the Lyu Mansion?
