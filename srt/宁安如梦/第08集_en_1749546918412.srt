1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
As long as I can enter the Ning'an Palace

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,000
and pay all the price

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,400
I will be happy

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,400
The End

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,400
The End

7
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,400
Everything seems to be a dream

8
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,400
I have owe many people

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,400
Chaozhe, help me

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,400
I will be a good person after this

11
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,400
I will be a good person

12
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,400
I will be a good person

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,400
You can't give me something

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
But they

15
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,400
I can't help you

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,400
with your life

17
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,400
Everyone has a right to escape

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,400
But I can't

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,400
I want to regret it

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,400
and do the wrong thing

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,400
I will do my best to return it

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,400
Do you believe that everything is decided?

23
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,400
I would rather believe in the future

24
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
Congratulations, Your Highness

25
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,400
Congratulations, Your Highness

26
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,400
The End

27
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,400
Ning'an

28
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,400
What are you doing?

29
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,400
But there is always a pair of invisible hands

30
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,400
to destroy everything

31
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,400
The revenge is long

32
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Who are you?

33
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
The Emperor of the mortal world

34
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
is so long

35
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,400
and so absurd

36
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,400
The revenge is long

37
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,400
The End

38
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,400
I just got into the palace

39
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,400
but I almost scared me to death

40
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,400
Isn't it just a jade seal?

41
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
Is it like this?

42
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,400
I only know how many words in jade seal

43
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,400
What does the word zhonghun mean?

44
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Zhonghun?

45
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,400
You actually saw these words

46
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,400
I heard 300 zhonghun

47
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,400
Can't you remember anything?

48
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
Did you say

49
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,400
zhongyi lian?

50
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,400
This is the progress of the palace

51
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
What is it?

52
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
Tell me quickly

53
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
If you accidentally sent it to the palace

54
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
What's wrong?

55
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,400
This is the news 20 years ago

56
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,400
The King of Pingnan

57
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,400
was the emperor of the late emperor

58
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,400
He was defeated in the imperial throne

59
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
and was sealed by Yuan Qian

60
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,400
He was not dead

61
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
and was kept in the palace

62
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
He was taken to the capital

63
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
20 years ago

64
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
and was taken to the capital

65
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
The King of Pingnan was surrounded

66
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,400
by the imperial guards

67
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
The late emperor was forced to leave the palace

68
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,400
and was kept in the palace

69
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,400
and was sealed by Yuan Qian

70
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
However, he was still

71
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
the empress's empress

72
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
and he was still

73
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
the crown prince

74
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,400
but he was still in the palace

75
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
In front of him

76
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,400
he had the same wife

77
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,400
as the young prince

78
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,400
The King of Pingnan was killed in the imperial palace

79
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,400
but he didn't see the empress and the emperor's

80
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,400
trace

81
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
So he suspected that

82
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
there was a secret passage in the palace

83
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
and asked them to escape

84
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,400
to the palace

85
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,400
But the imperial guards were already in the city

86
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,400
If the empress and the emperor

87
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,400
escaped from the palace

88
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,400
they had to go through

89
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,400
all the gates of the city

90
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
to get out of the city

91
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,400
The imperial guards

92
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
had to send soldiers to guard the city

93
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,400
and no one could get out

94
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,400
The King of Pingnan was very cruel to the late emperor

95
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,400
He was very cruel

96
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,400
He didn't find the emperor

97
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,400
and refused to be punished

98
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,400
At that time

99
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,400
he sent people to search the city

100
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,400
and ran into the children

101
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,400
He didn't hesitate to say

102
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
to catch them all

103
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,400
At that time, the imperial guards were in the east

104
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,400
The King of Pingnan asked the servants to come and take care of them

105
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
The sky was cold and the ground was cold

106
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,400
The children were all alone

107
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
and were in the snow

108
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,400
But they were all in the same body

109
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,400
No

110
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,400
No

111
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
No

112
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,400
The King of Pingnan was very cruel

113
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,400
He ordered the Crown Prince to be punished in three days

114
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Otherwise, the people who were caught

115
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
would be killed

116
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Pass the order

117
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,400
and send people to the city in three days

118
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,400
Otherwise, the King would kill the people

119
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,400
who were in front of the palace

120
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,400
Kill them all

121
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Yes

122
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Jin Yao closed her head

123
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,400
and the emperor's son, the 7-year-old Prince Ding

124
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
was born in the palace

125
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
He was very clever

126
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
He was very famous

127
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
He was able to protect the people of the city

128
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
However

129
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,400
Jin Yao

130
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
Jin Yao

131
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
The King of Pingnan

132
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
The King of Pingnan

133
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,400
Kill

134
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,400
They all killed him

135
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Including Consort Ding

136
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,980
What do you mean by that later?

137
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,120
Afterwards,

138
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,140
Duke of Dinguo settled down in Yongyi

139
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,480
to save His Majesty

140
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,680
as he promised to gain influence on use of his troops.

141
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,480
He was able to assign a big fire

142
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:53,200
before King of the Southern

143
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:59,820
Fruit

144
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,620
the moment you jump from your bed.

145
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:29,700
This dense field gives a vividERO

146
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,140
the hero died for the sake of the child.

147
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,820
So, the Baiguo Temple was abandoned

148
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,540
and was called

149
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,060
the Zhongyi Forest.

150
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,180
These years,

151
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,340
the Empress Dowager

152
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,620
has always thought of this matter.

153
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,540
She would be concerned about

154
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,740
those innocent lives.

155
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:43,860
So,

156
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,660
she never asked people to mention this matter.

157
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,020
Even if she is concerned about the innocent,

158
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,540
she should be guilty.

159
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,740
Today, the Empress Dowager's spirit is strong.

160
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,540
It's not like she is guilty.

161
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,940
But

162
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,340
the King of Pingnan caught the innocent people

163
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,060
just to force the emperor.

164
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,420
The little prince has brought the emperor out.

165
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,340
Why is he still in the killing mood?

166
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,140
The King of Pingnan

167
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,860
was a rebel who was impulsive.

168
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,460
Maybe he killed people

169
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,500
just to make up for it.

170
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,020
Miss Yao, what do you think?

171
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,740
I can't say.

172
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,180
But I think

173
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,340
even if he is a rebel,

174
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,980
he won't kill people without reason.

175
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,340
At that time,

176
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,620
the King of Pingnan was killed

177
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,060
by the innocent.

178
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,700
First, he was born for the world.

179
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,340
Second, he was so young

180
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,180
for the son of the late emperor.

181
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,780
He was so good-looking.

182
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,380
Then the King of Xue

183
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,380
is the elder of the sister Xue?

184
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,460
That's right.

185
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,980
Not only the son of the King of Ding,

186
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,380
but also the sister of the late emperor, Yongye.

187
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,300
It's a precept.

188
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,580
It's a common oath

189
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,860
of the two great tribes.

190
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,740
I know that.

191
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,900
After Mrs. Yan was buried,

192
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,860
she was sad and depressed.

193
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,100
She was divorced with the Duke of Xue.

194
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,140
After she returned to Yongye's mansion,

195
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,660
she was sick for a long time.

196
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,620
Yan Shi and Xue Shi

197
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,500
didn't come here

198
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
after this.

199
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,300
And I heard that

200
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,540
there were three people

201
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,500
under the Duke of Ding.

202
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,020
It was not the Duke of Xue's decision.

203
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,380
But later,

204
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,060
the Duke of Xue begged Mrs. Yan.

205
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,740
With the support of the Yan family,

206
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,140
she turned to the Lian family

207
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,220
and won the title.

208
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,300
But after Mrs. Yan passed away,

209
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,140
after three months,

210
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,700
the Duke of Xue married a new wife.

211
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,660
The Duke of Xue's mansion

212
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,100
really needed a female master

213
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:32,860
to take care of it.

214
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,500
She was a good wife

215
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,260
and had no regrets in her marriage.

216
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,580
But after Mrs. Yan passed away,

217
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,660
she was not happy enough

218
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,380
to have a baby.

219
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,460
It's a bit

220
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,460
hard to find a husband.

221
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,740
Sister Liao,

222
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,860
is that true?

223
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,780
Sister Xue is the daughter of the late emperor.

224
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,020
I'm afraid I didn't think

225
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,940
your father may write jokes like this.

226
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,420
My father?

227
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,860
Sure.

228
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,620
What are you talking about?

229
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,060
Uncle.

230
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,780
I'm sorry.

231
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,500
I didn't mean to...

232
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,060
Although my mother can remember,

233
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,620
she remains no more right.

234
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,220
You have longed for it.

235
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,260
You must be tired.

236
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,300
Sister Xue, I'm not good.

237
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,500
I'm the one who is chasing after everyone.

238
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,980
I'm getting too much trouble.

239
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,260
All right.

240
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,580
I need to know your words.

241
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,260
If someone hears it,

242
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,860
no one can get rid of the good fruit.

243
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,940
We have classes tomorrow.

244
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,780
Let's go.

245
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,180
Yes.

246
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,060
Editor Takeu

247
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,900
What are you thinking?

248
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,220
Our 300 ceiling cases are all past.

249
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,220
Because I'm not in love with Yanzhan.

250
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,740
Why do I bother about Y legend?

251
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,200
What is she?

252
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,440
Imperial Household Officer.

253
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,240
You've been in the palace for 40 years.

254
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,400
The palace doesn'tinguely need to feed us.

255
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,320
If you can't figure it out in the harem, we can just Auckland the whole palace to think it over

256
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,520
and keep it until ourINAUDIBLE Paris말.

257
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,440
The Imperial Household might find out…

258
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,480
enhance the officials' authority!

259
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,000
Yes, Aunt.

260
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,940
I will tellо me right now.

261
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,060
You can't leave now.

262
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,060
It'll be your bad luck.

263
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,180
Don't rub the wedding veil so cleanly.

264
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:27,900
I'm afraid that

265
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,260
you can officially know

266
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,300
that Brother very well.

267
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,980
Then you'll use a knot to tie theיזis leading to it.

268
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:36,820
Okay.

269
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:37,980
That's good.

270
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,580
We'll call it a robbery.

271
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,740
The world.

272
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,740
I don't believe in the world.

273
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,540
Why is it so hard for me to be a family member?

274
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,740
You are quite a brother.

275
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,540
You can't even have a son. You can't inherit the throne.

276
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,940
What? You want to give the throne to the criminal?

277
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,940
Why don't you take my life and your sister's life?

278
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,740
I will always be like this.

279
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,940
I can't even tell you what happened.

280
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,540
Are you the Empress Dowager or our sister's mother?

281
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,740
You... Erge, stop talking.

282
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,540
You son!

283
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,540
Don't be angry, Mother. I won't go to class today.

284
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,540
I will stay here with you.

285
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,540
You are still going to the palace to attend class?

286
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,540
You have already solved the suspicion of His Majesty.

287
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,940
Don't worry so much.

288
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,140
The solution is temporary.

289
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,740
Only if the surface is as dark as the net and doesn't move,

290
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,140
will it leak out.

291
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:45,940
Moreover, we investigated the inside house last night.

292
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,940
I'm afraid that our people have already been born.

293
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,940
So no matter what, I must send them some news.

294
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,940
You must be careful when you enter the palace.

295
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,540
Don't worry. I will let Dao Qing investigate the whereabouts of the Palace City.

296
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,740
Let Lv Xian keep an eye on the Xue family and Yan family.

297
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,940
If you have any news,

298
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,540
you must tell me at the very first time.

299
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,140
Yes.

300
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,940
Today, the Princess of the Sect is on leave.

301
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,540
You all should learn the basic poems first.

302
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,140
Move to the first page.

303
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,140
Give the cups to the students.

304
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,740
The Western Valley is relaxed.

305
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,740
The way is very simple.

306
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,140
The sound is louder.

307
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,740
The sound of the falling leaves are noisy.

308
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,740
The sound of the falling leaves are noisy.

309
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,140
The sound of the falling leaves are noisy.

310
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:49,340
Jiang Xunning, why aren't you reading?

311
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,540
Sir, students are confused.

312
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,340
This poem is just a bit of a ruckus.

313
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,340
It's just a rare poem.

314
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,140
Why don't you ask the teacher to do the test first?

315
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,340
We can learn it later.

316
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,940
I'm only asking you why aren't you reading.

317
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,740
Did you say so many words?

318
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,140
I...

319
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,740
I'm asking you to give the cups to the students.

320
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,340
On the study hall, you can just ask anything you want.

321
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,540
You don't know anything.

322
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,340
Go.

323
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,340
Stand outside.

324
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,940
The teacher is passing on the leaf.

325
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,740
If I know anything,

326
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,540
I'll chop your head off first.

327
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,740
What else do you want?

328
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,140
For the next part,

329
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,740
why don't you ask Miss Xue to lead the class?

330
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,540
Miss Xue,

331
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:41,540
the prince of this department is always more lively.

332
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,540
But if you want to know what he means,

333
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,340
you just need to follow...

334
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,140
Sir, I know.

335
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,140
It's good that you know.

336
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,140
You're indeed a noble lady.

337
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,940
You're really a good student.

338
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,740
I'm really relieved to have you as the head of the department.

339
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,740
I'm really relieved.

340
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,740
Miss Xue, please.

341
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,340
The circle is full of obstacles.

342
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,940
The circle is full of obstacles.

343
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:14,340
The circle is full of obstacles.

344
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:19,340
The circle is full of obstacles.

345
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,740
Han Lingyue is really a good student.

The deficit at the day after tomorrow is not enough

349
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,140
and send the student to this place.

350
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:36,340
For the sake of her honor, I'm afraid of negative thoughts.

351
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:40,140
Ni Goyu Tong

352
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,580
Okay.

353
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,940
That's all for today's class.

354
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,560
You all rest less.

That's why today I first explored Qзs

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,780
Because of the timing

363
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,140
So I have prepared things for you

364
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,380
Really make yourself at home

365
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,380
Since that's the case, I won't delay your time.

366
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,380
Come in and sit down.

00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,380
He's a good man.

378
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,380
He's a good man.

379
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,380
He's a good man.

380
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,380
I heard that

381
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,380
he's a good man.

382
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,380
He's a good man.

383
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,380
He's a good man.

384
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,380
Exactly.

385
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,380
Where are you from?

386
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,380
I'm from the north of the mountain.

387
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,380
I'm from the north of the mountain.

388
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,380
I'm from the north of the mountain.

389
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,380
Well...

390
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,380
I don't know.

391
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,380
Your Highness.

392
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,380
Your Highness.

393
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,380
Your Highness.

394
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,380
Your Highness.

395
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,380
Your Highness.

396
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,380
Something's wrong.

397
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,380
Xie Wei is in a fight.

398
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,380
He's colluding with the Yanling Army

399
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,380
to attack the imperial city.

400
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,380
In a fight?

401
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,380
It turns out that he's a good man.

402
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,380
He's a good man.

403
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,380
You're a good man.

404
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,380
You're a good man.

405
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,380
You're a good man.

406
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,380
So Xie Wei was the emperor last time.

407
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,380
He's still in a fight.

408
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,380
He did so much

409
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,380
and killed many people.

410
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,380
If he's not the emperor,

411
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,380
I'm afraid he won't go anywhere.

412
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,380
I know

413
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,380
all of you, including Princess,

414
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,380
know a lot about love.

415
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,380
But I hope you

416
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,380
forget everything you've learned

417
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,380
and come here from the beginning.

418
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,380
It's hard to say.

419
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,380
Sometimes it's hard to study.

420
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,380
The so-called three-year-old city

421
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,380
is five-year-old city.

422
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,380
The seven-year-old city is a number.

423
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,380
However,

424
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,380
the learning is a path.

425
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,380
With a path,

426
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,380
it's easy to call it a city.

427
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,380
You're not old.

428
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,380
You can't teach me anything

429
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,380
in half a year.

430
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,380
But if you can get a good temper,

431
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,380
you can't be as good as you are.

432
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,380
You're so hard to say.

433
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,380
How old have you learned

434
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,380
and what's your background now?

435
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,380
I started learning love since I was four.

436
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,380
Now I'm considered a master of the sect.

437
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,380
You've learned for more than twenty years.

438
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,380
That's a small city.

439
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,380
I'm a student.

440
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,380
If you're a talent,

441
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,380
you're smart.

442
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,380
You can't be so confident.

443
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,380
Qin Dao,

444
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,380
you're good at making rules.

445
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,380
You're good at making money.

446
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,380
Thank you, sir.

447
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,380
Qin Dao is a good couple.

448
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,380
I'll play a piece of Gao Shan Yin.

449
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,380
Let me see your skills.

450
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,380
Gao Shan Yin?

451
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,380
I didn't play it.

452
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,380
I'm sorry, sir.

453
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,380
I'm not good at playing the piano.

454
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,380
I'll play the piano.

455
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,380
Enough.

456
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,380
You've done this.

457
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,380
But you're so good at playing it.

458
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,380
Ning Er,

459
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,380
you've never learned

460
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,380
anything from me, right?

461
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,380
Didn't I say it first?

462
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,380
You've never learned anything.

463
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,380
You've started over.

464
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,380
It's a pity that this good love

465
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,380
is in your hands.

466
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,380
Then

467
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,380
I'll play a piece of Lie Qin.

468
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,380
Jiang Xue Ning.

469
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,380
I knew you were good at playing it.

470
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,380
I didn't expect you to be so angry.

471
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,380
Get out of here.

472
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,380
I...

473
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,380
Stand down.

474
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,380
Don't steal it.

475
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,380
I...

476
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,380
I...

477
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,380
I...

478
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,380
I...

479
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,380
I...

480
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,380
I...

481
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,380
I...

482
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,380
I...

483
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,380
I...

484
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,380
I shouldn't have played the piano.

485
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,380
I'm the most talented person in this world.

486
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,380
I've played two lessons today

487
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,380
and I'm really out of time.

488
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:08,260
Zhoumei!

489
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,720
Okay.

490
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,780
Cheers!

491
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,680
Xiaohuinnu functionality.

492
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,520
Thanks for your kind words.

493
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,020
Bye.

494
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:35,820
Haohao.

495
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,260
Herotok��t Xiaohuinnu

496
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,660
I can't pronounce your name right now.

497
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,100
What are you doing?

498
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,120
Are you blind?

499
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,880
I was flying.

500
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,520
Is there something wrong with my talisman?

501
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,040
I know.

502
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,360
I'm sure you were scared of me at the Taian Hall yesterday.

503
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,400
No, I didn't.

504
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,240
I didn't mean to try this on.

505
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,240
I didn't mean to punish you.

506
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,280
It's just that your love life is too short.

507
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,960
I'm afraid I might disturb others' learning.

508
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,720
I know that you're worried about Yan Ling these days.

509
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,080
You can't understand it if you don't have a good time.

510
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,160
Alright.

511
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,720
Go in.

512
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,120
I...

513
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Why won't I come?

514
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,320
If it's too much time, I won't come toもう.

515
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,080
Since I COVID, why have to be so rough?

516
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,920
What else do you want?

517
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,760
No matter how tired and lost I am to science and technology,

518
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,480
you can only...!

519
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,760
I guess you'd better...

520
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,040
If you insist on making me go to best of my skill.

521
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,760
What?

522
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,960
You're not going to play?

523
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,280
I don't understand.

524
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,880
But you promised me

525
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,800
that you'd let me go back.

526
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,920
Can you do that?

527
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,120
I'll stay alone

528
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,960
in school today.

529
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,680
I can play the flute.

530
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,560
You're so good at playing the piano.

531
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,040
As a human,

532
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,600
I should also take good care of you.

533
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,760
Safe travels to professor.

534
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,160
Drop it.

535
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,720
Since I'm nobody,

536
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,120
it's passable for me to lie in the palace and suffocate myself.

537
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,760
I need some analyzed intelligence

538
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,720
to get rid of some ill-mannered squatting.

539
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,760
What's the point?

540
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,160
He forced me several times.

541
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,120
Did my life become too hard?

542
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,520
What about you?

543
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,440
Do you really not want to be the Emperor?

544
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,800
It's okay if others don't understand.

545
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,360
You've been with me for years.

546
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,280
Don't you understand me?

547
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,440
What Emperor, what Prince Ling?

548
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,280
I just want to be a normal person.

549
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,280
When you escape the position of the whole wood,

550
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,320
you will do what you really want.

551
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,200
Who doesn't want to?

552
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,200
It's just that I'm working hard.

553
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,480
I have to.

554
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,080
Some people fight for victory,

555
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,720
and some people push back by force.

556
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,640
I'm afraid I person drama myself.

557
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,080
How come I feel like

558
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,600
you've found yourself consciously different lately?

559
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,600
You've been intending to change the set-up.

560
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,320
It's the same for me.

561
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,080
Like something concrete.

562
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:33,880
Right.

563
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,080
Forget it.

564
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,080
Forget this.

565
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,200
Today, I came to find aorman with you.

566
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,280
I know for some reason,

567
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,360
a BCC in the esteemed temple

568
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,320
is the one in the south.

569
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,440
We can practice some wild rabbits.

570
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,600
How about we go for a walk?

571
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,640
Let's go.

572
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,400
Buy some wine.

573
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,080
Okay. Let's go.

574
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,480
I heard that you two

575
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,320
saved a little eunuch named Zheng Bao

576
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,320
at the gate of Ning An Palace yesterday.

577
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,280
It was saved by the princess.

578
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,480
I heard that you two

579
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,320
saved a little eunuch named Zheng Bao

580
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,320
at the gate of Ning An Palace yesterday.

581
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,320
It was saved by the princess.

582
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:43,680
Is that so?

583
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,920
Yes.

584
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,040
Well eight of those

585
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,000
were saved at will,

586
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,840
you didn't need to hang up.

587
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,800
I thought after some affairs,

588
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,320
we were kind of

589
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,160
still leaving you to nobody.

590
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,600
What makes you film while it's still burning?

591
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,440
I finally understand

592
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,100
thepresence silently.

593
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,800
Zhengbao is a charges vì blah.

594
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,640
Back then,

595
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,640
Zusammenź,

596
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,300
she said she wants to connection with me.

597
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,120
Yes, same topic.

598
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,240
So many things in the imperial study

599
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,760
can't hide your magic.

600
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,560
You've been in the palace for a long time.

601
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,440
You know how dangerous it is.

602
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,160
What about you?

603
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,240
You know the relationship between Zheng Bao and Wang Xinyi.

604
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,960
Is it meaningful to save her?

605
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,080
What Wang Xinyi?

606
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,400
I've been in the palace for a few days.

607
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,240
I don't know anything.

608
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,320
Really?

609
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,840
You know everything about life and death.

610
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,560
What else do you know

611
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,920
that you don't know?

612
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,240
I've already explained it.

613
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,320
That's a coincidence.

614
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,240
I have no objection to your visit to the palace.

615
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,600
You want me to go to the palace.

616
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,240
Princess has been taking care of me.

617
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,000
I'm a crazy person.

618
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,080
I must take care of her.

619
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,240
If I don't take care of her,

620
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,400
I'm afraid she won't even know how to die.

621
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,800
So I'm thinking

622
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,600
if I can save a little eunuch,

623
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,840
it might be useful in the future.

624
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,960
I'm not sure.

625
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,960
But it's about the safety of the Yan family.

626
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,720
I don't have any promise to you.

627
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,600
You only trust me.

628
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,000
That's a trust.

629
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,400
You're wrong.

630
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,960
You said it yourself.

631
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,160
I don't need to pretend in front of you.

632
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,720
Now that I've said the truth,

633
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,120
you're not angry anymore, are you?

634
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,600
Forget it.

635
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,080
The palace is a mess.

636
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,840
You're not a bad person.

637
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,640
But I need to remind you.

638
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,280
If you're involved in the dispute,

639
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,280
I'm afraid you'll be in danger.

640
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,160
I've been entrusted by the Yan family

641
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,600
and I've been entrusted by the master.

642
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,760
So I'm warning you.

643
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,960
You're young and thoughtful.

644
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,720
Don't make any mistakes.

645
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,680
You sound like you're a big deal.

646
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,000
What did you say?

647
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,440
I mean

648
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,240
Zheng Bao is really so good.

649
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,760
Will he be the one

650
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,760
who's going to be the king?

651
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,640
You're not good enough.

652
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,320
All right.

653
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,120
Tell me about the song

654
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,600
from the class.

655
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,600
Class is really important.

656
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,320
Why? You don't want to go to class?

657
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,640
Fine.

658
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,360
Then stay here.

659
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,040
I'll go back when I'm back.

660
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,120
Hey.

661
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,680
Let's talk.

662
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,960
Do you have a job?

663
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,280
Do you want to help your sister?

664
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,000
Don't you have to do it?

665
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,760
It's more than I can wait.

666
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,120
I have nowhere to go.

667
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,720
Maybe she's the one

668
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,000
who's always doing this.

669
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,360
That's why it's so difficult.

670
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,380
I think a lot today.

671
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,000
Has the Moxias been doing ok before?

672
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
You went back inside, is that not good?

673
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,460
The demands of the names are sorted by the疑

674
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:13,080
They are a collection of all the borings

675
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,740
for the purchased

676
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,160
You were too tense according to the end Meer

677
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,160
I need to relax a little more.

678
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,160
What's wrong?

679
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,160
Why can't you get up?

680
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,160
It's a student's act.

681
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,160
Luckily, it's okay.

682
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,160
It's good that you know.

683
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,160
Where did the cat come from?

684
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,160
It sounds cute.

685
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,500
Next episode

686
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,660
Childe, look!

687
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,660
Look.

688
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,660
Mister, look.

689
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,660
Hurry.

690
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,660
Who gave you the guts?

691
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,660
I...

692
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,660
I told you to come here to learn love.

693
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,660
It's not a joke.

694
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,660
If you still can't play it well tomorrow,

695
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,660
don't come to class anymore.

696
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,660
Get out of here.

697
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,660
Why do you still say you trust each other?

698
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,660
You can just practice.

699
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,660
I'm angry and angry.

700
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,660
I wanted to ask her about Yu Ru Yi.

701
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,660
Now...

702
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,660
Miss Jiang Er.

703
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,660
Greetings, Miss Jiang Er.

704
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,660
Yesterday, thank you for your help.

705
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,660
How could you know it was me who saved you?

706
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,660
You were the one who saved you yesterday.

707
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,660
I've been in the palace since I was born.

708
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,660
I understand what you should know.

709
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:40,660
There are many people in the palace who are well-known and well-preserved.

710
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,660
Even if they are good friends in the West,

711
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,660
they dare to speak out.

712
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,660
Only you,

713
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,660
you are clearly not familiar with each other,

714
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,660
but dare to speak out for me at that time.

715
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,660
I'm sure you'll be grateful.

716
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:59,660
Do you know that I'm not stupid to speak out for you?

717
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,660
Are you disappointed?

718
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,660
I'm not.

719
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,660
I'm just a little confused.

720
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,660
So you came to me today to repay my kindness?

721
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,660
That's what I'm going to do.

722
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,660
What about now?

723
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,660
You saved me.

724
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,660
If you don't say it,

725
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,660
it's true that I'm not stupid.

726
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,660
But I'm very pure in terms of the language of the Xuan Zhi.

727
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,660
I know.

728
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,660
After all, I want to be grateful to you

729
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,660
and let you be my use.

730
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,660
You're very honest.

731
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,660
But you've never seen me being so mean.

732
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,660
Miss, what did you say?

733
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,660
I know you're a good person.

734
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,660
If you have a heart,

735
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,660
you should pay for it.

736
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,660
I've been in this palace for half a year.

737
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:49,660
I don't do anything bad to people.

738
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,660
I'm just afraid that one day,

739
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,660
I can't get rid of the bad things.

740
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,660
So I want to find someone to take care of me.

741
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,660
If something happens,

742
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,660
I don't know what to do.

743
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,660
You're my benefactor.

744
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,660
If you want to harm people,

745
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,660
what's the point of protecting me?

746
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,660
I'm not your benefactor.

747
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,660
Some things are not in your heart.

748
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,660
If you have a heart,

749
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,660
you'll have a good person in the world.

750
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,660
I have.

751
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,660
Who is it?

752
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,660
I'll take you to meet someone later.

753
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,660
See you.

754
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,660
Thank you for your account book.

755
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,660
You learned a lot from me.

756
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,660
Please have a seat.

757
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,660
But...

758
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,660
There seems to be some misunderstandings.

759
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,660
I'm not good at writing.

760
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,660
I've read it again.

761
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,660
I'm not good at it.

762
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,660
Look at it.

763
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,660
Right, right here.

764
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,660
Look at it.

765
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,660
Is it wrong?

766
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,660
It may not be wrong.

767
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,660
Maybe I'm not good at it.

768
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,660
I'm not sure if it's wrong.

769
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,660
I'm indeed mistaken.

770
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,660
You've learned a lot from me.

771
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,660
But you've learned a lot from me.

772
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,660
No.

773
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:22,660
I'm just a little bit worried.

774
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,660
By the way, Boss Xu.

775
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,660
Now the private price is over.

776
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,660
I'd like you to sell it for me.

777
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,660
Of course I'll give you a commission.

778
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,660
Miss,

779
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,660
you've helped me and the farmers a lot.

780
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,660
Don't mention the commission.

781
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,660
But the private price is growing.

782
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,660
Now it's all in stock.

783
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,660
I've read your account book.

784
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,660
The private price is growing.

785
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,660
It's almost a peak.

786
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,660
I don't want to talk too much.

787
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,660
Why does Boss Xu look at me like that?

788
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,660
It's nothing.

789
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,660
I just think that

790
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:02,660
you've chosen the right person.

791
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,660
I'm sorry.

792
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,660
I'm sorry.

793
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,660
Miss Yao,

794
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,660
you don't have to look at me.

795
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,660
Miss Yao,

796
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,660
just say it.

797
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,660
What does it say on the letter?

798
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,660
Why is it red on my face?

799
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,660
You're annoying.

800
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,660
Come on in.

801
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,660
Isn't this Miss Jiang?

802
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,660
What a coincidence.

803
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,660
I'm really impressed by Miss Yao's good deeds.

804
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,660
What's wrong?

805
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,660
Nothing.

806
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,660
But my mother sent me a letter.

807
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,660
She said that my father

808
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,660
went to Zhang's family to get married.

809
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,660
I won't say it.

810
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,660
It's strange that my father is in the middle of the world.

811
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,660
How could he use my daughter's family to get married?

812
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,660
Why are you looking at Zhang Zhe again?

813
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,660
He's getting married.

814
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,660
He doesn't know how to fly me.

815
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,660
But I've thought about it.

816
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,660
He's not good at being born.

817
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,660
He's not a good mother.

818
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,660
I have everything.

819
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,660
I don't need to worry about him.

820
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,660
Didn't Miss Jiang say that

821
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,660
Mr. Zhang is a man of the people.

822
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,660
He's not bad.

823
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,660
Qi, I think

824
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,660
you should thank Miss Jiang

825
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,660
for your good cause.

826
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,660
Xue Ning,

827
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,660
I've misunderstood you a lot.

828
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,660
If you don't say it,

829
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,660
I might get lost.

830
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,660
Thank you.

831
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,660
You're a good person.

832
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,660
Miss Ya, don't do that.

833
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,660
I have nothing to do with the fate of the world.

834
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,660
Miss Jiang is so kind.

835
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,660
You haven't found your own fate.

836
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,660
You have the time to think of someone else.

837
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,660
Why haven't I seen the Yan Prince come to you recently?

838
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:35,660
Is it because your dream has come true?

839
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,660
I'm so happy.

840
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,660
Mr. Zhang.

841
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,660
What's wrong?

842
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,660
The man in the palace is too much.

843
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,660
I can't understand what's going on.

844
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,660
What's going on?

845
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,660
It's Mr. Gong Yi.

846
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,660
He pretended to be your name.

847
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,660
He transferred many men in the palace.

848
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,660
He forced Yu Ruyi to avoid the investigation

849
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,660
and sent them to the house.

850
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,660
He's the one who's responsible for the man in the palace.

851
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,660
He's the one who's responsible for the man in the palace.

852
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,660
He's the one who's responsible for the man in the palace.

853
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,660
He's the one who's responsible for the man in the palace.

854
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:24,660
But I found out that he's late.

855
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,660
It's him.

856
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:29,660
Yesterday, the imperial court found out the account of the man in the palace.

857
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,660
Although we didn't find out the truth,

858
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,660
we found out that the time Mr. Gong Yi gave in

859
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,660
was not too long.

860
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,660
I didn't have the time to think about it.

861
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,660
I just wanted to take the risk and remind him.

862
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,660
It's okay.

863
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,660
You did a good job.

864
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,660
But the palace is in a tight fit.

865
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,660
I'm afraid the imperial kitchen won't be able to stay.

866
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,660
Find a chance to go somewhere else.

867
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,660
Yes.

868
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:05,660
You were born in a high school, but you're still a child.

869
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,660
You never got into trouble when you were in the water.

870
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:12,660
You were in a bad situation and you were still in a bad mood.

871
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,660
Changzhe, the Yao Xi in your eyes

872
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,660
must be a good girl.

873
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,660
Will you agree to this marriage?

874
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,660
Why are you here again?

875
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,660
Why did you run out again?

876
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,660
You dare to make trouble in front of the young master Xie's door.

877
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,660
Don't be so insolent.

878
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:41,660
It seems that you're the same as me.

879
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,660
You know you can't blame yourself for your own wrong.

880
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,660
You don't have to kill Yu Ruyi.

881
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:56,660
You don't have to come to me with a risk.

882
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,660
Yu Ruyi, it's related to him.

883
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,660
But now the Duke of Dingguo has found out.

884
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,660
If we don't help him,

885
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,660
he will be in the palace...

886
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,660
It's okay. I have my own way.

887
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,660
I taught you to come out of the capital

888
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,660
not to let you die.

889
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:18,660
From now on, you don't have to serve the others.

890
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,660
Just sit in the palace and watch the eunuchs.

891
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,660
Yes, there's one more thing.

892
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:26,660
I got the information from the people who sent the imperial doctor.

893
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,660
They did that for Yu Ruyi's sake

894
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:31,660
to get the Yan family to have the heart of a minister.

895
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,660
I understand. Go back.

896
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,660
Be careful of being seen.

897
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,660
Yes.

898
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:44,660
I don't know when you came.

899
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:49,660
I was afraid to be separated.

900
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:54,660
I came to exchange another half of the paper.

901
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,660
I thought I would let go of the memory.

902
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:01,660
The best choice.

903
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:05,660
I took a trip to the capital.

904
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:08,660
I went to the final destination.

905
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:11,660
I couldn't open the dream.

906
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:17,660
But I was able to fly to the snow.
