1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
As long as I can enter the Ning'an Palace

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,200
and pay all the price

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,600
I will be willing to do my best

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,400
The End

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,800
The End

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,800
Everything seems to be a dream

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,400
I have owed a lot of people

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,800
Chaozhe, help me

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,600
I will be a good person after this

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
The End

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
I will be the one to take the favor

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,800
There are some things you can't give me

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
But what about them?

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,000
The life you chose is for Mr. You

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,400
In this world, everyone has the right to escape

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,000
But I can't

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,000
I want to regret it

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,400
and do the wrong thing

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,200
and go back in time

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Does Mr. Zhang believe that everything is decided?

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I would rather believe in the future

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,000
Your Highness

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,800
Your Highness

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,200
The End

26
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,000
Ning'an, what are you doing?

27
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,000
In the Ming Dynasty

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,600
there was always a pair of hands

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,600
that could break everything

30
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,400
The revenge is long

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,600
Who are you in the end?

32
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,600
The Emperor of the mortal world is so long

33
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,000
and he is so ridiculous

34
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,200
The Imperial Reẽ

35
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,000
The End

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Who do you对 me?

37
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,000
The Chief Minister of the Blogger

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,600
isa, the Dabangtong enjoy an huzhi

39
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,100
May the Dabangtong achieve sixty thousand miles

40
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,200
I will do interpreters

41
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,800
to return safely

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The new official is on the market.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You should watch Ning An Rume.

44
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,840
The smart baby, He Fei He.

45
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,720
The milk powder from Fei He.

46
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,720
You should watch Ning An Rume.

47
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,440
Ning Er has been to the prison.

48
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,400
You can't reveal half of the words to others.

49
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
Otherwise,

50
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll kill you.

51
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,600
Yes.

52
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,240
I understand

53
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,720
the relationship between the two of them.

54
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,560
But...

55
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,720
But the State Preceptor has started to suspect

56
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,880
some of the actions that I've been doing.

57
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,800
He even thinks that

58
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,600
the relationship between the two of them is related to the lower official.

59
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,120
I'm just afraid that...

60
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,720
Guo Guo has been chasing her for so long.

61
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,920
She has been looking for her for so long.

62
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,480
She must have been involved with the girl.

63
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,120
You're threatening me with Ning Er.

64
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,440
You want me to be the second-in-command for you?

65
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,640
I dare not.

66
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,560
I dare not.

67
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,720
Don't worry.

68
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,680
As long as you're loyal to Ning Er,

69
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,240
I'll do nothing for you.

70
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,720
But remember,

71
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,880
if anyone else knows about Ning Er's case,

72
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,800
the consequences will be dire.

73
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
I understand.

74
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,760
He's been waiting for so long.

75
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,160
He's just looking for her.

76
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,520
Gao Qing,

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,120
go to the Western City immediately.

78
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,680
If they haven't left the city,

79
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,760
stop them from coming here.

80
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,160
Yes.

81
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,800
I'm going to Jiang Fu.

82
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,480
You can call Lv Xian over.

83
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,400
If Gao Qing doesn't stop them,

84
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,200
we must go to Tongzhou in advance.

85
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,320
How can that be?

86
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,520
It's getting cold.

87
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,320
If we go to Tongzhou to catch a snowfall,

88
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,440
it'll be dangerous.

89
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,120
Feng Ming Yu is still taking the medicine.

90
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,920
That's exactly why we must go.

91
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,160
Ning Er is in danger.

92
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,000
If Zhang Zhe goes out of the building,

93
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,920
I won't go.

94
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,640
Who will save Ning Er's life?

95
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,560
Who is it?

96
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,360
Third Madam, it's me, Huang.

97
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,920
You're finally back.

98
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
Something happened in the east gate.

99
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,840
Let's talk inside.

100
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,200
Come.

101
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:35,920
We're done.

102
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,560
Huang,

103
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,600
what's going on?

104
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,040
According to what you said,

105
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,000
I was going to pick you up outside the gate.

106
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,880
I didn't expect that the court

107
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,600
would send someone to ambush you.

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,960
Do you know how many people

109
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,160
we've been killed?

110
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,480
We've been killed by the intelligence.

111
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,720
Who are these people?

112
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,200
I'm Zhang Zhe.

113
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,400
You can call me Du Jun Shan.

114
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,160
Du Jun?

115
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,480
You're Du Jun?

116
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,000
The public transport city has been changed.

117
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,320
I don't think it'll take long.

118
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,040
The court will be here soon.

119
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,200
Impossible.

120
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,640
Mr. Gong Yi

121
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,160
can't betray us.

122
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,800
Huang,

123
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,200
are you sure he's Du Jun Shan?

124
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,840
Then this girl...

125
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,480
I said, this is a delicate and gentle girl.

126
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,200
So she's a woman.

127
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,840
Mr. Zhang,

128
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,800
when you're dying,

129
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,960
you'll be in a hurry

130
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,760
to take her with you.

131
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,680
Or do you have any other plans?

132
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,840
I just don't have the right to say this.

133
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,720
I hope you don't make any trouble.

134
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,160
You mean,

135
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,240
I've never heard

136
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,920
that Mr. Du Jun

137
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,640
has a sister.

138
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,240
You can ask me about my brother.

139
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,840
I've found out that the public transport city has been changed.

140
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,920
I'm going to leave the capital with me tonight.

141
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,680
If I didn't meet you,

142
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,160
we'd have left the local area.

143
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,800
Okay.

144
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,960
This is true.

145
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,800
We can escape tonight.

146
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,160
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

147
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,160
Okay.

148
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,200
We'll talk when General Feng comes tomorrow.

149
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,360
Xiaobao.

150
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,160
Go get some water and dry the clothes.

151
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,520
We'll stay here tonight.

152
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,400
You were kidnapped?

153
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,520
What's going on?

154
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:56,920
No.

155
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:57,840
I want to report...

156
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,480
Mr. Zhang, I...

157
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,160
Mr. Zhang,

158
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,360
don't panic.

159
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,000
The kidnapping operation is in the court.

160
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,000
What you're doing

161
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,720
is not only to see the Minister of Justice,

162
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,200
but also to see my secret secret.

163
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,640
Although it looks dangerous,

164
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,200
it may not be the worst step.

165
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,080
If we report it now,

166
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,360
the doctor will destroy the plan for His Majesty.

167
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,760
It's hard to be kidnapped.

168
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,560
Second,

169
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,560
Nian'er is the Goddess of Girls.

170
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,080
She will destroy the reputation.

171
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,280
This is so sudden.

172
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:23,960
How could he

173
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,800
go to the prison?

174
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,280
I even met a traitor.

175
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,200
What a bad idea.

176
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,240
Mr. Zhang.

177
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,960
The night is late.

178
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,600
I'm sorry.

179
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
Nian'er's safety

180
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,320
will be in the hands of you.

181
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,520
But

182
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,240
there are many people in the mansion.

183
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,440
Have you thought about it?

184
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,120
How to keep the news?

185
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,920
Then I'll say,

186
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,800
this girl went to the city

187
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,440
to take the Buddha's offering.

188
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,320
She will stay in the temple for a few days.

189
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,320
I believe

190
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,040
she can keep it for a while.

191
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,520
That's good.

192
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,400
I'll go to the palace to clear the order.

193
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,960
I'll go to Tongzhou to rescue her.

194
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,280
I'll save her back.

195
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,040
Okay.

196
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,360
I'm begging you.

197
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,160
She's been a coward since she was a kid.

198
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,880
I really feel guilty.

199
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,560
This time,

200
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,280
no matter what,

201
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,880
you must let her come back safely.

202
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,320
Come on.

203
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,840
Come on.

204
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,240
Have a drink.

205
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,320
Okay.

206
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,680
Wait.

207
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,800
If you don't get a drink,

208
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,560
she lives in the fort.

209
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,520
Can she keep the level of19 test before giving birth?

210
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,520
Xiaobao.

211
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:18,840
most它的欢酷对�役不金氏

212
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,680
Day Zhao

213
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,900
so it is true

214
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,240
that dream

215
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
Took YOU

216
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,520
I drink

217
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,920
so you dare not drank

218
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,520
Fuían

219
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,120
aside

220
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:36,720
cold

221
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,720
snub

222
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:38,600
and close

223
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,320
still afraid that

224
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,120
Yes.

225
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,720
I didn't expect Mr. Du Jun to be so delicate.

226
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,160
This young sister is so chargeable.

227
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,100
you are a mad woman.

228
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,200
There are pleasure in ourselves when you are hardshipy.

229
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,640
May we express our gratitude to...

230
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,320
Can the這樣 do any party wheels hard to take your breathe in?

231
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,760
Fashion sense ismares

232
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,680
but scary here.

233
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,360
Yes.

234
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,520
Let us ask Sir and Sister to rest down here.

235
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,300
No need to homepage.

236
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,620
Thanks.

237
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,420
Lord Zhang

238
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,160
Xiao Yan

239
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,760
You came out right into me Shi Feng

240
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,600
this crime is not a childhood story.

241
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,000
I woke up every night

242
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,480
to sky immediately after meeting her in the hospital.

243
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,400
I had a plot twist

244
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,360
but I lost myande to these low-end木heads

245
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,080
so that I could just mistake them

246
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,220
for prospecting a mutual relationship.

247
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,160
So it's safer.

248
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,760
They seem to be not in a good mood.

249
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,760
According to the normal logic,

250
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,760
they should leave the capital early.

251
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,760
But they insist on waiting for General Feng.

252
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,760
I think this person is also the top in the party.

253
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,760
It seems that there will be a battle tomorrow.

254
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,760
Don't worry.

255
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,760
I will protect you.

256
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,760
When I arrive in the next city,

257
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,760
I will try to help you leave.

258
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,760
But before that,

259
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,760
I will have to make you feel sorry for me.

260
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,760
I will believe you at any time.

261
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,760
I can wait for the winter at the end of the night.

262
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,760
I will slowly recall.

263
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,760
I forget that I have no you.

264
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,760
Tonight, I will take you to rest here.

265
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,760
I will bring you back to the palace tomorrow.

266
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,760
Where are you going?

267
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,760
Please rest in peace.

268
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,760
Thank you.

269
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,760
I will stay outside.

270
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,760
The night breeze of this mountain is cold.

271
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,760
It's time to escape.

272
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,760
You still have to take care of the so-called ceremony.

273
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,760
Your Highness, I am here.

274
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,760
Miss Jiang,

275
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,760
Miss Jiang, please rest now.

276
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,760
I will go out and guard for you.

277
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,760
Now, people outside think that I have nothing to do with you.

278
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,760
If you go out,

279
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,760
won't you suspect me?

280
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,760
It's a very long time.

281
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,760
We can rest together.

282
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
Besides,

283
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,760
I am a little scared.

284
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,760
I will let you go.

285
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,760
Don't worry.

286
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,760
You will be fine.

287
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,760
I will take care of you.

288
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,760
Your Majesty,

289
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,760
I need to see you.

290
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,760
Your Majesty,

291
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,760
Duke of the State,

292
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,120
I'm here to discuss with His Majesty

293
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,480
about the big trouble we had last night.

294
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,680
Please allow me to leave.

295
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,600
I'm here to do this.

296
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,040
How did you know about this?

297
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,200
Last night,

298
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,280
I planned to deal with Xie Qing.

299
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,560
I came here to get rid of the rebellion

300
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,880
to let Zhang Zhe

301
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,160
go to the rebellion

302
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,880
and investigate the rebellion.

303
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Why didn't His Majesty tell me earlier?

304
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,480
You don't trust me?

305
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,280
I mean it.

306
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,640
The less people know, the better.

307
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,960
Last night,

308
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,760
the State's reinforcements were new.

309
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,080
I'm afraid

310
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,120
they've already investigated the rebellion.

311
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,920
I came here today

312
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,480
to ask Your Majesty

313
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,360
to give me the seal of Yan's family.

314
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,480
I can go to Tongzhou to receive the seal.

315
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,680
You can't.

316
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,320
I've never been a soldier.

317
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,360
How can I finish this?

318
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,360
Last night,

319
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,480
Xingwu Wei has been killed by many rebels.

320
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,560
So,

321
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,400
I should

322
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,800
go there personally.

323
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,040
You're right.

324
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,800
This is the most important place

325
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,000
for Xie Meng.

326
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,840
I'm sure...

327
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,000
So many people died last night.

328
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,280
You can go back first.

329
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,920
We'll arrange the execution of the rebellion.

330
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,920
We'll make a decision

331
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,080
after Xie Qing and I discuss it.

332
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,480
Rest...

333
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,040
I'm leaving.

334
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,920
Didn't you say

335
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,320
that we should jump around

336
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,480
the palace Soy sneak here?

337
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,580
Why do you hang up?

338
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,580
I've been in the palace for a long time.

339
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,500
I'm sure that the capital will be more careful

340
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,500
if I'm in the capital.

341
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,500
Duke Ding is not familiar with the plan.

342
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,100
If I go there,

343
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,900
I'm afraid I'll be in trouble.

344
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,180
Moreover,

345
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,780
His Majesty is in charge of the military service.

346
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,180
I'll go there

347
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,260
to help His Majesty

348
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,420
to take over the Yan Army.

349
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,900
It's not a good idea.

350
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,460
I'm sorry.

351
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,900
But don't forget that

352
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,900
you first go to troops.

353
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,580
We'll ask Duke Ding

354
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,900
to operate over four Virginia Arm's equally well enough.

355
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,340
Make sure

356
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,060
you don't make one genetically weak step.

357
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,420
The flower blooms, the world is full of flowers

358
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:15,740
Without your encounter

359
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:20,060
I can wait for the winter to bloom

360
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:24,060
I will slowly leave the memories

361
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:28,300
I have forgotten myself, I don't have you

362
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,140
What happened?

363
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,140
Sir, General Feng wants to see you

364
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:42,140
The flower blooms, the world is full of flowers

365
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,860
Without your encounter

366
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:49,260
I can wait for the winter to bloom

367
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,540
I will slowly leave the memories

368
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:56,620
I have forgotten myself, I don't have you

369
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,300
What happened?

370
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,900
I don't have you

371
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,340
What happened?

372
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,260
I have forgotten myself, I don't have you

373
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,540
What happened?

374
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,500
I have forgotten myself, I don't have you

375
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,100
Since we're here, where should we go?

376
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,100
There's no rush.

377
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,500
I have one thing to ask.

378
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,100
Since you already know that there's a chance for the attack on the city,

379
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,900
why don't you tell the truth?

380
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,100
The attack on the city has been arrested.

381
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,500
How many secretaries and secretaries in the capital are already been published?

382
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,300
If I act rashly,

383
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,100
I'll only destroy the king's blood for many years.

384
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,300
This is a...

385
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,700
A good excuse.

386
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,500
It's just that Mr. Du Jun has been sent out of the capital.

387
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
I haven't seen him before.

388
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,500
Mr. Gong Yi is not well-known.

389
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,900
He can't be compared to him.

390
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,900
But you're in a high position.

391
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,100
You should know about us.

392
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,900
Why don't you tell me?

393
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,900
Why am I here?

394
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,900
Zhang Mou Yu went to the capital many years ago.

395
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,100
The capital has been in a state of crisis for a long time.

396
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,100
However, General Feng is the one who's holding the king's military power.

397
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,700
General, you came here because you didn't know.

398
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,500
These are just your guess.

399
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,300
It's not a big deal.

400
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,100
It's not enough to prove your identity.

401
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,500
Although Mr. Zhang is a spy,

402
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,500
he's not very good at protecting people.

403
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,500
If he keeps doing this, he'll be too much.

404
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,700
He needs to think of a way to do it.

405
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,300
Brother,

406
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,900
you don't have to keep him in his face until now.

407
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,700
He's been in the capital for a long time.

408
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,900
He's been in trouble for many people.

409
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,100
But he's not done anything.

410
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,100
It's strange.

411
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,100
But now, it's obviously against him.

412
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,900
General Feng doesn't suspect him.

413
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,300
But he's been keeping an eye on you.

414
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,700
Who knows if they've colluded secretly.

415
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,700
I think they just want to delay our retreat.

416
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,300
They want to lure the court to arrest people.

417
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,500
You're so ridiculous.

418
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,700
Who are you?

419
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,300
Did I say anything wrong?

420
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,100
I'm talking to you about the internet.

421
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,700
Why should I talk to you?

422
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,100
If you hadn't come here last night,

423
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,500
we would have left the capital.

424
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,900
Today, we have a general Feng who is not familiar with it.

425
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,300
He's not going to pursue the palace.

426
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,300
He just wants to find out about the prince's plan.

427
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,500
He said he didn't have any plans.

428
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,700
Enough.

429
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,700
Don't be so kind before you get into trouble.

430
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:21,300
I'll take back the capital and share it with you.

431
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,100
General Feng,

432
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,700
there were so many troubles in the last night.

433
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,500
If we keep it up,

434
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,500
I'm afraid that we'll be in trouble.

435
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,700
That's right. Let's talk about the way up.

436
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,100
No.

437
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,300
The whole of Tongzhou is important.

438
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,900
I can't let a person who is not familiar with the way up

439
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,300
to come and discuss with us.

440
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,100
You can kill him.

441
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,100
You can't let go of him.

442
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,300
Mr. Zhang,

443
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,500
I'll ask you one last time.

444
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,300
If you can't prove your identity anymore,

445
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,100
don't blame me for being rude to you.

446
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,700
I'll take back the capital.

447
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,700
I'll take care of the prince's murder.

448
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,900
Who is it?

449
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,300
Good morning, everyone.

450
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,700
If you're not angry,

451
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,700
I'll smile for you.

452
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,700
I'll make the Xue family enjoy their life.

453
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,300
It's him?

454
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,100
So he's also the one who's the prince of Pingnan.

455
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,500
The last time he returned to the capital

456
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,700
with the identity of the prince's son,

457
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,300
he was in the mess in the Xue family.

458
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,100
Could it be the prince of Pingnan's arrangement?

459
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,300
Consort Xue,

460
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,100
what are you hiding here for?

461
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,900
You don't have the face to pick up people?

462
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,100
If I'm not hiding,

463
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,700
how can I watch this show?

464
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,700
Besides,

465
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,100
if I'm not hiding,

466
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,300
how can I know the army of the legend?

467
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,300
How can you be so stupid?

468
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,300
By the way,

469
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,700
Consort Ding is the most common person among the prince.

470
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,100
She must have seen the army of the army.

471
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,500
I've already said that she's fake.

472
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,300
Take her down!

473
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,700
I'm not sure if you're a normal person.

474
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,300
How can you hide such a pretty sister?

475
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,300
They're all brothers.

476
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,300
Why don't you introduce me to them?

477
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,100
Is she really a fake?

478
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,900
You're not even sure if she's a real one.

479
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,300
I'm sure she's a real one.

480
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,900
I think she's a real one.

481
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,900
I'm sure she's a real one.

482
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,300
She's a real one.

483
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,500
She's a real one.

484
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,900
I'm sure she's a real one.

485
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,900
If she's a real one,

486
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,900
you're going to be honest with her.

487
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,900
Are you crazy?

488
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,700
I didn't say she's a fake.

489
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,900
You're just a ghost.

490
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,700
You're just a ghost.

491
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,700
Mr. Xue,

492
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,300
please give me a private lesson.

493
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,100
Sir,

494
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,700
when we were playing the violin together,

495
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,500
you called me Consort Ding.

496
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,500
Why are you so upset

497
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,300
in front of a woman?

498
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,100
Consort Ding.

499
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:18,900
General,

500
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,100
since you've confirmed your identity,

501
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,100
you're not going to be late.

502
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,700
Just go.

503
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,500
Let's go.

504
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,700
Miss Hao,

505
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,500
who's your surname?

506
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,300
Do you know Consort Ding?

507
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,100
I've never seen her.

508
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,100
Then why did she help us?

509
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,500
I'm afraid that she has more secrets

510
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,300
on her body.

511
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,380
What did you say?

512
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,300
Husband,

513
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,500
it's all entãoime.

514
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,100
His Majesty warned you

515
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,100
that it was wrong to make a small presence.

516
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,660
He did planetta

517
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,900
but you now know that,

518
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,900
I told you to order troops to the East Zhou immediately

519
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,900
to help Xie Shao Shi to be peaceful.

520
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,900
That Xie Wei is just a civil official.

521
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,900
It's still not worth it.

522
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,900
Go and call Ye'er.

523
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,900
This time, the new position

524
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,900
must be under great power.

525
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,900
Yes.

526
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,900
Please wait, Duke.

527
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,900
I think this matter needs to be dealt with carefully.

528
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,900
Xie Shao Shi is now in a bad position.

529
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,900
But you have to be paid by him.

530
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,900
We have been keeping the soldiers' health for years.

531
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,900
We have been holding them till now.

532
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,900
If Xie Shao Shi finds out, it will be troublesome.

533
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,900
You are right.

534
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,900
Since the time of the ceremony,

535
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,900
he has been in my team.

536
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,900
I have to defend him.

537
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,900
Guards and setup

538
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,900
Sir, someone is sick.

539
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,900
The patient died sometime ago.

540
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,900
Sir,

541
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,700
Brat this idiot,

542
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,900
is a natural impotent.

543
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,900
Search a little bit.

544
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,620
What?

545
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:47,980
It seems that Zhenning

546
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,140
is really with them.

547
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,780
What are you talking about?

548
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,180
Xiaobao said that

549
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,300
Feng Mingyu has started to suspect

550
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,700
but Xue Dingfei

551
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,100
has helped him to make the certificate

552
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,660
and has gone to Tongzhou.

553
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,500
But with Zhang Zhizhing,

554
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,300
he must have started to suspect

555
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,540
how I arranged Xue Dingfei

556
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,900
to the plan.

557
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,940
Sir, this person is not allowed to talk anymore.

558
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:11,860
He has taken to Tongzhou.

559
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,820
He must go out.

560
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,820
What should we do next?

561
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,060
We will go to Tongzhou first.

562
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,940
They are in the carriage.

563
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,060
They must be running fast.

564
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,260
Our speedy horsemen

565
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,540
must be faster than them.

566
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,660
We must search Tongzhou immediately.

567
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,540
We must find Feng Mingyu's location

568
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,100
before we can find the suspect.

569
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:28,980
Yes.

570
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,060
Good girl.

571
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,060
This carriage is good, right?

572
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,300
If it is a horse,

573
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,140
we must call you.

574
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,540
Who is your sister?

575
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,700
Mr. Zhang and I

576
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,300
are good brothers.

577
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,420
Are you Li Yinghan's brother?

578
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,340
Mr. Zhang, I think something is wrong.

579
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,620
Although Zhenning is here,

580
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,780
we have been here

581
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,180
for an hour.

582
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,780
They seem to be in the carriage.

583
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,220
We must find the suspect.

584
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,220
We have been here before.

585
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,100
They seem to be taking us around.

586
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,820
They are not in a hurry to go to Tongzhou.

587
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,460
What are they waiting for?

588
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,780
The judge, General Feng, said

589
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,580
that Tongzhou is important.

590
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,500
Do they want to

591
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,540
take action in Tongzhou?

592
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,660
If this action is against the court,

593
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,980
I must find out.

594
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,300
General Feng,

595
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,620
when we behave like this,

596
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,100
do we even lose control?

597
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,380
It is so difficult to find this out for us.

598
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:50,140
There are many suspicious people

599
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,100
But we arerunny.

600
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,260
If all goes wrong with the town,

601
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,420
we will lose economic father.

602
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,060
No need to worry.

603
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,580
I am set in my plan.

604
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,020
I think you can arrange concerns as you wish.

605
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,500
The court provides the emergency since it only burdened Yan Mu.

606
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,140
You can only send my new Уо Despiteves to search.

607
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,180
And you two is too old for that.

608
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,180
I'm not sure who will win.

609
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,180
I'm so tired of getting 13 times the number of times.

610
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,180
The scenery here is good.

611
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,180
Why don't you stop for a meal?

612
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,180
Young Master Ding Fei,

613
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,180
you're not here to play with water.

614
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,180
Why?

615
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,180
I'm injured.

616
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,180
You go and wait for me.

617
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,180
I'm not leaving anyway.

618
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,180
You go by yourself if you want to leave.

619
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,180
This place is not good.

620
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,180
Be careful.

621
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,180
Miss, let me help you.

622
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,180
Help me boil water.

623
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,180
Young Master Ding Fei,

624
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,180
if you're okay, come and help me.

625
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,180
I can't play alone.

626
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,180
Tell me the truth.

627
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,180
I helped Zhang Zhe Meng to get over the grudge.

628
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,180
What's the use of selling this behavior in the lake?

629
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,180
And that girl.

630
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,180
What's the situation?

631
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,180
According to your plan,

632
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,180
that girl shouldn't be here.

633
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,180
It's like a change of last night.

634
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,180
I'm also a little bit worried about you.

635
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,180
Other things are a little bit like that.

636
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,180
I only agreed to play the role of

637
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,180
convincing them to get over it.

638
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,180
Now I should have escaped.

639
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,180
Now that you're in this group,

640
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,180
how can I tell Wang Yan when I'm back to the capital?

641
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,180
You keep these words in front of you.

642
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,180
Two-faced and three-tongued people

643
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,180
won't play well.

644
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,180
You can let Feng Ming Yu die in Tongzhou

645
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,180
and you can kill him.

646
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,180
No.

647
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,180
This way.

648
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,180
Xiao Shi.

649
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,180
Hey, master.

650
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,180
Come on, rest.

651
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,180
Come.

652
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,180
Beat him up.

653
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,180
Come back to the capital and let him come.

654
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,180
Game is over.

655
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,180
Can I stop now?

656
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,180
Big brother...

657
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,180
Who am I?

658
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,180
Why should I help you?

659
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:41,180
I've heard your name.

660
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,180
I have a question in my heart.

661
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,180
But even if I ask you,

662
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,180
will you answer me?

663
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,180
No matter what reason,

664
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:53,180
you've already been a witness.

665
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:56,180
You've just opened the palace and never returned to your original position.

666
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:59,180
You can only help me hide my identity on this journey.

667
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,180
Are you threatening me?

668
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,180
I'm not threatening you.

669
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,180
I'm just doing a collaboration.

670
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,180
Why don't you tell me your purpose?

671
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,180
Maybe I can help you out.

672
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:15,180
Otherwise, I won't be able to expose you.

673
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:20,180
I'm afraid you'll be in danger.

674
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,180
You're not making a mistake.

675
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,180
You're the one who's weak.

676
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,180
I'm a new member of the department.

677
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,180
But Lord Zhang won't be in the same team with me.

678
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:31,180
I don't care about your mission.

679
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,180
You're a threat.

680
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,180
Threat?

681
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,180
Who?

682
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,180
I've never heard of it.

683
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,180
It's useless to deny it.

684
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,180
I'm the one who knows my mission.

685
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,180
I'm sure you know someone in the court.

686
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,180
I'm here to help you out.

687
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,180
I don't know.

688
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:01,180
I can't think of another answer except for Xie Shao.

689
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,180
So what?

690
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:07,180
Anyway, Lord Zhang has to be careful on the way here.

691
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:11,180
That famous word doesn't sound like my good temper.

692
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:14,180
He can kill you anytime.

693
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,180
Thank you for your reminder.

694
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,180
One or two eggs?

695
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,180
Why are they so strong?

696
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,180
Here.

697
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,180
Put it here.

698
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,180
Okay.

699
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,180
Sorry, I was too careless.

700
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,180
I'll have to trouble you again.

701
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,180
It's okay.

702
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,180
What are you thinking about?

703
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,180
Let's go.

704
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,180
I'll take you to the west.

705
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,180
Where are you going?

706
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,180
Don't go to see others.

707
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,180
If they see you,

708
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,180
they'll think you're a fool.

709
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:30,180
Don't go back there.

710
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,180
Have a feel for yourkeepers.

711
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:46,180
Don't stay at home until it'sそれでは.

712
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,180
Not much伞 will solve this matter.

713
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,180
Keep usutt the crops,...

714
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:56,180
...and let's smart eat them.

715
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,180
Do you have any news, Mr. Zhang?

716
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,180
There are many ways to avoid them.

717
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,180
Who told you to use this kind of self-sufficiency?

718
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,180
This method is the fastest.

719
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:12,180
And the needle to make the play will make people believe.

720
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,180
It was their carriage.

721
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,180
It's inconvenient to talk on the carriage.

722
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,180
Then the money is a little tight.

723
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,180
But it's convenient now.

724
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,180
My hand is fine.

725
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,180
Yes.

726
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,180
What do you want to ask?

727
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,180
Don't ask.

728
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,180
In the temple,

729
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,180
how did you know about the palace city?

730
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,180
But it was also told by Xie Shao Shi.

731
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,180
I checked Xue Ding Fei's ingredients.

732
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,180
I found that he should also be with Xie Shao Shi.

733
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,180
But the strange thing is,

734
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,180
why didn't Xie Shao Shi mention this to me?

735
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,180
Don't you think that

736
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:48,180
Xie Shao Shi and you are too close?

737
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:51,180
Maybe Xie Shao Shi has many difficulties to explain.

738
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,180
But he must be a good person.

739
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,180
Miss Jiang,

740
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,180
the evaluation is so bad.

741
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,180
You can't just talk with your heart.

742
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,180
Most of the time, there are reasons for making mistakes.

743
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,180
Someone didn't take revenge.

744
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,180
Someone didn't repay the kindness.

745
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,180
But no matter what the purpose is,

746
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,180
it's wrong.

747
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,180
I beg you to let Zhou Yun Zhi go.

748
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:15,180
I didn't expect to harm you.

749
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:18,180
You are so innocent and wise.

750
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:21,180
Even the judge doesn't dare to make a simple conclusion.

751
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:24,180
But why do you want to commit suicide?

752
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:27,180
I am the one who should make a decision.

753
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,180
Isn't that so?

754
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,180
I let you speak.

755
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,180
So in your heart,

756
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,180
if you make a mistake,

757
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,180
it's useless to make up for it.

758
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,180
Right?

759
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,180
Did Xie Shao Shi make a mistake?

760
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,180
Now, it's still a good thing to do.

761
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,180
It's not important to do it now.

762
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,180
I've thought about it on this road.

763
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,180
Before entering Tongzhou, it's all the mountain roads.

764
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,180
Even if we escape,

765
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,180
we will be caught very quickly.

766
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,180
You are right.

767
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:10,180
Let's enter Tongzhou first and then escape.

768
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,180
We need to figure out the plan for Feng Ming Yu.

769
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,180
I am very guilty of this crime.

770
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,180
I can't let you be in danger.

771
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,180
When you enter the city,

772
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,180
you can be treated by Miss Jiang.

773
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,180
The penalty area is Yongding Medical Hall.

774
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,180
There will be a court official to take care of it.

775
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,180
What about you?

776
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,180
I will follow Feng Ming Yu.

777
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,180
I will find out all the secrets of the opposition.

778
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,180
And then I will send the news to the court.

779
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,180
That's not good.

780
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,180
You don't even have a Zhao Ying.

781
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,180
It's too dangerous.

782
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,180
I promised the teacher.

783
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,180
I will take this opportunity to make a mess for the court.

784
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,180
Mr. Zhang.

785
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,180
Mr. Zhang. Miss Zhang.

786
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,180
Let's eat.

787
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,180
Go back.

788
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,180
Sir.

789
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:09,180
Why do I think their attitude is not good?

790
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,180
We are here because of Feng Ming Yu.

791
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,180
In their eyes, the court dares to take the Yan family.

792
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,180
Naturally, they think we are here to find the mountain.

793
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,180
What are you doing?

794
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,180
I am sorry.

795
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,180
I am so confused.

796
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,180
I have to see the uncle.

797
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,180
And I will come to the commander to help.

798
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,180
I am so confused.

799
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,180
Come on. Come here.

800
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,180
Uncle.

801
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,180
General.

802
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:39,180
General Yan Liu.

803
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,180
The letter that the Marquis left has been received.

804
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:48,180
Mr. Xie is grateful to the Yan army for the change.

805
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:51,180
We all have it in our hearts.

806
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,180
But we hope you can understand.

807
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,180
The Yan army belongs to the Yan family.

808
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,180
I understand.

809
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:01,180
I have never thought about changing it.

810
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,180
You are not here for the emperor.

811
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,180
Yes.

812
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,180
But it's not completely true.

813
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,180
Marquis Yan is released now.

814
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,180
But he will come back sooner.

815
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,180
Before the final report,

816
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:15,180
what I want to do is to prevent the Yan army from falling into the Duke's hands.

817
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,180
Will the Marquis really come back?

818
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,180
He will.

819
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:21,180
But the time is not up yet.

820
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,180
What time?

821
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,180
A big battle.

822
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:29,180
When the imperial court is useless,

823
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,180
we can give up.

824
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,180
As for now,

825
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:35,180
I would like to ask General Yan to help me.

826
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,180
As the news is reliable,

827
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,180
the King of Pingnan will be in trouble in Tongzhou.

828
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:44,180
General Yan Liu, please arrange for the people to search the army.

829
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,180
See if there is any medicine to bury.

830
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,180
Medicine?

831
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,180
They want to destroy the army?

832
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,180
We can't be sure yet.

833
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,180
But be careful.

834
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,180
Okay.

835
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,180
I will tell them.

836
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,180
You can rest here.

837
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,180
I will arrange a camp for you.

838
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,180
No need.

839
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,180
I have an important matter to attend to.

840
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,180
Okay.

841
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,180
Sorry, Lord Zhang.

842
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,180
I didn't mean it.

843
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,180
It's nothing.

844
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,180
I am Feng Mingyu.

845
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:34,180
If you are old, you can't ride a horse.

846
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,180
Why don't we go there first?

847
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:38,180
There is a way to take you down.

848
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,180
You can't ride a horse.

849
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,180
You just got the imperial decree.

850
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,180
You killed someone.

851
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:46,180
Do you know if there is any safety in Tongzhou?

852
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:49,180
Is there anything urgent that you want to do?

853
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:50,180
I don't have any urgent matter.

854
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,180
I just want to ask you this.

855
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,180
You...

856
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,180
Don't be angry.

857
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:57,180
Don't be angry.

858
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,180
You are not dead.

859
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,180
If there is anything urgent,

860
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,180
you can come and listen to me.

861
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,180
Maybe I can ask the former Shao of Jincheng

862
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,180
to help you.

863
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,180
I am anxious to go to the city.

864
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,180
You can go and have a look for me.

865
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,180
I don't know how to speak.

866
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:14,180
I don't want to listen to you.

867
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,180
Don't listen to me.

868
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,180
What happened?

869
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:20,180
Why don't you go?

870
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,180
It's Tongzhou City ahead.

871
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,180
We have so many people coming in.

872
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:30,180
It's not safe to be in Thailand.

873
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,180
Why don't we split up?

874
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,180
You and I,

875
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:33,180
Miss Zhang,

876
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,180
follow Huang Qian.

877
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:27,180
I am so sorry.

878
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,180
I am sorry.

879
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,180
I am sorry.

880
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,180
I am sorry.

881
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:31,180
I am sorry.

882
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:32,180
I am sorry.

883
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,180
I am sorry.

884
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,180
I am sorry.

885
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,180
I am sorry.

886
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,180
I am sorry.

887
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:37,180
I am sorry.

888
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,180
I am sorry.

889
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,180
I am sorry.

890
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,180
I am sorry.

891
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,180
I am sorry.

892
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:42,180
I am sorry.

893
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,180
I am sorry.

894
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,180
I am sorry.

895
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,180
I am sorry.

896
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,180
I am sorry.

897
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,180
I am sorry.

898
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:48,180
I am sorry.

899
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,180
I am sorry.

900
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,180
I am sorry.

901
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,180
I am sorry.

902
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:52,180
I am sorry.

903
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:53,180
I am sorry.

904
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:54,180
I am sorry.

905
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:55,180
I am sorry.

906
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:56,180
I am sorry.

907
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:57,180
I am sorry.

908
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:58,180
I am sorry.

909
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:59,180
I am sorry.

910
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:00,180
I am sorry.

911
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:01,180
I am sorry.

912
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:02,180
I am sorry.

913
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,180
I am sorry.

914
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:04,180
I am sorry.

915
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,180
I am sorry.

916
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,180
I am sorry.

917
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,180
I am sorry.

918
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:08,180
I am sorry.

919
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:09,180
I am sorry.

920
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,180
I am sorry.

921
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,180
I am sorry.

922
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,180
I am sorry.

923
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:13,180
I am sorry.

924
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,180
I am sorry.

925
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:15,180
I am sorry.

926
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,180
I am sorry.

927
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:17,180
I am sorry.

928
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:18,180
I am sorry.

929
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:19,180
I am sorry.

930
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:20,180
I am sorry.

931
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,180
I am sorry.

932
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,180
I am sorry.

933
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:23,180
