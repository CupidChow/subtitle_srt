Still, I ended up like that.

Yes.

103

He was just a stableman.

104
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:53,960
He's the one

105
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,510

You don't know Zhou?

112

He comes from a humble family and is good at fawning upon the rich and the powerful.

he's been badmouthing you to His Highness a lot.

125

But somehow,

126
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,640
he got His Highness's order

127
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,710
and was coming to the capital.

128

to not forget who you are.

132
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,260
Who is he to tell me who I am?

133
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:00,950
Bring it on.

There are no decent plants in my garden.

Sorry to bore you, Ning.

138
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,760
Why don't you plant some Nerium oleander?

139
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,880
It looks gorgeous, but it's actually very poisonous.

140
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,140
It fits the scene well.

141
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:42,840
Yes.

142
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:46,620
Ning.

143
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,320
Zhou is good at martial arts after all.

144
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,810
He's a rare matching opponent to me.

145
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,110
He could fight with you

146
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,650
because others dared not fight with you.

147

Qing Feng.

149
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,880
I asked him to get some wine.

150

Why is it taking him so long?

151
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,170
Right.

152
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,790
I'll go take a look.

153
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,850

154
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:13,410
Enjoy.

155
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,190
If I remember it correctly,

156
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,870
I have reminded you last time

157
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,620
not to mess with Yan Lin, Mr. Zhou.

158
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,950
Are you determined to get involved in this mess?

159
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,210
Miss, you must have heard of this saying.

160

The tree may long for calmness, but the wind will not subside.

Even if I don't do it,

I knew you were coming today,

166

00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,940
of the Yan family colluding with Lord Pingnan,

174
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,360
right?

175
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:09,200
His Majesty is quite intimidated by Lord Pingnan.

176
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,070
If the Xue family wants to overthrow the Yan family,

177
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,630
it must be some serious crime that can take the whole family down.

178
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,810
The Yan family has been loyal for generations.

179
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,030
They couldn't get what they want.

180
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,220
That's why I thought

181
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,270
they'd want to forge evidence.

182
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,640
You're so smart. I'm ashamed of my inferiority.

183
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,770
I've obeyed you

184
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,010
and stopped stealing

185
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,750
or looking for His Lordship's seal and handwriting anymore.

186
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,430
But Duke of Xue just wouldn't let me go.

187
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,570
I thought

188
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,450
I could fool him with some casual handwriting.

189
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,080
But who would expect that

190
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,860
I would find something huge?

191
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,470
What is it?

192
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,700
Are you sure you were not mistaken?

193
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,780
I work for the Xingwu Guards.

194
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,650
That…

195
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,620
I've seen Lord Pingnan's emblem too many times.

196
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,950
How could I be mistaken?

197
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,270
Miss,

198
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,680
this is a serious matter.

199
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,900
I should have reported it.

200
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,770
But if Duke of Xue knows about this,

201
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,660
the Yan family will be punished for sure.

202
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,660
I am also destined

203
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,370
to be killed since I've outlived my usefulness.

204
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,040
So, Miss,

205
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,840
please tell me

206
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,790
what I should do next.

207
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,580
I can't take your salute.

208
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,430
As you can see,

209
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,310
I want to help the Yan family.

210
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,590
But like you,

211
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,730
I'm also a nobody.

212
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,780
It's okay for nobodies to work together for profit.

213
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,420
Although I have nothing now,

214
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,870
it's easy for me

215
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:22,980
to kill you.

216
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,220
Do you believe it?

217
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:24,600
Yes.

218
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,730
If you tell the Yan family about this,

219
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,020
they can take my life thousands of times.

220
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,920
That's right.

221
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,110
You may not be able to enjoy

222
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,580
what the Xue family promised you.

223
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,100
Besides, what you saw was just fragments of the emblem.

224
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,510
You don't know what's written in the letter.

225
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,120
I believe

226
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,110
the Yan family has no intention to rebel.

227
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,870
There must be some other explanation.

228
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,360
Anyway,

229
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,080
don't let anyone know

230
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,930
about the burnt letter.

231
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:49,790
Yes.

232
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,360
It's mainly about Duke Xue.

233
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,600
If they want to forge it,

234
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,430
they'll need Marquis of Yan's handwriting and seal.

235
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,110
The handwriting is easier to get.

236
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,040
It's easy to find on the memorials.

237
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,070
You can fool them with some copybook

238
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,390
and buy some time.

239
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,470
But it's not a long-term solution.

240
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,280
The one who started the trouble is the one who should solve it.

241
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,860
You are right about one thing.

242
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,180
Even if it's not you,

243
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,650
there will be someone else

244
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,140
who will tell Yan Lin

245
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,620
everything you found out.

246
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,580
It's time for him

247
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,610
to grow up.

248
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,400
Your Highness.

249
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,450
-Where is the wine? -Your Highness.

250
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,450
-Where's the wine? -We have a guest.

251
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:47,530
Sir.

252
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,630
I didn't know you'd come suddenly.

253
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,280
I'm sorry.

254
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:53,540
It doesn't matter.

255
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,500
There's no need to stand on ceremony in your residence.

256
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,140
It's already past mid autumn.

257
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,870
Why haven't the flowers of this tree bloomed yet?

258
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,190
This tree was planted by my aunt

259
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,540
before she got married.

260
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,110
Twenty years ago, my aunt passed away.

261
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,440
The leaves started withering.

262
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,370
Since then, its flowers have never bloomed again,

263
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,450
as if it were dead.

264
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,880
Are you here for my father, Sir?

265
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,350
Father went to the military camp.

266
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,210
He might be back late. How about taking a rain check?

267
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,360
Why do you

268
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,880
smell like charcoal?

269
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,560
Are you having a barbecue in the garden?

270
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:29,890
Excuse me.

271
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:32,050
It seems I came at the right time.

272
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:32,810
Speaking of which,

273
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,510
I haven't had game meat for years.

274
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,300
May I join you?

275
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,210
What's wrong with Xie Wei?

276
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,840
Why did he come to the Yan Mansion for no reason?

277
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,920
Now that he saw me with Zhou Yinzhi,

278
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,320
I don't know what trouble he'll cause.

279
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,680
My goodness, you're still eating?

280
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,190
Get him out of here.

281
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,080
We're not friends.

282
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,780
Why do we have to eat together?

283
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,190
Your Highness,

284
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,890
there's not much meat left.

285
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,980
How about I go to the kitchen and get some more for you?

286
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,980
I'll be back soon.

287
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,000
Why are you so irritable?

288
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,980
Our fearless Ning

289
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,130
is afraid of Mr. Xie?

290
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,210
I wonder what will happen in class in the future.

291
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,210
Eat your meat.

292
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,740
Ning'er,

293
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,000
is this how you treat Viscount Yan?

294
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,980
-It's okay. -Mr. Xie, don't get me wrong.

295
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,580
Yan Lin and I are best friends.

296
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,630
He likes hot food.

297
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:55,700
Right?

298
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:57,990
Come on.

299
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,830
Drink some wine.

300
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,690
Don't burn your tongue.

301
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,220
Ning'er.

302
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,030
Don't you know drinking is bad for health?

303
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,130
Since you're friends,

304
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,450
you should be beneficial to each other.

305
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,850
You don't even know that?

306
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,530
Yes.

307
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,070
You're right, Sir.

308
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,060
I'll drink.

309
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,910
It will only hurt my body, okay?

310
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:13,330
Ning.

311
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,300
I don't know what's wrong with her today.

312
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,160
She's so drunk.

313
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:24,530
Ning.

314
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,240
Why don't you stay here for one night?

315
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,530
I want to go home.

316
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,620
Don't worry, Your Highness.

317
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,130
I have something

318
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,710
to ask Mr. Jiang about.

319
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,870
I can send Miss Ning'er

320
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,330
back to the Jiang Mansion.

321
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:40,580
In that case,

322
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,640
I'll leave her to you, Sir. Thanks.

323
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,050
Let's go.

324
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,060
Are you done pretending?

325
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,260
Get up if you're done.

326
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,770
You are so insightful.

327
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:10,840
I feel ashamed.

328
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,720
You know Zhou Yinzhi well?

329
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,910
You're mistaken, Sir.

330
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,770
We don't know each other well.

331
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,770
Think carefully before you answer.

332
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,950
Have you forgotten, Sir?

333
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,150
He was with us

334
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,980
when we came to the capital.

335
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,350
We were separated when we got robbed halfway.

336
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,290
Later, we finally got out of the wilderness.

337
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:30,320
[Four years ago]

338
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,990
It was Zhou Yinzhi and the Jiang family

339
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,930
who found us.

340
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,320
So,

341
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,190
of course there's some friendship between us.

342
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,320
Just a little bit.

343
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,380
What he wants to do now

344
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,780
has nothing to do with me.

345
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,400
You know what he wants to do?

346
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,520
To help the Xue family take down the Yan family.

347
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,130
I have persuaded him today.

348
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,750
He won't do anything to the Yan family anymore.

349
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,450
I can let myself believe that

350
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,450
you have no intention to harm Yan Lin.

351
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,990
But the court disputes are not as simple as you think.

352
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,440
I don't care what your relationship with Zhou Yinzhi

353
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,390
or who the person behind him is,

354
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,270
but I hope you'll stay out of this.

355
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:04,849
Otherwise,

356
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,109
your survival is threatened

357
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,160
even without me trying to kill you.

358
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,349
I have to ask you as well, Sir.

359
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,609
What is your relationship with Yan Lin?

360
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,150
What do you mean?

361
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,740
You come from the Xie family in Jinling.

362
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,270
You have nothing to do with the Yan family.

363
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,470
In the capital,

364
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,970
you seem to have no connections with the Yan family,

365
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,170
but you took care of Yan Lin repeatedly.

366
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,790
And now that Zhou Yinzhi showed up,

367
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,670
you even investigated it yourself.

368
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:29,720
I dare to guess

369
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,200
the secret you want to hide is related to the Yan family.

370
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,350
What does it have to do with you?

371
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,900
Yan Lin is also my friend.

372
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,540
Just like you,

373
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,290
I don't want to see him in danger.

374
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,500
Jian Shu.

375
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:48,350
Sir.

376
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,150
Follow them.

377
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:49,570
Yes.

378
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,020
I'll ask someone to send you back.

379
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,950
You didn't see anything

380
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,150
that happened today.

381
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:29,980
Zhou.

382
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:31,990
Why are you still here?

383
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,380
Your Highness,

384
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,420
I have something to tell you.

385
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,280
What happened?

386
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,370
I, Zhou Yinzhi, am a despicable person

387
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,570
who's greedy for power and profit.

388
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,900
I approached Your Highness

389
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,030
because I was ordered by Xingwu Guards

390
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,120
to investigate the evidence

391
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,790
of Lord Pingnan's collusion with the Yan family.

392
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,920
I failed your trust.

393
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,460
Please punish me severely.

394
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,270
Zhou Yinzhi.

395
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,890
Why did you

396
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,810
choose to tell me at this time?

397
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,330
It's Miss Jiang.

398
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,030
Miss Jiang and I go way back.

399
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,500
She saw through me

400
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,710
when we met today.

401
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,190
She was worried about your safety,

402
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,320
so she asked me to tell you everything.

403
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:19,270
Ning.

404
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,340
It's Ning.

405
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,930
You've treated me so well, Your Highness.

406
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,470
I am really grateful to you.

407
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,640
So if the Yan family

408
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,900
is not involved with Lord Pingnan at all,

409
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,760
I won't make up a false testimony.

410
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:35,620
But recently,

411
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,930
when I investigated the Yan family in secret,

412
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:40,930
I found that His Lordship did have contact via letters

413
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,480
with the remnants of Lord Pingnan's rebels.

414
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,560
I wonder if you know that, Your Highness.

415
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,290
What did you say?

416
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,860
You came at the right time.

417
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:15,770
Try this wine.

418
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,730
It was just delivered from the north.

419
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,260
You had a fight with Xuening?

420
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,440
Father,

421
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,150
do you know

422
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,880
the Xingwu Guards are investigating

423
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,610
the remnants of Lord Pingnan's rebels in secret?

424
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,880
People are saying that

425
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,700
this case is related to the Yan family.

426
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,260
What should come

427
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,450
will come.

428
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,450
After 20 years,

429
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,590
I still can't forget it.

430
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,310
Those who did bad things

431
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,400
won't be able to forget either.

432
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,130
Do you remember your cousin Xue Dingfei?

433
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,210
You've told me stories about him since I was young, Father.

434
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,670
You said that Lord Pingnan

435
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,320
rebelled 20 years ago.

436
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,500
In order to protect His Majesty,

437
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,560
Cousin was killed by Lord Pingnan.

438
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:15,860
Father.

439
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,490
Is there some other reason for my cousin's death?

440
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:19,290
I don't know.

441
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,860
It's just I received a letter from Lord Pingnan.

442
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,820
It said that

443
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,880
Dingfei's not dead.

444
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,470
He's in his hands.

445
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,140
How is that possible?

446
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,910
Lord Pingnan is a rebel.

447
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,120
They have wild ambitions.

448
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,910
They said that to perturb you.

449
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,080
They were obviously trying to sow discord between the Yan Family and the Xue family

450
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,880
to perturb His Majesty, Father.

451
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,790
If His Majesty is discerning,

452
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,880
no one can perturb him.

453
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,510
Rumors are just rumors.

454
00:21:59,320 --> 00:21:59,900
But

455
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,510
those who did bad things 20 years ago

456
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,510
were not the Yan family,

457
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,780
but the Xue family.

458
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,980
I've burned the letter from Lord Pingnan.

459
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:09,530
But

460
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,050
the letter in which I asked for his whereabouts

461
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,390
got in their hands.

462
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,530
The rumors in the capital

463
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,130
didn't come out of nowhere.

464
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,980
Why were you tricked into this, Father?

465
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,110
This is your cousin.

466
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,180
How could I not ask about him?

467
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:28,880
Back then,

468
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,170
before your aunt passed away,

469
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,970
she held my hand.

470
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,410
She was so sick that she couldn't speak.

471
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,110
She could only look at me with those eyes

472
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:41,760
[Xue Dingfei's mother, Yan Min]

473
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,170
and she kept crying.

474
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,100
Even when she swallowed her last breath,

475
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,600
she couldn't close her eyes.

476
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,910
In the great State of Qian,

477
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,830
how could they push a seven-year-old child out

478
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,360
to face the cruelest sword?

479
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:55,980
Is this

480
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,390
fair?

481
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:09,310
Some things

482
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,040
should be known by you now.

483
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:34,600
[Baiyun Hall]

484
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:48,580
Sir, it's all clear now.

485
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,710
He's inside.

486
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,180
Do we need more people?

487
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,130
No.

488
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,620
[Baiyun Hall]

489
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:27,950
You're here.

490
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,520
Should I call you Mr. Xie,

491
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,930
[Lord Pingnan's counsellor, Gongyi Cheng]

492
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,010
or Dujun, the Hermit?

493
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,090
Mr. Gong Yi.

494
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,120
I haven't seen you in a while.

495
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,340
How is His Highness?

496
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,240
You still remember him?

497
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,350
I thought that

498
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,850
you've long forgotten about your identity

499
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,470
since you've been in the land of wealth and tenderness at the capital.

500
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:50,130
And you've forgotten what His Highness told you

501
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:54,060
when you insisted on coming to the capital four years ago.

502
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,590
Those are some heavy words.

503
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,240
What I've done in the capital these years

504
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,880
is all under His Highness' order.

505
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,410
I dare not forget my origin.

506
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,100
How could I be anything

507
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,420
that you said?

508
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,280
The general trend of the court

509
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,070
is in the hands of the Yan and Xue families.

510
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:17,930
To achieve great things,

511
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,790
His Highness must make them fight.

512
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,860
We arranged spies in the capital

513
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,860
so that we could use their investigation on the rebels

514
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,940
to punish the Yan family for rebelling.

515
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,020
Once the Yan family falls, there will be no leader in the troops.

516
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,850
It'll be the best time for us to take action.

517
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:33,620
There's no way you don't understand this.

518
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,950
Of course I understand.

519
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,130
I've been planning for years

520
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:40,260
and making friends with the officials

521
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,130
in the capital just for this.

522
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,530
Nonsense!

523
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,790
If that's the case,

524
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,740
why did you stop the Xingwu Guards from investigating the case?

525
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:53,540
Instead, you instigated His Majesty to hand this case over to the Ministry of Justice.

526
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,380
You are obviously disloyal.

527
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,160
If you hadn't taken action in the capital

528
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,500
and made the court suspicious,

529
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,200
I wouldn't have to do all this.

530
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,080
But

531
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,260
I'm here today

532
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,360
to ask you a question.

533
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,840
I want to ask you

534
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,670
about the truth of

535
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,370
the assassin of Cengxiao Restaurant.

536
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:29,800
I said

537
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,140
I would overthrow the rule of Shen Lang.

538
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:36,690
But if you insist on interfering,

539
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,580
I have no right to stop you, Mr. Gong Yi.

540
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:44,950
But

541
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,260
I have to tell you.

542
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,070
If you kill our comrades

543
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,510
in the name of His Highness,

544
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:55,460
I won't sit back and do nothing.

545
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:20,440
Sir,

546
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,410
the capital

547
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,350
is my territory.

548
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,110
You must be careful

549
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,690
doing things here.

550
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:32,540
Xie Wei.

551
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,000
Don't forget

552
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,900
your life was saved by His Highness.

553
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,930
If you want to please both sides,

554
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,110
you will only be doomed eternally.

555
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,290
Miss.

556
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,950
Qing Feng from the Yan Mansion is here.

557
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,730
He said

558
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,770
Viscount Yan is not doing well.

559
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,450
They said

560
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,500
you locked yourself in your room.

561
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,940
How much did you drink?

562
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,480
Sorry.

563
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,390
Did I scare you?

564
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,210
Why is it so hot?

565
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,510
I'll go get a doctor.

566
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:16,610
Ning.

567
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:19,950
Don't go.

568
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:26,610
♫Time flies and everything's like a dream♫

569
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:36,010
♫I traveled so far but still can't forget you♫

570
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:35,860
I'm sorry.

571
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:42,850
♫I spent half my life loving you but ended up being a joke♫

572
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,930
Why are you saying this?

573
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,200
I should be the one

574
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,460
to say sorry.

575
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:47,270
♫My heart is broken♫

576
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,760
You've treated me so well,

577
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,920
but I failed to do the same for you.

578
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:51,010
♫But I never regret loving you♫

579
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:49,430
No.

580
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:50,990
I was too stupid.

581
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,650
I thought

582
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,990
there was no hardship in this world

583
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,450
that I couldn't overcome.

584
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:56,870
I also thought

585
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,530
I should let the whole world know that I like you.

586
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,510
But I forgot that

587
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,670
things change.

588
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,020
No one knows what will happen tomorrow.

589
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:15,860
You didn't have to go to the palace to be a study partner,

590
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,000
but I sent you in.

591
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,230
Now everyone knows

592
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,290
we grew up together.

593
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:25,260
♫We were too young to know about pain♫

594
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,880
If the Yan family gets in trouble,

595
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,170
what should you,

596
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:29,210
♫We drank under the moon amidst flowers♫

597
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,590
such a delicate girl, do?

598
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,450
How should you face those rumors?

599
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,730
♫We saw flowers blooming yesterday♫

600
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:31,390
You didn't ask me

601
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:36,370
♫And thought they'd still be blooming tomorrow♫

602
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,680
when I knew the Yan family was in trouble,

603
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,680
or how I convinced Zhou Yinzhi.

604
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:40,550
♫When we were young♫

605
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,290
You didn't suspect that I deceived you and hid it from you,

606
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:44,400
♫We believed that as long as we could♫

607
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,840
or worry that I'd tell others and hurt you.

608
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:47,280
♫Hold those warm hands♫

609
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,570
All you thought about is saying sorry to me

610
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:52,800
♫We could be with our beloved one forever♫

611
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,200
and worrying about my future.

612
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:53,540
I trust you.

613
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:58,140
♫Time flies and everything's like a dream♫

614
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,440
From beginning to end,

615
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,610
always.

616
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,170
You're so stupid.

617
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:07,050
♫I traveled so far but still can't forget you♫

618
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:05,030
You're the dumbest person in the world.

619
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,860
Because you're Ning.

620
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:14,870
♫I spent half my life loving you but ended up being a joke♫

621
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,660
You are the person who treats me the best

622
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,000
besides my father.

623
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,930
But it was me who let you know all this.

624
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:18,710
♫My heart is broken♫

625
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,270

♫But I never regret loving you♫

627
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,190
No one can live carefreely forever.

628
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,250
I should have grown up.

629
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,780
But it's too late.

630
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:32,030
No.

631
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:33,850
You still have me.

632
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:34,850
Yan Lin.

633
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,550
Let's get through this together.

634
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,450
You will still be the carefree viscount.

635
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,050
OK?

636
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:45,980
Don't cry.

637
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,260
We won't cry anymore.

638
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:48,800
OK?

639
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,320
My Lord.

640
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:10,920
You didn't sleep all night.

641
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,350
Why are you standing here in the wind now?

642
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,550
You may catch a cold.

643
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:14,830
My Lady.

644
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,380
Look at these fallen leaves.

645
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,520
They seem to rely on the trees,

646
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,450
but as soon as the wind and rain comes,

647
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:25,170
they'd fall and turn to dust.

648
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,090
Who cares about the life and death of a leaf?

649
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,720
Is something troubling you, My Lord?

650
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:31,430
No.

651
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,850
I'm just thinking about a bet.

652
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,740
So, have you decided which side to bet on?

653
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:40,170
No one in this world can be relied on forever.

654
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,790
I came from nothing to now.

655
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,040
What I learned is to bet on both sides.

656
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,890
It's okay if I'm betting on the disadvantaged side or

657
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:50,470
being used as a tool.

658
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,010
As long as I can win in the end.

659
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:55,550
Father!

660
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,720
[Long History]

661
00:32:59,440 --> 00:32:59,900
Father!

662
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:02,230
Father!

663
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,390
Bad news!

664
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,500
Something happened on the Cao River.

665
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,030
Our silk ship flipped over.

666
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:10,010
Look at you, panicking like this.

667
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,140
How inappropriate.

668
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,740
Why did the ship

669
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,770
flip over all of a sudden?

670
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,340
On the surface, it was because it rained for days on Cao River,

671
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,070
and our people overloaded it with goods.

672
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,270
So it was an accident.

673
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,170
But in fact,

674
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,140
someone dug a hole under the ship.

675
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,180
So someone wanted the ship to flip over on purpose.

676
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,620
The position and route of our ships have always been a secret.

677
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,880
It's hard for outsiders to figure out.

678
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,880
I'm afraid it was done by an insider.

679
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,220

00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,810
who's behind this.

681
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:36,760
Find him

682
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,450
and get rid of him.

683
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,680
I've sent people to investigate.

684
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,550
Water transport

685
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,580
was a business appointed by the government.

686
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,160
Over the past years, our family

687
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,370
has made acquaintance with a lot of court officials

688
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:54,430
with the money from water transport.

689
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,740
We also asked some of the

690
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,760
Xingwu Guards to work for us.

691
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,460
If this matter

692
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,780
is found to be related to the Xue family,

693
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,920
His Majesty will be furious.

694
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,520
Now is the crucial moment for the Xue family

695
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,050
to take down the Yan family.

696
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,469
So this matter

697
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,170
must be suppressed.

698
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,730
Father, don't worry.

699
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,050
Leave it to me.

700
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:16,719
Wait.

701
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:21,489
Tell Zhou Yinzhi to hurry up.

702
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:24,810
To take down the Yan family,

703
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:26,550
it has to be quick.

704
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:27,560
Yes.

705
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,080
Xie Ju'an.

706
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,980
How can you still have the mood to feed fish?

707
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,900
Gongyi Cheng has come to our door.

708
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,040
What does it mean?

709
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,120
It means Jinling

710
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,030
has started to be dissatisfied with you.

711
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,560
If they really get irritated

712
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,219
and report…

713
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,820
And report your identity as a traitor,

714
00:34:58,830 --> 00:34:59,360
your life

715
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,150
and my life

716
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,380
will both be over.

717
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,530
What's the use of being afraid?

718
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,050
Yes.

719
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,890
It's useless to be afraid.

720
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,040
But you don't have to irritate

721
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,950
that old man, Gongyi Cheng, right?

722
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:08,350
What?

723
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,810
Are you afraid he won't do something to you?

724
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:13,070
We've been in the capital for four years.

725
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:16,480
All the spies and secret agents in the city are under our control.

726
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,920
Even if Gongyi Cheng has the intention to do something,

727
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,320
there's no one he can use.

728
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,280
Besides,

729
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:25,090
Lord Pingnan still considers me useful.

730
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,170
He won't kill me.

731
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,990
Then what did he

732
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,380
come here for?

733
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:30,830
The Yan family.

734
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,320
He's anxious to make the court chaotic,

735
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,380
but he was intimidated by the strength of Yan's troops.

736
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,230
So,

737
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,490
he wants to use Duke of Xue to take down the Yan family.

738
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,190
Then why are you so calm?

739
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,680
You would always get anxious

740
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,850
once the Yan family was brought up.

741
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:54,020
If we can make Duke of Xue only concentrate on his own affairs,

742
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:57,700
even if Gongyi Cheng wants to turn the world upside down,

743
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,830
he can't do anything to the Yan family.

744

00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,410

746
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,290
You were right.

747
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,600
What the Xue family wants to hide

748
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,460
is really about water transport.

749
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:13,570
A few days ago,

750
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,900
the Xue family was joined by the big silk merchants in the capital

751
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,520
to lower the price of raw silk.

752
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,700
When the silk price fell, they secretly bought the silk

753
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,980
then shipped it to Jiangnan to weave.

754
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,650
And then it was transported back to the capital to sell at a high price.

755
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:24,510
Unexpectedly,

756
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,470
the ship flipped over on the way back.

757
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,170
The business of the Xue family

758
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,390
has always been done anonymously.

759
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,860
That's why we've been investigating them for so long

760
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,910
but we couldn't find evidence of their crimes.

761
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:37,900
But this time, they worked with the silk merchants to lower the price

762
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,500
and the ship flipped over. It's quite big news.

763
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:41,890
Since there were more people involved,

764
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:43,380
there's more evidence.

765
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,480
You two,

766
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,820
go investigate the water transport and silk merchants separately.

767
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,090

you...

769
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,240
As for me,

770
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:56,300
of course I'll go buy raw silk at a low price

771
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:58,010
since word hasn't been spread yet.

772
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,130
As the news spreads, the silk price will rise tremendously.

773
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,190
Then we can make a big profit out of it.

774

I don't know about business.

777

Thanks to your kindness,

778
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,890
I could learn math and accounting.

779
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,290

I've marked it so that

782

it will be easier

It's said that the ledger should be private,

789

but you showed it all to me.

00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,460
Seems like

851
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:24,870
you failed.

852
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,510
It's half successful.

853
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,930
I'm so unlucky today.

854
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,470
Tell me honestly.

855
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,020
When did the silk ship

856
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,450
flip over on Cao River?

857
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,280
And when did the news first reach the capital?

858
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,590
And who knows about it?

859
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,340
It happened yesterday.

860
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,640
The news has only been in the capital for four hours.

861
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,340
Other than the messenger,

862
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:45,310
only His Lordship,

863
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,570
you, me, Dao Qin,

864
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:48,420
and the Xue family at most, know about this.

865
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,150
Impossible.

866
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:51,850
Someone bought raw silk from Xu Wenyi the day before yesterday

867
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:54,580
and predicted that the raw silk price would rise.

868
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,620
I tried many times

869
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,630
but Xu Wenyi didn't say much.

870
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,630
But I heard from the guild that

871
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,430
it was a girl who traded with him.

872
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,030
Guess who she is.

873
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,290
She's the illegitimate daughter

874
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,540
from Mansion of Earl of You that no one knows about.

875
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,870
Her name is You Fangyin.

876
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:09,750
There's a boss

877
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:10,890
behind this girl.

878
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,040
Unfortunately,

879
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,970
I haven't found out who the boss is.

880
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:14,880
Jian Shu.

881
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,560
Ask Dao Qin to investigate

882
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,600
the illegitimate daughter from  You Mansion

883
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,060
and the person behind her.

884
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:21,560
Yes.

885
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,050
You said it was half successful.

886
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:27,260
What do you mean?

887
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,260
Xu Wenyi

888
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,730
only sold 400 taels of silk.

889
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:30,820
He kept the rest to himself.

890
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,040
He is smart.

891
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,110
He thought I must be sent by some important official,

892
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,040
so he wanted to get on good terms with me.

893
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,050
He sold the rest of the raw silk to me

894
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:36,810
at the market price last year.

895
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:37,800
Good.

896
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:39,920
The silk price is turbulent this year.

897
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,580
The silkworm raisers suffered a lot.

898
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,260
We are not here for money.

899
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:44,880
It's okay to make less.

900
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,220
You are generous.

901
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,460
I remember the Yan family's accident

902
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,750
happened at Yan Lin's coming-of-age ceremony.

903
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:01,280
Now I've ruined Zhou Yinzhi's move in advance

904
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,730
and warned the Yan family to take precautions.

905
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,390
I think things can be changed.

906
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:09,740
But the Xue family's grudge against the Yan Family wasn't formed in one day.

907
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,930
I need to make more plans

908
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:12,680
if I want to help the Yan family.

909
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:13,980
Sister Jiang.

910
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,540
Come on in.

911
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:20,390
A chef from Yuhang came to our mansion.

912
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:21,650
He's best at making pastry.

913
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:23,650
I heard that you grew up in Jiangnan,

914
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:25,460
so I'm here to share it with you.

915
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,330
Baoying is an expert at eating.

916
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:27,790
So,

917
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:30,030
I followed her here to have some.

918
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:37,180
Its reputation is well deserved.

919
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,540
Compared with those time-honored brands in the capital,

920
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,000
it's as good if not better.

921
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,900
You don't like it, Sister Jiang?

922
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,360
It's delicious.

923
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:49,810
It's just that

924
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,650
I don't like the sweet taste very much.

925
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:52,310
No offense.

926
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,650
I knew it.

927
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:54,810
Even the Empress Dowager likes

928
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:56,810
the pastry from Baoying's mansion.

929
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:57,220
Well.

930
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:58,950
Since you don't like it,

931
00:42:58,950 --> 00:42:59,830
I'll take it.

932
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,390
I only have a small box of it.

933
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,820
Save some for me.

934
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,500
Jiang Xuening.

935
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:08,780
There's something I want to ask you.
