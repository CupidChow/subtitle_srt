173
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,570
Crown Prince Junior Preceptor, Xie Ju'an.

174
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,480
Zhang Zhe was indeed fair for Yan Family's case.

175
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,420
But he also investigates the rebels closely.

176
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,820
He is very sharp-minded.

177
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,170
It can be both be advantageous or disadvantageous

178
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,630
to take the risk to use him.

179
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:24,680
Besides,

180
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,740
Gu Chunfang has entered the capital.

181
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,690
Keep an eye on these two people.

182
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,370
Yes.

183
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,920
Sir!

184
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,100
Sir.

185
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,760
You forgot your stuff.

186
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,400
Besides layered walnut cake,

187
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,660
I also prepared four kinds of cakes.

188
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,170
Of course, they are not as delicious as the ones you make personally,

189
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:43,560
but

190
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,090
you can still win that lady's heart, right?

191
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:46,760
What lady?

192
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,120
As Jian Shu said,

193
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,540
that gorgeous Jiang's family Secondâ€“

194
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,510
Tao.

195
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,050
Mr. Xie!

196
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,160
Mr. Zhou?

197
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:01,710
Mr. Xie.

198
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:02,670
Well.

199
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,940
Marquis of Yan wants to see you.

200
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,890
[Mansion of Marquis of Yan]

201
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:16,800
[Only Virtue Creates Fragrance]

202
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,340
Mr. Xie.

203
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,860
Long time no see. How are you?

204
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,150
Everything is fine.

205
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,640
Your Lordship,

206
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,980
how has your health been?

207
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,240
After all these years,

208
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,990
I finally got what I wanted.

209
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,760
There isn't a single bad thing.

210
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,220
Please.

211
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,410
Why did you ask me to come

212
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,380
today?

213
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:02,990
Sir,

214
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,870
I would like to invite you

215
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,300
to write a praise for me.

216
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,070
The person to write a praise should be a man.

217
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,300
According to ancient customs,

218
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,300
the elders of our clan should be the one to write for him

219
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,510
to express their expectations.

220
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,240
Junior Preceptor Xie,

221
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,050
Yan family has been on the battlefield for a long time.

222
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,140
We have few people left in the household.

223
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,720
Now,

224
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,700
there can only be you.

225
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,060
I thought

226
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,750
you are my master and I am your disciple

227
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,280
so no one will say anything.

228
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,500
But now it seems

229
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,560
it's inconvenient given Yan family's reputation.

230
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,760
If it makes things difficult for you...

231
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,330
No.

232
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,020
It's not inconvenient.

233
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,750
Viscount is upright.

234
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,650
And the Coming-of-Age Ceremony is the most important thing

235
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:10,580
in a man's life.

236
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,000
Thank you for your appreciation of me

237
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,210
and entrusting this task to me.

238
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,090
Iâ€™m just thinking

239
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:18,810
what I should name

240
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,460
Viscount on the Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

241
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,360
Thank you, Sir.

242
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,500
You haven't gone to the palace to study these days.

243
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,090
You can't lag behind in your studies.

244
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,430
We are almost done teaching Doctrine of the Mean.

245
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,130
The following spring, we will be starting on Book of Documents.

246
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,130
Don't worry, Sir.

247
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,340
I won't slack off.

248
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,040
Is there anything else besides the dishes?

249
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,750
No, Sir.

250
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,100
Th-they are all there.

251
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,660
Anything else?

252
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,660
Since you sent Zhou Yinzhi to help,

253
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,220
the Xingwu Guards have been in a good place.

254
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,940
We are only restricted from going in and out,

255
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,670
but it's not too inconvenient.

256
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,760
Zhou Yinzhi

257
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,310
is not someone below me.

258
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,760
These

259
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,810
were all arranged by her.

260
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:14,710
I didn't expect

261
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,370
it's her who has been protecting me.

262
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:20,230
Sir.

263
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,210
How has Ning been

264
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,480
in the palace?

265
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,630
Do you still

266
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:26,480
love her?

267
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,520
As always.

268
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,590
What if she likes someone else

269
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,940
in the coming days?

270
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,750
The person she likes

271
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:43,100
is definitely at least thousand times or more stronger than me.

272
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,780
It is enough as long as they're someone she likes.

273
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,610
I'd be lying if I say I won't be sad.

274
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,670
But as one grows up,

275
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,430
they'll know what love and hate is.

276
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,070
And that not everything would go your way.

277
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,170

279
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,720
for a while now.

280
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,060
I've been hesitating to give it to her.

281
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,460
Since you're here today,

282
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,320
I'd like to ask you to give this to her.

283
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:12,730
It's all up to her.

284

Even if she doesn't come,

285

it doesn't matter.

Okay.

287
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,400
I will deliver it for you.

Thank you, Sir.

289
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,700
Ning, what are you thinking?

290
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,630
Don't you think

291
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,640
Mr. Xie was looking at me weirdly during yesterday's class?

292
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,900
Did I offend him again?

293
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,190
Mr. Xie...

294
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,610
What's wrong?

295
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,870
Ning, you have no idea.

296
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,820
I was going to eat the layered walnut cake you gave me last time

297

bit by bit.

298

when I was eating it.

300
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,780
So I asked him to try some.

301
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,510
But he took them all away.

302
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,790
I didnâ€™t expect

303

Mr. Xie to be someone like this.

304
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,120
I couldn't bear to eat it.

305
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,420
This is great.

306
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,370
You took mine and he took yours.

307

This is what they mean by

I didnâ€™t say anything bad about you.

311
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,360
I'm going to class.

312
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:25,190
So you're mad about the layered walnut cake.

313
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,050
I didn't mean it.

314
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,470
It doesn't matter.

315
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,510
I shouldn't have bothered you about this.

316

You don't have classes today, right?

317

Yours

322
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,220
was written by Yan Lin personally.

323
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,810
It was signed off as Viscount Yan Lin,

324

the son of Marquis of Yan for everyone else's invitation.

nor his title.

He wants you to go,

331
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,140
but also hopes that you can stay away from the trouble.

332

But it's up to you

whether you want to go or not.

334
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,090
I will go.

Even if he doesn't invite me,

336
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,930
I will definitely go.

00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,850
I'm afraid there might be trouble.

343
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,660
There's still some time before the Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

344
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,420
I think

345
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,850
we should take precautions

346
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,510
and make early arrangements.

347
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,000
You're quite thoughtful.

348
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:24,890
Go to class first.

349
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:26,200
Yes.

350
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,450
How good to be you.

351
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:40,380
You can leave the palace to attend Yan Lin's Coming-of-Age Ceremony just by applying for leave.

352
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:40,980
Unlike me.

353
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,860
I received an invitation,

354
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,100
but it's not up to me.

355
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,410
Empress Dowager doesn't allow you to go?

356
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,210
That's right.

357
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,820
Jie has agreed to let Second Brother go.

358
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,140
Yet Mother insists that I'm a princess

359
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,400
so I can't go with them.

360
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,770
Yan Lin's Coming-of-Age Ceremony is related to the court.

361
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:55,970
It won't be that easy.

362
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,420
His Highness, Lord Linzi and Yan Lin are classmates.

363
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,100
He can attend on behalf of the royal family.

364
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,100
But you are

365
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,180
a model of all ladies in the capital.

366
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,450
Of course Her Majesty doesn't want you

367
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,780
to get involved in this.

368
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:07,069
I know.

369
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,819
The capital is full of people who flatter the high flyers and step on the low lives.

370
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:11,569
Now that Yan Family is not in a good state,

371
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:12,599
no one wants to go.

372
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,230
But Ning,

373
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,480
that's why I have to go.

374
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:20,550
This is a once in a lifetime occasion for Yan Lin.

375
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,079
If even I don't support him,

376
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,589
what would others think?

377
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,380
You're smart and full of ideas.

378
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,579
Help me think of a way.

379
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,100
You said

380
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,830
Lord Linzi is going too?

381
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,030
Yes.

382
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,750
I have an idea then.

383
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,030
I'm sure it'll work.

384
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,500
Shu?

385
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,300
You're going to Yan Lin's Coming-of-Age Ceremony?

386
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,360
Aunt, don't worry.

387
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,550
There's a reason

388
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,420
for this.

389
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,580
His Majesty has been taking so long to convict the Yan family.

390
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,260
Firstly, it's because

391
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,860
they lack crucial evidence.

392
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:02,940
Secondly, it's because

393
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,740
Marquis of Yan has been fighting battles for years

394
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,740
and has high prestige in the court.

395
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,660
We have to consider the opinions of the officials.

396
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,290
Since Mansion of Marquis of Yongyi has been confined,

397
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:15,140
there have been people in the court pleading for leniency.

398
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,000
He didn't stop even after being punished severely.

399
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:19,820
I wonder what Yan Mu

400
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,510
did to make them do this.

401
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,040
So,

402
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,740
at this critical moment,

403
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,530
the more polite we should be.

404
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,600
Besides,

405
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,310
I heard that

406
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,590
Lord Linzi is also going.

407
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,170
Jie is close to Yan Lin.

408
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,660
Since you have such good judgement,

409
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,750
he'll definitely like you more.

410
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,170
But...

411
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,890
With what reason are you going there for?

412
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,890
Aunt, why don't you let the princess go on your behalf?

413
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,580
On one hand, it can show the royal grace

414
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,520
and shut the public's mouths.

415
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:53,620
Secondly,

416
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,510
as Shu's study partner,

417
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,740
I can naturally go there.

418
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,920
All right then.

419
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:02,780
This time,

420
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,980
I will let Yan family take the advantage.

421
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,020
Have a look.

422
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,690
Have a look.

423
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,900
Take a look.

424
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,700
Have a look.

425
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,890
Have you prepared the headdress and hairpin

426
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,060
for the Coming-of-Age Ceremony?

427
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,260
Don't worry, Sir. Everything is ready.

428
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,410
How is Yan family's

429
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,560
situation now?

430
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,570
The Yan family is in turmoil now.

431
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,700
Not many dare to attend the Viscount's Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

432
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,900
As for the Xue family,

433
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,730
they deliberately asked Xingwu Guards to make trouble.

434
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:36,730
They didn't allow the alcohol and vegetables that were prepared

435
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,160
to be delivered into the mansion.

436
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,030
His Lordship flew into a rage.

437
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,260
Let them be arrogant for a few more days.

438
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,820
The Xue family

439
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,590
will pay the price sooner or later.

440
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:01,410
[Sword Foundry]

441
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:09,750
Ning,

442
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,890
didn't you say you want to pick up a gift for Yan Lin first?

443
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,290
We are in the wilderness,

444
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,720
what can there be here?

445
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,600
Your Highness, come with me and you'll know.

446
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,150
You two stay here.

447
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:24,930
Master Gao.

448
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,800
You're here, Miss Jiang.

449
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,810
Take Miss Jiang's sword out.

450
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:29,550
Coming.

451
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,500
You ordered this sword two months earlier.

452
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,660
It was finally completed yesterday.

453
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,720
Please have a look.

454
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,470
As expected of what

455
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,580
took two months to be forged.

456
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,980
It's indeed a good sword.

457
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,310
Two months ago?

458
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,340
Isn't that before you entered the palace?

459
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,870
You prepared it so early.

460
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,530
Looks like your gift will

461
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,190
definitely be the best today.

462
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,530
Miss, are you giving this sword to someone?

463
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,070
Yes.

464
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,950
I was worried that it wouldn't make it in time.

465
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,340
Is there anything wrong?

466
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,610
Normally, a sword to be given as a gift

467
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:06,810
are decorated with gems

468
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:07,780
and forged with gold or silver.

469
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,440
Yet you asked for a meteoric iron sword

470
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,170
that is full of murderous aura.

471
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,110
It has a bad meaning.

472
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:14,690
What should we do?

473
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,010
Is it too late to change the sheath now?

474
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,260
I'm afraid...

475
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:01,770
Ning.

476
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:03,940
Do you like the capital?

477
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:04,810
Yes.

478
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,800
The capital is so bustling.

479
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:07,410
Look.

480
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,110
The palace is so grand.

481
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,540
Ning'an Palace is also in there.

482
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,970
You like Ning'an Palace?

483
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,830
I heard that the empress lives there.

484
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,820
I must visit it in the future.

485
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,650
What's so good about that?

486
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:21,810
It's just a big cage.

487
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,590
What about you, Yan Lin?

488
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:26,960
What do you want to do in the future?

489
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,500
Me?

490
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,550
Of course, I'll roam the battlefield like my father.

491
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,640
And trade half of my life for the world's peace.

492
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,730
You have a good ambition.

493
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,360
But your sword

494
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,390
is not good enough.

495
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,780
It's pretty,

496
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,250
but not powerful enough.

497
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,890
It won't scare the enemy.

498
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,280
How about this?

499
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:51,480
I'll give you a new one

500
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,340
on your Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

501
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:53,930
Sure.

502
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,630
Then I want

503
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,280
a sharp sheathless sword to fight with me.

504
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,340
It's a deal, General Yan.

505
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:03,900
Deal.

506
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:05,780
Deal.

507
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,930
Only wandering warriors need a sheath for their sword.

508
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,060
But generals don't.

509
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,230
If they have to go on a trip to somewhere far,

510
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,290
it won't be in the sheath for too long.

511
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,010
The person I'm giving this to

512
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,040
is someone who wants a sword that can kill enemies on the battleground.

513
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,970
This is perfect.

514
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,580
It's getting late.

515
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,440
We should go to Yan's residence..

516
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:42,830
[Mansion of Marquis of Yan]

517
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,500
Please.

518
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:43,750
Viscount Yan,

519
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,150
we are here to support you.

520
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,410
Are the dishes ready?

521
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,240
Your Highness.

522
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,490
You are the master today and I am the guest.

523
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,090
No need for the formalities.

524
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,170
Everyone is just worried about the court affairs.

525
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,280
It's not that they don't want to come.

526
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,740
Don't think about it too much.

527
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,800
They don't matter.

528
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,910
Itâ€™s enough to have you here.

529
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,170
Iâ€™m afraid it's not just us

530
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,580
you're thinking of.

531
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,460
The princess's study partner?

532
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,580
Sister?

533
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,700
Miss Jiang, go in first. I'll be right there.

534
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,240
Sister, why are you here?

535
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,650
Aunt asked me to come.

536
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,860
This is the Yan family after all.

537
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,340
It's something that I should be attending.

538
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,080
I don't know what His Majesty is thinking.

539
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,780
Even rebels can organise a Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

540
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,140
Father has ordered Xingwu Guards to guard the mansion.

541
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,480
If they dare to act rashly,

542
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,610
I won't let them off.

543
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,700
All right.

544
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,420
Though not many people came today,

545
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,210
they all come from prestigious families.

546
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,540
You have to put on an act.

547
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:17,900
Greetings, Junior Preceptor Xie.

548
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,430
Please.

549
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:23,910
Junior Preceptor Xie.

550
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:27,220
Father is waiting in the backyard.

551
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,150
Please go ahead.

552
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,770
Junior Preceptor Xie.

553
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:30,770
This way, please.

554
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:43,230
[Ancestral Virtue]

555
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,360
Today is the Coming-of-Age Ceremony of Yan Lin.

556
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,670
Our child has finally grown up.

557
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,290
You should rest assured now.

558
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,610
Please, Junior Preceptor Xie.

559
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,940
His Lordship is inside.

560
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,340
[Late sister Yan Minsheng]

561
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,610
Your Lordship.

562
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,970
Since you are writing the praise today,

563
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,660
as the outstanding ancestors of the Yan Family are all here,

564
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,660
could I ask you to burn an incense for them

565
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,430
and fulfill their wishes?

566
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,980
The Yan family ancestors.

567
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:21,800
I

568
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,780
am here.

569
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:50,280
Sister.

570
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,410
Your wish has been fulfilled.

571
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,730
The lost has returned home.

572
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,940
The flowers in the yard

573
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,720
should be blooming again soon, right?

574
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,520
Your Lordship,

575
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,700
may I ask

576
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,240
if Madam Yan

577
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,460
died peacefully?

578
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,190
The 10-month-old fetus

579
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,670
that was forced to its death by an enemy.

580
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,450
Yet her husband did not care about it.

581
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,860
How could she have died peacefully?

582
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:34,080
Over 300 lives

583
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,180
were burned to ashes.

584
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,270
She searched all day and night in the ashes,

585
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,330
and cried her eyes out.

586
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,110
But the Xue family

587
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,990
stepped on the blood of this parent and child

588
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,190
to enter the palace to receive rewards.

589
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,900
How deep her hatred was...

590
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,250
She divorced Xue Yuan

591
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,900
and dragged her body back to Yan Mansion.

592
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,240
She passed away in less than a few months.

593
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,720
But she never gave up looking

594
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,390
till the moment she died.

595
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,630
No matter what difficulties she had,

596
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,820
she just wanted that child to be alive.

597
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:25,780
To be well and alive.

598
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:19,670
[Ancestral Virtue]

599
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,240
Viscount.

600
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,720
We should go in now.

601
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:55,480
Yan Lin.

602
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,380
I'm here. Shouldn't you be greeting me?

603
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,420
I thought you weren't coming.

604
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,080
Why would I?

605
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:12,310
No matter what,

606
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:15,210
I have to come to your Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

607
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:16,780
What is this?

608
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:18,460
A birthday gift.

609
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,500
I should have given it to you earlier.

610
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,160
Is it heavy?

611
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:21,830
Let me do it.

612
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,990
How can the birthday boy snatch gifts as soon as we entered?

613
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:24,980
Why are you in such a hurry?

614
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,130
Why don't you bring us in?

615
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,860
Iâ€™m waiting to drink your wine.

616
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,180
-Mr. Zhang. Mrs. Zhang.
-Congratulations.

617
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:36,810
Thank you.

618
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,080
Here.

619
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,050
Sir, a toast to you.

620
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,050
Leave me alone.

621
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,380
Everyone,

622
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,570
today is Yan Lin's birthday.

623
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:18,700
Let's congratulate the birthday boy.

624
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,260
Sure!

625
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,670
I don't know many words.

626
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:23,470
I'll go first.

627
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:26,770
Yan.

628
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,150
I wish you happiness

629
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,400
and longevity.

630
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,880
I'm not 80 years old.

631
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,180
I can't afford your congratulation.

632
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,510
Stop pretending.

633
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:45,810
You

634
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,290
donâ€™t study hard.

635
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,580
Mr. Xie would be furious if he heard it.

636
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,110
Sit down.

637
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,550
I'll go next.

638
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,580
The lines I have are great.

639
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:58,400
Like the constant moon, like the rising sun.

640
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,930
Like...

641
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,300
Like...

642
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,230
You've been studying for so long.

643
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,130
I think you're just about the same.

644
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:10,730
Forget it.

645
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,200
Why don't we let

646
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,500
Jiang family's Second Young Lady do it?

647
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,320
I wish you...

648
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:32,720
Forget it.

649
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,560
If you can't think of anything,

650
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,890
let me wish you instead.

651
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,500
May the moon be with you forever.

652
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,950
And the breeze always with you.

653
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,380
When worries come along,

654
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,840
all of them will be solved.

655
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,260
When hardships come along,

656
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,860
all of them will be avoided.

657
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,290
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

658
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,210
Viscount is really eloquent.

659
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:55,420
-That's right.
-Exactly.

660
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:55,860
Yeah.

661
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,540
Ning, you can't come up with a good congratulatory speech

662
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,850
but you prepared a good gift.

663
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,510
Come on, show them.

664
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,739
Nice sword!

665
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:28,980
Great!

666
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,230
Nice sword!

667
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,139
So thoughtful.

668
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:33,060
Miss Jiang,

669
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,699
this sword doesn't have a sheath?

670
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:35,699
Someone once said

671
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,139
the general's sword

672
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,199
is without sheath.

673
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:40,010
I didnâ€™t expect you to remember.

674
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,320
You only said the first half in the past.

675
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,889
Today, I give you the second half of it.

676
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:47,400
The sharpness of a sword comes from experience.

677
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,400
The day for you to emerge from your sheath will arrive.

678
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,489
May you

679
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,500
succeed on the battlefield

680
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,030
in exchange for the world's peace.

681
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,950
-Great!
-Great!

682
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,240
Well said, Miss Jiang.

683
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,460
I wish Yan Lin

684
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:06,220
all the best in

685
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,170
riding the wind through the haze on the battlefield.

686
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:08,630
Come on.

687
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,510
Let's do it together.

688
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:09,970
Come on.

689
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:12,080
Come on.

690
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,170
Okay.

691
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,110
Thank you for coming today.

692
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:21,570
I...

693
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,050
Shall drink first.

694
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,390
What is he doing?

695
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:41,860
Xue Ye!

696
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,480
What are you doing?

697
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,520
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

698
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,400
My brother is drunk.

699
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,200
Iâ€™m not drunk!

700
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,040
Viscount Yan,

701
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:54,610
you've been pretending for so long.

702
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,210
You must have had enough fun.

703
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,770
Xue Ye, what's wrong with you?

704
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,900
Your Highness, Lord Linzi.

705
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,770
It's okay if you forget.

706
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,660
Let me say it.

707
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,630
His Majesty has ordered

708
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:10,020
that there cannot be weapons in Mansion of Marquis of Yan without permission.

709
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:10,600
Guards!

710
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,450
Confiscate his sword.

711
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,100
Yes!

712
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:17,850
Stop!

713
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,790
Are you serious?

714
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,470
Xue Ye, what do you want?

715
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,530
Your Highness.

716
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,060
The Xue family is just leading Xingwu Guards

717
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,460
to do official business.

718
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,020
Xue Ye.

719
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,300
Take anything you want

720
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,370
today.

721
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,040
But not

722
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,020
this sword.

723
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:36,830
Fine.

724
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,970
Then you're disobeying the order.

725
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:41,100
Only rebels dare to disobey the order.

726
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:41,830
Yan Lin.

727
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,160
Do you dare?

728
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:48,300
Stop talking nonsense.

729
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,040
Get out!

730
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,350
Xue Ye, don't go too far.

731
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:55,620
Mr. Xue,

732
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,580
you can't say he disobeyed the order yourself.

733
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,610
Besides, todayâ€“

734
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,160
Ning.

735
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,080
Brother!

736
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,340
How could he hit her?

737
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:16,820
How dare you hit her?

738
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,410
I tolerated you several times.

739
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:19,540
Don't go overboard.

740
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,010
No one can hurt her in front of me.

741
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:24,590
Brother.

742
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:25,940
Are you all dead?

743
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:27,560
Kill him!

744
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,690
Yan Lin!

745
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:46,980
Tell them to stop!

746
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,260
Stop!

747
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,570
Stop!

748
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:12,700
My Lord!

749
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:14,690
Lord!

750
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,580
Mr. Xie is here too.

751
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:17,890
What's wrong?

752
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,990
Viscount is fighting with the Xingwu guards.

753
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:21,750
What?

754
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,680
The Xue family wants to make trouble today.

755
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,280
If Yan Lin makes any mistake,

756
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,240
he will be convicted of rebellion.

757
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:31,960
No.

758
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,080
We can't let this get out of hand.

759
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:47,160
Yan Lin, stop fighting.

760
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,200
Yan Lin!

761
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,410
I'm fine.

762
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,070
Don't make a big conflict.

763
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,330
Especially not today.

764
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,280
Xue Ye.

765
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:58,660
Today is Yan Lin's birthday.

766
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,890
Do you have to do this?

767
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,110
Your Highness.

768
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:03,610
Yan Lin disobeyed the order and hit someone.

769
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:04,790
If we don't teach him a lesson,

770
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,870
the Xue family will lose our face.

771
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,990
What disobedience?

772
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,540
Xue Ye,

773
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,300
don't blindly accuse just because of Jie's order.

774
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,470
Ning went to pick up the sword

775
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,600
to be gifted with me.

776
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,560
Did I

777
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,450
disobeyed the order too then?

778
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,920
Brother, that's enough.

779
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:21,550
Your Highness, have you seen it clearly?

780
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,720
Yan Lin committed violence in public.

781
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,510
The Yan family has not been cleared their name as rebels,

782
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,830
yet he dares to do this.

783
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,580
Are you also protecting him?

784
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,630
Nonsense!

785
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,160
You were the one who started it first.

786
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:31,660
Xue Ye,

787
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,000
don't you just want this sword?

788
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:36,780
You don't have to use the imperial edict to suppress me.

789
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,430
Now.

790
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,750
Fight with me.

791
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,400
If you win,

792
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,700
I'll give it to you.

793
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:43,550
Do you dare?

794
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:44,610
Yan Lin.

795
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,580
Viscount Yan.

796
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,820
My brother's martial art skills are nothing compared to yours.

797
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,050
This sword is a gift from Miss Jiang.

798
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,500
Please have mercy.

799
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,890
Listen, Yan Lin.

800
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,470
What are you so proud for?

801
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,810
The Yan family is full of martial artists.

802
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:03,140
Who do you think you are?

803
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:03,750
Xue Ye.

804
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,260
What do you mean?

805
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,040
You're the one who wants the sword.

806
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,480
You're the one who doesn't dare to fight.

807
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,810
You're the one who won't admit defeat too.

808
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:11,850
Looks like the Xue family

809
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:13,580
only knows how to raise losers.

810
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:14,180
Zhiyi.

811
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,720
Watch what you say.

812
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:17,330
I didn't say anything wrong.

813
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,990
Your Highness, you're wrong.

814
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,700
Although there are people like Xue Ye in the Xue family,

815
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,250
they are not all like that.

816
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,600
If Viscount Dingfei were still alive,

817
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,060
he wouldn't be so useless.

818
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,700
Dare you say that again?

819
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,550
I can say it as many times as you want.

820
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,680
Everyone knows that

821
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:36,420
Xue family's Viscount

822
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,900
is the legitimate son of Mrs. Yan.

823
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:39,900
My cousin,

824
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,220
Xue Dingfei!

825
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,320
Shut up!

826
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,590
My brother was reckless

827
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,780
and offended Viscount Yan.

828
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,390
I apologize for him.

829
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,060
I heard that Brother Dingfei is gifted and intelligent.

830
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,690
But it has been 20 years.

831
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,770
The past is gone.

832
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,530
Why bring it up again

833
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,180
and be so aggressive today?

834
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,100
If such a person

835
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,610
were still alive out of luck,

836
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:07,400
how scary it'd be.

837
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,960
How many people will be so worried about it

838
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,120
they can't sleep at night?

839
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:12,950
Yan Lin,

840
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:15,370
my sister is giving you some respect.

841
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:16,570
Don't be ungrateful.

842
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,970
Arrest him!

843
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,140
Enough!

844
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,920
It's a Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

845
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,850
Look at the state it is in right now!

846
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,070
Is this how I taught you?

847
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,600
All right.

848
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,550
They're just kids.

849
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,080
It's normal

850
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,570
to have conflicts.

851
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:42,670
Qing Feng.

852
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,880
It's almost time for the Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

853
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,210
Take Yan Lin to prepare.

854
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:47,510
Yes.

855
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,620
The auspicious time is just around the corner.

856
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:00,550
Please have a seat, everyone.

857
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:01,870
My Lord.

858
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,710
Let's get ready too.

859
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:14,340
Let's go!

860
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:29,540
Greetings, Your Highness.

861
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,820
Today is a great day for the crown prince.

862
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,600
How come...

863
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:36,990
Why?

864
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,800
What took you so long?

865
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:41,450
Did you miss a great show?

866
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,500
Zhiyi, don't take it seriously.

867
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:44,880
Nothing.

868
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,180
Everything has been solved.

869
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,470
Don't worry.

870
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,020
That's good.

871
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,180
The Ministry of Justice has been busy recently.

872
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,710
Lord Zhang and I are late.

873
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,740
Luckily we didn't miss the auspicious time.
