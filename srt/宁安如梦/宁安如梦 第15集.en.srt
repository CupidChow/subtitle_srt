173
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,570
Crown Prince Junior Preceptor, Xie Ju'an.

174
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,480
Zhang Zhe was indeed fair for Yan Family's case.

175
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,420
But he also investigates the rebels closely.

176
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,820
He is very sharp-minded.

177
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,170
It can be both be advantageous or disadvantageous

178
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,630
to take the risk to use him.

179
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:24,680
Besides,

180
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,740
Gu Chunfang has entered the capital.

181
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,690
Keep an eye on these two people.

182
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,370
Yes.

183
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,920
Sir!

184
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,100
Sir.

185
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,760
You forgot your stuff.

186
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,400
Besides layered walnut cake,

187
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,660
I also prepared four kinds of cakes.

188
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,170
Of course, they are not as delicious as the ones you make personally,

189
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:43,560
but

190
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,090
you can still win that lady's heart, right?

191
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:46,760
What lady?

192
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,120
As Jian Shu said,

193
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,540
that gorgeous Jiang's family Second–

194
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,510
Tao.

195
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,050
Mr. Xie!

196
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,160
Mr. Zhou?

197
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:01,710
Mr. Xie.

198
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:02,670
Well.

199
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,940
Marquis of Yan wants to see you.

200
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,890
[Mansion of Marquis of Yan]

201
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:16,800
[Only Virtue Creates Fragrance]

202
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,340
Mr. Xie.

203
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,860
Long time no see. How are you?

204
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,150
Everything is fine.

205
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,640
Your Lordship,

206
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,980
how has your health been?

207
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,240
After all these years,

208
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,990
I finally got what I wanted.

209
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,760
There isn't a single bad thing.

210
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,220
Please.

211
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,410
Why did you ask me to come

212
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,380
today?

213
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:02,990
Sir,

214
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,870
I would like to invite you

215
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,300
to write a praise for me.

216
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,070
The person to write a praise should be a man.

217
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,300
According to ancient customs,

218
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,300
the elders of our clan should be the one to write for him

219
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,510
to express their expectations.

220
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,240
Junior Preceptor Xie,

221
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,050
Yan family has been on the battlefield for a long time.

222
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,140
We have few people left in the household.

223
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,720
Now,

224
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,700
there can only be you.

225
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,060
I thought

226
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,750
you are my master and I am your disciple

227
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,280
so no one will say anything.

228
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,500
But now it seems

229
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,560
it's inconvenient given Yan family's reputation.

230
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,760
If it makes things difficult for you...

231
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,330
No.

232
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,020
It's not inconvenient.

233
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,750
Viscount is upright.

234
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,650
And the Coming-of-Age Ceremony is the most important thing

235
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:10,580
in a man's life.

236
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,000
Thank you for your appreciation of me

237
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,210
and entrusting this task to me.

238
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,090
I’m just thinking

239
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:18,810
what I should name

240
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,460
Viscount on the Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

241
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,360
Thank you, Sir.

242
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,500
You haven't gone to the palace to study these days.

243
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,090
You can't lag behind in your studies.

244
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,430
We are almost done teaching Doctrine of the Mean.

245
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,130
The following spring, we will be starting on Book of Documents.

246
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,130
Don't worry, Sir.

247
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,340
I won't slack off.

248
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,040
Is there anything else besides the dishes?

249
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,750
No, Sir.

250
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,100
Th-they are all there.

251
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,660
Anything else?

252
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,660
Since you sent Zhou Yinzhi to help,

253
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,220
the Xingwu Guards have been in a good place.

254
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,940
We are only restricted from going in and out,

255
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,670
but it's not too inconvenient.

256
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,760
Zhou Yinzhi

257
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,310
is not someone below me.

258
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,760
These

259
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,810
were all arranged by her.

260
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:14,710
I didn't expect

261
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,370
it's her who has been protecting me.

262
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:20,230
Sir.

263
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,210
How has Ning been

264
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,480
in the palace?

265
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,630
Do you still

266
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:26,480
love her?

267
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,520
As always.

268
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,590
What if she likes someone else

269
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,940
in the coming days?

270
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,750
The person she likes

271
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:43,100
is definitely at least thousand times or more stronger than me.

272
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,780
It is enough as long as they're someone she likes.

273
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,610
I'd be lying if I say I won't be sad.

274
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,670
But as one grows up,

275
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,430
they'll know what love and hate is.

276
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,070
And that not everything would go your way.

277
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,170
I've written this invitation

[Coming-of-Age Ceremony Invitation]

279
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,720
for a while now.

280
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,060
I've been hesitating to give it to her.

281
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,460
Since you're here today,

282
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,320
I'd like to ask you to give this to her.

283
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:12,730
It's all up to her.

284

Even if she doesn't come,

285
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:16,950
it doesn't matter.

286
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:18,750
Okay.

287
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,400
I will deliver it for you.

288
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,860
Thank you, Sir.

289
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,700
Ning, what are you thinking?

290
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,630
Don't you think

291
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,640
Mr. Xie was looking at me weirdly during yesterday's class?

292
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,900
Did I offend him again?

293
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,190
Mr. Xie...

294
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,610
What's wrong?

295
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,870
Ning, you have no idea.

296
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,820
I was going to eat the layered walnut cake you gave me last time

297
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,360
bit by bit.

298
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,870
But the next day, I bumped into Mr. Xie

when I was eating it.

300
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,780
So I asked him to try some.

301
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,510
But he took them all away.

302
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,790
I didn’t expect

303
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,260
Mr. Xie to be someone like this.

304
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,120
I couldn't bear to eat it.

305
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,420
This is great.

306
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,370
You took mine and he took yours.

307
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,980
This is what they mean by

308

Mr. Xie.

310
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,300
I didn’t say anything bad about you.

311
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,360
I'm going to class.

312
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:25,190
So you're mad about the layered walnut cake.

313
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,050
I didn't mean it.

314
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,470
It doesn't matter.

315
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,510
I shouldn't have bothered you about this.

316
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,200
You don't have classes today, right?

317
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,130

320

Yours

322
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,220
was written by Yan Lin personally.

323
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,810
It was signed off as Viscount Yan Lin,

324

the son of Marquis of Yan for everyone else's invitation.

nor his title.

Only Yan Lin.

330

He wants you to go,

331
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,140
but also hopes that you can stay away from the trouble.

332
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,160
But it's up to you

333

whether you want to go or not.

334
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,090
I will go.

335

Even if he doesn't invite me,

336
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,930
I will definitely go.

337

It's just..

during the Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

Though with Zhou Yinzhi, getting around will be easy,

00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,850
I'm afraid there might be trouble.

343
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,660
There's still some time before the Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

344
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,420
I think

345
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,850
we should take precautions

346
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,510
and make early arrangements.

347
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,000
You're quite thoughtful.

348
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:24,890
Go to class first.

349
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:26,200
Yes.

350
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,450
How good to be you.

351
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:40,380
You can leave the palace to attend Yan Lin's Coming-of-Age Ceremony just by applying for leave.

352
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:40,980
Unlike me.

353
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,860
I received an invitation,

354
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,100
but it's not up to me.

355
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,410
Empress Dowager doesn't allow you to go?

356
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,210
That's right.

357
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,820
Jie has agreed to let Second Brother go.

358
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,140
Yet Mother insists that I'm a princess

359
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,400
so I can't go with them.

360
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,770
Yan Lin's Coming-of-Age Ceremony is related to the court.

361
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:55,970
It won't be that easy.

362
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,420
His Highness, Lord Linzi and Yan Lin are classmates.

363
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,100
He can attend on behalf of the royal family.

364
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,100
But you are

365
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,180
a model of all ladies in the capital.

366
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,450
Of course Her Majesty doesn't want you

367
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,780
to get involved in this.

368
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:07,069
I know.

369
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,819
The capital is full of people who flatter the high flyers and step on the low lives.

370
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:11,569
Now that Yan Family is not in a good state,

371
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:12,599
no one wants to go.

372
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,230
But Ning,

373
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,480
that's why I have to go.

374
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:20,550
This is a once in a lifetime occasion for Yan Lin.

375
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,079
If even I don't support him,

376
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,589
what would others think?

377
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,380
You're smart and full of ideas.

378
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,579
Help me think of a way.

379
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,100
You said

380
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,830
Lord Linzi is going too?

381
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,030
Yes.

382
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,750
I have an idea then.

383
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,030
I'm sure it'll work.

384
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,500
Shu?

385
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,300
You're going to Yan Lin's Coming-of-Age Ceremony?

386
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,360
Aunt, don't worry.

387
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,550
There's a reason

388
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,420
for this.

389
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,580
His Majesty has been taking so long to convict the Yan family.

390
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,260
Firstly, it's because

391
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,860
they lack crucial evidence.

392
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:02,940
Secondly, it's because

393
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,740
Marquis of Yan has been fighting battles for years

394
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,740
and has high prestige in the court.

395
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,660
We have to consider the opinions of the officials.

396
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,290
Since Mansion of Marquis of Yongyi has been confined,

397
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:15,140
there have been people in the court pleading for leniency.

398
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,000
He didn't stop even after being punished severely.

399
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:19,820
I wonder what Yan Mu

400
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,510
did to make them do this.

401
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,040
So,

402
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,740
at this critical moment,

403
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,530
the more polite we should be.

404
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,600
Besides,

405
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,310
I heard that

406
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,590
Lord Linzi is also going.

407
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,170
Jie is close to Yan Lin.

408
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,660
Since you have such good judgement,

409
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,750
he'll definitely like you more.

410
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,170
But...

411
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,890
With what reason are you going there for?

412
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,890
Aunt, why don't you let the princess go on your behalf?

413
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,580
On one hand, it can show the royal grace

414
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,520
and shut the public's mouths.

415
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:53,620
Secondly,

416
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,510
as Shu's study partner,

417
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,740
I can naturally go there.

418
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,920
All right then.

419
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:02,780
This time,

420
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,980
I will let Yan family take the advantage.

421
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,020
Have a look.

422
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,690
Have a look.

423
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,900
Take a look.

424
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,700
Have a look.

425
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,890
Have you prepared the headdress and hairpin

426
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,060
for the Coming-of-Age Ceremony?

427
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,260
Don't worry, Sir. Everything is ready.

428
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,410
How is Yan family's

429
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,560
situation now?

430
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,570
The Yan family is in turmoil now.

431
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,700
Not many dare to attend the Viscount's Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

432
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,900
As for the Xue family,

433
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,730
they deliberately asked Xingwu Guards to make trouble.

434
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:36,730
They didn't allow the alcohol and vegetables that were prepared

435
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,160
to be delivered into the mansion.

436
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,030
His Lordship flew into a rage.

437
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,260
Let them be arrogant for a few more days.

438
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,820
The Xue family

439
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,590
will pay the price sooner or later.

440
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:01,410
[Sword Foundry]

441
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:09,750
Ning,

442
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,890
didn't you say you want to pick up a gift for Yan Lin first?

443
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,290
We are in the wilderness,

444
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,720
what can there be here?

445
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,600
Your Highness, come with me and you'll know.

446
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,150
You two stay here.

447
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:24,930
Master Gao.

448
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,800
You're here, Miss Jiang.

449
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,810
Take Miss Jiang's sword out.

450
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:29,550
Coming.

451
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,500
You ordered this sword two months earlier.

452
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,660
It was finally completed yesterday.

453
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,720
Please have a look.

454
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,470
As expected of what

455
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,580
took two months to be forged.

456
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,980
It's indeed a good sword.

457
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,310
Two months ago?

458
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,340
Isn't that before you entered the palace?

459
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,870
You prepared it so early.

460
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,530
Looks like your gift will

461
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,190
definitely be the best today.

462
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,530
Miss, are you giving this sword to someone?

463
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,070
Yes.

464
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,950
I was worried that it wouldn't make it in time.

465
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,340
Is there anything wrong?

466
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,610
Normally, a sword to be given as a gift

467
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:06,810
are decorated with gems

468
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:07,780
and forged with gold or silver.

469
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,440
Yet you asked for a meteoric iron sword

470
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,170
that is full of murderous aura.

471
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,110
It has a bad meaning.

472
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:14,690
What should we do?

473
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,010
Is it too late to change the sheath now?

474
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,260
I'm afraid...

475
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:01,770
Ning.

476
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:03,940
Do you like the capital?

477
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:04,810
Yes.

478
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,800
The capital is so bustling.

479
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:07,410
Look.

480
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,110
The palace is so grand.

481
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,540
Ning'an Palace is also in there.

482
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,970
You like Ning'an Palace?

483
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,830
I heard that the empress lives there.

484
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,820
I must visit it in the future.

485
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,650
What's so good about that?

486
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:21,810
It's just a big cage.

487
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,590
What about you, Yan Lin?

488
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:26,960
What do you want to do in the future?

489
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,500
Me?

490
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,550
Of course, I'll roam the battlefield like my father.

491
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,640
And trade half of my life for the world's peace.

492
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,730
You have a good ambition.

493
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,360
But your sword

494
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,390
is not good enough.

495
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,780
It's pretty,

496
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,250
but not powerful enough.

497
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,890
It won't scare the enemy.

498
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,280
How about this?

499
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:51,480
I'll give you a new one

500
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,340
on your Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

501
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:53,930
Sure.

502
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,630
Then I want

503
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,280
a sharp sheathless sword to fight with me.

504
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,340
It's a deal, General Yan.

505
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:03,900
Deal.

506
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:05,780
Deal.

507
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,930
Only wandering warriors need a sheath for their sword.

508
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,060
But generals don't.

509
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,230
If they have to go on a trip to somewhere far,

510
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,290
it won't be in the sheath for too long.

511
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,010
The person I'm giving this to

512
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,040
is someone who wants a sword that can kill enemies on the battleground.

513
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,970
This is perfect.

514
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,580
It's getting late.

515
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,440
We should go to Yan's residence..

516
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:42,830
[Mansion of Marquis of Yan]

517
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,500
Please.

518
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:43,750
Viscount Yan,

519
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,150
we are here to support you.

520
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,410
Are the dishes ready?

521
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,240
Your Highness.

522
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,490
You are the master today and I am the guest.

523
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,090
No need for the formalities.

524
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,170
Everyone is just worried about the court affairs.

525
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,280
It's not that they don't want to come.

526
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,740
Don't think about it too much.

527
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,800
They don't matter.

528
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,910
It’s enough to have you here.

529
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,170
I’m afraid it's not just us

530
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,580
you're thinking of.

531
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,460
The princess's study partner?

532
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,580
Sister?

533
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,700
Miss Jiang, go in first. I'll be right there.

534
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,240
Sister, why are you here?

535
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,650
Aunt asked me to come.

536
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,860
This is the Yan family after all.

537
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,340
It's something that I should be attending.

538
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,080
I don't know what His Majesty is thinking.

539
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,780
Even rebels can organise a Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

540
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,140
Father has ordered Xingwu Guards to guard the mansion.

541
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,480
If they dare to act rashly,

542
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,610
I won't let them off.

543
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,700
All right.

544
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,420
Though not many people came today,

545
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,210
they all come from prestigious families.

546
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,540
You have to put on an act.

547
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:17,900
Greetings, Junior Preceptor Xie.

548
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,430
Please.

549
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:23,910
Junior Preceptor Xie.

550
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:27,220
Father is waiting in the backyard.

551
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,150
Please go ahead.

552
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,770
Junior Preceptor Xie.

553
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:30,770
This way, please.

554
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:43,230
[Ancestral Virtue]

555
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,360
Today is the Coming-of-Age Ceremony of Yan Lin.

556
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,670
Our child has finally grown up.

557
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,290
You should rest assured now.

558
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,610
Please, Junior Preceptor Xie.

559
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,940
His Lordship is inside.

560
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,340
[Late sister Yan Minsheng]

561
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,610
Your Lordship.

562
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,970
Since you are writing the praise today,

563
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,660
as the outstanding ancestors of the Yan Family are all here,

564
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,660
could I ask you to burn an incense for them

565
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,430
and fulfill their wishes?

566
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,980
The Yan family ancestors.

567
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:21,800
I

568
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,780
am here.

569
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:50,280
Sister.

570
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,410
Your wish has been fulfilled.

571
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,730
The lost has returned home.

572
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,940
The flowers in the yard

573
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,720
should be blooming again soon, right?

574
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,520
Your Lordship,

575
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,700
may I ask

576
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,240
if Madam Yan

577
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,460
died peacefully?

578
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,190
The 10-month-old fetus

579
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,670
that was forced to its death by an enemy.

580
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,450
Yet her husband did not care about it.

581
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,860
How could she have died peacefully?

582
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:34,080
Over 300 lives

583
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,180
were burned to ashes.

584
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,270
She searched all day and night in the ashes,

585
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,330
and cried her eyes out.

586
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,110
But the Xue family

587
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,990
stepped on the blood of this parent and child

588
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,190
to enter the palace to receive rewards.

589
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,900
How deep her hatred was...

590
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,250
She divorced Xue Yuan

591
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,900
and dragged her body back to Yan Mansion.

592
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,240
She passed away in less than a few months.

593
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,720
But she never gave up looking

594
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,390
till the moment she died.

595
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,630
No matter what difficulties she had,

596
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,820
she just wanted that child to be alive.

597
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:25,780
To be well and alive.

598
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:19,670
[Ancestral Virtue]

599
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,240
Viscount.

600
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,720
We should go in now.

601
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:55,480
Yan Lin.

602
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,380
I'm here. Shouldn't you be greeting me?

603
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,420
I thought you weren't coming.

604
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,080
Why would I?

605
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:12,310
No matter what,

606
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:15,210
I have to come to your Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

607
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:16,780
What is this?

608
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:18,460
A birthday gift.

609
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,500
I should have given it to you earlier.

610
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,160
Is it heavy?

611
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:21,830
Let me do it.

612
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,990
How can the birthday boy snatch gifts as soon as we entered?

613
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:24,980
Why are you in such a hurry?

614
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,130
Why don't you bring us in?

615
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,860
I’m waiting to drink your wine.

616
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,180
-Mr. Zhang. Mrs. Zhang.
-Congratulations.

617
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:36,810
Thank you.

618
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,080
Here.

619
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,050
Sir, a toast to you.

620
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,050
Leave me alone.

621
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,380
Everyone,

622
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,570
today is Yan Lin's birthday.

623
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:18,700
Let's congratulate the birthday boy.

624
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,260
Sure!

625
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,670
I don't know many words.

626
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:23,470
I'll go first.

627
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:26,770
Yan.

628
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,150
I wish you happiness

629
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,400
and longevity.

630
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,880
I'm not 80 years old.

631
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,180
I can't afford your congratulation.

632
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,510
Stop pretending.

633
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:45,810
You

634
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,290
don’t study hard.

635
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,580
Mr. Xie would be furious if he heard it.

636
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,110
Sit down.

637
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,550
I'll go next.

638
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,580
The lines I have are great.

639
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:58,400
Like the constant moon, like the rising sun.

640
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,930
Like...

641
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,300
Like...

642
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,230
You've been studying for so long.

643
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,130
I think you're just about the same.

644
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:10,730
Forget it.

645
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,200
Why don't we let

646
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,500
Jiang family's Second Young Lady do it?

647
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,320
I wish you...

648
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:32,720
Forget it.

649
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,560
If you can't think of anything,

650
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,890
let me wish you instead.

651
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,500
May the moon be with you forever.

652
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,950
And the breeze always with you.

653
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,380
When worries come along,

654
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,840
all of them will be solved.

655
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,260
When hardships come along,

656
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,860
all of them will be avoided.

657
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,290
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

658
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,210
Viscount is really eloquent.

659
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:55,420
-That's right.
-Exactly.

660
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:55,860
Yeah.

661
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,540
Ning, you can't come up with a good congratulatory speech

662
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,850
but you prepared a good gift.

663
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,510
Come on, show them.

664
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,739
Nice sword!

665
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:28,980
Great!

666
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,230
Nice sword!

667
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,139
So thoughtful.

668
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:33,060
Miss Jiang,

669
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,699
this sword doesn't have a sheath?

670
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:35,699
Someone once said

671
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,139
the general's sword

672
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,199
is without sheath.

673
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:40,010
I didn’t expect you to remember.

674
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,320
You only said the first half in the past.

675
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,889
Today, I give you the second half of it.

676
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:47,400
The sharpness of a sword comes from experience.

677
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,400
The day for you to emerge from your sheath will arrive.

678
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,489
May you

679
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,500
succeed on the battlefield

680
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,030
in exchange for the world's peace.

681
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,950
-Great!
-Great!

682
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,240
Well said, Miss Jiang.

683
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,460
I wish Yan Lin

684
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:06,220
all the best in

685
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,170
riding the wind through the haze on the battlefield.

686
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:08,630
Come on.

687
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,510
Let's do it together.

688
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:09,970
Come on.

689
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:12,080
Come on.

690
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,170
Okay.

691
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,110
Thank you for coming today.

692
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:21,570
I...

693
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,050
Shall drink first.

694
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,390
What is he doing?

695
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:41,860
Xue Ye!

696
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,480
What are you doing?

697
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,520
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

698
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,400
My brother is drunk.

699
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,200
I’m not drunk!

700
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,040
Viscount Yan,

701
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:54,610
you've been pretending for so long.

702
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,210
You must have had enough fun.

703
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,770
Xue Ye, what's wrong with you?

704
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,900
Your Highness, Lord Linzi.

705
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,770
It's okay if you forget.

706
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,660
Let me say it.

707
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,630
His Majesty has ordered

708
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:10,020
that there cannot be weapons in Mansion of Marquis of Yan without permission.

709
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:10,600
Guards!

710
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,450
Confiscate his sword.

711
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,100
Yes!

712
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:17,850
Stop!

713
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,790
Are you serious?

714
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,470
Xue Ye, what do you want?

715
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,530
Your Highness.

716
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,060
The Xue family is just leading Xingwu Guards

717
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,460
to do official business.

718
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,020
Xue Ye.

719
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,300
Take anything you want

720
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,370
today.

721
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,040
But not

722
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,020
this sword.

723
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:36,830
Fine.

724
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,970
Then you're disobeying the order.

725
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:41,100
Only rebels dare to disobey the order.

726
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:41,830
Yan Lin.

727
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,160
Do you dare?

728
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:48,300
Stop talking nonsense.

729
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,040
Get out!

730
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,350
Xue Ye, don't go too far.

731
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:55,620
Mr. Xue,

732
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,580
you can't say he disobeyed the order yourself.

733
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,610
Besides, today–

734
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,160
Ning.

735
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,080
Brother!

736
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,340
How could he hit her?

737
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:16,820
How dare you hit her?

738
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,410
I tolerated you several times.

739
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:19,540
Don't go overboard.

740
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,010
No one can hurt her in front of me.

741
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:24,590
Brother.

742
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:25,940
Are you all dead?

743
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:27,560
Kill him!

744
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,690
Yan Lin!

745
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:46,980
Tell them to stop!

746
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,260
Stop!

747
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,570
Stop!

748
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:12,700
My Lord!

749
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:14,690
Lord!

750
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,580
Mr. Xie is here too.

751
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:17,890
What's wrong?

752
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,990
Viscount is fighting with the Xingwu guards.

753
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:21,750
What?

754
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,680
The Xue family wants to make trouble today.

755
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,280
If Yan Lin makes any mistake,

756
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,240
he will be convicted of rebellion.

757
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:31,960
No.

758
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,080
We can't let this get out of hand.

759
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:47,160
Yan Lin, stop fighting.

760
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,200
Yan Lin!

761
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,410
I'm fine.

762
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,070
Don't make a big conflict.

763
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,330
Especially not today.

764
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,280
Xue Ye.

765
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:58,660
Today is Yan Lin's birthday.

766
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,890
Do you have to do this?

767
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,110
Your Highness.

768
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:03,610
Yan Lin disobeyed the order and hit someone.

769
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:04,790
If we don't teach him a lesson,

770
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,870
the Xue family will lose our face.

771
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,990
What disobedience?

772
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,540
Xue Ye,

773
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,300
don't blindly accuse just because of Jie's order.

774
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,470
Ning went to pick up the sword

775
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,600
to be gifted with me.

776
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,560
Did I

777
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,450
disobeyed the order too then?

778
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,920
Brother, that's enough.

779
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:21,550
Your Highness, have you seen it clearly?

780
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,720
Yan Lin committed violence in public.

781
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,510
The Yan family has not been cleared their name as rebels,

782
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,830
yet he dares to do this.

783
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,580
Are you also protecting him?

784
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,630
Nonsense!

785
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,160
You were the one who started it first.

786
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:31,660
Xue Ye,

787
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,000
don't you just want this sword?

788
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:36,780
You don't have to use the imperial edict to suppress me.

789
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,430
Now.

790
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,750
Fight with me.

791
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,400
If you win,

792
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,700
I'll give it to you.

793
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:43,550
Do you dare?

794
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:44,610
Yan Lin.

795
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,580
Viscount Yan.

796
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,820
My brother's martial art skills are nothing compared to yours.

797
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,050
This sword is a gift from Miss Jiang.

798
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,500
Please have mercy.

799
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,890
Listen, Yan Lin.

800
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,470
What are you so proud for?

801
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,810
The Yan family is full of martial artists.

802
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:03,140
Who do you think you are?

803
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:03,750
Xue Ye.

804
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,260
What do you mean?

805
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,040
You're the one who wants the sword.

806
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,480
You're the one who doesn't dare to fight.

807
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,810
You're the one who won't admit defeat too.

808
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:11,850
Looks like the Xue family

809
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:13,580
only knows how to raise losers.

810
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:14,180
Zhiyi.

811
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,720
Watch what you say.

812
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:17,330
I didn't say anything wrong.

813
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,990
Your Highness, you're wrong.

814
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,700
Although there are people like Xue Ye in the Xue family,

815
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,250
they are not all like that.

816
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,600
If Viscount Dingfei were still alive,

817
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,060
he wouldn't be so useless.

818
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,700
Dare you say that again?

819
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,550
I can say it as many times as you want.

820
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,680
Everyone knows that

821
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:36,420
Xue family's Viscount

822
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,900
is the legitimate son of Mrs. Yan.

823
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:39,900
My cousin,

824
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,220
Xue Dingfei!

825
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,320
Shut up!

826
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,590
My brother was reckless

827
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,780
and offended Viscount Yan.

828
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,390
I apologize for him.

829
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,060
I heard that Brother Dingfei is gifted and intelligent.

830
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,690
But it has been 20 years.

831
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,770
The past is gone.

832
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,530
Why bring it up again

833
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,180
and be so aggressive today?

834
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,100
If such a person

835
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,610
were still alive out of luck,

836
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:07,400
how scary it'd be.

837
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,960
How many people will be so worried about it

838
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,120
they can't sleep at night?

839
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:12,950
Yan Lin,

840
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:15,370
my sister is giving you some respect.

841
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:16,570
Don't be ungrateful.

842
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,970
Arrest him!

843
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,140
Enough!

844
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,920
It's a Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

845
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,850
Look at the state it is in right now!

846
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,070
Is this how I taught you?

847
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,600
All right.

848
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,550
They're just kids.

849
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,080
It's normal

850
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,570
to have conflicts.

851
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:42,670
Qing Feng.

852
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,880
It's almost time for the Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

853
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,210
Take Yan Lin to prepare.

854
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:47,510
Yes.

855
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,620
The auspicious time is just around the corner.

856
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:00,550
Please have a seat, everyone.

857
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:01,870
My Lord.

858
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,710
Let's get ready too.

859
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:14,340
Let's go!

860
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:29,540
Greetings, Your Highness.

861
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,820
Today is a great day for the crown prince.

862
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,600
How come...

863
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:36,990
Why?

864
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,800
What took you so long?

865
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:41,450
Did you miss a great show?

866
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,500
Zhiyi, don't take it seriously.

867
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:44,880
Nothing.

868
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,180
Everything has been solved.

869
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,470
Don't worry.

870
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,020
That's good.

871
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,180
The Ministry of Justice has been busy recently.

872
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,710
Lord Zhang and I are late.

873
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,740
Luckily we didn't miss the auspicious time.
