Mr. Zhang, do you believe in predestination from the previous life?

Don't worry, Your Majesty.

It's still too early to convict me.

42
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,130
May I take the liberty to guess Mr. Zhang's intention?

43
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,200
Are you going to summon

44
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,130
the servants who checked the paper

45
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,860
to the palace and search them?

46
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,040
Exactly.

47
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,830
What trick are you pulling this time?

48
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,630
Your Majesty,

49
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,190
the paper count doesn't match.

50
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,140
First, it's possible

51
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,140
that Miss Jiang truly was involved.

52
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,090
Second, it's possible

53
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,620
that the person who checked it is suspicious.

54
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,600
Explain more clearly.

55
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,680
The servants who went to check the paper count

56
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,110
should have already been informed of my intention.

57
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,070
If there is someone

58
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,579
who wanted to hurt Miss Jiang,

59
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:23,670
they will take this chance to steal the paper,

60
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,630
even if they forgot about the count earlier,

61
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,860
and hide it on themselves.

62
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,230
That person had to return with everyone to report,

63
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,590
so they didn't have time to destroy the paper.

64
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,630
Your Majesty, please give the order

65
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,030
to search them one by one.

66
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,940
If we eliminate their suspicion,

67
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,510
then we can say that Miss Jiang is the most suspicious.

68

Zhang Zhe,

69
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,800
you already had a plan,

70
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,300
but you purposely hid it from me to fool me?

71
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,610
Your Majesty, please forgive us.

72
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,990
Mr. Zhang just felt

73
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,070
that if the perpetrator dared to use Eunuch Huang

74
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,440
to frame someone

75
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,920
in front of Your Highness,

76
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,190
then they must have an ulterior motive.

77
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,570
He didn't want to alert them,

78
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,230
so he didn't dare to reveal it.

79
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,820
Call them to the outside of the palace

80
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,280
and search them one by one.

81
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,590
I didn't expect Mr. Zhang to have a chain scheme.

82
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,590
I thought that he was

83
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,790
considering Sister Yao's reputation.

86
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,970
There seems to be something amiss with the one on the right of the second row.

87
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,670
She keeps covering her waist.

88
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,740

00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,080
It's not mine.

this person is a palace maid of Yangzhi House.

95
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,230
I found

96
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,180
used Bailu paper on her.

Speak.

100
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,560
Where did you get this paper?

101
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,840
Your Majesties,

102
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,630
the writing on this paper

103
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,800
was written by me.

104
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,460
I think she could only help.

105
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,900
She didn't have the chance to touch the unused paper,

106
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,460
so she secretly took this used paper

107
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,770
from the corner.

108
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,240
However, it also proves

109
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,730
that this paper is mine.

110
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,700
It's not like thatï¼Œ

111
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,680
Your Majesties.

112
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,200
When I swept the room this morning,

113
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,540
I noticed that this paper was stained.

114
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,690
I knew the paper is expensive

115
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,070
and also knew that Miss Jiang is wasteful and wouldn't use it again,

116
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,180
so I wanted to secretly keep it

117
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,640
to practice calligraphy.

118
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,610
I thought that I could put it back after writing on it

119
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,940
and no one would know.

120
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,630
Who knew such a matter would happen today?

121
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,180
I was terrified,

122
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,280
so I didn't dare to say it just now.

123
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,200
Since you said you wanted to practice calligraphy,

124
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,659
then you must be literate.

125
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,100
Why don't you read it?

126
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,510
What does it say?

127
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,310
I heard

128
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,190
Mr. Zhang has the habit of carrying official documents with him.

129
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:00,590
It must be an official document from the Ministry of Justice.

130
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,290
What's written

131
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:05,960
is Reeds and Rushes from the Book of Songs.

132
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,820
Can you read it?

133
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,070
Reeds...

134
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,020
How could there be a poem

135
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,420
on an official document?

136
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,990
Why are you staring at me?

137
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,320
If it weren't for the fact

138
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,750
that Their Majesties are here,

139
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,550
I would have slapped you already

140
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,250
to ask

141
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,790
what kind of stupid master

142
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,910
would have a useless servant like you?

143
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,640
How dare you!

144
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,560
Watch your language.

145
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,920
You're just a mere study partner.

146
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,540
Who would try to harm you?

147
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:36,770
Your Majesty,

148
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,840
this matter concerns my innocence.

149
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,020
More so, it pertains to the Rebels Case

150
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,140
and the empire.

151
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,940
Your Majesty, please investigate thoroughly

152
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,090
and find the person behind this

153
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,490
to uphold justice for me.

154
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,070
Rise.

155
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:47,960
Yes.

156
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,500
That's right.

157
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,960
Since you're illiterate,

158
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,860
you don't know what's written on the paper.

159
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,180
Thus, you couldn't have committed the crime alone.

160
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:55,640
Tell me,

161
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,350
who instructed you to do this?

162
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,090
No one instructed me.

163
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,160
I was mistreated by Miss Jiang

164
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,300
and I saw her continuously instigating

165
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,550
the First Princess.

166
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,680
I grew upset.

167
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,150
I also heard that Eunuch Huang

168
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,060
would lead his men to investigate the palace,

169
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,720
so I hatched this plan to frame her.

170
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,480
Nonsense!

171
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,030
You still haven't given up.

172
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,100
Your Majesty.

173
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:25,990
Wang Xinyi,

174
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,260
call someone now

175
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,340
to drag her out of the palace gate and cane her

176
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,070
until she tells the truth.

177
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:31,760
No!

178
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,260
-No!
-Forget it.

179
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,190
Mother,

180
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,740
what is wrong?

181
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,250
If you

182
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,289
commit violence at this hour,

183
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,960
how will the people in the palace rest in peace?

184
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,560
We had no clues about the rebels.

185
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,650
Now, we finally got a clue.

186
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,520
We should just follow the clue.

187
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,090
You are still unwell.

188
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,460
What's the rush?

189
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,930
I was careless.

190
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,350
I forgot that you've just recovered.

191
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,280
You should rest.

192
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,440
How about this?

193
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,790
I'll have Wang Xinyi take her to the Office of Punishment

194
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,990
and interrogate her.

195
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,120
Alright.

196
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,930
It's been a long night.

197
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,360
It's almost dawn now.

198
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,860
I am tired.

199
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,530
Everyone, go back.

200
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,030
Let's talk another day.

201
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,840
No, no!

202
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,050
Your Majesties,

203
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,530
no!

204
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,590
Is today

205
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,840
a day of bad luck?

206
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,670
I was so scared.

207
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,810
But Sister Ning was so amazing.

208
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,940
One step forward would have meant death.

209
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,270
One step backward would have meant death too.

210
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,600
I could only take a risk.

211
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,840
However, I regained my innocence last night

212
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,700
because of the sirs from the Ministry of Justice.

213
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,680
It's all because you don't know how to act nicely.

214
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,430
Otherwise, who would hate you so much to do this to you?

215
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,230
If not for Sister Yao's sake,

216
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,560
Mr. Zhang wouldn't have

217
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,080
cared about you either.

218
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:04,800
Alright.

219
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,670
Letâ€™s talk after we go back to Yangzhi House.

220
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,710
Miss Jiang, why are you looking at me like that?

221
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,840
I am just surprised.

222
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,290
Miss Xue, why did you

223
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,010
speak up for me last night?

224
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,070
We are study partners together.

225
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:18,890
Isn't this

226
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,520
what I should do?

227
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,210
Miss Jiang,

228
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,560
His Majesty said

229
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,230
that Minister Jiang has always

230
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,950
dedicated himself to the court.

231
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,860
Although there were reasons today,

232
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,440
you still suffered unjust.

233
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,650
His Majesty will order a serious investigate into this matter.

234
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,900
He will definitely give you justice.

235
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,670
I thank His Majesty for his understanding,

236
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,160
but as for justice,

237
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,140
even if His Majesty has trouble,

238
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,470
I will find a way to get it back myself.

239
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,550
Mr. Zhang is indeed impressive.

240
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,120
I thought both sides would be offended.

241
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,750
I didn't expect that there would be a twist

242
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,970
to solve this mystery.

243
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,630
I'm afraid the one behind this

244
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,410
is not the one who supplies Jade Ruyi Scepter.

245
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,830
What do you mean?

246
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,060
The people in the palace have been investigated several times.

247
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,120
Whether they can still commit the crime isn't as important.

248
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,520
Even if the rebels planned today's matter,

249
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,220
there's no need to target a mere study partner.

250
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,580
That makes sense.

251
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,110
However, Miss Jiang

252
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,690
is not an ordinary person.

253
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:27,930
Sir, what do you mean?

254
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,510
What a surprise.

255
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,440
Mr. Zhang is asking me

256
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,730
for information.

257
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,470
Mr. Zhang.

258
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,220
Sirs,

259
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,740
thank you for your hard work last night.

260
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,490
What's wrong?

261
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,120
If it weren't for Mr. Chen and Mr. Zhang last night,

262
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,790
I might have been executed now.

263
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,860
I should thank them.

264
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,650
I will do it now.

265
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,180
You all can head back first.

266
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,230
How long will she be crazy for?

267
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,640
Those are men from outside the palace.

268
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,040
She...

269
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,340
Sirs, please wait.

270
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,710
Thank you for saving my life.

271
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,630
I came here presumptuously

272
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,490
to thank Mr. Zhang in person.

273
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,390
Thank Mr. Zhang?

274
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,670
Then I have nothing to do with this.

275
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,520
Mr. Zhang, you can stay behind.

276
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,980
I'll wait for you up front.

277
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,560
If you hadn't

278
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,970
spoken with justice last night,

279
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,500
I would have been punished.

280
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,220
Because of me,

281
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,140
you even offended the Empress Dowager.

282
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,340
I feel guilty.

283
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,600
Thank you, sir.

284
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,850
You're too kind.

285
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,090
It's nothing.

286
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,920
It was my duty.

287
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:08,930
No need to thank me.

288
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:09,320
No.

289
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,170
It's not your duty.

290
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,800
The palace is dangerous

291
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,000
and full of cunnings.

292
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,100
Even Mr. Chen just made perfunctory comments,

293
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,300
but you were willing to find the truth

294
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,540
and clear my name.

295
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,040
You are much better than

296
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,530
those who loaf on the job.

297
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,810
You deserve my gratitude.

298
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,490
I'm just an outsider,

299
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:33,920
but Miss Jiang,

300
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,160
you are deep within the situation.

301
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,020
You must be careful in the future.

302
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,020
Of course.

303
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,760
I need to stay in the palace for a while.

304
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,070
I am

305
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,330
truly afraid of death.

306
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,190
I can't let them harm me so easily.

307
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,960
It's good as long as you're cautious.

308
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,130
I can't stay in the Inner Palace anymore.

309
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,330
I shall take my leave.

310
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:11,850
Mr. Zhang?

311
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,490
You and Miss Yao

312
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,390
are both Her Highness's study partners.

313
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,920
I heard that there had been conflicts about me

314
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:26,440
and Miss Yao has thought of many ways to break off the engagement.

315
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,840
I don't know if it's true.

316
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,350
I see.

317
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,380
Thank you.

318
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,520
But Miss Yao doesn't think so anymore.

319
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,180
Mr. Zhang, you should know that already.

320
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,580
Why are you still asking?

321
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,380
To break off the engagement.

322
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,660
What?

323
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,330
I will break off the engagement with the Yao family.

324
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,870
He wants to break off the engagement?

325
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,130
He doesn't like Yao Xi.

326
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,370
Ning'er

327
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:25,820
What's so funny?

328
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:27,990
Teacher,

329
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,190
why are you here?

330
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,130
If I were you

331
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,840
and just survived

332
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,200
after getting framed,

333
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,410
I would definitely not smile.

334
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,560
You know about it?

335
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,810
It's hard not to know

336
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,160
when it caused a ruckus in the palace.

337
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,530
What are you waiting for?

338
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,210
You are still wandering outside.

339
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,240
Do you want to die?

340
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:46,440
I...

341
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,170
Isn't this the way to Yangzhi House?

342
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,750
Wenzhao Pavilion is over there.

343
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,480
How was it in Tai'an Hall today?

344
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,970
Could you tell who tried to harm you?

345
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,500
On the surface, it's a maid called Jiaorui,

346
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,430
but I don't think it's that simple.

347
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,270
When the Empress Dowager interrogated me,

348
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,200
she seemed to want to get to the bottom of things,

349
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,170
but she ended hastily while interrogating the maid.

350
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,300
It's truly strange.

351
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,020
Do you suspect anyone?

352
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,770
I do have a guess,

353
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,340
but with this person's personality,

354
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,780
they shouldn't have used such a simple trick.

355
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,010
However, considering the whole situation,

356
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,700
this person was capable of bribing the palace maid,

357
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,520
and knew the entirely of the four rebellious phrases.

358
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,180
She also prepared in advance.

359
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,230
It's definitely not something she could have done

360
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,070
when she learned of Huang Renli's search.

361
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,170
She must have known it early on,

362
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:38,240
so that she could remain composed,

363
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,620
but I don't have solid evidence.

364
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,940
Not everything needs evidence.

365
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,630
The Empress Dowager's reaction

366
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,030
already explained a lot.

367
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,200
That's true.

368
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,460
Although the Empress Dowager wanted to get the Yan family involved in this,

369
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,590
she wouldn't have had to

370
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,560
beat around the bush if she wanted to harm me.

371
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,820
It could only be the one

372
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,030
who she wants to save.

373
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,640
Since you have the answer,

374
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,260
what do you plan to do?

375
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,790
I didn't do anything wrong.

376
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,770
Since she wanted to harm me,

377
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:06,200
she might think I'm easy

378
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,760
to control and bully if I don't do anything

379
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,359
in return.

380
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,569
Since she dares to upset me today,

381
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,329
from now on,

382
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,010
I will make her restless

383
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,849
and unable to sleep or eat well.

384
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,099
It's good to be fearless,

385
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,829
but if you can't judge the situation,

386
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,030
then you are foolish.

387
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,310
Don't act just yet.

388
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:23,950
Think carefully before you do it.

389
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,720
Thank you for the advice.

390
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,180
By the way,

391
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,580
why were you standing there just now?

392
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,180
Mr. Zhang's investigation helped me escape from danger,

393
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,380
so I went to thank him.

394
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,590
Zhang Zhe?

395
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,920
You know Zhang Zhe?

396
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,700
What relationship do you have?

397
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,860
No relationship.

398
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,190
I just admire him.

399
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:47,590
Admire?

400
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,420
Mr. Zhang has a good reputation.

401
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,950
He is truly a good official.

402
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:51,800
Only he

403
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,260
was willing to help me when I was in danger.

404
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,010
I admire him

405
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,570
and am grateful to him.

406
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,450
You like Zhang Zhe?

407
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,380
Since when?

408
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,080
Does Yan Lin know?

409
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,150
Yan Lin and I are just friends.

410
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,810
So you have romantic feelings for Zhang Zhe.

411
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,900
This is my own business.

412
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,190
If I were Yan Lin,

413
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,120
I would skin you

414
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,690
and take away your rebellious nature.

415
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,370
Even if you have heard of Zhang Zhe's good reputation

416
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,550
and grew to admire him,

417
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,250
then you fell in love with him at first sight today,

418
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,630
it may not just be your wishful thinking.

419
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,950
You like him,

420
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,740
but he may not be good enough for you.

421
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,880
Not good enough?

422
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,360
What nonsense are you talking about?

423
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,380
I purposely said one bad thing about Zhang Zhe

424
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,100
and you're already so anxious.

425
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,360
You exposed your weakness in a few words.

426
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,660
Do you think that I'm a kind person

427
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,880
who you can trust?

428
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,820
Or do you think everyone is kind,

429
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,660
so you're not guarded against anyone?

430
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,390
If I were you,

431
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,230
I would always hide the person I like in my heart.

432
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,490
I wouldn't tell anyone

433
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,840
or let others know.

434
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,410
Luckily, you met me today.

435
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,370
I won't do anything to you for now.

436
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:02,340
If you meet someone else in the future

437
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,140
who wants to control or harm you,

438
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,320
they would start with Zhang Zhe.

439
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,930
Then you'll understand

440
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,920
what it means

441
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,170
to hurt others and yourself.

442
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,490
[Xie Mansion]

443
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,420
Sir.

444
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,190
Why are you back so early?

445
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,790
Weren't you going to teach the study partners?

446
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:38,760
I took leave.

447
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,530
Go investigate Zhang Zhe.

448
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,230
Isn't he just a low-ranking official of the Ministry of Justice?

449
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,890
What's there to investigate?

450
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,170
I'll go now.

451
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,570
Kneel.

452
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,810
Last night, when I saw that the maid

453
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:09,080
was the one who had gone to the Imperial Garden with you,

454
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,290
I realized that it was you who did it.

455
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,050
How dare you

456
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,080
trick even me?

457
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:16,530
Aunt, please forgive me.

458
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,810
It's all my fault.

459
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,830
Please don't upset yourself.

460
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,240
Jiang Xuening only has above-average looks.

461
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,770
She comes from an ordinary family,

462
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,630
and is rude and sharp-tongued.

463
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,700
You are the daughter of the Xue family.

464
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,520
How could you go against

465
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,830
such a lowly thing?

466
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,520
Aunt, you donâ€™t know.

467
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,760
Not only is Jiang Xuening favored by Her Highness, the princess,

468
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,360
but she also seduced His Highness, Lord Linzi.

469
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,660
I was worried that he would be tricked by her,

470
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,000
so I wanted to use this

471
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,150
to drive her out of the palace.

472
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,120
Jie?

473
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,300
How is that possible?

474
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,750
I saw it with my own eyes.

475
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,020
How could I be wrong?

476
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,780
Then why did you defend her in the end?

477
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,100
Didn't I teach you that you must

478
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,070
get rid of the root of the problem?

479
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,440
Last night, Lord Zhang

480
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,620
already discovered the case's critical point.

481
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,080
Seeing that it would fail,

482
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,730
I worried that they'd follow the trail to Aunt

483
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,690
and also that Lord Linzi would find out,

484
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:14,190
ruining your plan to help the Xue family.

485
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,450
Thatâ€™s why I wanted to hide it

486
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,780
and wait for the future.

487
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:20,350
Rise.

488
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,220
Since the plan failed,

489
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,230
we indeed can't alert them.

490
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:31,790
Jiang Xuening,

491
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,590
Zhang Zhe,

492
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,450
and the Yan family

493
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,730
are all here to ruin my plans.

494
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,460
There's still a long way to go.

495
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,180
As long as it is within the palace,

496
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,610
I will find a way.

497
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,010
Your Highness, this is enough.

498
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,270
I can't wear this much.

499
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:05,870
Silly Ning.

500
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,290
This is not for you to wear.

501
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,550
It's for your dignity.

502
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,520
You were framed last night.

503
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,770
It means that someone didn't take my words seriously

504
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:15,170
and still believe that you have no backing.

505
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:17,920
Come.

506
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,610
I said I'll take care of you in the palace,

507
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,210
so I won't let them bully you.

508
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,460
These are to help you recover from the shock.

509
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,130
Matron Su.

510
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:29,960
Yes.

511
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,250
Send someone to the Office of Punishment.

512
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,970
When that girl confesses who's behind her,

513
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,500
I want to know immediately.

514
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,160
Yes.

515
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:44,930
I can't repay

516
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:45,940
your kindness.

517
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,340
I feel guilty.

518
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:49,370
However, this matter

519
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,610
is not that simple.

520
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,200
Your Highness, it's better not to get too involved.

521
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,500
I know

522
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,040
that you treat me well,

523
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,490
but being so favored by you

524
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,950
will make people jealous.

525
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,570
Just like with His Majesty and the harem.

526
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,320
Your Highness, you must

527
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,070
treat all study partners equally.

528
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,800
Meanie Ning.

529
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,340
You always push me away.

530
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,150
Don't be jealous

531
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,010
when I favor other people.

532
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,220
Then I can only be like those concubines

533
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,220
and throw a tantrum

534
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,040
and wreak havoc for you.

535
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:20,590
Your Highness.

536
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,140
I think my brother

537
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,880
has this handkerchief too.

538
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,560
Could it be that you two...

539
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,610
Your Highness, what are you thinking?

540
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,020
This handkerchief is very ordinary.

541
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,350
You can buy it anywhere.

542
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,030
You're right.

543
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,750
But how did you know

544
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,690
that Lord Linzi also has one?

545
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,800
The day that the study partners changed seats,

546
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,770
I worried that Shu would feel hurt,

547
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:56,830
so I went to explain

548
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,740
and ran into my brother.

549
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,740
I saw it by chance.

550
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,490
Iâ€™ve never heard of him

551
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,010
liking any girls these years.

552
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,810
He doesn't tell me when I ask him.

553
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,670
So, did Miss Xue

554
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,440
also see that handkerchief?

555
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,610
That's why I didn't press further.

556
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,670
I was worried that Shu would be upset.

557
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,580
After all...

558
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,380
Let me tell you secretly.

559
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,180
Mother is trying to set Shu and my brother up.

560
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,340
This was the cause

561
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,390
behind what happened last night.

562
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,200
Understanding the cause and effect,

563
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,860
I'm more sure that Xue Shu is the one behind this.

564
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,920
All this fighting

565
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:47,290
is just for the position of the empress.

566
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,020
This time, I don't care

567
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:50,610
who takes that position.

568
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,890
The Marquis already knows

569
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,220
about your assistance last night.

570
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,120
He invited you to the mansion

571
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,610
as soon as he woke up

572
00:24:58,690 --> 00:24:59,920
to express his gratitude.

573
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,920
We didn't know you would come at this hour.

574
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,120
It's our negligence.

575
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,000
The Marquis needn't worry.

576
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,250
I was just passing by last night.

577
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:08,840
By the way,

578
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,880
I heard you all went after the assassin last night.

579
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,720
Did you find anything?

580
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,520
I was useless.

581
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,380
I returned without results.

582
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,480
Assassins are cunning

583
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,680
and difficult to catch.

584
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,940
Don't blame yourself.

585
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:23,730
His Lordship?

586
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:27,460
Marquis.

587
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:29,590
Marquis,

588
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,330
you just recovered. Why did you come out?

589
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:31,870
I'm fine.

590
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:34,730
Marquis.

591
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,570
Marquis,

592
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,020
please go in.

593
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,650
Otherwise, the viscount will find out.

594
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:40,650
Yan Lin is filial.

595
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,140
He insisted on personally decocting the medicine for me.

596
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,020
Go help him.

597
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,570
Iâ€™ll speak with Junior Preceptor Xie.

598
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,250
Yes.

599
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:53,990
Marquis.

600
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:58,340
Marquis,

601
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,180
I'm not worthy of your bow.

602
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
You saved my life.

603
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,140
How are you not worthy?

604
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,270
When I first met you,

605
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,330
I felt close to you for some reason.

606
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,730
Later,

607
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,120
you became Yan Lin's teacher

608
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,950
and took good care of him.

609
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,750
Yan Lin also praises you.

610
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:21,630
I thought

611
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,960
that, perhaps,

612
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,940
this was the fate between people.

613
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,260
But last night,

614
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,290
you put your life

615
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,050
in danger.

616
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,650
What for?

617
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:38,910
Is it just because you are Yan Lin's teacher?

618
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:51,980
Marquis,

619
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,090
you are the pillar

620
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,580
of the State of Qian.

621
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,140
You shouldnâ€™t be set up by small-minded people.

622
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,430
I should do

623
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,940
whatever I can to help.

624
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,680
Marquis, it's cold outside.

625
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:11,140
Why don't you return to your room and rest?

626
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,370
I walked between life and death last night.

627
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,430
Somehow,

628
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,890
I dreamed of many past memories.

629
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:22,320
I remembered the battles fought in this lifetime,

630
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,520
Yan Lin's mother who passed away young,

631
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,090
my elder sister,

632
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,440
and that child, Dingfei.

633
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,960
This osmanthus tree

634
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,580
was planted a few years before my elder sister got married.

635
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,020
Close to 10 years later,

636
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:00,720
that child

637
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,670
also reached the naughtiest age.

638
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,450
I remember that he once

639
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,790
moved a ladder over from somewhere.

640
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,140
What are you doing?

641
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:22,650
Come down now.

642
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,620
Mother and Father quarreled again.

643
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,780
She hasn't smiled for days.

644
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,490
Mother loves the fragrance of osmanthus the most.

645
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,110
I want to pick some for her

646
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,060
to make her happy.

647
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:34,730
Nonsense.

648
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,320
I think

649
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,440
it's because you want to be spanked again.

650
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,210
Your mother and your father

651
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,010
quarreled six times last month.

652
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,430
The last time was when you stole candies.

653
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,100
The last, last time was when you stole my wine.

654
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:48,620
Another timeâ€”

655
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,960
Uncle, you're familiar with the art of war.

656
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,910
I don't dare to lie to you.

657
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,550
How can you suspect me?

658
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:56,310
Enough.

659
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:57,940
You're a man.

660
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,210
You shouldn't cry so much.

661
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:03,240
If you really want it,

662
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,360
I'll pick it for you.

663
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,290
-Thank you, Uncle.
-Get down here.

664
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,350
What are you doing?

665
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:17,960
You brat!

666
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,440
If I catch you,

667
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,600
I'll skin you alive.

668
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:33,250
Uncle,

669
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,660
are you okay?

670
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,530
Don't worry. I'm not dead yet.

671
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,300
I won't tell your mother this time.

672
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,760
If you dare to

673
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:44,540
try it again,

674
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,890
I'll be serious.

675
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,650
Thank you, Uncle.

676
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,860
Naughty.

677
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,900
I have heard about

678
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,790
Viscount Dingfei's matters.

679
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:13,990
Marquis,

680
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,160
my condolences.

681
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,950
He was such a young child

682
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,220
that he'd never left the capital.

683
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,230
That winter

684
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:24,720
had been so cold.

685
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,720
I wonder if the palace

686
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,440
had lit lights and fires,

687
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,190
and if anyone

688
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:34,940
had helped place blankets on him at night.

689
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,340
How cruel must one be

690
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,360
to bear to push him out?

691
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:42,100
Marquis.

692
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,690
Back then, my sister

693
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,530
refused to believe that the child

694
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,890
died in the rebellion of Lord Pingnan.

695
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,840
She endured the pain and humiliation

696
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,300
and searched everywhere.

697
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,470
Unfortunately, there was no news

698
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,800
from this vast world.

699
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,080
Everyone thought

700
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,730
that it was just a mother

701
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:07,490
who refused to believe that her child had died.

702
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,060
But if

703
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,840
the heavens could see

704
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,290
and showed mercy,

705
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,050
allowing the child to survive in the world,

706
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,460
I wonder what he looks like now.

707
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,500
The heavens will bless the kind.

708
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,410
Since he is blessed,

709
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,280
then he should go through hardships

710
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,420
to acquire knowledge and wisdom.

711
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:44,210
The truth

712
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,740
will be revealed sooner or later.

713
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:51,620
If that child is still alive

714
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:53,880
in this world,

715
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:58,140
why has he not come out earlier to meet his family?

716
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:12,780
Maybe

717
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,520
he has his reasons.

718
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,670
Okay.

719
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,070
Okay.

720
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:26,090
He should go through hardships.

721
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:30,150
He should acquire knowledge and wisdom.

722
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,300
Father.

723
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,280
Mr. Xie.

724
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:40,840
Qing Feng said you came out for some fresh air.

725
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,870
How can you do that?

726
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:44,400
Hurry back to your room and take the medicine.

727
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:45,170
This kid

728
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:47,940
is bossing me around nowadays.

729
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:50,100
It's because I care for you.

730
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:50,950
Anyhow,

731
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,000
if Mr. Xie hadnâ€™t stopped me,

732
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:54,580
I would have charged to the Xue family already.

733
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,370
Junior Preceptor Xie was right.

734
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,210
Xue Yuan wouldn't have done nothing.

735
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,280
Iâ€™m afraid he has

736
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,680
already destroyed the evidence.

737
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,300
We can't testify now.

738
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,020
We must be careful.

739
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:07,300
Marquis,

740
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,000
it's getting cold now.

741
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,490
You should head back to your room and take the medicine.

742
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,890
Iâ€™ll take my leave if there's nothing else.

743
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,490
Junior Preceptor Xie.

744
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,430
Although this osmanthus tree

745
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,890
has not bloomed for years,

746
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,150
I believe

747
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:31,970
it's still alive.

748
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,150
If one day

749
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:35,840
it blooms again,

750
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,540
I'll invite you to see it.

751
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,160
Okay.

752
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:59,770
Father, have you asked Junior Preceptor Xie?

753
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,230
Why did he do such a rescue?

754
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:03,550
I always feel

755
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,270
that he treats the Yan family

756
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:06,410
differently.

757
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:10,630
All these years,

758
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,409
everyone has seen

759
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,909
how despicable the Xue family is.

760
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,880
Junior Preceptor Xie is a righteous man.

761
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,630
He did it out of kindness.

762
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,650
You just need to thank him.

763
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,060
Don't think too much.

764
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:24,989
Yes.

765
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,540
Duke,

766
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,889
the men Yan Mu brought back from the Tongzhou Camps

767
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:32,040
have been eliminated.

768
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,170
Our men also transferred the training grounds outside the city

769
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,389
to a secret place.

770
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,159
The private army is foolproof now.

771
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,580
Foolproof?

772
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,380
If I hadn't reacted in time,

773
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,810
this matter would have

774
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:46,810
already been exposed

775
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,690
to the Empress Dowager and His Majesty.

776
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,290
Duke, please do not be angry.

777
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:52,949
Ye,

778
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:55,370
I asked you to bring Xingwu Guards last night

779
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:57,680
and stop the Yan family from finding a doctor

780
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,680
in the name of searching for rebels.

781
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,420
Why has there not been

782
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:03,490
any news from the Yan family yet?

783
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:04,840
Father,

784
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,020
that old man marches with the army throughout the years.

785
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,280
He won't die so easily.

786
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:10,200
Making him get sick this time

787
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,880
and suffering is still good.

788
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:12,940
Look at them.

789
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,670
They don't even dare to report this to His Majesty.

790
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,670
He must be afraid.

791
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,810
Duke, don't worry.

792
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,860
We have blamed the assassination

793
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,990
on the rebels first.

794
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:22,950
Even if the Yan family wants to hold us accountable,

795
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:25,160
no one can find fault in us.

796
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,640
That's true,

797
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:30,560
but will Yan Mu

798
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,140
let things go so easily?

799
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,820
Thinking of this,

800
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,010
it still feels strange.

801
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,320
Ye,

802
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,610
didn't you notice anything unusual

803
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,620
in the city last night?

804
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:44,650
Anything unusual?

805
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,040
There is one thing.

806
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,450
After night fell,

807
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,330
no one walked around in the city,

808
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:51,940
but Xingwu Guards said

809
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,090
they met Junior Preceptor Xie in the west of the city,

810
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,440
outside the clinic near the Yan mansion.

811
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,150
Xie Wei?

812
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,660
First, the power was transferred to the Ministry of Justice.

813
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,460
Next, the water transport Raw Silk Case happened.

814
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:06,070
Then it was Hanlin Academyâ€™s men.

815
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,250
Now, he is even involved in the Xingwu Guards sealing off the city

816
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,090
to catch the rebels.

817
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:14,390
What is his purpose?

818
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,680
What is he up to?

819
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,070
Father,

820
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,520
he's just a scholar

821
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,490
and takes on negligible tasks.

822
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:24,010
We can call him over to ask

823
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,640
and everything will be clear.

824
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,070
Duke,

825
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,310
I believe

826
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,520
that he is correct.

827
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:31,360
His Majesty has great faith in Junior Preceptor Xie,

828
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,690
but he has no real power.

829
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,860
We may fear him,

830
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,610
but there is no need to be so cautious.

831
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,540
If we can find a way to befriend him,

832
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,420
it'll only be beneficial

833
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,730
to your plans.

834
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,310
Go on.

835
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,520
To befriend someone,

836
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,050
you just have to cater to him

837
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,510
or provide help in desperate times.

838
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,890
We can pay attention to Junior Preceptor Xie preferences

839
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,220
and wait for the chance.

840
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,900
Then, when he is in danger,

841
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,870
we can help him

842
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,540
and naturally get him on our side.

843
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:00,530
Chances don't come by waiting for them.

844
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,110
Rather, they are created.

845
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,660
His Majesty dotes on him

846
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,480
because

847
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,920
he never competes for power.

848
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,960
However,

849
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,360
if His Majesty grows suspicious of him,

850
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,760
things will be different.

851
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:42,790
â™«A dark nightâ™«

852
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,800
â™«A flash of fireworksâ™«

853
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:52,280
â™«Lend me half a lucid dreamâ™«

854
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:57,010
â™«I knew there's no right or wrongâ™«

855
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,730
That's all for today.

856
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:01,020
â™«Love has no cause and effectâ™«

857
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,240
Class dismissed.

858
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:03,520
Goodbye, Teacher.

859
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:07,170
â™«But I didn't know on the day of snowfallâ™«

860
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,150
Speaking of which,

861
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,550
â™«You were hereâ™«

862
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,530
we haven't seen Junior Preceptor Xie for days.

863
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:12,340
Yes.

864
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:13,830
Why doesn't he teach us anymore?

865
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,540
â™«How much do I have to giveâ™«

866
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,690
Although these new scholars teach well,

867
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:20,260
â™«In exchange for the love I deserveâ™«

868
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:19,730
they still can't be compared to Junior Preceptor Xie.

869
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:20,660
By the way, Ning,

870
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,380
didn't Junior Preceptor Xie ask you to practice the qin at Wenzhao Pavilion?

871
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:28,250
â™«I thought letting go was the best choice for memoryâ™«

872
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,630
Have you seen him?

873
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:28,910
My father told me

874
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,850
â™«Lend me a breezeâ™«

875
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,110
that Junior Preceptor Xie is afraid of the cold.

876
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:35,250
â™«To pursue the unsolved dreamâ™«

877
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,820
He never leaves his home during the winter.

878
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,990
Perhaps this is why.

879
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:42,710
â™«But it disappeared as the snow fellâ™«

880
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,380
You'll leave the palace for a rest tomorrow.

881
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,960
We won't see each other for a few days.

882
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,390
Why don't we go to the Imperial Garden for tea and desserts

883
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,650
and play for half a day?

884
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,740
Sure.

885
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,300
Whatever you say, Your Highness.

886
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,520
Official Xie,

887
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,510
can't you let me win once?

888
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,920
Your Majesty, don't you love playing against me

889
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,780
because

890
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,970
I always treat you genuinely?

891
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,520
If Your Majesty only wants to win,

892
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,720
you can have someone else accompany you.

893
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,470
You...

894
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,350
I heard

895
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:23,050
Minister Yao fancies Zhang Zhe as his son-in-law.

896
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,540
He even went to propose marriage personally,

897
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,560
but that Zhang Zhe

898
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,290
has been trying to break off the engagement these days.

899
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:32,740
Minister Yao is picking a fight with the Ministry of Justice in all aspects.

900
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,270
Mr. Yao loves his daughter.

901
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,610
It's understandable.

902
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,290
Thank you, Your Majesty,

903
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:43,390
but I practice Taoism.

904
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,720
I stop eating sweets in the winter.

905
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,150
Look at you.

906
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:49,900
You're free of desires.

907
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,930
You just read Buddhist scriptures or Taoist books all day.

908
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:53,820
At your age,

909
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,140
you have not even formed a family.

910
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,320
This can't do.

911
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,310
My parents passed away early.

912
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,340
There are also few people in my clan.

913
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,370
Since the elders don't urge me,

914
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,770
I have no such intention.

915
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:04,960
Maybe

916
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,100
I'm also afraid of having troubles like Mr. Yao.

917
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:10,710
I didn't expect

918
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:13,350
that you have learned to joke around too.

919
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,780
Sister Fang, give it to me.

920
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,460
Her Highness is still there.

921
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,510
Don't run around.

922
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:21,640
Greetings, Your Majesty

923
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,370
and Teacher.

924
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:31,340
Greetings, Your Majesty and Teacher.

925
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:34,020
I thought he was sick from the cold.

926
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:35,720
It turns out that he has the time to drink tea

927
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,850
but not for classes.

928
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:55,980
Uncle told me

929
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,780
you wanted to enter the palace a few nights ago

930
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,440
and even met Xingwu Guards who were searching for the rebels.

931
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:03,950
Yes.

932
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,800
I left the qin in the palace a few days ago.

933
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,650
I wanted to retrieve it overnight,

934
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:11,330
but I forgot the time while I was thinking of the music piece on the road.

935
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,730
I only came in after dawn.

936
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:16,210
You love the qin so much.

937
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,500
You are truly obsessed.

938
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:31,110
Miss Jiang.

939
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,170
Zheng Bao,

940
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:34,060
why are you here?

941
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,820
Miss Jiang,

942
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:37,930
the maid who framed you in Tai'an Hall died.

943
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,190
His Majesty wants to see you.

944
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:39,980
Dead?

945
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:43,300
They want to shut me up

946
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,370
to make peace.

947
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,880
It's indeed a good trick.

948
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,280
Eunuch Wang should have been the one to inform you,

949
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,070
but I was worried you don't know the stakes,

950
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,020
so I came here.

951
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,370
Please listen to me.

952
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,790
What do you mean?

953
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:57,290
Since that night,

954
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:58,720
the Empress Dowager

955
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,740
frequently mentioned you in front of His Majesty.

956
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,450
She said you are rude

957
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:03,780
and hard to get along with.

958
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,810
However, His Majesty thinks

959
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:06,830
that you've been wronged in this matter

960
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:09,440
and thus ordered the Office of Punishment to investigate it.

961
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,130
That night was a matter of life or death.

962
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,260
In order to survive,

963
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,790
it was inevitable that I offend the Empress Dowager.

964
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:14,810
I'm not surprised

965
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,580
that she did this to me.

966
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:17,820
Don't worry.

967
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,510
I know how to deal with this.

968
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,050
I won't offend His Majesty rashly.

969
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,490
Speaking of that night,

970
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:26,020
His Majesty came suddenly.

971
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:27,340
Did you call him?

972
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:30,250
Thank you.

973
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:31,920
No need to thank me.

974
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:33,950
By the way, Miss Jiang,

975
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,400
there is one more thing

976
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,260
I must tell you.

977
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,160
Recently,

978
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:39,600
the Duke of Xue often comes to the Imperial Study.

979
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,320
He seems to want to

980
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,730
sow discord between Junior Preceptor Xie and His Majesty.

981
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:43,430
Xie Wei?

982
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,560
Has the Xue family

983
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,440
noticed him?

984
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,810
[Imperial Study]

985
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:54,750
Rise.

986
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:56,550
Yes.

987
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:01,190
I promised to give you an explanation,

988
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:03,570
but she committed suicide to escape punishment.

989
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:05,410
This case can only go unsolved.

990
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,040
However, the Office of Punishment

991
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,240
did receive some answers a few days ago.

992
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,000
This maid should be

993
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,970
a rebel planted in the palace by Lord Pingnan.

994
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:16,220
A rebel?

995
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:19,090
What? Do you have any objection?

996
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:20,110
Your Majesty,

997
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,010
I just didn't expect

998
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,760
there would be a rebel near the Yangzhi House.

999
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,420
Fortunately, she is dead now.

1000
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:28,570
Otherwise, I might feel anxious.

1001
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:30,190
You are within the palace.

1002
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,820
What's so scary about a mere rebel?

1003
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,260
Thank you, Your Majesty, for upholding justice for me.

1004
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,970
Otherwise, a weak woman like me

1005
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:39,470
would have fallen into their trap.

1006
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:40,790
Not only would it be dangerous to myself,

1007
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:42,530
but my family would also be affected due to the rebels.

1008
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:43,610
That would be horrible.

1009
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:45,120
Minister Jiang

1010
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:47,000
dedicates himself

1011
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:49,010
to the country and court.

1012
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:50,820
Miss Jiang,

1013
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:53,150
you were also wronged in this matter.

1014
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:54,160
How about this?

1015
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,670
I'll have Wang Xinyi go to the Imperial Household Department tomorrow

1016
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:58,700
and ask someone to give you a reward

1017
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,840
as a consolation.

1018
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,100
Your Majesty, thank you for your kindness.
