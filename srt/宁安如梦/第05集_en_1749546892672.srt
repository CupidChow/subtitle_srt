1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
As long as I can enter the Ning'an Palace

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,200
and pay all the price

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,600
I will be willing to do my best

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,400
The End

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,800
The End

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,800
Everything seems to be a dream

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,400
I have owed a lot of people

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,800
Chaozhe, help me

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,600
I will be a good person after this

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
The End

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
I will be the one to take the favor

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,800
There are some things you can't give me

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
But what about them?

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,000
The life you chose is for Mr. You

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,400
In this world, everyone has the right to escape

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,000
But I can't

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,000
I want to regret it

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,400
and do the wrong thing

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,200
and go back in time

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Does Mr. Zhang believe that everything is decided?

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I am more willing to believe in the future

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,000
Your Highness

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,800
Your Highness

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,200
The End

26
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,000
Ning'an, what are you doing?

27
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,000
In the Ming Dynasty

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,600
there was always a pair of hands

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,600
that could break everything

30
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,400
The revenge is long

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,600
Who are you in the end?

32
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,600
The Emperor of the mortal world is so long-winded

33
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,000
and so absurd

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,580
S груп

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,060
The

36
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,900
Demon Lord looks at Ning An as a dream

37
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,300
The royal family of the two-leafed-hooks, the royal family of the two-leafed-hooks, the Demon Lord looks at Ning An as a dream

38
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:05,300
39 Wei Tai Tai, Yang Wei Shu, Zhi Wei Tong, Yang Hu Wei, the Demon Lord looks at Ning An as a dream

39
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,100
What time is it? Why haven't you left the palace yet?

40
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,100
The palace gate is closed for a while

41
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,100
I'm really worried that you'll be back to the palace

42
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
I heard that the Demon Lord is really strict

43
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
He even uses the board

44
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
I specially prepared the medicine from the Imperial Medical Academy

45
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Don't go to the palace and hurt yourself

46
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
I don't want a bride like that

47
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Yan Ling

48
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Sorry, I'm talking nonsense

49
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
You treat me well, I'm grateful

50
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,600
But the more you do for me, the more I feel guilty

51
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
I only treat you as my best friend

52
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
I just hope you can be safe

53
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Ning Ning, don't say that

54
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,200
I swear I won't say those nonsense anymore

55
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,200
Don't make me angry, okay?

56
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,200
By the way, Mr. Xie told me about you today

57
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,200
What did he say?

58
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
He asked me if I had taught you a way

59
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,200
to get a fake account

60
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,200
to make people listen to you

61
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,200
I thought I wouldn't ask about the bad things

62
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,200
I just admit it

63
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,200
I knew you would lie to me

64
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
and push you to the side

65
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,200
I just don't want Mr. Xie to go into my house

66
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,800
Then tell me who taught you

67
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,800
I did

68
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
My Ning Ning has a secret

69
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
I told you earlier

70
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
People will grow up

71
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
I will also change

72
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,800
I don't care

73
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,800
No matter what you look like

74
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
I will be good to you

75
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,400
Promise me

76
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,400
No matter what you have

77
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,400
I will be the first person to know

78
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,400
in the world

79
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,400
Okay

80
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,400
Sister Yao

81
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,400
I just mentioned a new way

82
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,400
Why are you crying?

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Okay, this is in the palace

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
If you hear the rumors

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
it will be bad

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Sister Yao, we are all good sisters

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
If you have any difficulties

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
just tell us

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We can also think of a way together

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I heard sister Bao Ying say that

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
she didn't remember her Zhang Zhe

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That's why she cried

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
She is a rare guest

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
How can she match me?

95
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That is the Zhang Zhe who got the new position

96
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Sister is actually in the same family

97
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,600
This person is not in the right position

98
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
She is just in the court

99
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600
and is in the court

100
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
There is only a mother in the family

101
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
My father used to look at her

102
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,600
He said that she is not good at playing the role

103
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
but she has the potential and the potential

104
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,600
So I agreed to marry my father

105
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
But now

106
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,600
He is drunk and has no taste

107
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,600
I want to get a divorce

108
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,600
But my father doesn't agree

109
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,600
I don't want to marry him

110
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,200
Sister Xue

111
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,200
What should I do?

112
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,200
But the marriage is over

113
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,200
and the marriage is changed

114
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
That's why I feel sad

115
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,200
If I want to get a divorce

116
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,200
it's hard to let others say that I am in the wrong

117
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Now I don't dare to marry

118
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,200
I don't want to marry

119
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Besides, Zhang Zhe

120
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,200
has already divorced two families

121
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,200
One is going to divorce with someone

122
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,200
The other is not married

123
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,200
and the other is dead

124
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
Now I can't get a divorce

125
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,800
I don't want to get a divorce

126
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,800
My father is a member of the court

127
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
I am a legitimate daughter

128
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,800
How can I marry a person like him?

129
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
I think

130
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
Sister Yao's heart is too dead

131
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
There are so many ways to get a divorce

132
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
There are so many ways to get a divorce

133
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Why must you get a divorce?

134
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Why do you have to get a divorce?

135
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
If you find a reason, no one can say anything

136
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
You have a way

137
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,400
If you are as strict as Sister Yao

138
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Zhang Zhe has never married twice

139
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,400
He is a reasonable person

140
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,400
and the second wife is still alive

141
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,400
What is this?

142
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,400
Isn't this a blessing?

143
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
But

144
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
his fiancee has been weak since childhood

145
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
and is sick

146
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
No matter what

147
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
you only need to get a divorce

148
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,400
Zhang Zhe is a very considerate person

149
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,400
No one can tell him who is going to marry him

150
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,400
I don't think he will dare to say

151
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
that you are going to get a divorce

152
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Even if you are a good husband

153
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,400
but if you hear this

154
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,400
how can you not care about your daughter?

155
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Also

156
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
he is now in a bad position

157
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
If he is offended by Yao's family

158
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
what benefits does he have?

159
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,400
If he is a good person

160
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
I am afraid that he will not be able to stop you

161
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
What are you looking at?

162
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,400
You scared me

163
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
Miss Yao'er

164
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,400
Please take a step

165
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
I have something to tell you

166
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,400
Just say whatever you want to say

167
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,400
Jiang Xunning

168
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,400
This is in the palace

169
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,400
Don't be too rude

170
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,400
Don't come over here

171
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,400
What?

172
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,400
I bullied you

173
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,400
and you want to be high-ranked?

174
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,400
But I have a princess

175
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
and a father who can protect her

176
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,400
What do you have?

177
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
The family of the daughter and the daughter

178
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,400
are all poor and have a big problem

179
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
They are so old and have a bad temper

180
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,400
They are so old and have a bad temper

181
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
I am afraid that no one will dare to tell this

182
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Miss Yao, are you right?

183
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,400
I am tired. I am going to sleep

184
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,400
Jiang Xunning

185
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,400
You crazy woman

186
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
I will not play with you

187
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,400
Wait for me

188
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
Lord Zhang

189
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,400
I have something to tell you

190
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
The harem is not safe

191
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,400
and has to be taken care of

192
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Please forgive me

193
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,400
I am not smart

194
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
Lord, do you want to see me dead?

195
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
The blood is shed behind the whole school

196
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
and never satisfied with the position of the Noble Consort

197
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,400
She has already been watched over

198
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,400
and she has a child

199
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,400
If even Zhou Yingzhi is also taken care of

200
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,400
she will not be able to stop her

201
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,400
and she will not be able to stop her

202
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,400
Even Zhou Yingzhi is also taken care of

203
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
Then I will completely lose in the front court

204
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,400
At that time

205
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
what kind of scourge will I be?

206
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,400
If you go with the wrong way

207
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
and kill yourself in the middle of the road

208
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,400
You will surely be able to protect me

209
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,400
and protect me from the outside world

210
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
I am hiding in the wild

211
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
but you dare to risk your life to distract them

212
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
Zhang Zhe

213
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400
You treat me so well

214
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,400
but you can't always treat me like this, okay?

215
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
Your Highness is a mother of a country

216
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,400
Zhang Zhe is a god of the court

217
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
who is the king of the ten armies

218
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,400
He is in the middle of the world

219
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,400
He is in the middle of the world

220
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,400
and he is the king of the world

221
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
But Zhou Yingzhi is a member of the imperial court

222
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
He is a member of the imperial court

223
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,400
who is willing to sacrifice herself in the middle of the road

224
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,400
I do not dare to die

225
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:23,820
Is it about the Within gonna

226
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,180
I'm willing to give you my heart.

227
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,180
I know you don't like to be killed.

228
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,020
I don't want to ask you to let them die.

229
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,700
But please forgive me.

230
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,660
I've been through this.

231
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,020
The crime I committed in the camp of Bijiangzhou

232
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,780
is to punish them with the crime of the crime.

233
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:55,940
Is that right?

234
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,180
Changzhe, help me.

235
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,900
I'll be a good person after this.

236
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,860
Is that okay?

237
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,700
Yanzi, please finish your product.

238
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,620
Changzhe, this is your shop.

239
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,820
I'll ask Changzhe

240
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,820
to learn about my crime from you.

241
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,660
What are those things?

242
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,620
What is this?

243
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,180
Sure, right then.

244
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,340
Money cannot appreciate someone who has the power

245
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,480
I have lots of people

246
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:44,860
Even if you're

247
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,020
My people

248
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,820
Does have enough for me

249
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,100
Which one applicants

250
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,680
Would it be convenient if

251
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,300
See all other candidates

252
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,780
Why do I have yourcent

253
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,180
It seems that young and old.

254
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,180
It's like a good looking.

255
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,180
I heard that you and Yan Lin have been very close these days.

256
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,180
You look pretty good.

257
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,180
Your Highness, you really are very kind.

258
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:24,180
Zhou Ying Zhi is a good person. He will definitely be filial to you.

259
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,180
Lord Zhou, how was the arrangement for the last time?

260
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,180
I'm afraid that Your Highness will be punished for this.

261
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:39,180
Yes, I have tried to punish you several times.

262
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,180
But the kitchen outside the royal court is heavily guarded.

263
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,180
I really want to cut off the notes.

264
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,180
It's too difficult.

265
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,180
And the seal.

266
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,180
I also hid it more secretly.

267
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,180
I'm a bit...

268
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,180
I don't like people who are looking for reasons.

269
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,180
I only ask for the result.

270
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,180
You are not bad in the new position.

271
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,180
Do you understand?

272
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,180
Yes, I understand.

273
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,180
Go ahead.

274
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,180
Yes.

275
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,180
Two days later, you went to the foreign exchange office.

276
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,180
There was a business partner there.

277
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,180
The business partner was in a hurry.

278
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,180
At that time, there will be a business partner called Xu Wen Yi.

279
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,180
You take this money and buy his goods.

280
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,180
You will get the number soon.

281
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,180
Please come closer.

282
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,180
This one is also good.

283
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,180
This one is also good.

284
00:14:55,180 --> 00:15:00,180
Manager, do you have a businessman named Xu Wen Yi?

285
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,180
Xu Wen Yi?

286
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,180
That's him.

287
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,180
Please wake up.

288
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,180
Please wake up.

289
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,180
We are also old friends for many years.

290
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,180
I brought this batch to make it a year of hard work.

291
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,180
You said how much you want.

292
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,180
We borrowed money to raise more money.

293
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,180
Now you don't want it.

294
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,180
What can we do?

295
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,180
Brother Xu, I've already said it clearly.

296
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,180
The price of this year is a drop.

297
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,180
I don't know when we can see the drop.

298
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,180
Our Dongjia has decided not to take it.

299
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,180
Don't make me feel uncomfortable.

300
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,180
Brother Xu.

301
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,180
This is good.

302
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,180
You are the boss of Xu.

303
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,180
I want to buy silk.

304
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,180
This is 400 taels. Please take it.

305
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,180
As for the silk,

306
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,180
it's better to put it in your warehouse.

307
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,180
Miss, this 400 taels

308
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,180
actually relieves the burning energy of my and the farmers.

309
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,180
But Miss,

310
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,180
the market is now at a lower price.

311
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,180
Maybe we should keep the price.

312
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,180
You have a lot of it in your hand.

313
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,180
Aren't you afraid of loss?

314
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,180
If we can't sell it,

315
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,180
maybe next year, we will be in trouble.

316
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,180
No.

317
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,180
Dongjia said that, Commander.

318
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,180
I trust him.

319
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,180
Since the silk can't be used on the road,

320
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:50,180
it's just a little bit of trouble.

321
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,180
Forget it.

322
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,180
Just do your best.

323
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,180
You are so thoughtful.

324
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,180
You are so thoughtful.

325
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,180
Miss Jiang is the best.

326
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,180
Is it possible?

327
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,180
You were so bold

328
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,180
to bring this kind of detail to me.

329
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,180
Mr. Wang.

330
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,180
I'm sorry.

331
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,180
I'm sorry.

332
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,180
I'm sorry.

333
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,180
Mr. Wang.

334
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,180
I've already copied the exam paper.

335
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,180
Please take a look.

336
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,180
You are welcome, Mr. Xie.

337
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,180
I don't think it's necessary.

338
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,180
A bunch of little girls are studying.

339
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:41,180
The exam paper is just a walk.

340
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,180
Don't be too serious.

341
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,180
I remember what Mr. Xie said before.

342
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,180
The exam paper is simple.

343
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,180
If His Majesty knew,

344
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,180
would he think that some women

345
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,180
couldn't find out the truth?

346
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:04,180
A princess must study.

347
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,180
His Majesty can't do anything.

348
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,180
In a sense,

349
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,180
a girl should listen to her parents

350
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,180
and marry her husband and children.

351
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:19,180
It's okay to be a girl.

352
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,180
But you must be so serious.

353
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,180
Yes.

354
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,180
The ceremony is over.

355
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,180
Please prepare the documents for the afternoon.

356
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,180
If you can't pass the exam,

357
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,180
you will be expelled.

358
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,180
Yes.

359
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,180
Oh no.

360
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,180
I wanted to memorize the books last night.

361
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:58,180
But I fell asleep when I took the books.

362
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,180
What should I do next?

363
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,180
Miss Jiang.

364
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,180
I've seen that you are a good person.

365
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,180
I heard that your father is close to Mr. Xie.

366
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,180
I wonder if Mr. Xie has pointed out your research.

367
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,180
Look.

368
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,180
Can you tell me a little bit about it?

369
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,180
What books do you like to read?

370
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,180
Do you have any special hobbies?

371
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:29,180
There are few people who have studied real-life.

372
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,180
If they can reach a good level,

373
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,180
I will not study any more.

374
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,180
I will not be a student.

375
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,180
Since you asked,

376
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,180
I have to say something.

377
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,180
It's hard to say that Mr. Xie is a good student.

378
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,180
You must read the 20 books.

379
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,180
Especially the third and sixth books.

380
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:53,180
I heard that Mr. Xie is a good person.

381
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,180
No matter how good the answer is,

382
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,180
if you don't correct the questions,

383
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:00,180
you will be expelled.

384
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,180
Who brought the 20 books?

385
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,180
Come and see.

386
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,180
Miss Bao Yin, did you bring them?

387
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,180
No.

388
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,180
Miss Xue.

389
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,180
Really?

390
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,180
The handwriting is not good.

391
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,180
Are you really going to be expelled?

392
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,180
Miss Bao Yin, don't listen to her nonsense.

393
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,180
Jiang Xue, you are afraid that you will not even know the big words.

394
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,180
She is the kind of person like Mr. Xie.

395
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,180
She can understand.

396
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,180
Let's just wait for this afternoon to see her smile.

397
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,180
Miss Jiang Er.

398
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,180
Wait.

399
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,180
What's the matter?

400
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,180
Last night...

401
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,180
Miss Ya, don't worry.

402
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,180
I am not a good person.

403
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,180
I am just a straightforward person.

404
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,180
I don't do things like hurting people.

405
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,180
Of course, I am not worried that I will be in trouble.

406
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,180
I am asking you without any grudge.

407
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,180
But your reaction last night was too excessive.

408
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:58,180
Miss Jiang Er, what is the relationship between you and Zhang Zhe?

409
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:01,180
I am just a bad person for Mr. Zhang.

410
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,180
You think we are a little bit?

411
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,180
If there is something,

412
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,180
why are you being expelled?

413
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,180
If there is nothing between you and him,

414
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,180
why do you care so much about my marriage?

415
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,180
Mr. Zhang is a simple person.

416
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,180
He is always wise and a gentleman.

417
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,180
Xue Ning is just a small person.

418
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,180
How dare she have any relationship with him?

419
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,180
Just that she is a gentleman.

420
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,180
She is a person who is strong and strong.

421
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,180
Miss Yao is not suitable for this kind of marriage.

422
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,180
She wants to withdraw from the right path.

423
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,180
But if she does something wrong, it's not good.

424
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,180
She wants to withdraw from marriage and wants to harm herself.

425
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,180
There is no such thing in the world.

426
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,180
You are standing here and talking nonsense.

427
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,180
If you really have such a thing,

428
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,180
and you want to marry someone like her,

429
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,180
I am afraid that you might not be better than me.

430
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,180
If I were Miss Yao,

431
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,180
and met someone like her,

432
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,180
I would be very happy to marry her.

433
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,180
Why do you want to withdraw?

434
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,180
If I were to withdraw,

435
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,180
I would not put the dirty water on the innocent person.

436
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,180
The letter was given by the Zhang family.

437
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,180
If I was so stubborn and didn't want to carry the reputation of my power,

438
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,180
and still want to withdraw from marriage,

439
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,180
I would rather wait for the next time I am gone.

440
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,180
What do you mean by that?

441
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,180
Do you know what it means?

442
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,180
I am going to be a student soon.

443
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:17,180
You should read more books instead of me.

444
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,180
Thank you for your help.

445
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,180
I am grateful to you.

446
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,180
No need.

447
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:32,180
Miss Yao is a good student.

448
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,180
That's not necessary.

449
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,180
It's just that the State Department

450
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,180
is very important to you in reading.

451
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:41,180
That's why I am doing this.

452
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,180
But this exam is a personal question

453
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,180
that Miss Xie personally asked.

454
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,180
There are many theories in the question.

455
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,180
If you have 20 pages,

456
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:54,180
you can take it out and read it carefully.

457
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,180
You really have 20 pages?

458
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,180
Miss Yao, you...

459
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:03,180
It's okay. Thank you, Mr. Yao.

460
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,180
No, no.

461
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,180
Please have a seat.

462
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:41,180
The ceremony is starting.

463
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:45,180
The exam is only one hour.

464
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:52,180
Please take your time to answer the questions.

465
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,180
I knew that the last time was a physical examination.

466
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,180
The third one is written in the letter.

467
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,180
Isn't it...

468
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,180
Hurry up.

469
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:07,180
Don't be so hasty.

470
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,180
Wait.

471
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,180
Miss Xie, what's wrong?

472
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:16,180
If it's not a stormy day,

473
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,180
open the window of the Eastern foot.

474
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,180
I will not be able to open it.

475
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:24,180
I will not be able to open it.

476
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,180
I will not be able to open it.

477
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,180
Open the window of the Eastern foot.

478
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,180
Yes.

479
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,180
Move the pen.

480
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,180
What open window?

481
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,180
It's clearly that I'm going to be a maid.

482
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,180
A rebel is a rebel.

483
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,180
I'm a little man.

484
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:50,180
How can I teach you a good lesson this time?

485
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,180
Our time is passing.

486
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:56,180
The years are passing.

487
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:00,180
The flowers are blooming.

488
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:04,180
Without your encounter.

489
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:08,180
Open the window of the Eastern foot.

490
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:12,180
I will not be able to open it.

491
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:18,180
I will not be able to open it.

492
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:23,180
The wind is blowing.

493
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:26,180
The flowers are blooming.

494
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:30,180
Without your encounter.

495
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:33,180
The moon is shining on your earth.

496
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,180
It's cold.

497
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:40,180
Be careful when you come close.

498
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,180
The time is passing.

499
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:45,180
Everyone, stop the answer.

500
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,300
Stop.

501
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:10,180
Guys.

502
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:10,940
Ok

503
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,700
Send it in

504
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,460
Send it, send it

505
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,300
It's my turn

506
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,020
So the emperor is底托的死亡

507
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,380
from the Berlin's

508
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,380
可能來了

509
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,740
that the dead

510
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,740
expected

511
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,580
the dead

512
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,460
Thanks a lot

513
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,060
Studio

514
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,300
Can you

515
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,260
please

516
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,780
put it these days

517
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,020
the trouble

518
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,460
It seems that the time of the scroll is long.

519
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,180
And it seems to be waiting for you.

520
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,140
Don't you know?

521
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,340
It has eyes.

522
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,700
Just now,

523
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,500
I and Yue Guo

524
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,580
have already come out with the result of the evaluation.

525
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,020
Dingguo Palace School of Literature,

526
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,140
Shangde,

527
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,740
Yao Shang School of Literature,

528
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,020
Zhongshang.

529
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,900
Thank you, Mr. Guo.

530
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,660
The government of Fangjian is excellent.

531
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,500
The scroll is the final level.

532
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,460
But there is a good word left.

533
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,060
It says that the process is serious.

534
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,060
It can be seen that there is a way to learn.

535
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,260
You can keep it.

536
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,900
Thank you, Mr. Guo.

537
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,620
From Yue Yu Zhou Baoying,

538
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:56,260
you have to learn from it in the future.

539
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,100
You can keep it.

540
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,380
Yes.

541
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,540
As for Jiang Shi Lang Fu, Jiang Xue Ning,

542
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,660
the scroll is the top level.

543
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,620
Mr. Xie's point.

544
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,420
I will definitely...

545
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,260
You can keep it.

546
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,700
How is that possible?

547
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:18,620
Look.

548
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,700
Our second daughter is happy.

549
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,340
She even said something to Xia.

550
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,300
No.

551
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,540
I can't stay in the palace no matter what.

552
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,580
And don't say that I am a student of Xie Wei.

553
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,460
That's just a search.

554
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,500
Mr. Xie.

555
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,820
The student is not well-known.

556
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,820
He still wants to ask for help.

557
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,980
The student knows that the student is not well-educated.

558
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,580
But he is being evaluated as a teacher.

559
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,100
I am afraid that he is too busy with the people in the middle.

560
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,580
Why don't you give the students' scrolls to the students?

561
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,380
It will make them happy.

562
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,700
Are you questioning me?

563
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,140
I dare not.

564
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:53,500
Okay.

565
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,780
Since that's the case,

566
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,580
I will give you the scrolls

567
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,500
and give you a review.

568
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,500
So that you can know

569
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,820
where you are.

570
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,460
I... I don't need it.

571
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,140
Sir.

572
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,740
The student is not well-educated.

573
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,140
He is well-educated.

574
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,260
Yes.

575
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,540
It's a rare opportunity.

576
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,460
What's the difference between the students in the middle?

577
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,500
Jiang Xuning.

578
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,060
You are so stubborn.

579
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,700
You can take the scrolls to the school.

580
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,020
Why do you have to come to fight us?

581
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:22,780
Then...

582
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,500
Then you took the scrolls to the school.

583
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,660
What did you say to her?

584
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,060
It seems that

585
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,380
Miss Jiang is not happy.

586
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,180
We are so lucky.

587
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,620
Mr. Yi De is a little bit jealous.

588
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,060
He doesn't dare to bother you.

589
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,220
That's good.

590
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,580
Then Miss Jiang can stay alone.

591
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,980
I am envious of you.

592
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,540
Sir, you don't need to.

593
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,500
You can't be too strict.

594
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,500
As a teacher,

595
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,100
I will do it for you.

596
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,660
But Miss Jiang has entered the palace.

597
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,740
There is a time

598
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,100
to learn slowly.

599
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,780
Am I right?

600
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,340
Okay.

601
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,820
You two can go back to your home.

602
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:09,180
After that, you can officially enter the palace to study.

603
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,780
We will support you in the future.

604
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,620
We will study for half a year.

605
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,500
I hope you can stop being lonely

606
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,900
and study hard.

607
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:20,900
Go back.

608
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,780
I have something to do with you two.

609
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,020
Yes.

610
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,340
Oh my gosh, I actually passed.

611
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,780
And Mr. Xie is not easy to be so harsh on.

612
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:47,700
Heثy serious, methods bearer,

613
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,180
and scapegoat.

614
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,740
But you didn't feelBO it before.

615
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,420
You scared me.

616
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,100
My father says

617
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,420
Mr. Xie is gatherings

618
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,500
before getting born.

619
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,540
As a fellow student,

620
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,780
he never vergonts what we do.

621
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,180
Could I learn again?

622
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,500
Just to know it makes him harder to hear.

623
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,980
I'm so grateful to Miss Jiang Er, the great fan.

624
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,780
If you didn't have the knowledge, I would have been killed.

625
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,980
Miss Jiang is indeed not a common person.

626
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,380
It's like she knows what she's going to be like.

627
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,540
From the topic to Mr. Xie's hobby,

628
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,580
she's just a little bit different.

629
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,860
Who knows what you've done in the background.

630
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,300
Other people can do it, too.

631
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,100
But Mr. Xie is a good man,

632
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,340
and he's very good-looking.

633
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,500
No one knows about the court.

634
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,940
Such a person can't put you in the eyes.

635
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,340
Don't be so reckless.

636
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,540
You think Xie Wei is a good man, too?

637
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,900
Who doesn't know Mr. Xie is a good man?

638
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,060
He's a good man who's not in the court,

639
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,060
and he's very considerate.

640
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,140
He's loyal to His Majesty.

641
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,980
How can he not be a good man?

642
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,700
This is the current Xie Wei.

643
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,940
He has nothing to do with the anti-democracy.

644
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,260
Everyone thinks he's a good man.

645
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,340
He's a good man.

646
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,740
Only I can do it.

647
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,820
If I don't expose myself,

648
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,940
will I know more than others?

649
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,740
What's wrong?

650
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,420
I'm going back to find Mr. Xie.

651
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,660
Miss Fang, if you haven't come back yet,

652
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,740
please come to Feng Chen's place to save me.

653
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,420
Where are you going?

654
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,220
There's a trap in the mountain with lovers.

655
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,580
There must be a village nearby.

656
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,180
We can get out of here soon.

657
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,100
Wake up.

658
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,620
You can't die.

659
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,420
What are you doing?

660
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:58,260
The doctor said that you're a bit ill.

661
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,420
I can only save you if I'm in danger.

662
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,060
You're not a good man.

663
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,420
Xie Wei, don't!

664
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,460
Don't come any closer!

665
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,700
It's not me.

666
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,740
It's not him.

667
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,280
Look at her surgical eyes red.

668
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,300
Hazy red��고.

669
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,740
With leggings,

670
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,740
four-sp They're all different.

671
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,740
But I want you to correct the point.

672
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,340
Okay.

673
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,400
if I suddenly think too heavy about you?

674
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,540
It must be Li Huan Zheng.

675
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:15,500
Li Huan eighteen attend your zither master's on thealon.

676
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,780
What the hell are they?

677
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,900
Boss.

678
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,100
No!

679
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,100
Longjing, I'm fine.

680
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,100
I just want to know how to tell you.

681
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,100
Some of you have warned me several times.

682
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,980
Some of you are worried about Yanling,

683
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,580
but also about what happened that year.

684
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,260
She has a divorce.

685
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,100
She will lose her blood when she has a bloodbath.

686
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,300
The so-called

687
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,380
blinding eyes of the emperor

688
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,780
are also related to the emperor.

689
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,420
No matter what secrets Xie Wei has hidden,

690
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,020
in this palace,

691
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,660
it's too easy for her to take advantage of me.

692
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,180
Until now,

693
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,020
I only have a military condition

694
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,860
to be able to get a promotion.

695
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,300
Younger Master Diana expected

696
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,300
I wouldn'tivot your care.

697
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,500
Why do you want me to stay?

698
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,300
Sheنning's apprentice.

699
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,820
Xue Ning knows the school is a lot more advanced.

700
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,140
She is not thatdate.

701
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,060
Instead, she is willing to teach you

702
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,700
how to enjoy your time in the palace.

703
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,900
After I thought of it,

704
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:41,980
there's an explanation.

705
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,340
You are doubting Там When I had not forgotten

706
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:46,300
I'm afraid I had missed it before,

707
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,140
so you choose me to stay by your side

708
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,540
and watch over you carefully.

709
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,580
You are intentionally

710
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,120
nombre外出 I dare you to be there

711
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,260
in falling apart from your father.

712
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,740
And I beg you forusal.

713
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,340
I will do it right now.

714
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,620
Am I right?

715
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,180
If you come to me,

716
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,700
the answer is obvious.

717
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,740
I don't want to be known

718
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,020
by others

719
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,060
and other people.

720
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,700
But

721
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,620
it's not enough

722
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,220
for you.

723
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:12,940
But

724
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,020
I have a question.

725
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,020
I want to ask you.

726
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,820
What's your relationship

727
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,940
between you and Yan Ling?

728
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,300
He is my friend.

729
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,100
is the best person in the capital.

730
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,500
That's the case.

731
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,700
What do you mean?

732
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,500
You and Yan Ling are in love.

733
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,100
After you get rid of the crown prince, you'll have to marry her.

734
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,500
Xue Ning said that Yan Ling is my best friend.

735
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,300
Love is not fake.

736
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,900
But it's not a man or a woman's love.

737
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,700
Miss Ling'er's hairpin is indeed different from others.

738
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,100
She's not talented.

739
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,500
I found out that Miss Ning is indeed reading a lot of books.

740
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,700
This one is a book of the Dragon Monkey Soul.

741
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,900
And this one is a book of the War State.

742
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:03,900
These things are not books that Miss Guizhong would read.

743
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,700
I haven't heard that you're a student before.

744
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:11,500
Why do you have to be so hard on yourself now?

745
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,500
If it wasn't for me,

746
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,500
I wouldn't believe in such strange things.

747
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,500
I'm afraid I'd think that Miss Ning

748
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,700
is a person who's been through a lot.

749
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,100
Xue Ning indeed has a hidden intention.

750
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:38,100
But it's just to get away from the palace and the court.

751
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:41,500
Please let me go to the palace.

752
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,100
Don't waste your energy.

753
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,700
First, a few days ago,

754
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:49,900
I entrusted Xie Meng to take good care of Miss Ning.

755
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:54,500
Second, Yan Ling also asked Xie Meng to help Miss Ning.

756
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,300
Third,

757
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:01,100
the so-called low-level gratitude is to repay the favor.

758
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,100
Didn't you hear that?

759
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:07,500
Although the list of the people who entered the palace is reasonable,

760
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:12,300
in the end, we still have to hand it over to Xie Meng.

761
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,700
Your name is Xie Meng. You've already been using it once.

762
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:22,300
It's for letting you enter the palace. How could you let yourself leave easily?

763
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,300
Letting me enter the palace? You still have a part left.

764
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,100
It turns out that it's not someone who wants to take care of me.

765
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,300
It's someone who wants to take care of me.

766
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,100
Instead of letting you stay outside the palace,

767
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:35,100
why don't you let you stay under the shadow?

768
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:38,700
Look carefully. If you don't want to enter the palace,

769
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,900
I'm afraid that I'll kill you and kill you.

770
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,300
Thank you, sir.

771
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,500
Xue Ning is just a woman with a sense of justice.

772
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,300
She has no power in the court and has no ambition.

773
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,300
To you, I'm just a little ant,

774
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,300
so I can be a little bit of a thief.

775
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:02,300
If I were to say that I've been here since the beginning, I wouldn't have told anyone behind me to harm you.

776
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,100
Would you like to believe me?

777
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:08,300
If you were me, would you believe me?

778
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,300
I don't believe you.

779
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,900
So, if you were me,

780
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:32,300
would you be a thief or a thief?

781
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,700
But sir, I don't want to die.

782
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,100
To me, you're not a threat.

783
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,500
A real threat.

784
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:54,300
I don't want to believe you, but I want to believe you.

785
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,900
I'm not jealous of people who don't give me any mercy.

786
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,900
I don't want to hurt the savior.

787
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,500
But the important thing is,

788
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,100
do you listen to me?

789
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:11,700
Ming Er, you've tried to find a secret.

790
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,700
But you can't mention it to anyone.

791
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,100
You're a cautious person.

792
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:21,700
You're a very conservative person.

793
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,500
You're a smart person.

794
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:27,100
You're the only one living in the palace.

795
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,900
It's also quite interesting.

796
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,500
But I don't want to.

797
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:37,300
What you're hiding is what I want to see.

798
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,500
So Jiang Xun Ling, you've been poison-hunting for half a year.

799
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,300
You're still like a regular person.

800
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,700
You're being obedient to me.

801
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,800
Don't provoke Yan Ling.

802
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,700
Don't do anything that's too easy for you.

803
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,900
Don't force me.

804
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,700
Don't make me angry.

805
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,700
Otherwise...

806
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,140
YoungDes seams are pretty and ethic.

807
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,140
Old people can't resist women.

808
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,940
Thief won't lie.

809
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:24,100
You tried to escape from your accent, so I'm gettingyr.

810
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:29,040
Half of the year, there's no avoided, but only luck in passing.

811
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,060
There are two of them in the shooting.

812
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:36,060
I'll ask someone to go to Ya Men to pay for your price.

813
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,660
I'll have a good drink tonight.

814
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:41,340
Prince, this is not good.

815
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,660
Let me tell you.

816
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:46,340
Tomorrow, I'll invite a girl who is very important to me.

817
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,620
You two are still old friends.

818
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,900
I'll take you to meet her.

819
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:53,460
Could it be the second girl from the Jiang clan?

820
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,660
That's right. It's her.

821
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,660
Let me tell you.

822
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,820
This girl is the most important person to me.

823
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:00,900
Let's go.

824
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,500
I...

825
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,500
How come the spirit will be with Xing Wu Wei?

826
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,180
I'm investigating.

827
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,500
I'll find out right away.

828
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:21,700
Master, madam.

829
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,100
The second girl is back.

830
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,900
The girl is back.

831
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,700
Your girl is back.

832
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,100
The two days have passed well in the palace.

833
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,700
The news has come back to the mansion.

834
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,700
Our girl is really capable.

835
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,700
She passed the exam with all her might.

836
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,100
Congratulations, sister Ning.

837
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:50,700
I thought you couldn't pass the exam with your ability.

838
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,100
I didn't expect you to stay.

839
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,700
I was thinking,

840
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:00,700
is it luck or someone from the higher-ups?

841
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,700
Yes.

842
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,700
In your eyes,

843
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,700
I'm just not a good student.

844
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,700
If I pass the exam,

845
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,700
there must be a ghost behind me.

846
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,700
Isn't it?

847
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,700
You appeared on that list on the day.

848
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,700
Not your sister.

849
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,700
I came to find out.

850
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:22,700
I thought it was Master Yan who helped you.

851
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,700
I'm afraid it's not an accident this time.

852
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,700
Mother said yes.

853
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,700
You admit it.

854
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,700
You took your sister's opportunity.

855
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,700
If your sister passed the exam,

856
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,700
now what you heard in the palace

857
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,700
are the talents of the emperor, the emperor, the emperor and the emperor.

858
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,700
Your sister must have a good source of income.

859
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,700
It's also possible to be a princess.

860
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,700
But on the contrary, you are so stubborn.

861
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,700
You are so annoying.

862
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,700
Don't say you are a princess.

863
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,700
Even if you become the empress,

864
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,700
you will die.

865
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,700
I'm sorry.

866
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:34,700
I'm sorry.

867
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:35,700
I'm sorry.

868
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,700
I'm sorry.

869
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:37,700
I'm sorry.

870
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,700
I'm sorry.

871
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:39,700
I'm sorry.

872
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,700
I'm sorry.

873
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:41,700
I'm sorry.

874
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,700
I'm sorry.

875
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:43,700
I'm sorry.

876
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:44,700
I'm sorry.

877
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:45,700
I'm sorry.

878
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:46,700
I'm sorry.

879
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:47,700
I'm sorry.

880
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,700
I'm sorry.

881
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,700
I'm sorry.

882
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,700
I'm sorry.

883
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,700
I'm sorry.

884
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:52,700
I'm sorry.

885
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:53,700
I'm sorry.

886
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:54,700
I'm sorry.

887
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:55,700
I'm sorry.

888
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:56,700
I'm sorry.

889
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:57,700
I'm sorry.

890
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,700
I'm sorry.

891
00:44:58,700 --> 00:44:59,700
I'm sorry.

892
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,700
I'm sorry.

893
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,700
You came.

894
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:12,700
I'm here to exchange the other half of the money.

895
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:17,700
I thought I would let go of the memory.

896
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:20,700
The best choice.

897
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:28,700
I'm going to chase after the dream that I can't open.

898
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:38,700
But I can't true for my wish in theMúsica.

899
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,700
I will never forget you

900
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,700
I will never forget you

901
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,700
I will never forget you

902
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,700
I will never forget you

903
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,700
I will never forget you

904
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,700
I will never forget you

905
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,700
I will never forget you

906
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,700
I will never forget you

907
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,700
I will never forget you

908
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,700
I will never forget you

909
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,700
I will never forget you

910
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,700
I will never forget you

911
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,700
I will never forget you

912
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,700
I will never forget you
