1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
As long as I can enter the Ning'an Palace

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,200
and pay all the price

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,600
I will be happy and happy

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,400
The End

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,800
The End

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Everything seems to be a dream

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,600
I have owe many people

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,000
Chaozhe, help me

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,800
I will be a good person after this

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
The End

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
I will be the one to take the throne

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,800
There are some things you can't give me

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
But what about them?

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,000
The life you choose is for Mr. You

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,400
In this world, everyone has the right to escape

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,000
But I can't

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,000
I want to regret it

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,400
and do the wrong thing

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,200
and try my best to return

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Does Mr. Zhang believe that everything is decided?

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I would rather believe in the future

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,000
Your Highness

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,800
Your Highness

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,800
The End

26
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Ning'an, what are you doing?

27
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,800
In the Ming Dynasty

28
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,600
there was always a pair of hands

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,400
that could break everything back to the original position

30
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,200
The revenge is long and the wish is long

31
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,400
Who are you in the end?

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,600
The Emperor of the mortal world is so long

33
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,000
and he is so ridiculous

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,800
Speak as the reinforcement

35
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,800
Queen of Humanity

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,300
Episode 5

37
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,600
He also can't contain me

38
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,300
What does it mean?

39
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,100
We are a pair not afraid of dying

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,320
Young Master Ab 칠唤, long life!

41
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,380
Young Master U Penny D 잊很在用谁都不曾 chattering

42
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,040
I gave him a class on me

43
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,320
He 상황我选 er

44
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,860
Milk

45
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,740
Empress.

46
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,420
This's probably not the most appropriate place for me.

47
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,200
What do you think, is it necessary to abolish base specs?

48
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,820
The ascension of theommenation has gotten a well-off cultural development.

49
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,580
Here.

50
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,980
See through that, our Pin Yethan's 41ndート

51
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,620
No.

52
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,100
Xie Qing, have you been with me since young?

53
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,340
Do you still think I am an unique guy?

54
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,140
You must try that.

55
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,500
In my time, when I was a little kid,

56
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,300
it was my이c who probiotislated.

57
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,820
Since childhood, my impétition went awry.

58
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,620
You must bring happiness and wealth.

59
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,460
I will offer you the highest rewards.

60
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,460
I came today to tell you about the matter.

61
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,460
You're right.

62
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,460
I've already given the order to not hold anything in place.

63
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,460
It's just that the Nidang Jiaozha is too suspicious.

64
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:18,460
I'm asking for your permission to use the jade seal to send a few orders.

65
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,460
Xia Chi?

66
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,460
You must do the whole thing.

67
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:27,460
The Nidang Jiaozha's suspicion is not enough to get into the structure.

68
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,460
Here it is.

69
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,460
Ladies and gentlemen, who are you looking for?

70
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,460
Your Majesty's order.

71
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,460
Take the criminal Zhang Zhe from the Nidang Jiaozha and return to the case.

72
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,460
Nidang? How is that possible?

73
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,460
My son is in the Ministry of Justice.

74
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,460
How could he be involved with the Nidang Jiaozha?

75
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,460
Did you guys do something wrong?

76
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,460
Mother.

77
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,460
Zhe.

78
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,460
Zhe.

79
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,460
What's going on?

80
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,460
Explain to them.

81
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,460
How could you have anything to do with the Nidang Jiaozha?

82
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,460
Go and explain to them.

83
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,460
Don't worry.

84
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,460
They just did the job.

85
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,460
I'll explain to them.

86
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,460
Wait at home.

87
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,460
I promise you.

88
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,460
This matter will be solved.

89
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,460
I'll explain to them.

90
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,460
I promise you.

91
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,460
I'll come back to celebrate with you.

92
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,460
Zhe.

93
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,460
My daughter.

94
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,460
今日.

95
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,460
今日.

96
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,460
discussing with you?

97
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,460
They areüğ

98
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,460
Please other sides of investigation.

99
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:20,420
Today, a criminal,

100
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,420
I'm so happy to see you.

101
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,420
If there's anyone hiding,

102
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,420
we'll be in the same boat.

103
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,220
Have a drink.

104
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,020
You've been drinking for a long time.

105
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,420
You should try it too.

106
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,020
Get out!

107
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,620
How long has he passed?

108
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,020
More than a month.

109
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,420
Ying Mi.

110
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,620
What's wrong?

111
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,180
to save the people in the capital.

112
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,740
If he is saved,

113
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,780
it's not over.

114
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,420
There is no key.

115
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,180
It's over.

116
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,980
Lao Huang, think about it.

117
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,420
How many days has it been since we came here?

118
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,620
Did the palace court

119
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,140
contact us

120
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,260
according to the king's order?

121
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,940
It's true that the palace court

122
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,220
has been following us for a long time.

123
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,460
Now the court has found the clue.

124
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,580
Don't you understand?

125
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,780
You mean

126
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,700
the palace court has been sentenced?

127
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,620
Why didn't you

128
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,660
execute the task before me?

129
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,580
I've seen something wrong with him.

130
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,380
Isn't it good?

131
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,100
The last time the military camp

132
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,900
failed to defend the border,

133
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,540
it was also the pen of the palace court.

134
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,700
In my opinion,

135
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,780
we must immediately

136
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,020
rise to the capital and return to the capital.

137
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,220
We must tell the king about this.

138
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:56,780
No.

139
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,620
Why not?

140
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,820
If we leave now,

141
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,780
the stone emperor of the palace

142
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,860
will never come back.

143
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,260
No matter what,

144
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,580
we must bring the justice

145
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,580
out of the main road.

146
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,500
If he didn't betray us,

147
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,620
then that

148
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,020
ghost Mr. Du Jun

149
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,060
from the Shen Chu Ghost Desert

150
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,740
is the one.

151
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,780
If he really betrays us,

152
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,820
I'll kill him.

153
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,460
But this prison

154
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,260
is not for the guards.

155
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,100
We'll take those people.

156
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,700
What do you think?

157
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,780
To be honest,

158
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:28,940
I received news

159
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:29,980
a few days ago.

160
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,540
The king went to the capital

161
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,060
secretly

162
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,180
and took the firewood

163
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,420
to take back the palace.

164
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:37,980
Firewood!

165
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:39,820
So,

166
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,820
we need to find a time

167
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,100
to bring the justice out of the capital.

168
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:42,740
General Feng

169
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,220
will be able to

170
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,060
take us back to the capital.

171
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,660
Such a big matter?

172
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,420
Why didn't you tell me?

173
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,300
Old Huang,

174
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,900
I really take you as my brother.

175
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:54,980
You're just so disappointed.

176
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,820
That's what the king meant.

177
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,180
I'm a king.

178
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,700
Fine.

179
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,220
The phoenix rain is coming.

180
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,220
It seems that

181
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:08,860
the king is not going to lose

182
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,020
the layout in the north.

183
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,220
Since that,

184
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,580
we'll

185
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,380
take action on the day of the flood.

186
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,460
In the meantime,

187
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,300
the new guard

188
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:16,900
will be the one

189
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,060
to escort the people out.

190
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,380
We'll do it

191
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,660
if we need to.

192
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:23,740
Thank you.

193
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,220
Xue Ding Fei sent a message.

194
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,380
According to what you told him,

195
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,300
the phoenix rain

196
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,380
decided to be released.

197
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,180
But

198
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,900
there was a change.

199
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:42,900
A change?

200
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,220
What change?

201
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,580
The king sent the phoenix rain

202
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,380
to the capital secretly.

203
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,580
He also brought a large batch of firewood

204
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,100
to destroy the palace.

205
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,660
This time, the phoenix rain

206
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,700
will be released

207
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,460
to the city.

208
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,260
Now, in the capital,

209
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,060
I and Gong Yi Chen

210
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,140
are both the maids of the King of Pingnan.

211
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,340
The King of Pingnan is very suspicious.

212
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,340
He often

213
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,500
has a grudge against me

214
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,780
and is very suspicious.

215
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,660
That's why I got the information

216
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,940
and secretly sent the phoenix rain.

217
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,780
But the phoenix rain is different.

218
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,900
He is the only one

219
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,220
who leads the army

220
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,140
under the King of Pingnan's command.

221
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,100
Although he hasn't seen me,

222
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,980
he must know a lot of things about me.

223
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,340
Zhang Zhe

224
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,980
wants to take the army

225
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,060
under his nose.

226
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,500
It's not a good idea.

227
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,700
Sir, what should we do?

228
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,340
If Zhang Zhe goes out of the mausoleum,

229
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,460
the phoenix rain will definitely

230
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,740
be able to make this plan.

231
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,020
Isn't that so?

232
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,460
This Xue Ding Fei

233
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,020
is a very close friend of mine.

234
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,100
He might not be able to hide it from you.

235
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,220
But now,

236
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,140
when I meet with the King of Pingnan,

237
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,780
I will only take risks

238
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,180
and tell Zhang Zhe

239
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,460
all the news about the army.

240
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,980
I hope he

241
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,340
can live in Tongzhou.

242
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,260
With Zhang Zhe's reputation,

243
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,940
you can't be so sure about the phoenix rain.

244
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,860
You always hide the phoenix rain.

245
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,300
After Zhang Zhe goes back to Ying,

246
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,260
you must be sent to the Ministry of Justice.

247
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,340
If Zhang Zhe goes out of the mausoleum,

248
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,260
he can only use the phoenix rain

249
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,860
to bury everyone in Tongzhou.

250
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,380
You suggested to Shen Lang

251
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,260
to take people to Tongzhou to meet the King of Pingnan.

252
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,260
It's to make him fight with the rebel army

253
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,740
and take advantage of the imperial army.

254
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,980
But now, the phoenix rain is in the hands of the fire.

255
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,260
It's hard to survive once it's exploded.

256
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,140
You want to put Xue Yuan together?

257
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:35,980
Yes.

258
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,780
The criminal should be punished

259
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,860
for his crime.

260
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,980
But he is you after all.

261
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,460
Think about it.

262
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,380
Ddu Ddu.

263
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,520
M weed house.

264
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,580
kilka��.

265
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,180
you.

266
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,340
My lady,

267
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:17,780
it has been reported that

268
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,780
we're under order today.

269
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,500
Young wet earth hurry to stay overnight.

270
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,180
She asks you for a ride.

271
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,020
Another one in the last split.

272
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,740
Miss.

273
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,140
Go. Let her arrange it for me as soon as possible.

274
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,140
Yes.

275
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,340
I don't know what happened today.

276
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,860
She suddenly said she wanted to stay.

277
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,340
And she took out a lot of the guards from the news station.

278
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,100
So she had the chance to let you meet the crown prince.

279
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,140
Although I was in a hurry,

280
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,740
you should tell her in time.

281
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,740
If I can't send her off,

282
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,180
I'll be in trouble.

283
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,940
You're not to be polite with me.

284
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,940
You're not to be polite.

285
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,740
It's right in front of us.

286
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,140
I've opened the door.

287
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,340
Although no one will come for now,

288
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,340
let's hurry.

289
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,540
I'll wait for you outside.

290
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,340
Don't move.

291
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,940
Didn't you say that the emperor has a decree

292
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,140
that he can't move you and the crown prince?

293
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,940
How dare they beat you?

294
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,940
It's such a place.

295
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,940
You're so capable.

296
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,940
You haven't recovered from your injuries.

297
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,540
You're going to Huangzhou now.

298
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,940
I wonder how much more you'll suffer.

299
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,940
I'm afraid that you'll be in trouble.

300
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,940
I'm afraid that you'll be in trouble.

301
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,940
Xueyi.

302
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,940
A few days ago,

303
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,940
I found myself in trouble.

304
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,940
But all the people who do it

305
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,940
know that the decree on his body

306
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,940
doesn't dare to think about anything.

307
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,140
It's just a little thing.

308
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,140
It doesn't hurt at all to see you scared.

309
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,140
I've been trying to be with my father.

310
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,140
You know what others don't know.

311
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,940
Okay.

312
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,140
Look at you,

313
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,940
so silly.

314
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,140
I really went to Huangzhou,

315
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,940
but I'm afraid that I won't be able to rest assured.

316
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,940
You are not lied to.

317
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,420
And they are exercised against theARA.

318
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,740
XiaoFLUалvl.

319
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,420
不錯.

320
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,860
XiaoFLUалоLU.

321
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,620
XiaoFLUjesong.

322
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,960
Yanlin.

323
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,200
I don't know where you are.

324
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,280
You are helping me.

325
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,320
Ningning, thank you.

326
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,440
You never have to thank me.

327
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,520
I've thought it through

328
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,200
for all these days.

329
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,080
But there are many things

330
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,920
that I can't think of.

331
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,360
Ningning,

332
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,000
you treat me well.

333
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,840
I treat you well too.

334
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,320
But why don't you like me?

335
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,520
It's none of your business.

336
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,320
I said

337
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,280
I'm a bad person.

338
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,600
So what?

339
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,680
I had a dream.

340
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,760
In the dream,

341
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,800
I told you

342
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,960
I wanted to be the empress.

343
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,720
That day,

344
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,120
you were in a bad mood.

345
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,440
So you were angry

346
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,160
and fought with me.

347
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,560
So,

348
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,960
what happened next?

349
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,560
I really became the empress.

350
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,640
You came back.

351
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,520
Ye Lin, you are crazy.

352
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,280
I'm crazy.

353
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,320
You locked me up with others.

354
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,000
You treat me so badly.

355
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,560
I'm a coward.

356
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,960
You're so bad in the dream.

357
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,000
So I don't like you.

358
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,040
How can you be bad?

359
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,280
It's obvious that

360
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,880
your dance in the dream

361
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,280
is so bad.

362
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,600
That's why Ningning

363
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,560
doesn't like me.

364
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,600
What should I do?

365
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,560
I'm going to Huangzhou soon.

366
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,760
I can't wait to see you do the marriage.

367
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,760
Another call go.

368
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,880
Wake up.

369
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,920
Okay.

370
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,120
I knew it's my dream.

371
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,040
Now who else wants to be the empress?

372
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,600
Who do you want to marry?

373
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,480
Chang Zheuktih

374
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,480
I saw it in the management.

375
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,480
I'm Zhang Zhe, the Minister of Justice.

376
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,480
Do you know my great power?

377
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,480
Ningning,

378
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
look at his eyes.

379
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,480
It reminds me of your eyes.

380
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,480
I'm sorry.

381
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,480
If you really feel sorry for me,

382
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,480
then take advantage of me

383
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,480
and get married as soon as possible.

384
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,480
Marry a good man who deserves to be entrusted.

385
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,480
Otherwise, when I come back,

386
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,480
I will take over you

387
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,480
no matter whether you like me or not.

388
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,480
Don't worry.

389
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,480
I will take care of you.

390
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,480
I will.

391
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,480
I will.

392
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,480
It's time.

393
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,480
Send the smoke wood and smoke wood to Liu Fang.

394
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,480
Yes.

395
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,480
You have a good reputation.

396
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,480
These silver coins are kept for the mute to take care of.

397
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,480
You must take care of yourself on this road.

398
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,480
Don't be impulsive.

399
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,480
You must remember to live to have hope.

400
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,480
Where did you get so much money?

401
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,480
I exchanged it with the money you gave me.

402
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,480
Ningning,

403
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,480
I gave you the money.

404
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,480
How can I return it to you?

405
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,480
Yan Li.

406
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,480
Ningning,

407
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,480
don't play tricks with me.

408
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
How can I take your money?

409
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,480
Don't worry.

410
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,480
Don't think about it.

411
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,480
The future of our family is a foundation for the court.

412
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,480
Besides, you reminded us

413
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,480
and prepared us

414
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,480
to be so easy to be a hero.

415
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,480
You can't be a hero.

416
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,480
I promise you

417
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,480
that no matter what happens,

418
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,480
I will come back safely.

419
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,480
Miss.

420
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,480
Miss.

421
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,480
The court sent someone to arrest the crown prince.

422
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,480
Go.

423
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,480
It will be troublesome for someone to see you later.

424
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,480
You must come back safely.

425
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,480
If you lie to me,

426
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,480
I will never be in your shoes.

427
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,480
I promise you.

428
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,480
I promise you.

429
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,480
Go, go, go.

430
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,480
Come out.

431
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,480
Go.

432
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,480
Go.

433
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,480
The criminal Yan Lin is ready to be killed.

434
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,480
Go.

435
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
There are too many people outside.

436
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,480
If the people in the prison leave,

437
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,480
we will go out again.

438
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,480
We will hide here.

439
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,480
Go.

440
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,480
Go.

441
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,480
The wind is blowing all day.

442
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,480
Don't leave 90,000 miles.

443
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,480
I will come back safely.

444
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,480
Mr.

445
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,480
Mr.

446
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,480
The air is here.

447
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,480
Let's go back home.

448
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,480
Huang Zhong

449
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,480
is all arranged.

450
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,480
All arranged?

451
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,480
How is the arrangement in the prison?

452
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,480
Everything is in order.

453
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,480
The first thing we need to do is to

454
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,480
take care of the people in the prison.

455
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,480
We need to take care of the people in the prison.

456
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,480
We need to take care of the people in the prison.

457
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,480
We need to take care of the people in the prison.

458
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,480
Everything is in order.

459
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,480
Is Huang Qian sure to take action?

460
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,480
Yes.

461
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,480
Go back.

462
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,480
Yes.

463
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,480
Mr.

Mr.

467

Mr.

468
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,480
Mr.

469
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,480
Mr.

Mr.

477
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,480

Mr.

480
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,480
There must be additional averages around the prison.

481
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,480
Hurry up and find Mr.

482
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,480

Yes.

485
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,480
Right.

486
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,620
Wait.

My lord.

513
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,320
It's time to wake up.

514
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,200
The men from Laijie Yu

515
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,360
have cut off the chain.

516
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,600
They released the prisoner.

517
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,600
We were not enough.

518
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,760
Now we are under attack.

519
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,760
Don't panic.

520
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,000
Get out of here.

521
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,800
Please send reinforcements from the palace.

Bastard.

527
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,040
My lord.

528
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,240
Instead of letting these prisoners

529
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,760
use the outside world,

530
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,000
why don't we kill them all here?

531
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,680
Let's do it.

532
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
My lord.

533
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,960
They are not all dead prisoners.

534
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,120
We can't control them.

535
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,080
When those prisoners come in,

536
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,800
we will be the ones to die.

537
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,280
Kill them.

538
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,280
Yes.

539
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,320
Kill them.

540
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,320
Kill them.

541
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,320
Who is there?

00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,800
Brothers.

543
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,280
Kill these dogs.

544
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,280
Kill them.

545
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,320
Kill them.

546
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,000
Why are you here?

547
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,320
Kill them.

548
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,920
Kill them.

549
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,920
Kill them.

550
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,920
Kill them.

551
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,920
Go find Mr. Gong Yi.

552
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,480
Miss Jiang is missing.

553
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,040
But it's not the time to talk.

554
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,560
The Nidang will come to see you later.

555
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,880
Please change your clothes.

556
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,600
You will be suspected.

557
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,600
Nidang?

558
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,720
You are here to meet Nidang?

559
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,800
I will do it myself.

560
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,000
Hello.

561
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,480
Nice to meet you.

562
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,120
Mr. Gong Yi.

563
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,080
Jim Zanger's son!

564
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,280
Please let me have a look at your arm.

565
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,840
Miss Jiang.

566
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,520
Your Margaret.

567
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,840
If you go out now, you'll be killed.

568
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,040
Please follow me and be careful.

569
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,840
If you're offended, please forgive me.

570
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,840
Hurry and kill them!

571
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,040
Master, the prison is in chaos.

572
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,040
How do we punish them? Please try it.

573
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,040
You're so timid.

574
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,040
How dare you mess with me?

575
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,040
You're the one who's in trouble tonight.

576
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,040
Kill them all!

577
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,040
Yes!

578
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,040
Kill them all!

579
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,040
Brother Fang!

580
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,040
I'm sorry, Mr. Gong Yi.

581
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,040
We didn't do anything wrong.

582
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,040
How could we make a mistake?

583
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,040
Yes!

584
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,040
No need to find them.

585
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,040
There's no Gong Yi City in the prison.

586
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,040
You've already been punished by the court.

587
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,040
Who are the people in the prison?

588
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,040
They're the same as you.

589
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,040
They're the same as the Prince.

590
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,040
Don't talk too much.

591
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,040
I can't come here now.

592
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,040
Please follow me out.

593
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,040
Wait.

594
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,040
We're not the ones who reported the crime.

595
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,040
How do you know our identity?

596
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,040
If you don't know, don't blame me for being rude.

597
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,040
Kill them!

598
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,040
Kill them!

599
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,040
Brother Fang!

600
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,040
Brother Fang!

601
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,040
There are many guards outside.

602
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,040
We're all dead.

603
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,040
Let's escape.

604
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,040
What?

605
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,040
What are you waiting for?

606
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,040
The court deliberately released the news of Gong Yi City.

607
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,040
It's to invite the troops to the prison.

608
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,040
If we don't leave now,

609
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,040
we'll be in no time.

610
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,040
There are so many people outside.

611
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,040
How can we leave?

612
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,040
Follow me.

613
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,040
Let's go.

614
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,040
Stop them all!

615
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,040
Stop them all!

616
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,040
Don't go.

617
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,040
Go.

618
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,040
Who are you to report the crime?

619
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,040
Why are you here?

620
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,040
Young man,

621
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,040
if you want to kill me,

622
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,040
someone will avenge you for me.

623
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,040
Yan.

624
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,040
If you continue to search in the capital,

625
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,040
I don't believe that more than ten thieves

626
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,040
will be able to make the prison so useless.

627
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,040
There must be a reason.

628
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,040
Yes.

629
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,040
Prime Minister, it's not that we're not good at guarding.

630
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,040
But many people have been taken away by the imperial court tonight.

631
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,040
We're already under the control of the guards.

632
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,040
You're all dead.

633
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,040
No matter how the court falls,

634
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,040
we will definitely keep enough guards.

635
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,040
How can you do this?

636
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:08,040
I think that some of you are not good at guarding.

637
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,040
That is,

638
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,040
colluding with the thieves.

639
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,040
Prime Minister, I...

640
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,040
I think Zhou Ying Zhi is suspicious.

641
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,040
He was in the position of a good guard three days ago.

642
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,040
I don't know what he's going to do.

643
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,040
And the criminal in the prison was also killed by him.

644
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,040
A good guard?

645
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,040
You're the one who should be a good guard.

646
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,040
You were the last one to appear in the prison just now.

647
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,040
Nonsense!

648
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,040
Prime Minister, can I do the work for Zhou Bai?

649
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,040
Wei Xi, you...

650
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,040
Prime Minister, if these criminals don't kill each other,

651
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,040
they will definitely collude with the thieves.

652
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,040
Not only that,

653
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,040
they will also become the witnesses

654
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,040
who are not good at guarding.

655
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,040
I believe that if the Prime Minister is there,

656
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,040
he will also make the same choice.

657
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,040
If you don't believe me,

658
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,040
then Zhou Ying Zhi's life...

659
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,040
You can take it!

660
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,040
You...

661
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,040
You...

662
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,040
You're going to kill me?

663
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,040
I'm going to kill you!

664
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,040
You're going to kill me?

665
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,040
I'll kill you!

666
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,040
I'll kill you!

667
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,040
I'll kill you!

668
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,040
I want to protect you more than warning you.

669
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,040
And you!

670
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,040
See? This is his whereabouts.

671
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,040
In my hands,

672
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:10,040
whether it's the treason or the new-born,

673
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,040
Yang Feng Yin Wei,

674
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,040
he can't be left alone!

675
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,040
Yes!

676
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,040
I'll kill you.

677
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,040
I'll kill you!

678
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,040
I'll kill you!

679
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,040
You're the one!

680
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,040
Brother Huo, they're coming.

681
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,040
Why are we still heading east?

682
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,040
How did you know about the palace's position?

683
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,040
You're the one who's left.

684
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,040
You can tell me now.

685
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,040
I have saved the palace in the prison.

686
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,080
What do you mean?

687
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,160
You've been with the Prince for so many years.

688
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,040
You've never heard of

689
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,440
Du Jun Shan Ren?

690
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,880
Du Jun Shan Ren?

691
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,040
You're Mr. Du Jun?

692
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,040
Brother Huang, we've saved him.

693
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,160
Mr. Du Jun is here.

694
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,880
We must find a way to take him out.

695
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,280
Du Jun Shan Ren?

696
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,040
Mr. Du Jun is the one who ordered

697
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,040
the previous Fu to take revenge.

698
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,040
But he's not the one who did it.

699
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,440
He's the one who did it.

700
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,440
I'm not lying.

701
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,440
But we've never seen him before.

702
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,440
We should be honest.

703
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,440
We should be fair.

704
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,440
About tonight,

705
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,440
isn't it fair?

706
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,440
The day before, I was in the back of the palace.

707
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,440
I was in the front,

708
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,440
and I was in the back.

709
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,440
I was in the prison.

710
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,440
But I didn't get anything.

711
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,440
I thought I'd be in the court.

712
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,440
But I've been in the trouble.

713
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,440
But I met these fools.

714
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,440
I'm sorry.

715
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,440
What you just said

716
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,440
means the court will know

717
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,440
we're coming to the prison soon.

718
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,440
But we're in the middle of the world.

719
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,440
How could we think of it?

720
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,440
If I'm right,

721
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,440
the court has already decided

722
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,440
to investigate you.

723
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,440
There must be a lot of soldiers

724
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,440
who are in trouble.

725
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,440
My identity is not true.

726
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,440
Send someone to the east gate to see.

727
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,440
Ning Xun, be careful.

728
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,440
Yes.

729
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,440
You can go to the main gate

730
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,440
to find some common clothes.

731
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,440
Yes.

732
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,440
There are four gates in the capital.

733
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,440
The imperial guards will be in charge of that.

734
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,440
They will be sent to the capital

735
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,440
to separate the three gates

736
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,440
from the north and south.

737
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,440
The foreign army will be surrounded

738
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,440
and the western gate will be empty.

739
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,440
Lord Zhang

740
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,440
will only take the traitor

741
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,440
who escaped from the prison.

742
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,440
He will only take the traitor

743
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,440
who escaped from the prison

744
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,440
to the west gate.

745
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,440
If the case is settled,

746
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,440
the other party will let you go.

747
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,440
This will make

748
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,440
Lord Zhang

749
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,440
be a traitor.

750
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,440
I heard that the mountain people

751
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,440
have the ability to return to the desert.

752
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,440
This is really a good idea.

753
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,440
If the information is good,

754
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,440
the traitor will be in the city

755
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,440
after he leaves the capital.

756
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,440
He will be taken to Tongzhou

757
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,440
first.

758
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,440
From the capital to Tongzhou,

759
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,440
there are three ways to go.

760
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,440
I can't predict

761
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,440
their choices.

762
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,440
So,

763
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,440
I can only rely on Lord Zhang

764
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,440
on this journey.

765
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,440
I will think of a way

766
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,440
to clear all the traitor's

767
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,440
plots on this journey.

768
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,440
After Lord Zhang

769
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,440
enters the city of Tongzhou,

770
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,440
he will be in charge of

771
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,440
the camp of Xu Ying

772
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,440
in the case of the assassins.

773
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,440
The imperial guards

774
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,440
will be in charge of the camp.

775
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,440
Okay.

776
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,440
But

777
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,440
Lord Xie seems to be familiar with the

778
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,440
assassination.

779
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,440
Is it really just a piece of information

780
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,440
from the assassins?

781
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,440
Lord Zhang is in the Ministry of Justice.

782
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,440
He deals with the case of the assassins every day.

783
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,440
It's good to be cautious,

784
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,440
but if you are too cautious,

785
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,440
it's too much.

786
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,440
Too much?

787
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,440
It's meaningless to be cautious.

788
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,440
Isn't it?

789
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:33,440
Lord Xu,

790
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:40,440
what are we going to do?

791
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,440
Actually,

792
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,080
I'm going to the Palace of Justice.

793
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,640
Is this rabbit really going to sell us?

794
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,520
It's not too late to know yet.

795
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,800
Now there are five new guards in the whole city.

796
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,920
The whole village has a heavy army to guard.

797
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,360
Don't you want to believe what I said?

798
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,040
It seems that you can take out our treasure.

799
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,040
I've been in the court for years.

800
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,760
I still have the people's hands.

801
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,000
If you want to live, come with me.

802
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,040
This is Mr.Estzeniu Dane.

803
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:18,940
Golden

804
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:20,640
This is Golden.

805
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,480
This is made byultan Han at the authentic Steel Fortress.

806
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,160
Now this bag is saved.

807
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,800
You're the one who can solve it.

808
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,680
How can you have a piece of this?

809
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,680
Take this.

810
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,680
Miss.

811
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,680
Miss.

812
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,680
Miss.

813
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,680
I'm going.

814
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,680
Miss.

815
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,680
Now you still don't believe me?

816
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,680
If the gate is not open,

817
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,680
I'll return your people to you.

818
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,680
Who is it?

819
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,680
Mr. Huang.

820
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,680
I have something to do.

821
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,680
I'm in a hurry to go out.

822
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,680
The first batch of documents are ready.

823
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,680
Please don't worry.

824
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,680
It's Mr. Huang who wants to go out.

825
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,680
Open the door.

826
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,680
Yes.

827
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,680
Mr. Du Jun, the former emperor,

828
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,680
is the one who buried the secret of the imperial court.

829
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,680
I didn't expect that he would be so smart.

830
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,680
I'm sorry.

831
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,680
I'm sorry.

832
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,680
I'm sorry.

833
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,680
I'm sorry.

834
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,680
I'm sorry.

835
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:07,680
I'm sorry.

836
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,680
I didn't expect that he would be so smart.

837
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,680
Firemen.

838
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,680
You were taken away by Lu.

839
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,680
Why did he do this?

840
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,680
Mr. Shao Shi.

841
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,680
You know what happened.

842
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,680
Please forgive me, Mr. Shao Shi.

843
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:45,680
It's my fault.

844
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,680
It's my fault that I couldn't protect your right.

845
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,680
I was so mean.

846
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,680
I was worried about your safety.

847
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:55,680
I was careless.

848
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,680
It affected your innocence.

849
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,680
So I didn't dare to report to the imperial court.

850
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,680
I really had no choice.

851
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,680
I had to come to you.

852
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,680
You're a smart person.

853
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,680
Miss Ling Er has been in jail for a long time.

854
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,680
You can't reveal half of the words to others.

855
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,680
Otherwise,

856
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,680
I'll kill you.

857
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,680
I'm sorry.

858
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,680
I'm sorry.

859
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,680
I'm sorry.

860
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,680
I'm sorry.
