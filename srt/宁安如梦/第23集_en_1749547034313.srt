1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
As long as I can enter the Ning'an Palace

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,200
and pay all the price

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,600
I will be willing to do so.

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,400
The End

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,800
The End

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,800
Everything seems to be a dream.

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,400
I have owed a lot of people.

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,800
Chaozhe, help me.

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,600
I will be a good person after this.

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
The End

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
I will be the one to take the favor.

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,800
There are some things you can't give me.

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
But what about them?

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,000
The life you chose is for Mr. You.

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,400
In this world, everyone has the right to escape.

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,000
But I can't.

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,000
I want to regret it.

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,400
I will do my best to return.

20
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,400
Does Mr. Zhang believe that everything is decided?

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,200
I am more willing to believe in the future.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,200
Congratulations, Your Highness.

23
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,000
Congratulations, Your Highness.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,400
We are all willing to do so.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,200
Ning'an, what are you doing?

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,200
In the end,

27
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,800
there is a pair of invisible hands

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,800
that will destroy everything.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,600
The revenge is long.

30
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,800
Who are you?

31
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,800
The Emperor of the mortal world is so long-winded.

32
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,400
The world is so chaotic.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,600
The world is so chaotic.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The End

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,400
It's time to send them off.

36
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,600
Xie Wei, kill him.

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,260
Sherhi, Prim Where Are You благодар

38
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,800
Let go.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,800
Let me agree that after you killed him,

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
the outskirts ofither yes.

41
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,160
Boss Jiang,更or-ok

42
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,160
Hahahahaha.

43
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,800
As you wish,

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I will hug my worthy life.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
There is no enough light for me to shine for you.

46
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,600
Sister,

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,360
I was being selfish.

48
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,540
You talked enough, so I liked that lecture.

49
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,500
Something else Ichihara told me to do.

50
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,220
General Director Miraimi,

51
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:19,960
the

52
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,860
politicians who manipulate this country

53
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,820
don't have the will of government duty,

54
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,240
they are just

55
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,220
a failure to serve about the ideas of the country.

56
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,080
None are like that from a national когдаook.

57
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,300
If we get back what was before.

58
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,800
You and Director purchase my two daughters.

59
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,860
Let me see if I can help.

60
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,320
I am sorry that your ev Debatte was no serious

61
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:58,360
Please allow myful

62
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:04,960
I did not manage these, how can the anguish arise?

63
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,140
It is your fault

64
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,380
Yourldings didn't know

65
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,460
So, I intended to question you

66
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,660
Now standing in front of me

67
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,060
is the crown prince of the Wuchao?

68
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,860
Or someone else?

69
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,660
Ling'er, go out.

70
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,860
I have something to tell her.

71
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,060
Ling'er, stop making me say it twice.

72
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,860
Otherwise, I won't let you be afraid.

73
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,060
It really happened.

74
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,660
It's okay.

75
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,860
Miss Jiang, you go out first.

76
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,260
I have something to tell Xie Shao.

77
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,060
Miss, the gentleman asked me to take you to rest.

78
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,860
I picked some clean laundry clothes for you from the temple.

79
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,260
They are already in the room.

80
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,260
You should go and see if they are suitable.

81
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,460
What do you want to ask, Mr. Zhang?

82
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,660
Just say it.

83
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,460
Xiaobao is yours?

84
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,060
Yes.

85
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,860
Xue Dingfei is also yours.

86
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,260
It's okay.

87
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,660
Miss Jiang said that Yong Ding's medical department is not in the court.

88
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,460
The one who Xie was telling me in the capital

89
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,660
was a liar from beginning to end.

90
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,660
You don't want me to leave Tongzhou alive.

91
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,260
Mr. Zhang, do you think that

92
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,260
in this game of chess,

93
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,660
your life and death are so important to me?

94
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,460
I am indeed not that important.

95
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,260
But once I return to the capital alive,

96
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,260
I will become the king's threat.

97
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,260
So...

98
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,660
So I will kill you.

99
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,060
Mr. Zhang, you are not that good at your own business.

100
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,060
I have never said that I am a saint from beginning to end.

101
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,860
But in this mess,

102
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,060
the imperial court will have to take on a very serious person.

103
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,460
A very serious person.

104
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,260
Xue Dingfei and Xiaobao are very stubborn.

105
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,060
I am not sure how I can

106
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,260
make this matter known to the public.

107
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,460
But on the way here,

108
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,260
are they not safe to protect Mr. Zhang in the dark?

109
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,060
Have you ever thought about it?

110
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,560
Fengming and Nenqiao have secretly

111
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,560
transported the fire medicine to Tongzhou.

112
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,260
How many imperial court officials have been involved in this?

113
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,860
If Mr. Zhang thinks that

114
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,060
after returning to the capital,

115
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,060
he will be the most superior in the world

116
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,860
to Xie's crime.

117
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,860
But that can be done.

118
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,660
But for Xie,

119
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,260
you and I have always been the same.

120
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,860
But it is just that we have chosen two paths.

121
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,860
Xie is very compatible with Mr. Zhang.

122
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,260
He is not willing to be your enemy.

123
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,860
But what Mr. Zhang wants to do

124
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,860
is your freedom.

125
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,860
Wait.

126
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,260
There is one more thing.

127
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,860
Miss Jiang is so despicable. Please allow me to...

128
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,260
Ling'er is my student. I can handle it.

129
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,260
It is hard for Mr. Zhang to take care of you all the way.

130
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,060
I should have been the one to thank you.

131
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,060
But...

132
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,060
I have one thing to ask you.

133
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,660
What kind of person do you think

134
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,060
you are?

135
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,860
What do you think you are?

136
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,860
I am willing to do anything to hurt Miss Jiang.

137
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,060
He is a fool.

138
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,860
He has all the thoughts on him.

139
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,660
It is fine if others can't see it.

140
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,860
You really don't know what you are doing?

141
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,860
What do you think of me and Miss Jiang?

142
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,460
That is also the matter between us.

143
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,060
Mr. Xie, why do you tell me this?

144
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,060
I am his teacher.

145
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,060
You are trying to be a good student.

146
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,060
But you are not even a good teacher.

147
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,060
You...

148
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,660
When you were in the capital,

149
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,060
if you really worried about him,

150
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,060
you shouldn't have brought him out of the city.

151
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,860
It was because of you that he was in danger.

152
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,860
Mr. Zhang is a very high-ranking person.

153
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,860
He is loyal to his people.

154
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,260
But for the sake of love,

155
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,060
he is loyal to his people.

156
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,660
If you are worried about him,

157
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,260
don't bother him anymore.

158
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,460
Otherwise,

159
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:44,260
I am not willing to kill you again.

160
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,260
Mr. Xie is a man who can be separated from the world.

161
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,460
But Miss Jiang is a living person.

162
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,260
You can't just attack him.

163
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,260
Is that so?

164
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,860
Everyone, hurry up.

165
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,660
Everybody, pick them up as fast as possible.

166
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,020
Hurry up!

167
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,660
It's time to wrap theั therapeutic energy.

168
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,660
Yes.

169
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,660
Hurry up, faster, follow up!

170
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:25,140
Hurry up!

171
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,160
Director,

172
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,460
Dingu kung was a knitting master.

173
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,060
He was never able to kneel down.

174
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,860
Tearing him down

175
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,860
Do you want to die in the hands of me?

176
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,860
Where is he?

177
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,860
I'm hurt.

178
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,860
Where is he?

179
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,860
Is the Tian family so intelligent?

180
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,860
You're really a useless bastard.

181
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,860
What are you doing?

182
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,860
Stop it.

183
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,860
You're so bold.

184
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,860
You Yan army are used to

185
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,860
the chaos of the mother and the son.

186
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,860
The imperial palace is in great danger.

187
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,860
But I dare to ask

188
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,860
who was the one who escaped from the town.

189
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,860
Who is the one who protected the city?

190
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,860
You're a coward.

191
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,860
How dare you take my life?

192
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,860
I'm angry.

193
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,860
His Majesty has handed over the Yan army to the Xie's Mansion.

194
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,860
If anything happens,

195
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,860
I can discuss with the imperial palace.

196
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,860
Xie Shao Shi is a civil servant.

197
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,860
How can he manage the military affairs?

198
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,860
Today's situation seems to be a big deal.

199
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,860
It's a great loss.

200
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,860
Thank you for your kind words.

201
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,860
I'm not good enough.

202
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,860
I'm also grateful to the Yan army for their courage.

203
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,860
But it's strange.

204
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,860
I've promised to see you in Tongzhou City.

205
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,860
Why did I see you here?

206
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,860
My father is just a coward.

207
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,860
Is this what you want to hear from Xie Shao Shi?

208
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,860
The imperial palace doesn't have to be respected.

209
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,860
It's just that I'm not doing anything today.

210
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,860
I'll tell His Majesty about it.

211
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,860
Please accept my invitation.

212
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,860
I'm not leaving.

213
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,860
Young Master Ding Fei!

214
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,860
Where are you going?

215
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,860
Now that the Yan army is in a good mood,

216
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,860
the Yan army is in a good mood.

217
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,860
It's a good opportunity to fight.

218
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,860
If the Xue family finds a chance to fight,

219
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,860
the consequences will be dire.

220
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,860
So we should close the seal.

221
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,860
Understood.

222
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,860
Sit.

223
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,860
But...

224
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,860
The Marquis has investigated

225
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,860
the cause of the Ying army's military affairs.

226
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,860
The news is very serious.

227
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,860
Now that the Xue family is here,

228
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,860
I'm worried that they'll enter the camp and destroy the evidence.

229
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,860
I came here to investigate this matter.

230
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,860
Please prepare the evidence for the case.

231
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,860
And the suspicion case.

232
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,860
Okay.

233
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,860
The drugs you took have been reported to me.

234
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,860
Although it's not a big deal,

235
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,860
the dead bodies are still in the mountain.

236
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,860
I asked people to go to the front to repair them.

237
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,860
But the situation is chaotic now.

238
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,860
Please don't be here to judge.

239
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,860
I hope you can give me the evidence.

240
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,860
Mr. Xie, the man is here.

241
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,860
I'll go and arrange the case.

242
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,860
You can tell me if you need anything.

243
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,860
Please send the general for me.

244
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,860
Please.

245
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,860
Did you hear it clearly?

246
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,860
I followed him in the dark.

247
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,860
I heard it clearly.

248
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,860
Xie Shao Shi is indeed the subordinate of the subordinate.

249
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,860
I'm sure it's Mr. Fei.

250
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,860
Look at it clearly.

251
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,860
Is there any scar on the heart?

252
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,860
Why are you so anxious?

253
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,860
I'm just a cat.

254
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,860
Don't be afraid.

255
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,860
I won't run away.

256
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,860
Really.

257
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,860
There is indeed a scar on the heart.

258
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,860
Did you find out where he is?

259
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,860
I heard that he seems to be the subordinate of Xie Shao Shi

260
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,860
who is in the dark in the Pingnan King's prison.

261
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,860
There are many reasons for this.

262
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,860
You can leave now.

263
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,860
No one should mention it.

264
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,860
Yes.

265
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,860
How could he still be alive?

266
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,860
Bao told me that

267
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,860
Zhang Zhizhi suspected your identity.

268
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,860
You said it yourself.

269
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,860
I'm just a pet.

270
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,860
How could I know that a subordinate is so hard to find?

271
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,860
Then why didn't I let Bao Chen Ling kill Zhang Zhizhi

272
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,860
while he was in the process?

273
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,860
I told Feng Ming Yu that he was Mr. Du Jun.

274
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,860
If he was in trouble,

275
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,860
I would be the one to lie.

276
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,860
Then how could I tell him

277
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,860
that I saw the king when I returned to Jinling?

278
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,860
No.

279
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,860
Feng Ming Yu was killed by you.

280
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,860
I was living with you.

281
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,860
I was going to kill Zhang Zhizhi.

282
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,860
I'll go now.

283
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,860
I'll make you happy.

284
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,860
No need.

285
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,860
But because of Miss Jiang,

286
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,860
you can live for Zhang Zhizhi's life.

287
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,860
So you're afraid?

288
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,860
I told you to come here

289
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,860
not to talk nonsense with you.

290
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,860
Now that Feng Ming Yu is in the capital,

291
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,860
Prince of Pingnan will be in trouble.

292
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,860
The war is at its peak.

293
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,860
You can't be so bold.

294
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,860
What should we do next?

295
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,860
Have you thought about it?

296
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,860
I'm not you.

297
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,860
I'm not as capable as you.

298
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,860
I just want to live

299
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,860
and enjoy the wealth of Ronghua.

300
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,860
I don't dare to go there.

301
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,860
Prince of Pingnan wants to use

302
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,860
the identity of Xue Dingfei.

303
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,860
But he's afraid that I'll betray him.

304
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,860
That's why he wants to use your name

305
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,860
to make a promotion.

306
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,860
But we'll stick to the role of a puppet.

307
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,860
Once the city is dead,

308
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,860
if you rely on me,

309
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,860
maybe you'll have a chance.

310
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,860
After I finish what I should do,

311
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,860
Xue Dingfei can keep you.

312
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,860
But if you don't want to be Xue Dingfei,

313
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,860
you can come to the world.

314
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,860
Enough.

315
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,860
Think about it.

316
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,860
Give me an answer before you leave Tongzhou.

317
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,860
Master Zhang, is it convenient for me to come in?

318
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,860
Please come in.

319
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,860
General Yan said the mountain road is blocked.

320
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,860
We'll stay here for a few days.

321
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,860
I'm afraid that your arm won't be able to eat.

322
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,860
So I made a move.

323
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,860
Thank you, Miss Jiang.

324
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,860
What did you say in the afternoon?

325
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,860
Nothing.

326
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,860
You're a public figure.

327
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,860
Your Highness.

328
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:08,860
Master, even though you were crying,

329
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,860
she did not do well.

330
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,860
I know

331
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,860
you know the truth when you're here.

332
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,860
But you saved us today.

333
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,160
So can you

334
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,860
tell the officials the truth?

335
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:26,700
Miss Jiang, if you are really

336
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,860
involved,

337
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,660
why didn't you help us

338
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,860
continue guarding in the capital?

339
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,100
I left you in...

340
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,780
the prison and sent you...

341
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,460
to my death,

342
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,100
but she was also tastesied.

343
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,900
It was an occupation ofUFF.

344
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,700
Your Highness, please forgive us.

345
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,900
This you'reer RMB and RMB of Costume.

346
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,380
You would be blamed...

347
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,420
for your business in this outfit.

348
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,300
It's just that you hermed out...

349
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,460
and passed on your name.

350
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,500
Waking you out like this,

351
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,300
you're bearing away my happiness.

352
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,340
But I've also itself denied herápabsheete,

353
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,340
You are really guilty.

354
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,340
When Yu Ru's case was solved, you saved my life.

355
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,340
You were so righteous in the case of Yan Lingguan.

356
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,340
If you hadn't forced me to file a case against Chang Ming

357
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,340
and give it back to me, I wouldn't have been involved in this.

358
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,340
If you want to say you are guilty, I should be guilty of it.

359
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,340
Miss Jiang, you don't have to be like this.

360
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,340
The truth of the case is also what happened in Zhang Mo's case.

361
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:28,340
Shi Youyun invested in Mu Guang and reported to Qiong Yao.

362
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,340
Miss Jiang is so close to her.

363
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,340
Zhang Mo will not be like her.

364
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,340
As long as I don't do anything to harm the court,

365
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,340
I can not say it.

366
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:41,340
Because I am a girl.

367
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,340
Let's eat.

368
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,340
Sir, the time has passed.

369
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,340
You need to rest.

370
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,340
I know.

371
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,340
I will sit here for a while.

372
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,340
Go get me a nosebleed.

373
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,340
Yes.

374
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,340
Master, you are still here so late.

375
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,340
Ye Er is going to be a military officer.

376
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,340
His leg injury is not easy to be healed.

377
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:27,340
So you still need to find the best medicine for me.

378
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,340
I understand.

379
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,340
You can see clearly.

380
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,340
I will take your crown prince.

381
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,340
Xue Yuan, hurry up and stop.

382
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,340
If you don't stop, you will die.

383
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,340
Father.

384
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,340
Father.

385
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,340
Father.

386
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,340
Take a model to trick me.

387
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,340
Xue Yuan, hurry up and withdraw the troops.

388
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,340
Give the real crown prince out.

389
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:13,340
Otherwise, I will let Ye Changchang die.

390
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,340
My son is born to be rich.

391
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,340
He should die for the rich.

392
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,340
I will not let him die.

393
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,340
He should die for the rich.

394
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,340
He is the one who will be the king.

395
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,340
Father.

396
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,340
Father.

397
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,340
Father.

398
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,340
Father.

399
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,340
Father.

400
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,340
Father.

401
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,340
Father.

402
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,340
Are you all right?

403
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,340
No colour on the face.

404
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,340
You are a good person.

405
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,340
You are a good person.

406
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,340
You don't know the truth.

407
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,340
You are always careful in the palace.

408
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,340
I think you are smart.

409
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,340
How can you even die today?

410
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,340
Do you remember what I told you when you just entered the palace?

411
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,340
You should let the students listen to you.

412
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,340
Don't make you angry.

413
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,340
If it's not me,

414
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,340
you will die many times.

415
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,340
Ning'er,

416
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,340
you care so much about Zhang Zhe.

417
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,340
You care about the compensation for him.

418
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,340
I...

419
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,340
Speak!

420
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,340
You are not a mute.

421
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,340
Why do you think it's his business?

422
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,340
You pretend to be mute.

423
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,340
The students want to listen to you.

424
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,340
But you...

425
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:10,340
You dare to say that you have never thought about killing Lord Zhang?

426
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,340
You have a connection with the opposition.

427
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,340
You started with the attack of the Palace of Justice.

428
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,340
You are in the layout.

429
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,340
Step by step,

430
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,340
everyone is your Ma Qiancun.

431
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,340
You can stop them at any time.

432
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,340
You kill people and kill them.

433
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,340
Then you tell me,

434
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,340
who did I use?

435
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,340
You used Lord Zhang's investigation.

436
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,340
You used Xiaobao's blood to make the plan.

437
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,340
You used Fengming and the new five soldiers.

438
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,340
You used the Yan Army to fulfill your plan.

439
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,340
You even asked me to enter the palace.

440
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,340
Did you want to use me to save the Yan Army?

441
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,340
Shut up!

442
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,340
Everything is in my eyes.

443
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,340
I have to believe it.

444
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,340
The students are timid.

445
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,340
I didn't want to be involved with you.

446
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,340
You have been so angry all the way.

447
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,340
I never saw you.

448
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,340
But even so,

449
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,340
I still think that you are a good person.

450
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,340
If you are a good person,

451
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,340
you can't kill innocent people.

452
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,340
Jiang Xuanning, listen to me.

453
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,340
Zhang Zhe is a good person.

454
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,340
But I am not a good person.

455
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,340
Ning'er, you remember.

456
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,340
In this world,

457
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,340
what should be killed is bad.

458
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,340
It's stupid.

459
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,340
You can't keep it.

460
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,340
But you are willing to live with me.

461
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,340
You are already by my side.

462
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,340
If there is another time,

463
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,340
you will ruin my good thing in the prison.

464
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,340
I will take your life first.

465
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,340
Sir.

466
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,340
Go.

467
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,340
Go.

468
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,340
Sir.

469
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,340
How do you feel?

470
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,340
Sir.

471
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,340
Sir, the poison is too deep.

472
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,340
The medicine is not full.

473
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,340
We should go back to the capital.

474
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,340
I will go to another way to check the way down.

475
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,340
Maybe I still hope to leave here in advance.

476
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,340
As long as I tell General Ye Liu,

477
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,340
he will definitely agree with us to go back to the capital.

478
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,340
Don't worry, sir.

479
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,340
I can't wait.

480
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,340
You go to find some real medicine.

481
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,340
But sir,

482
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,340
your body...

483
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,340
Go.

484
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,340
I will go to the capital.

485
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,340
I will go to the capital.

486
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,340
Sir, your body...

487
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,340
Go and ask.

488
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,340
Yes.

489
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,340
If it's not me,

490
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,340
you will die in the prison.

491
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,340
You care so much about this.

492
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,340
You care about the medicine for him.

493
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,340
You are so impulsive.

494
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,340
Today, I am in danger.

495
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,340
Miss Shi gave me a life-long drink.

496
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,340
I am willing to die in the palace.

497
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,340
Miss Shi is willing to die.

498
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:22,340
But I don't think it's right for you.

499
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,340
What do you think of me now?

500
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,340
Is it because I was poor and I have no money?

501
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:37,340
Or is it because I am so emotional?

502
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,340
Think about it carefully.

503
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,340
The way you walked here,

504
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:43,340
there are many things that have not changed.

505
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,340
If I were with Zhang Zhai,

506
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,340
wouldn't I be in trouble again?

507
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,340
There is something that Xie Wei Dao did not say wrong.

508
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,340
If it's not him who is in a hurry to arrive,

509
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,340
it's not just me.

510
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,340
I am afraid that everyone will be embarrassed.

511
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,340
Or I should go to the prison.

512
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,340
After all, I lost my life.

513
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:10,340
After all, I am still happy.

514
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,340
Mr. Lv said that the capital is a bit safe.

515
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,340
Chen Yin has already said that the news about the passage is a memorial.

516
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,340
It will not be uploaded on the news.

517
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,340
Jiang Shang Shu visited Xie Fu a day ago.

518
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,340
He said...

519
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,340
What did he say?

520
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,340
He said when Miss Jiang Er will return to the capital,

521
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,340
he will give Miss Jiang Er a birthday gift.

522
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,340
He will see the year-end of the year.

523
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,340
He will ask if he can return to the capital.

524
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,340
The mountain road is blocked.

525
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,340
He will definitely not return to the capital.

526
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,340
That's right.

527
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,340
When the mountain road is blocked,

528
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,340
he will return home to make up for it.

529
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,340
Sir, can I come in?

530
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,340
Come in.

531
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,340
What is it?

532
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,340
I said something that I shouldn't have said yesterday.

533
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,340
I was angry and came to apologize.

534
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:10,340
It's not my intention to interfere in the communication.

535
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,340
But I caused you a lot of trouble.

536
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,340
I was wrong.

537
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,340
You know you are in trouble.

538
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,340
You have broken my body.

539
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,340
How could you do that?

540
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,340
It's cold today.

541
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,340
Please don't go out.

542
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,340
It's the most important thing to take care of your body.

543
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,340
I have my own body.

544
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,340
I have my own number.

545
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,340
Besides,

546
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,340
is there anything else?

547
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,340
Then I will remind you for your father.

548
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,340
Now the people in the temple are all involved.

549
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,340
Take your heart and mind.

550
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,340
If you still have half of your body,

551
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,340
don't make trouble again.

552
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,340
I understand.

553
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,340
The Yan Army is still in the way.

554
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,340
If you need anything in your life,

555
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,340
go to the newspaper.

556
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,340
Sir.

557
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,340
Who is it?

558
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,340
The guy crab looks good.

559
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,340
I think I need to go.

560
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,340
I want to see him.

561
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,340
I mean,

562
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,340
master Xu Ding...

563
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,340
Getting시에 bought to the convention hall.

564
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,340
To get theмосher.

565
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,180
Mr. Zhang.

566
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,740
General Yan,

567
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,300
what happened?

568
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,540
I heard that you're in a bad mood.

569
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:35,260
I have something to ask you.

570
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,220
What is it?

571
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,660
Please help me

572
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,340
to find out the truth about the military force

573
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,340
of Tongzhou.

574
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,540
And give me a light sign.

575
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:47,660
Deliver a whats Visharm.

576
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:54,260
Excuse me.

577
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,420
We need to full-eron our letter.

578
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,620
It's coming.

579
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:04,540
You want City Ranger Jiang is the man.

580
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,140
Xia Jun'an used to

581
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,700
後來 就不像這種 你小事

582
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,900
可深入感料有人有關心啊

583
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,100
This kind of spirit

584
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,100
is still thinking of giving Miss a birthday present.

585
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:13,980
It's not normal.

586
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,860
It's absolutely not normal.

587
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,260
Is it...

588
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,900
There are many formalities outside.

589
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,500
But which one can you teach?

590
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,820
Now, the official's house is in a mess.

591
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,900
This one is just a small one.

592
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,700
You can just prepare it as you like.

593
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,540
If it's not convenient, then...

594
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,220
It's convenient? Why not?

595
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,460
The dog thief in the official's house

596
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,380
left a lot of things in the official's house.

597
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,220
He only wants to make fun of it.

598
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,100
How about this? Let's split up.

599
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,060
You prepare the wine.

600
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,580
I'll treat you to a toast.

601
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,780
Since it's a birthday present,

602
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,900
I'll prepare some presents

603
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,860
to send to Miss.

604
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,380
Go ahead.

605
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,460
I'll prepare some presents too.

606
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,620
Xue Dingfei.

607
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,940
I asked you about your last time.

608
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,460
How did you think about it?

609
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:04,460
I've thought about it myself.

610
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,100
I think it makes sense.

611
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,340
I can only trust you

612
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,980
if it's done.

613
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,300
After you return,

614
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,220
I'll take your money.

615
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,660
Anyway, to me,

616
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,180
as long as I can live,

617
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,660
I'll do anything.

618
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,340
Go to work.

619
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,340
Okay.

620
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,060
Miss You San,

621
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,020
I'm sorry to make you wait.

622
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,020
Of course.

623
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,740
Why don't you take a look at this?

624
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,180
I've worked hard to get some connections this time.

625
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,180
Please let me write it myself.

626
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,140
What are you talking about?

627
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,460
It's like the previous show.

628
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,980
We're all people with a head and a face.

629
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:53,660
Please let my daughter out right now.

630
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,660
The Duke is not in the capital today.

631
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,340
I can't be the master.

632
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,780
Do you think if the Duke knows

633
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,340
that you've been lying to me

634
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,180
about the silver grain in my house,

635
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:08,100
you can't be the master.

636
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,180
Please follow me.

637
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,420
Mr. Zhou.

638
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,420
Little brother.

639
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,980
Is Mr. Xie in the house?

640
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,140
Of course not.

641
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,900
Have you told me that you've been back for a while?

642
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,660
I have something to tell you.

643
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,100
We don't know if you haven't told us.

644
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,780
How about you tell me

645
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,780
about Miss You Fang Yin?

646
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,460
You should go now.

647
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,660
Don't stay here.

648
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:43,860
I heard you mention You Fang Yin.

649
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,140
What happened?

650
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,260
Since you knew that there was a problem in the guards,

651
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,460
why didn't you tell the emperor directly?

652
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,700
In that period,

653
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,900
the Marquis's Mansion was in a state of blood.

654
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,180
It was in the seal of the treasonous party.

655
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,540
Even if you went up,

656
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:04,140
how could His Majesty believe it?

657
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,940
Duke Ding has been with me for a long time.

658
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,500
He must have prepared for it.

659
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,700
If there's no evidence,

660
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,460
he will be punished by the court.

661
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,660
I'm afraid he will be burned to death.

662
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,700
Is there any witness in the military?

663
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,540
The witness is dead.

664
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,420
But the records are still there.

665
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,500
When the mountain road is fixed,

666
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,340
I can get it for you.

667
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,620
Okay.

668
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,540
Mr. Zhang, you promised.

669
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:31,180
About the seal of the treasonous party,

670
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,940
I still have a doubt.

671
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:37,700
You want to know about the matter of Duke Ding?

672
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:42,100
Twenty years ago, I didn't follow you.

673
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,780
I don't know what happened.

674
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:47,860
You rarely mention the incident.

675
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,100
What I know,

676
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,180
it's the same as what you know.

677
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,860
If the witness is really Duke Ding,

678
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:57,380
you will be happy to know.

679
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,980
I have another question.

680
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,860
Please tell me what happened.

681
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,460
You came to me today.

682
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,780
Is it the arrangement of Xie Shao?

683
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,380
Xie Shao has been in the capital for Yan.

684
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:12,980
He wants the Marquis to come back soon.

685
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,460
Please don't worry.

686
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,740
Since it's a deal,

687
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,500
I will investigate it.

688
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,660
I want to tell you something.

689
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:23,540
I won't report it to you.

690
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,820
I'm worried about the Xie family.

691
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,660
Please take care of it.

692
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,780
Don't do anything that makes people suspicious.

693
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,180
Thank you, Your Excellency.

694
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,700
How is it? Do you like it?

695
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,180
These are all collected from the Shangqing Temple.

696
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,060
Although they are not good,

697
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,700
no one has used them.

698
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,180
It's hard to find them.

699
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,460
Why did you send me these?

700
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,220
Aren't they going to your birthday soon?

701
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,020
How could you?

702
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,540
You told me to prepare them.

703
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,940
I was so angry that I thanked you.

704
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,740
But I don't like birthday presents.

705
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,700
You should take these back.

706
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,060
You don't like them.

707
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,660
I'll find something else.

708
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,700
Don't worry.

709
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,020
I'm not being polite to you.

710
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,500
Although I'm not different from Zhang Zhe,

711
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,140
he is a good official.

712
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:26,020
He knows that he will investigate the matter.

713
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,660
Now, the court is full of people.

714
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,940
They are afraid of the Duke Ding's power.

715
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,940
There are few people like him.

716
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,100
If I have any inconvenience,

717
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,620
I can ask him to help me.

718
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,420
You are so clever.

719
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,740
You are so smart.

720
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,900
If you two can be together,

721
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,740
you will be a perfect match.

722
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,980
It's a pity that we are different.

723
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,460
We can't be together.

724
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,500
We are too same.

725
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,580
We can't be together.

726
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:02,980
What's wrong?

727
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,020
Miss Jiang said that she doesn't want to celebrate birthday.

728
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,780
She didn't get any presents.

729
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,260
Sir, what should we do?

730
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,660
You don't have to.

731
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,500
Don't forget to take them all.

732
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,940
Miss Jiang,

733
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:31,140
you are so kind.

734
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,500
If it weren't for the difficulties in the family,

735
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,580
you wouldn't have been left here.

736
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,860
Good boy, are you hungry?

737
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,820
I asked the kitchen to make you a dish.

738
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,500
I don't know what you like to eat.

739
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,100
Come, try it.

740
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,780
Thank you for your concern.

741
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,580
I just don't know

742
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:55,660
why I came back from the middle of the family.

743
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:58,780
It's about your life.

744
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,420
I am your aunt.

745
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,580
Now you are older.

746
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:06,180
I have to make a plan for you.

747
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,060
Now, there is a good marriage.

748
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,780
I will give it to you.

749
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:14,740
You will be mad if you fly up the roof.

750
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,300
Why do you want me to marry you?

751
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:20,020
What kind of person is she?

752
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,620
How dare you!

753
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,820
How can a girl ask about this?

754
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,540
I will take care of the rest.

755
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,300
You can just be at ease.

756
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,260
The marriage was done by my parents.

757
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,780
But Fang Yin has been in the prison.

758
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,220
She will be mad if she goes back.

759
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,700
She will be embarrassed by the family.

760
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,340
She will be embarrassed by her parents.

761
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,180
That's good.

762
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,940
I will talk to Duke Ding and you.

763
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,340
As long as you don't tell me,

764
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,580
I will not tell anyone.

765
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,660
But I am low-key.

766
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,700
I am stupid.

767
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,220
You are so useless.

768
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,260
You just want to talk.

769
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,340
Lord Li is a good person.

770
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,860
He is young and has a lot of skills.

771
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,260
If you can give him a son,

772
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,940
you will be the future wife.

773
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,180
What else can you do?

774
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,500
But Lord Yonghou, Lord Li.

775
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,300
Exactly.

776
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,940
He has a second-class concubine.

777
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,180
What can he do?

778
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,820
You are so good-looking.

779
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,220
You are still jealous of him.

780
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,300
Enough.

781
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,140
Let me tell you the truth.

782
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,340
Your father has a business.

783
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,860
Lord Li is willing to marry you.

784
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,260
That's your blessing.

785
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,660
I won't talk to you about it.

786
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,980
If you are good-looking,

787
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,820
I will give you more dowry.

788
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:38,420
If you dare to give me other ideas,

789
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:41,180
I will punish you.

790
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,620
Boss.

791
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,620
How is it?

792
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,020
I found out from the business meeting

793
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,820
that the mansion bought a lot of wedding items.

794
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,220
The mansion is closed and the money is returned.

795
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,220
Is it for marriage?

796
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,820
That's impossible.

797
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,940
I heard that

798
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,420
the company owes a lot of debts.

799
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,180
That's why they want to kick the daughter out.

800
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:11,180
It's just that the Lord Li of the family in the city

801
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,820
has been in a long time.

802
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,580
They want to find a daughter

803
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,060
who is a high-ranking householder

804
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,260
to build a house.

805
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,420
These two are a good match.

806
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,660
Old man is usually good-looking.

807
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,460
He can be a father.

808
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,380
I'm afraid that the person he wants to marry is a concubine.

809
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,740
They can't bear to have a daughter.

810
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,580
They come back to rent a room.

811
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,780
There are no two-headed dogs.

812
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,780
They only look for a girl to harm them.

813
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,580
They are so generous.

814
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,460
How about this?

815
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,500
Go prepare some wedding gifts.

816
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,780
You can look at the fortune-telling.

817
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,060
Send them to the family of the You family.

818
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,260
Yes.

819
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,860
Boss Lv, you are so good-looking.

820
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:06,540
We are willing to do business with you.

821
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,980
After all, we are a country.

822
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,580
Yes.

823
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:13,260
But if Boss Lv is sincere in selling us,

824
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,860
he can give you some opportunities.

825
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,740
You are right.

826
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:22,260
I have been lucky to be able to enter the grand gate of the manor.

827
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,020
I will not be surprised by the small gifts.

828
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,300
I will give you some gifts in the future.

829
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,900
I will also send them to you.

830
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,260
Good.

831
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,620
I have a little trouble.

832
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,580
Can I go to the convenience store?

833
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,380
Convenience store?

834
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:38,940
�

835
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,620
Yes.

836
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,260
Get up.

837
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,420
What did you do to be so heavy?

838
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,620
It must be inside your alarm.

839
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,700
In your imagination,

840
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,620
you established a strong contract with me.

841
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,620
In this country,

842
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,540
I love you.

843
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,540
What's this?

844
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,820
I'm not ruined.

845
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,440
How about the new- После 23025?

846
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,760
Leave the money alone.

847
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,760
Take it or leave the hole alone.

848
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,340
Please spare my life.

849
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,440
I'm doomed.

850
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,120
Let me travel to Huay Mix House.

851
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,400
I'll have enough time to take a rest differently.

852
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,640
Miss Sui.

853
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,880
Miss Sui?

854
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,880
I don't want to.

855
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,880
Do you know how to be a pervert?

856
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,880
Can you promise me now?

857
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,880
Are you going to regret it?

858
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,880
No.

859
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,880
Boss Lv is good at acting.

860
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,880
I don't want to lie to you.

861
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,880
This marriage is a competition.

862
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,880
I don't want to drag you down.

863
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,880
I've been in business for so many years.

864
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,880
I've been in business for so many years.

865
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,880
I've been in business for so many years.

866
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,880
I've seen people like you before.

867
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,880
I've never seen you like this.

868
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,880
Forget it.

869
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,880
It's a good thing.

870
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,880
How about this?

871
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,880
I'll teach you a way.

872
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,880
Come here.

873
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,880
Let me tell you.

874
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,880
You're like this.

875
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,880
I've seen you like this.

876
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,880
But I don't want to lie to you.

877
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,880
I don't want to lie to you.

878
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,880
I don't want to lie to you.

879
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:08,420
She told you that she cares Однако because her uncle is into the teacher's work.

880
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,920
Fortunately, when the Evilственnes complaints against her

881
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,340
as a tutor, she is not only free,

882
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,620
but also a student isolation segment.

883
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,520
By the way,

884
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,400
don't you dare try to play around!

885
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,320
Don't get in the trouble.

886
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,680
You are so stubborn this business.

887
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,520
Behave yourself earlier.

888
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:30,080
I am afraid you might have available a way to worse the future in scores in the market,

889
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,880
so you need to be assembly-minded.

890
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,880
You're not going to celebrate your birthday?

891
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,080
Are you not thinking about

892
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,280
the place where the temple is too small?

893
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,680
There's nothing to be proud of.

894
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,880
It has nothing to do with it.

895
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,080
I just thought of some net affairs.

896
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,080
This world is not for everyone's birthday.

897
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,480
It's worth celebrating.

898
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,080
When I was in the capital,

899
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,880
I was always with Yen Ling.

900
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,080
Now that she's gone,

901
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,680
there's nothing to be proud of.

902
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,080
That's the case.

903
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,080
This year's birthday should be celebrated.

904
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,280
Yen Shizi has passed away.

905
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,480
I hope you can live a happy life.

906
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,880
You should do as she wishes.

907
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,080
Only then can you make her feel at ease.

908
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,280
Yes.

909
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,680
What Master Zhang said is true.

910
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,880
What did your birthday say to the others?

911
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,680
Moreover,

912
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,080
you were in the capital for a long time.

913
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,680
It's just that kind of thing.

914
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,680
You must have never experienced the temple.

915
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,680
Now,

916
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,480
we're in Tongzhou.

917
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,680
We're doing business.

918
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,680
We don't have wine and wine.

919
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,480
You should believe me.

920
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,280
Don't you have any sense of taste?

921
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,680
Finally, I've had enough.

922
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,080
I'm going to die of boredom.

923
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,080
Go.

924
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,880
Go.

925
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,080
I thought I'd let go of the best choice

926
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:39,080
of memories.

927
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,880

00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,480

00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:52,280
But I'm floating in the snow.

930
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,280
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
