1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
As long as I can enter the Ning'an Palace

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,200
and pay all the price

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,600
I will be willing to do so.

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,400
The End

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,800
The End

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,800
Everything seems to be a dream.

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,400
I have owed a lot of people.

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,800
Chaozhe, help me.

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,600
I will be a good person after this.

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
The End

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
I will be the one to take the favor.

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,800
There are some things you can't give me.

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
But what about them?

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,000
The life you chose is for Mr. You.

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,400
In this world, everyone has the right to escape.

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,000
But I can't.

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,000
I want to regret it.

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,400
I will do my best to return.

20
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,400
Does Mr. Zhang believe that everything is decided?

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,200
I would rather believe in the future.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,200
Congratulations, Your Highness.

23
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,000
Congratulations, Your Highness.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,400
We are all in the same boat.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,200
Ning'an, what are you doing?

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,200
In the end,

27
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,800
there is a pair of invisible hands

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,800
that will break everything.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,600
The revenge is long.

30
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,800
Who are you?

31
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,800
The Emperor of the mortal world is so long-winded.

32
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,600
The world is so desolate.

33
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,600
The End

34
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Episode 19

35
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,600
You are so smart.

36
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,600
It's a pity that you miss it.

37
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,600
You are so clever.

38
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,400
What do you want to do?

39
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
I should ask you this question.

40
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,800
Miss You, how could you hit someone?

41
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
The fifth generation of the folding door.

42
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,400
Who doesn't love?

43
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,800
Samsung Galaxy Z series.

44
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,200
Folding mobile phone, Ning'an is like a dream.

45
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,400
If you are hungry, eat good-hearted bread.

46
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,200
Good-hearted bread, Ning'an is like a dream.

47
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,600
No experience, only a cup.

48
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Use the treasure.

49
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,400
The good-hearted treasure, Ning'an is like a dream.

50
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Miss Jiang,

51
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,800
it's not easy to repair the jade vase.

52
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,800
If you want to play,

53
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,800
please go to other places.

54
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
But I'm sorry to bother you.

55
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,800
I'll just stand by and watch.

56
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
Let's have a look.

57
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,800
See if there's anything you want to buy.

58
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
This is good.

59
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,800
Boss,

60
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,800
you are too sweet.

61
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,800
Do you have any sweet?

62
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,800
Try this one.

63
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
Does Mr. Zhang come here often?

64
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
I'm not interested in the ancient Anjia.

65
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,800
I'm just free and peaceful.

66
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
I rely on my mother to make a living for me.

67
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
I'm learning the words of the book.

68
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
If I repair it here,

69
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
I can get rid of the silk.

70
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,800
I can get rid of the silk.

71
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,800
I can get rid of the silk.

72
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,800
I have many tools in my house.

73
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
I can ask my father to come.

74
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
I didn't mean to offend you.

75
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
I'm just free and peaceful.

76
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
I want to learn the craftsmanship.

77
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,800
I can't ask others.

78
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
If you come,

79
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
I can ask you to come.

80
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Miss Jiang likes this too?

81
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Yes, I do.

82
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
I used to like it.

83
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
I didn't like it.

84
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
I can like it in the future.

85
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
I'm not a liar.

86
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
Jiang Xie Ning.

87
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
What are you doing?

88
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
Stop.

89
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Zhang Zhen.

90
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
I've been looking for you these days.

91
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
I've also given you several cards.

92
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800
I don't mind if you don't reply me.

93
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
What do you mean?

94
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
Is this your man?

95
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,800
Miss Yao, you misunderstood.

96
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
I just met Mr. Zhang here.

97
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,800
It's not him.

98
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
Shut up.

99
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,800
If I didn't see it today,

100
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
I would have wronged you.

101
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
How did you tell me in the palace?

102
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,800
What did you do?

103
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
You're so calm.

104
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
You're so calm.

105
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
You're so shameless.

106
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
You're so shameless.

107
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
What's the matter

108
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
with you?

109
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,800
I just want to explain it to you.

110
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,800
Those messages are from someone else.

111
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
They want to make a fuss between you and me.

112
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,800
No one wants to make a fuss.

113
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
You're lying.

114
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
If Jiang Xie Ning told you something,

115
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
why did you come to the palace

116
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
after you said it in the palace?

117
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
If you don't like it

118
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,800
because of me,

119
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
I want to apologize to you.

120
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,800
I just never wanted to marry you.

121
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
All these things are because of you.

122
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
You're so heartless.

123
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
You want to marry me.

124
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
That's all.

125
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Please don't misunderstand me.

126
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
Don't make a fuss

127
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
and make me feel innocent.

128
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
Chengzhe,

129
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
why did you treat me like this?

130
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
I'm leaving.

131
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
Miss Jiang,

132
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
you haven't recovered your health.

133
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
All right.

134
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
I've seen you before.

135
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
You should be dead.

136
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
Don't cry here.

137
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,800
You're making me laugh.

138
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Mr. Zhang.

139
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Mr. Zhang.

140
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
Mr. Zhang and Yao Jia are getting married.

141
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
I really understand.

142
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
Are you trying to persuade me?

143
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
I have something to interfere with.

144
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,800
As long as you don't regret it.

145
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
This portrait

146
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
is the book of the Fan's Family.

147
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
When I first came to the capital,

148
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
I only had a house

149
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,800
with my mother's apartment.

150
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
Until I broke

151
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
the 42 cases in the Ministry of Justice,

152
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,800
I had to live in this house.

153
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Mr. Zhang has no family.

154
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
He has a few talents.

155
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,800
If he's not married because of his birth,

156
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
he's not.

157
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
The family of the Jin's family

158
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
is full of joy,

159
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
joy,

160
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
and love.

161
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,800
I don't like it at all.

162
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,800
I don't like the marriage between

163
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
the two of you.

164
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
If you marry Miss Yao,

165
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
you'll have a good relationship.

166
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,800
Why do you want to hurt her?

167
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
Well,

168
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
if there's a woman

169
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
who doesn't like these things,

170
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
it's just that you're in the same situation.

171
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
Can't you do that?

172
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
Maybe.

173
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,800
I can.

174
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,800
I'm just going to marry Miss Yao.

175
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,800
It has nothing to do with Miss Jiang.

176
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
Don't worry.

177
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
It's late.

178
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Please go back.

179
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,800
Be safe on the way.

180
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,800
Zheng Zhe,

181
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,800
I'm not the empress this time.

182
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,800
I'm a good person.

183
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Can we be together?

184
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
Boss Lv,

185
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,800
did Ying Zimei come back?

186
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
She's been in the same position

187
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
since yesterday.

188
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
She went back to the residence.

189
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,800
She said she was in a bad mood.

190
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
Who knows what she's doing?

191
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
Boss Lv,

192
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
I think

193
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
there's still a chance

194
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
between people.

195
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,800
There's a chance.

196
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,800
People are always saying that

197
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
they've been in the same position for a hundred years.

198
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,800
Besides, we still have a contract.

199
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,800
Right?

200
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Once she wants to break up with someone,

201
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,800
what's the use of the contract?

202
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
I've sent someone

203
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
to look after the place.

204
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
If she dares to act like a flower,

205
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,800
I'll kill her.

206
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
I'll kill her.

207
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
But,

208
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
tell me honestly.

209
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,800
Why did Jiang Xuening

210
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
invest money in the eyes of business?

211
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
Could it be

212
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,800
some kind of internal news?

213
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,800
I don't know.

214
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,800
You're confused, right?

215
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Fine.

216
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,800
I understand.

217
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
How about this?

218
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
You can open a box for me.

219
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,800
You can tell me

220
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
what she's going to say to you.

221
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
You can tell me.

222
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,800
We're all from the market.

223
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
I understand.

224
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,800
How can you do that?

225
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,800
You trust me so much.

226
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,800
I can't betray her.

227
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,800
That's not enough.

228
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
Don't talk too much.

229
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
I can give you

230
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
a hundred taels.

231
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Why are you turning your face when you're talking?

232
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
You have something to say.

233
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
Say it.

234
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,800
Hong Pei.

235
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,800
You didn't think about it.

236
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,800
I don't have

237
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
any customers in this shop.

238
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,800
I just got back from the spring.

239
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
His Highness was so angry.

240
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
I was so scared that I had to run home.

241
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,800
You're finally back.

242
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,800
I'm afraid you forgot me

243
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,800
a few days ago.

244
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
Why are you so cold-hearted?

245
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
I brought you

246
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
some delicious and fun food.

247
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
And you forgot

248
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
that you can't forget me?

249
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,120
If you're so cruel,

250
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,000
I'll bring you delicious and fun food.

251
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,040
Don't forget to forget me.

252
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,240
Piyang,

253
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,080
I like it the most.

254
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,280
Please take care of me.

255
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,880
Let's go.

256
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
You all can leave.

257
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,480
Yes.

258
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,560
Your Highness,

259
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,560
I'm not here for nothing.

260
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,600
I have something to ask you.

261
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,400
What do you mean?

262
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,320
Did I make you feel bad for not taking care of me?

263
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,440
I was scared to death.

264
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,320
I made you feel bad.

265
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,480
No.

266
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,800
But I still have a plan

267
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,400
for the last time.

268
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,920
My family said

269
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,880
I was not a high-ranking emperor since I was a child.

270
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,120
I didn't deserve to stay in the palace.

271
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,920
I just hope you can order me to leave.

272
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,560
You want to leave?

273
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,480
Ningning,

274
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,800
I'm so kind to you.

275
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,000
Why do you want to leave?

276
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,000
What should I do if you leave?

277
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,840
Your Highness, you're so noble.

278
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,720
You don't need me.

279
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,320
No.

280
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,160
Don't think about it.

281
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,840
Change one.

282
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,040
All right.

283
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,160
Well...

284
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,000
Your Highness knows

285
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,560
I really don't like to play the piano.

286
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,160
Can you do something

287
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,000
that can help me

288
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,800
to get rid of the thing about playing the piano?

289
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,320
I'm talking about Zhao Ge Lian Qin.

290
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,320
But Mr. Xie

291
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,760
made a mistake in person.

292
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,960
Are you afraid of him?

293
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
How could I?

294
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,280
I'm a princess.

295
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,720
I'm afraid of Mr. Xie.

296
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,440
I was talking to Yan family

297
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,680
the other day.

298
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,680
I was upset because I was upset.

299
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,920
If I'm even a liar,

300
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,320
I can't do this.

301
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,400
Change one.

302
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,560
No.

303
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,120
Think about it.

304
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,760
Change one.

305
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,080
I'll definitely agree to it.

306
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,840
Then please

307
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,560
let me see your daughter-in-law.

308
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,080
She's the one who's taking care of you.

309
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,720
I'm sure the family can be at ease.

310
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,080
No problem. I'll agree.

311
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,600
It's just a half-do.

312
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,480
It's not a big deal.

313
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,360
Thank you, Your Highness.

314
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,320
These are all given by you.

315
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,040
It's so beautiful.

316
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,920
Sister Jiang.

317
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,440
Your Highness is so nice to you.

318
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,880
I'm so envious.

319
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,120
Your Highness is the same

320
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,360
to all of us.

321
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,160
I've won some awards today.

322
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,600
It's your turn.

323
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,280
Don't forget me.

324
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,560
It's too expensive.

325
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,480
Take it.

326
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,680
This is also so beautiful.

327
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,880
It's not a treasure.

328
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,920
It's just a common reward.

329
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,560
It's worth your pride.

330
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,480
I used to think that

331
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,520
the more stupid I am,

332
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,520
I can't get past Jiang Xue Ning.

333
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,520
Now I see her as a liar.

334
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,080
I can't figure out

335
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,520
why everyone is like her.

336
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,440
We're different from her.

337
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,080
We can't learn

338
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,520
her mischievous attitude.

339
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,320
This is for your dad.

340
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,440
It's just that

341
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,760
she's a person of color.

342
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,880
We'll understand

343
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,640
sooner or later.

344
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,640
I can't get married now.

345
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,000
Uncle,

346
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,800
you've been looking for me for months.

347
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,720
You don't have any words at home?

348
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,800
I...

349
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,240
I'm just a senior.

350
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,240
I'm not good at tea.

351
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,720
Why do you suddenly want to steal my wife?

352
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,120
Are you playing with me?

353
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,920
Why do you want to steal my wife?

354
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,960
Brother Wang, you don't know that, do you?

355
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,120
I was called here

356
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,840
because of you.

357
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,480
Alright.

358
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,920
Don't just chat with me here.

359
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,320
Just go play.

360
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,040
I'm not good at playing with you.

361
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,160
It's okay if you're not good at playing with me.

362
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,000
We have a good friend here.

363
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,880
Jian Er,

364
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,040
take your uncle and sister to play with you.

365
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,920
Don't bully her.

366
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,320
You stay here.

367
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,340
Back to your position.

368
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,920
Maybe I can play with him again.

369
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,200
I clearly don't want to go anywhere.

370
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,360
I'll let you two go so you can rest and rest.

371
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,680
I love you!

372
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,480
I know you're well.

373
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,800
In this situation.

374
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,040
Ourmbforth,

375
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,400
soon we'll fight.

376
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,360
I'll play around.

377
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,760
Go ahead and play.

378
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,600
Oscar is no match for you.

379
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,760
I'm not that kind of person.

380
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,200
You really think so?

381
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,520
Your Highness also thinks that the blood family has a grudge against the Yan family.

382
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,520
The two families are not even happy.

383
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,920
I didn't mean that.

384
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,120
The family affairs can't be changed.

385
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,600
But at least I can control my heart.

386
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,720
I don't have any enemies against the Yan family.

387
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,600
I'm even more envious that he has his own heart.

388
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,520
It's hard for you to think so.

389
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,000
Aunt, there's a mistake.

390
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I don't like you.

391
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,320
But I'm also helpless.

392
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,880
I don't want you to be my brother.

393
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,880
But at least I don't want to be your burden.

394
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,120
Actually, it's not like that.

395
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,600
We know each other since we were little.

396
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,240
It's not like we're burdened by anything.

397
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,840
It's just that there are some things that are too strong.

398
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,600
It's really hard for people to be like that.

399
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,720
I've been wronged before.

400
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,720
Don't let it go.

401
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Aunt Su.

402
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's you.

403
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Aunt Su, this...

404
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
How did this lady enter the palace?

405
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
To answer your question,

406
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
the girl from the Qingyuan Manor suddenly got hungry and couldn't come to the capital.

407
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
She controlled the area with the help of the princess.

408
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
This lady is also the daughter of the general in the family.

409
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
She came to the palace to the capital.

410
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That's great.

411
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I mean,

412
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
as long as she likes to be warm, she will be very happy.

413
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You met her so soon?

414
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm afraid that Miss Xue Da is in a bad mood now.

415
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Sister Ning, why did you let me come to the palace?

416
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm the princess of the Lingzi King's position.

417
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm sure you have heard of it.

418
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Because of this handkerchief,

419
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I think Xue Shu Bao is your own handkerchief.

420
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I used the handkerchief that should have been on you

421
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
and used it on me.

422
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I don't want to carry this black pot for you.

423
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So I brought it here for you.

424
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Are you not angry?

425
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It's because I've taken you in.

426
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
To put it in words, I'm sorry to you.

427
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And after you found out the truth,

428
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
you can not tell me about your feelings.

429
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You can also tell Miss Xue directly.

430
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
But you didn't.

431
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You overestimated my feelings and arranged me to meet you.

432
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Why would I be angry?

433
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You're so self-conscious.

434
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm afraid that if you enter the palace,

435
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
you'll hate me again.

436
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I don't want to be a heartless person.

437
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Maybe I'll have to cut my back.

438
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Anyway, you chose the path yourself.

439
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
If you want to be the princess,

440
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
you have to be yourself.

441
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Okay, I'm tired.

442
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm done talking about what I should say.

443
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Please go back.

444
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
The last time I stole your voice,

445
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I won't owe you this time.

446
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
The doctor said that after drinking these two,

447
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
although it's a good medicine,

448
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
you still need to rest well and don't worry.

449
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I saw you were in the room and you were in the bathroom.

450
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
How could that be?

451
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Now it's your turn to get me involved.

452
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
These days, I'm not in the mood to do anything.

453
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I've been in the mood for two times.

454
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Later, Zhou Ying didn't know what to do.

455
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Now, I'm feeling much better.

456
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's Mr. Xie's side.

457
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I've asked you several times at night.

458
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'll report Mr. Xie's answer to you.

459
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Report!

460
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
My Lord, the Crown Prince.

461
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Li Yun Xuan has sent the invitation to the Crown Prince's court.

462
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
The official is checking the new weapons in front of the house.

463
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm here to ask.

464
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I don't know if these weapons are still working.

465
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Why not?

466
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
The Marquis's Mansion is in this state of light.

467
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Even if we send the weapons,

468
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
how many people will come?

469
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Why bother?

470
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Mr. Xie has taught me that

471
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
if you don't fight, you won't be able to see the people.

472
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Now that the Heavens has given us a chance to see the people,

473
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
why bother to let my father and I go?

474
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Go back to the house.

475
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
If the new guards don't allow the people to go out,

476
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
tell them that the emperor just wants Yan family to cooperate with the investigation.

477
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
He'll be in charge of the affairs and the principles.

478
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Ask them who dares to stop you.

479
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Yes.

480
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Mr. Zhang has passed away.

481
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
He must be talking to His Majesty.

482
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I wonder what he's up to.

483
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Do you still have the script to write?

484
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Your Majesty, I have the script.

485
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's not appropriate.

486
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Your Majesty,

487
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
there are already several days of the new guards in Yong Yi's Mansion.

488
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Now, the Yan family is in charge of the affairs.

489
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The case is closed.

490
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
The Ministry of Justice will be the one to decide.

491
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I ask His Majesty to order the new guards to approach the mansion.

492
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's better for me to hold the crown prince's official ceremony.

493
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Your Majesty,

494
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
the new guards are not going to be in charge of the affairs.

495
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Then the mansion of Yong Yi won't be able to be removed.

496
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Now, at this time,

497
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
what are you planning to do?

498
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
What's the reason?

499
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Your Majesty,

500
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
the Minister of State has made a point.

501
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
The case of the new guards is now closed.

502
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
But the Marquis's Mansion

503
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
is always closed.

504
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's hard for us to find out.

505
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
So you mean

506
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I stopped your case?

507
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm so impressed.

508
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I just think that

509
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
the crown prince's official is a big deal.

510
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
He can't wait.

511
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
If we delay the time,

512
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
we can't delay the time.

513
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Fine, fine.

514
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Isn't it just a ceremony?

515
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Just do it.

516
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
The new guards are guarding the entrance.

517
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
They can't find out the truth.

518
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
As for the case,

519
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I think you can find out

520
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
the truth by looking at the details.

521
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Zhang Zhe.

522
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I'm here.

523
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Before Gu Chunfang returns to the capital,

524
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
you still have the order.

525
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I'll give you the order.

526
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You'll investigate the six steps in the capital.

527
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You must give me an answer as soon as possible.

528
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

529
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,080
類雙激

530
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,500
Ms Xue, you're young

531
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,500
but you're very avowal.

532
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,080
Obviously there's a world

533
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,080
whereçandrible time waiting to come.

534
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,080
Thank you for your compliment.

535
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,080
Miss Jiang just came. She is not familiar with Ke Cheng.

536
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,080
I don't know her very well.

537
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,080
It's hard to say that she is not familiar with the deal.

538
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,080
Why don't you invite Miss Jiang to the scene?

539
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,080
Then please invite Miss Jiang to the scene.

540
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,080
Let's start.

541
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,080
Although Xue Hui is not good at music, she is more willing to take the chance.

542
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,080
I hope you and everyone can have a good time.

543
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,080
This is not good at music.

544
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,080
What should we do?

545
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,080
Ning Ning, it's really your sister.

546
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,080
Why don't you two be a little bit different?

547
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,080
Sister is always smart and kind.

548
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,080
I am not bad at it.

549
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,080
But we can only play with each other.

550
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,080
That's why we are so close.

551
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,080
No, no, no.

552
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,080
Miss Jiang is good at music.

553
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,080
She is so kind.

554
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,080
I can't say that she is not good at music.

555
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,080
It's a very good song.

556
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,080
You all should learn it.

557
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,080
Especially you, Miss Ning.

558
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,080
You know that you are more affectionate.

559
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,080
You should go back to prepare the basic music.

560
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,080
I want to draw tea.

561
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,080
Yes.

562
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,080
Miss Jiang.

563
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,080
Try it.

564
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,080
The peach cake my chef made is so delicious.

565
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,080
Thank you.

566
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,080
I said, Bao Ying.

567
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,080
How can you take out your treasure today?

568
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,080
Didn't you just give it to Xue Ning?

569
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,080
Then I like this, too.

570
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,080
Mr. Jiang.

571
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,080
No need to be so formal.

572
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,080
I just brought Qin Pu back to get it.

573
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,080
What are you waiting for?

574
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,080
Go ask Zhao Ge for love.

575
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,080
Then I will leave today.

576
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,080
I will give you a few pieces of paper.

577
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,080
I heard that Miss Jiang is talented.

578
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,080
I didn't expect that she is so good at this.

579
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,080
Compared to that Miss Jiang.

580
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,080
She is so good.

581
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,080
Miss Yao is over the moon.

582
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,080
I am a little worried for you.

583
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,080
You are the eldest daughter of the family.

584
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,080
I heard that you still have to bear the anger in the house.

585
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,080
You are bullied by her.

586
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,080
If I were you,

587
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,080
and I didn't learn to be so uneducated,

588
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,080
I would be so embarrassed to be a teacher.

589
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,080
Otherwise, the reputation of this dress

590
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,080
would be ruined.

591
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,080
Although my second sister is short of school,

592
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,080
she is far from being a teacher in the house.

593
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:19,080
Although my family is not as good as those high schools,

594
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,080
but the house management is strict.

595
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,080
If you have any mistakes,

596
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,080
please take care of your parents.

597
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,080
Why do you need to talk so much?

598
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,080
If Miss Yao has nothing to do,

599
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,080
I will leave first.

600
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,080
What a pity.

601
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,080
What are you saying?

602
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,080
I am a good-for-nothing.

603
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,080
I am just a piece of paper.

604
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,080
I am so sorry.

605
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,080
I don't care how you talk about your feelings.

606
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,080
I am just a piece of paper.

607
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,080
I am just a piece of paper.

608
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,080
I am just a piece of paper.

609
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,080
I am just a piece of paper.

610
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,080
I don't care how you talk about your feelings.

611
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,080
Come over and have a tea.

612
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,080
Use some snacks.

613
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,080
A peach cake?

614
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,080
The one from the Yushan House.

615
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,080
I don't like it.

616
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,080
I don't like sweet food.

617
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,080
The chef of the Bao Ying family is from the Yushan House.

618
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,080
He is also famous in the capital.

619
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,080
The peach cake from their family is too sweet.

620
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,080
The cooking skill of the Yushan House is almost the same.

621
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,080
It's better than your cooking skill.

622
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,080
You still remember it?

623
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:42,080
The Hero

624
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,040
The rabbit Vietnamese did not LIVE

625
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,440
I told everyone to leave.

626
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,840
And I ran into this wilderness.

627
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,240
Now I'm lost.

628
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,240
I can't go out.

629
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,280
I didn't eat or drink.

630
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,280
Eat.

631
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,320
Eat this.

632
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,240
Eat that.

633
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,600
Who made such tasty connecting hearts?

634
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,280
You won't face은 death any more.

635
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:44,280
I've forgotten I can never forget you.

636
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,280
Actually in the end, I still ate the rabbit.

637
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,200
In front of one could only choose what he hadn't loved,

638
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,120
but overnight, he would have been ousted.

639
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:11,120
The most real and maybe the ugliest side of the road.

640
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,120
I'm really afraid of death and I'm still very heartbroken.

641
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,120
By the way, sir, where did you buy that peach slice cake?

642
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,120
It tastes so good. I can't help but to say no more.

643
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,120
Sir, don't worry. I've already remembered the past.

644
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,120
Especially about you. I only remember the peach slice cake.

645
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,120
I forgot about it.

646
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,120
I won't make things difficult for you because of this.

647
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,120
By the way, the court today allowed the Yan family to hold a ceremony.

648
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,120
And let Zhang Zhe take over the case of the Yan family and you.

649
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,120
Mr. Zhang?

650
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,120
That's great.

651
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,120
If Mr. Zhang is here, he will definitely return the Yan family to his family.

652
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,120
Do you believe him that much?

653
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,120
I believe you.

654
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,120
The Xue family has just taken a step forward.

655
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,120
You can make them take the next step.

656
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:16,120
The court today is your first competition.

657
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,120
I admire you.

658
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,120
I hope there won't be any more waves in this ceremony.

659
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,120
There won't be.

660
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,120
Miss Ning'er, you're back.

661
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,120
How are you? Are you tired?

662
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,120
Do you want to have some tea?

663
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,120
Why did you suddenly call me Miss Ning'er?

664
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,120
We've discussed it.

665
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,120
Now we have two Miss Jiang.

666
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,120
We haven't made up our minds.

667
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,120
I'll call you Miss Ning'er.

668
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,120
Call me Miss Xie?

669
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,120
Don't you usually call me Miss Ning'er?

670
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,120
I know she calls me Ning'er.

671
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,120
But I don't know if she's your girlfriend.

672
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,120
I know she calls me Ning'er.

673
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,120
What's wrong with that?

674
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,120
But she's the only one who calls you Ning'er.

675
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,120
Only her?

676
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,120
Other people call her...

677
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,120
Right?

678
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,120
Look, we have called you Miss Jiang.

679
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,120
We have called you Xue Ning.

680
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,120
But only Mr. Xie calls you Miss Ning'er.

681
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,120
What's your name?

682
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,120
It's just a matter of time.

683
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,120
Just call me if you feel comfortable.

684
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,120
By the way, how's Lv Xian and Daoqing?

685
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,120
Everything is under your supervision.

686
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,120
That's good.

687
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,120
Be careful when you walk.

688
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,120
Sir, you're back.

689
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,120
I bought a new fish today.

690
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,120
And some glutinous rice and a set of walnuts.

691
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,120
You can try to make a peach cake.

692
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,120
Sir, what's the matter this morning?

693
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,120
Did you hear the teacher's lesson this morning?

694
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,120
My good sister got the questions right.

695
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,120
But he didn't say anything.

696
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,120
You didn't see Xue Shu's face.

697
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,120
You took so long.

698
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,120
You had to make a few jokes to make it work.

699
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,120
That's so funny.

700
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,120
Ning'er.

701
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,120
Have I been too harsh on you lately?

702
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:22,120
You should have said that to me.

703
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,120
I'm afraid that you can't do it.

704
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,120
I'm afraid that you can't do it either.

705
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,120
It's so hard for me to be a student.

706
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,120
Have you used the lunch box?

707
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,120
What time is it?

708
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,120
Of course I have.

709
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,120
Where's the light?

710
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,120
I've used it, too.

711
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,120
You don't like the light in the palace, do you?

712
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,120
I just got the feeling that I'm going to be idle.

713
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,120
I'm just going to be idle.

714
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,120
I'm just going to be idle.

715
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,120
I just got the feeling that I'm going to be idle.

716
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,120
I just ate a few bites.

717
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,120
Why?

718
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,120
You can't use the light in learning.

719
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,120
It's another lie.

720
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,120
It's made of honey.

721
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,120
It's not too sweet.

722
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,120
I don't like it.

723
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,120
It's delicious.

724
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,120
It's delicious.

725
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,120
It's sweet and not too sweet.

726
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,120
It has the taste of the past.

727
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,120
Sir, where did you buy it?

728
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,120
It's just in the palace.

729
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,120
I made it myself.

730
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,120
If you like it, you can take it all.

731
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,120
Thank you, sir.

732
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,120
Actually, there's one more thing.

733
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,120
I want to thank you, sir.

734
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,120
What is it?

735
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,120
When I was in the capital,

736
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,120
you were like the others.

737
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,120
I was like Jiang Er.

738
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,120
But after you disappeared for a long time,

739
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,120
you didn't call me Jiang Er.

740
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,120
You're called Ning Er.

741
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,120
I didn't notice that,

742
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:59,120
but now I've come back and I understand your meaning.

743
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,120
It's just a simple name.

744
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,120
What is it?

745
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,120
Jiang Xue Ning, Jiang Xue Hui,

746
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,120
Jiang is the family's surname.

747
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,120
Blood is the self-sacrifice of the rehearse.

748
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,120
Only this name

749
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,120
belongs to myself.

750
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,120
to my Про OC Notice visit

751
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,240
We meet there

752
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:18,880
company

753
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,360
So she indeed

754
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,840
comforts me

755
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:22,840
Really

756
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,720
YourDon's kindness

757
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,320
doesn't allow you

758
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,640
He was so upset

759
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,640
to take me as

760
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,080
others

761
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,840
I am not

762
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,720
Which Of your

763
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,920
do you like?

764
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,920
You used to be the only girl in my life.

765
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,920
You are the only girl in my life.

766
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,920
And now,

767
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,920
it's good to face the past.

768
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,920
But if we have to make it clear,

769
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,920
I think that the girl now

770
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,920
knows what she wants,

771
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,920
and it will be better.

772
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,920
It will be better in the future.

773
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,920
Can you understand

774
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,920
that you have no malicious intent

775
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,920
and no place for me?

776
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,920
Are you willing to be honest with me?

777
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,920
What else?

778
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,920
You and I have been like this all along.

779
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,920
Thank you, sir.

780
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,920
Don't worry, sir.

781
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,920
As long as you don't want to kill me,

782
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,920
I will listen to you.

783
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,920
Miss Xie Erwei,

784
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,920
you were even Be 어디 עלilong conversions you.

785
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,920
My dinner thinking this ends like this.

786
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,920
Are you putting the person

787
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,920
who asked you to hand in thisバイ記 something?

788
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,920
Place it here.

789
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,920
I will.

790
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,920
I'll make sure

791
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,000
to study on my master's physicaldegree.

792
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,920
You...

793
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,920
I won't return it to you.

794
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,920
I'll let you find the ring.

795
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,920
I'm afraid that no one can figure it out.

796
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,920
So I'm taking it out on you.

797
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,920
I've never been so stubborn to defeat Jiang Xue Ning

798
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,920
and even entered a Jiang Xue meeting.

799
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,920
So Ji Er is the one who's in charge of the new family.

800
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,920
What do you think I'm saying?

801
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,920
I'm sorry for my aunt's teaching.

802
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,920
I'm sorry for my aunt's teaching.

803
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,920
A few days ago,

804
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,920
His Majesty was busy with the Yan family's affairs.

805
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,920
Your father...

806
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,920
Now, we need to quickly

807
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,920
set Ji Er's status as the emperor.

808
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,920
So that we won't have many dreams.

809
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,920
Who's there?

810
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,920
I'll go and have a look.

811
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,920
The Ferryman

812
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,920
Hi, Sister Xue.

813
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,920
Sister Bao Ye.

814
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,920
Isn't this Sister Yao's pick?

815
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,920
Why does it come in your hands again?

816
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,920
This fragrant nang is not for Jiang Xue Ning.

817
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,200
Use all the horse's dung.

818
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,640
Are you kidding me?

819
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,440
Move!

820
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,320
Mister,

821
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,000
Mighty美女长,

822
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:08,640
your husband always

823
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,840
likes to take care of bowl owner.

824
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,400
Right?

825
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,240
Mom,

826
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,160
did you programming

827
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,520
do not support the drama firm?

828
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,280
company?

829
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:16,680
Senior,

830
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,600
It is my fault.

831
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,760
It was my fault as well,

832
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,960
First,

833
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,200
my daughter Head of Employee

834
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,440
expressed herself

835
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,840
Yao Xi deliberately left this in the garden

836
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,320
and wanted me to misunderstand you with Empress Dowager.

837
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:34,120
Didn't Miss Xue and Yao Xi grow up together?

838
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,600
You and Miss Jiang are also in the same team.

839
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,040
But I went to the court and found out that

840
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,960
you two are not close to each other.

841
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,360
You are more like enemies.

842
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,760
Even the first half of the poison was used to poison the palace.

843
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,640
You came here on your own.

844
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,880
Miss Jiang is a smart person.

845
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,200
There is no point in talking in front of a smart person.

846
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,120
I did the one in the paper jacket of Cha Chaoyang.

847
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,240
But it's not true to you.

848
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,640
I misunderstood you because of this year's investigation.

849
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,400
I feel a little guilty and uneasy.

850
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,600
Miss Xue is joking.

851
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,240
I may have misunderstood you,

852
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,120
but I lost my life.

853
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,360
I can't accept a hat like yours.

854
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,280
I know you don't want to forgive me easily.

855
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,440
But Miss Jiang is going to leave the palace soon.

856
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,840
Although I have to kill you,

857
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,280
I can't hurt you.

858
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,200
Besides, I have to deal with your sister.

859
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,320
If I want to take out the sincerity,

860
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,240
can this grudge be a little bit more?

861
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,000
Qi is not very good at it.

862
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,680
If you are against him,

863
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,640
you will have a good bone.

864
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,600
I don't like to have some small grudges around me.

865
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,160
It makes me feel sick.

866
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,000
Why don't I help you

867
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,440
to beat him up?

868
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,560
It's better to let you be close to him.

869
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,800
Thank you for your kindness, Miss Xue.

870
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,440
But I am not used to

871
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,320
being a good person.

872
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,160
I don't have the habit of being innocent.

873
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,840
I hope Miss Jiang can keep thinking like this.

874
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,880
But my sincerity will always be there.

875
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:26,960
Yes.

876
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:39,920
Fresht.

877
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,520
Xie Qing.

878
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,400
I told you not to come.

879
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,600
I have good news for you.

880
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:44,840
What we have in the capital

881
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,040
has some secrets schools.

882
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,440
I will never forget you

883
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,440
I will never forget you

884
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,440
I will never forget you

885
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,440
I will never forget you

886
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,440
I will never forget you

887
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,440
I will never forget you

888
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,440
I will never forget you

889
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,440
I will never forget you

890
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,440
I will never forget you

891
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,440
I will never forget you

892
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,440
I will never forget you

893
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,440
I will never forget you

894
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,440
I will never forget you

895
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,440
I will never forget you
