Okay.

172
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,640
Don't be angry. Don't be angry.

173
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,919
It's bad for the baby.

174
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,159
You're more important in my heart.

175
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,960
Tell her to leave. We don't want her here.

176
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:52,630
My Lady.

177
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,040
His Majesty saidâ€¦

178
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,090
I heard it.

179
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,880
Thank you, Eunuch Zheng.

180
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,310
I'll take my leave.

181
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,920
My Lady, the dessertsâ€¦

182
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,150
Do you think

183
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,710
there will still be room for you in the court

184
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,310
after Noble Consort Qin gives birth to an heir?

185
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,710
My Lord.

186
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,340
You guessed right.

187
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,420
She agreed to work on the inside

188
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,280
to help us.

189
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,630
First Young Lady can see what's at stake.

190
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,770
She needs someone to back her up in the court.

191
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,370
Working with us is a win-win.

192
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,770
She has no reason not to agree.

193
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,680
Zhang Zhe

194
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,240
will arrive in Yuzhou very soon.

195
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,700
If he can bring Xie Wei backâ€¦

196
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,670
Where is Zhou Yinzhi now?

197
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,850
I've sent for him.

198
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,080
He'll be here soon.

199
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,230
I'm Zhou Yinzhi.

200
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,300
Greetings, My Lord.

201
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,490
How is the investigation going?

202
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,120
My Lord,

203
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,550
I've conducted a thorough search in secret,

204
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,560
but Mr. Dingfei is nowhere to be found.

205
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,970
After making inquiries, I learned

206
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,220
that the last time he was seen,

207
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,150
he was in Cengxiao Restaurant.

208
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,330
That day,

209
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,860
some mysterious people from the south

210
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,910
went to Cengxiao Restaurant too.

211
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,140
No one knows why they were there.

212
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,210
So I suspect

213
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,970
that those people abducted Mr. Dingfei.

214
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,170
My Lord, don't worry.

215
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,150
I'll do my best

216
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,420
and bring him back for you.

217
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,160
No need.

218
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,940
Don't mention

219
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,510
this matter to anyone.

220
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,980
As for Xue Dingfei,

221
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,460
I've got other plans.

222
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,150
Yes.

223
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,160
There's one other thing I want to ask you about.

224
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,760
How much do you know

225
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,630
about Xie Wei?

226
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,780
My Lord, there must be some misunderstanding.

227
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,580
Xie Wei is just a casual acquaintance.

228
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,040
I don't work for him.

229
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,840
I've pledged my loyalty

230
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,110
to you.

231
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,020
So under no circumstances will I betray you.

232
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,820
My Lord, please don't doubt me.

233
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,820
Enough.

234
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,820
I didn't say you work for him.

235
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,380
You had dealings with Xie Wei in the past.

236
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,340
So more or less, you should

237
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,030
know something about him.

238
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,490
You know I need to deal with Xie Wei.

239
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,040
I don't keep useless men.

240
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,790
You know that too.

241
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,950
If you can't be of any helpâ€¦

242
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,140
I remember now.

243
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,240
All the people Xie Wei cares about have left the capital,

244
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,100
except one person.

245
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,550
[Lyu Mansion]

246
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,520
Yes. There's one person left.

247
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,370
Although she seems ordinary,

248
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,540
she's on good terms with Jiang Xuening.

249
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,780
And Jiang Xuening is very close to Xie Wei.

250
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,270
My Lord,

251
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,500
I promise to get evidence against Xie Wei

252
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,820
out of that person.

253
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,130
Mr. Zhou.

254
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,590
What are you doing?

255
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,480
Madam Lyu.

256
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,380
I apologize for my rudeness.

257
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,080
Mr. Zhou.

258
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,900
You need a proper reason to arrest me.

259
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,160
What have I done wrong?

260
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,450
This is the way Xingwu Guards do things.

261
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,090
No matter what you want to say,

262
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,620
you can say it in the prison.

263
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,140
Take her away.

264
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,400
Wait.

265
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,770
-You have no reason to arrest me!
-Madam!

266
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:02,970
-Let go of me!
-Madam.

267
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,050
What do you want?

268
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,760
Are you leaving tomorrow?

269
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,540
If I hadn't got injured,

270
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,960
I'd have long left for Yuzhou.

271
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,280
By the way,

272
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,460
thank you for your help.

273
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,230
You seldom say thank you.

274
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,520
I'll just accept your gratitude.

275
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,630
After all, I'm not likely to hear you thank me again.

276
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,580
Have you made up your mind

277
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,880
to part ways with us?

278
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,060
The journey ahead of you is dangerous.

279
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,270
Why should I join you?

280
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,920
Let's say goodbye here.

281
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,510
It's good this way.

282
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,110
I once said

283
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,940
after everything is settled,

284
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,990
you can keep using

285
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,230
the name Xue Dingfei.

286
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,030
But I wonder

287
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,940
if you still want that name now.

288
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,470
Actually, I'm always aware

289
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,980
that the name Xue Dingfei

290
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,750
is a thorn in your side.

291
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,930
You must feel very bad

292
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,790
every time someone calls me that.

293
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,190
Is that the reason

294
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,450
why you don't like me?

295
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,460
When we were young,

296
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,510
it did annoy me.

297
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,160
No wonder you were mean to me those years.

298
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,150
I knew it.

299
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,430
There's no way I was that annoying.

300
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,480
But you were not very likable either.

301
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,290
Don't say it out loud.

302
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,760
It's hurtful.

303
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:32,990
Xie Wei.

304
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,280
We've been tied to each other for 20 years.

305
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,850
After all those ups and downs,

306
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,990
are we brothers now?

307
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,460
Being my brother

308
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,400
means being in danger.

309
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,120
Aren't you afraid?

310
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,370
I am.

311
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,360
When I was with you,

312
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,230
nothing good happened.

313
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,620
Maybe

314
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,670
I should stay away from you.

315
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,340
After being controlled for 20 years,

316
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,740
you're finally free now.

317
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,070
Let's have a toast with tea.

318
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:16,370
Here is to

319
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,170
your freedom

320
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,670
and carefree life.

321
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,220
To my freedom.

322
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,570
Father.

323
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,090
I'm glad you got back safely.

324
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,360
Let me see.

325
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,260
How's Ju'an's injury?

326
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,340
Has it almost healed?

327
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,580
Marquis Yan, don't worry.

328
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,550
I'm fine.

329
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,410
Xie Ju'an.

330
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,920
How could you?

331
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,460
How could you put your life at risk like that?

332
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,060
Weren't you afraidâ€¦

333
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,110
Of death?

334
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,250
I am now.

335
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:02,950
Xuening.

336
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,780
You've gone through a lot too.

337
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,790
I failed to protect you that day.

338
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,540
Marquis Yan, please don't say that.

339
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,600
I should thank you.

340
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,600
It was Yan's troops that saved me.

341
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,680
Lord Pingnan and his minions have been eliminated.

342
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,820
I've reported it to the court

343
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,350
and explained everything.

344
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,680
I believe His Majesty

345
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,260
will forgive us

346
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,000
for deploying the troops.

347
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:24,500
Report!

348
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,730
General.

349
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,040
His Majesty's special envoy, Mr. Zhang Zhe, is here.

350
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,340
What will be will be.

351
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,830
Let's find out

352
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,560
what the imperial edict says.

353
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,660
Mr. Zhang, you came all the way from the capital.

354
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,920
Sorry that I couldn't make time to receive you properly.

355
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,980
Please forgive me.

356
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,310
I'm just here

357
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,500
to convey His Majesty's message.

358
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,190
There's nothing to forgive, Junior Preceptor Xie.

359
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,720
Here is the imperial edict.

360
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,480
By the will of Heaven, His Majesty speaks,

361
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,570
"I'm pleased to know about the great victory at the border.

362
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:23,750
Marquis Yan and his son led Yan's troops to successfully suppress the rebellion.

363
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,230
On my behalf, Zhang Zhe shall give them commendation

364
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,630
and reward the soldiers.

365
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,090
Junior Preceptor Xie Wei devised brilliant strategies

366
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,420
and made great contributions too.

367
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,420
I'll reward him myself after he returns to the capital."

368
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,300
All hail His Majesty.

369
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,430
General Yan.

370
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,270
The imperial edict is just half the message His Majesty wants to convey.

371
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,530
I'll tell you the other half now.

372
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,740
His Majesty hopes that Junior Preceptor Xie

373
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,800
and Viscount Yan can escort the princess back to the capital

374
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,530
and present yourselves to him.

375
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,610
No matter what grievances you have,

376
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,600
you can tell His Majesty then.

377
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,120
Yan's troops

378
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,050
shall retreat to the border

379
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,400
and continue to defend the State of Qian.

380
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:09,099
His Majesty cares for every one of you.

381
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,700
Please don't let him down.

382
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,020
I don't mean

383
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,410
to defy His Majesty,

384
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,950
but my wound hasn't healed yet.

385
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,880
I can't set off for the capital immediately.

386
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,050
So, Mr. Zhang,

387
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,170
please stay in Yuzhou for a few days.

388
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,630
Mr. Zhang, you came all the way here

389
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,630
and must be tired.

390
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,380
Stay here for a few days and have a good rest.

391
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,510
It's inconvenient to stay at the camp.

392
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,850
So I've prepared a place in town

393
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,680
where you can stay.

394
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,010
Her Highness is already there.

395
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:42,100
Why don't you all go to town and have some rest first?

396
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,990
We can

397
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,910
discuss everything else later.

398
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:45,460
Okay.

399
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,410
Thank you, General Yan.

400
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,750
-Ning.
-Your Highness.

401
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,500
Ning.

402
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,040
Your Highness.

403
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,960
You scared me.

404
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,950
I'm fine, Your Highness.

405
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,620
I came back unscathed.

406
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,940
When you go out in the future, you must bring enough guards with you.

407
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,180
Don't go out alone.

408
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,980
Got it.

409
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,310
I'm Zhang Zhe from the Ministry of Justice. Greetings, Your Highness.

410
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:29,580
Mr. Zhang?

411
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,080
I'm here on His Majesty's order.

412
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,880
Besides rewarding the troops,

413
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,730
His Majesty also wants you

414
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,190
to return to the capital as soon as possible.

415
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,400
We've all traveled a long way.

416
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,170
Let's get some rest first.

417
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,850
We can get down to business later.

418
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:44,520
Yes.

419
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,590
There's no rush.

420
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,710
There are enough servants in the mansion.

421
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,640
Let them know if you need anything.

422
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,050
I'll have more soldiers guard this place.

423
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,620
You'll be safe here.

424
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,530
Come.

425
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,070
Let's go.

426
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,760
Ning, tell me everything

427
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,910
you've been through along the way.

428
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,880
It's gonna be a long story.

429
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,560
Then let's talk all night.

430
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,390
I have a lot to tell you after all that's happened.

431
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:22,660
You almost lost the battle at Guiyi Heights?

432
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,220
We rolled the dice like we did so many times before.

433
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,060
Fortunately,

434
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,860
fate was on our side this time.

435
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,410
Ning, promise me

436
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,140
to stay safe.

437
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,010
Okay. I promise you.

438
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,240
The imperial edict has arrived.

439
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,570
We may go back to the capital very soon.

440
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,230
Are you happy, Your Highness?

441
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,570
When Princess Leyang left the capital,

442
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,800
she had lost all faith in her family.

443
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,450
Now that the State of Yue is no longer a threat

444
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,730
and the northern territories are in the clear,

445
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,190
she's fulfilled her duty.

446
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,950
Now, I'm just Shen Zhiyi.

447
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,780
I've had enough of the royal family's hypocrisy.

448
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,690
If I could,

449
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,320
I'd rather never go back to that cage.

450
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,830
How about you, Ning?

451
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,640
What are you and Mr. Xie gonna do?

452
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,330
I won't comment on his feelings for you.

453
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,630
I'm just a little worried.

454
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,140
You're spontaneous by nature.

455
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,110
But Mr. Xie is the opposite.

456
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,420
He's scheming and manipulative.

457
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,220
Loving such a dangerous man

458
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,540
will be exhausting.

459
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,120
Have you thought it through?

460
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,750
If there had been an easy way,

461
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,360
he wouldn't have chosen a path

462
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,660
that was full of dangers and traps.

463
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,940
You don't know him, Your Highness.

464
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,070
All these years,

465
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,070
life has not been easy for him.

466
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,910
People respect and fear him,

467
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,170
but I feel sorry for him.

468
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,680
I don't know what the future will be like.

469
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,620
All I know is that I don't want him to be alone anymore.

470
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,570
You're in love.

471
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,030
Yes, I am.

472
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,150
Is there anything you can do about it, Your Highness?

473
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,650
If you ask me,

474
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,660
I wish

475
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,490
there were a magic potion that can make you fall out of love.

476
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,380
Once you drink it,

477
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,370
you'll forget everything about him.

478
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,500
When love is gone, so are your worries.

479
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,780
But how can I forget

480
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,580
someone like him?

481
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,150
Your Highness.

482
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,310
Sometimes I wonder

483
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,490
whether I'm wrong.

484
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,230
What do you mean?

485
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,760
A long time ago,

486
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,180
I chose the wrong path,

487
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,470
made many mistakes,

488
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,310
and got what I deserved.

489
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,010
Later, I got a chance to start all over,

490
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,450
so I tried my best to change things

491
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,980
and make up for my mistakes.

492
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,080
I've done a lot by now

493
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,800
and it seems I've corrected some mistakes,

494
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,770
but I'm a bit scared.

495
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,570
Scared of what?

496
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,720
All this time,

497
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,540
I've been trying to change things

498
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,070
in a way that I think is good.

499
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,940
But what I think is good

500
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,050
may be bad

501
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,420
for other people, right?

502
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,420
What if their lives

503
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,780
could've been better?

504
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,490
You think too much.

505
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,530
You're always thinking

506
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,890
and end up confused.

507
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,450
Ning, believe in yourself.

508
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,500
You need to believe that everything happens for a reason.

509
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,770
Believe in yourself

510
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,440
and always live in the moment.

511
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:37,430
Your Highness, you have great wisdom.

512
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,340
What do you think

513
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,890
the imperial edict means?

514
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,300
Are we really going back to the capital?

515
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,500
A war has been fought.

516
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,780
Even if His Majesty is willing to let it slide,

517
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,060
Xue Yuan won't agree.

518
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,570
Whether we go back to the capital or not,

519
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,920
the Xue family won't just stand aside.

520
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,780
Why don't we just lead the army back to the capital

521
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,380
and eliminate the Xue family

522
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,900
in the name of cleansing the court of sycophants?

523
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,050
The court has doubted our intentions.

524
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:07,460
If we lead the army back,

525
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,790
we're very likely to be accused of mutiny.

526
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,060
If that happens,

527
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,320
things will only be worse.

528
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,010
Unless we have no other choices,

529
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:16,980
we can't do that.

530
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:17,810
Mr. Xie.

531
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,330
Here is the new qin you asked for.

532
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,930
Why hasn't Ning'er come to learn the qin today?

533
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:28,270
Miss Jiang and the princess talked the whole night.

534
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,420
Maybe she's too tired today.

535
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,900
I'll ask her about it later.

536
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,030
Since you're going to meet Miss Jiang,

537
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,140
I'll take my leave.

538
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,020
Has it ever occurred to you

539
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,890
that Miss Jiang can't play the qin well

540
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,340
not because the previous qin is bad?

541
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,240
A new qin won't be of much help.

542
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,370
If I teach her patiently,

543
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,900
she'll be good at it one day.

544
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,290
If she isn't,

545
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,990
the problem must be with me.

546
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:51,610
Look.

547
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,220
He's so defensive of her.

548
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,100
What?

549
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,190
Do you have a problem?

550
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,900
No. Of course not.

551
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,950
I'll take my leave.

552
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,320
The store-bought qin

553
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,710
is not comparable to the ones I made myself.

554
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,040
But I'll make do with it.

555
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,050
When I have free time,

556
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,790
I'll make a qin for Ning'er myself.

557
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:19,510
Yes.

558
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,330
He came all alone.

559
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:37,190
It seemed that he anticipated everything and got a perfect plan,

560
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:40,690
but in fact, he was putting himself in danger and taking a chance.

561
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,390
He was only so crazy and daring

562
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,590
because of you.

563
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:45,330
Now,

564
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,450
you know me inside and out.

565
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:51,040
You've seen me for who I am

566
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,750
without any disguise.

567
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,900
What do you think?

568
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,840
Are you still afraid of me?

569
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,910
Ning, believe in yourself

570
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,960
and always live in the moment.

571
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:29,200
-After we parted that dayâ€¦
-After we parted that dayâ€¦

572
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:34,540
Since we parted at Lord Linzi's mansion,

573
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,710
a long time has passed.

574
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,720
How have you been?

575
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,880
I've been good.

576
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,180
Don't worry about me.

577
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,710
â™«The snow is very lightâ™«

578
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,050
What I said that dayâ€¦

579
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,160
I didn't understand it at first,

580
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:48,720
â™«It doesn't stop even after filling all the cracks in the eavesâ™«

581
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,740
but later, I got what you meant.

582
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,580
Those words sounded harsh,

583
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:55,100
â™«You left in a hurry, leaving traces in the snowâ™«

584
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,780
but you said them for my good.

585
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,430
Thank you, Miss Jiang.

586
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:59,080
â™«They're about to be erased nowâ™«

587
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,270
At that time, I was bothered by vicious rumors.

588
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:05,320
â™«Disrupting my expectationsâ™«

589
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,610
Thank you for finding out the truth for me

590
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:05,540
despite our differences.

591
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,270
â™«We made a promiseâ™«

592
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,380
You stood up for me in the court.

593
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,670
I haven't thanked you for it.

594
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,790
â™«Yet we are only left with our memoryâ™«

595
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,670
Now that we've met,

596
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,960
thank you, Mr. Zhang.

597
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,130
â™«Flowers bloom in the streetâ™«

598
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,450
â™«Without youâ™«

599
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,510
Mr. Zhang, you once said

600
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:24,030
â™«Watching the clouds wait anxiously for winterâ™«

601
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,160
you love watching the rain.

602
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,070
You must be in a good mood today.

603
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,360
â™«Keep the memories slowlyâ™«

604
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,390
There are different kinds of rain too.

605
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:32,930
â™«I've forgotten about the four seasons without you by my sideâ™«

606
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,540
When the rain pours down,

607
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,260
it carries too much impact

608
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,760
and makes people uncomfortable.

609
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:39,690
â™«We made a promise, yet we are only left with our memoryâ™«

610
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:41,180
This kind of rain is the best.

611
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,910
â™«Snow covers the street once moreâ™«

612
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:47,260
â™«My heart freezes into a cocoonâ™«

613
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,230
It causes ripples on water surfaces

614
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,400
and makes every place it falls on glisten.

615
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,710
â™«The seasons repeat ruthlesslyâ™«

616
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,130
It's like a small twist in life.

617
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,180
You'll see its worth after you've been through it.

618
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:55,500
â™«Stealing my heart slowlyâ™«

619
00:26:55,630 --> 00:27:00,220
â™«I forgot I've never been sure whenâ™«

620
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:05,180
â™«I'll break the cocoon and become a butterflyâ™«

621
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,120
Have you asked her?

622
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,180
When will she come?

623
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,760
She went to see him.

624
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,160
I heard from Mr. Jiang that you moved back to the countryside.

625
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,030
I didnâ€™t expect you

626
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,550
to be with Junior Preceptor Xie and Yan's troops.

627
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,320
No one in the capital knows that now.

628
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,770
But if you keep staying with the troops,

629
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,340
it won't be long before word gets back.

630
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,670
No one knows

631
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,270
what will happen to the Jiang family then.

632
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,350
You mean

633
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,770
the court may control the Jiang family

634
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:46,970
as a bargaining chip?

635
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,740
Now Marquis Yan and Xie Wei control the northwest of the State of Qian

636
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,050
and an army of tens of thousands is stationed in Yuzhou

637
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:54,380
which is only miles away from the capital.

638
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:55,590
Without any doubt,

639
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,200
the court feels threatened.

640
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,660
If this goes on,

641
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,030
when the court runs out of options,

642
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:03,950
I'm afraid the Jiang family will be their last resort.

643
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,660
Thank you for caring for the Jiang family, Mr. Zhang.

644
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,540
But I need clarification about one thing.

645
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,750
What's His Majesty's plan?

646
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,490
He claims that he wants to reward the soldiers,

647
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,350
but it sounds like an excuse to me.

648
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,190
Is he planning to trick them back to the capital

649
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,410
and then settle the score with them?

650
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,740
No one knows what His Majesty is thinking.

651
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,690
The Xue family is also a source of pressure.

652
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,880
But without Yan's troops,

653
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,650
peace wouldn't have been restored at the border.

654
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,130
If Xie Wei hadn't put his life at risk,

655
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,090
Lord Pingnan wouldn't have been killed.

656
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:30,210
Now that both invaders and rebels have been defeated,

657
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,060
if His Majesty turns his back on these heroes,

658
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,420
everyone who has pledged loyalty to him will be disappointed.

659
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,810
Xie Wei and the others did everything they did

660
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:37,450
for the State of Qian and His Majesty,

661
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,760
not for their own interests.

662
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,340
I know what you mean.

663
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,750
Xie Wei is determined to wipe out the Xue family.

664
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,610
I know that too.

665
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,340
But no matter what crime the Xue family has committed,

666
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,970
they should be judged by the Ministry of Justice according to the law.

667
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,180
What Xie Wei has done

668
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,300
is nothing short of raising an army of his own and standing against the court.

669
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,250
It's understandable that His Majesty is on guard.

670
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,290
You're not him.

671
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,260
If you'd been through what he's been through,

672
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,020
you wouldn't have said that.

673
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,550
Sorry.

674
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,240
You're just looking out for me.

675
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,240
I shouldn't have taken it out on you.

676
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,050
It's fine.

677
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:23,440
I just hope

678
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,010
Junior Preceptor Xie and the Yan family

679
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,650
can return to the capital to meet His Majesty

680
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:27,780
as soon as possible.

681
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,750
As long as they return to the capital,

682
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,920
the court will see

683
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,610
their loyalty and sincerity.

684
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,830
His Majesty won't make things hard for them.

685
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,110
It's getting late.

686
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,560
The rain is beautiful,

687
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,820
but it's cold out here.

688
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,500
Don't stay here for too long.

689
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,900
Go back and get some rest.

690
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,030
Miss Jiang.

691
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,870
I have one question for you.

692
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,130
If that day,

693
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,180
my mother hadn't had that accident,

694
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,860
would you still have let go?

695
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,840
Things have changed. So have we.

696
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,620
Since we've moved on,

697
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,850
there's no need to dwell on the past.

698
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:20,330
â™«Wind blows gentlyâ™«

699
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,180
I once made lots of mistakes

700
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,960
because of my obsession.

701
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:26,740
â™«The fallen flowers bloom in my heartâ™«

702
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,990
I'm indebted to you, Mr. Zhang.

703
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:24,820
I will

704
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,810
do my best to make it up to you.

705
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:31,260
But I can't help who I love.

706
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:34,030
â™«Your whisper under the moonlight sounds beautifulâ™«

707
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,380
Have you

708
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,360
â™«Getting closer gentlyâ™«

709
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,720
given your heart

710
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,990
to Junior Preceptor Xie?

711
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:43,670
â™«The season stays in dreamlandâ™«

712
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:40,770
Yes.

713
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,620
I love him.

714
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,140
â™«The snow is very lightâ™«

715
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:55,160
â™«It doesn't stop even after filling all the cracks in the eavesâ™«

716
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:01,530
â™«You left in a hurry, leaving traces in the snowâ™«

717
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:05,520
â™«They're about to be erased nowâ™«

718
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:11,320
â™«Disrupting my expectationsâ™«

719
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:20,760
Miss Jiang.

720
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,870
Mr. Xie wants to see you.

721
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,760
What happened?

722
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,900
Why didn't you come to learn the qin today?

723
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,950
Where did you go?

724
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,210
Why are you all wet?

725
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,870
I stayed up late last night

726
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,750
and didn't get up until the afternoon.

727
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,740
I wanted some fresh air

728
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,000
so I went to the garden.

729
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:58,740
Then it rained,

730
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,360
so I watched it for a while.

731
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,420
You watched the rain alone.

732
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,440
Didn't you feel bored?

733
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:13,710
Not really.

734
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,670
I have something to discuss with you.

735
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,080
His Majesty urges you and Yan Lin to return to the capital.

736
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,540
His intention is unclear.

737
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,730
You should think about it carefully.

738
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,960
As for me,

739
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,470
if I keep staying here,

740
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,550
the court will find it out sooner or later.

741
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,450
The Jiang family is still in the capital, so I thinkâ€¦

742
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,450
You want to leave?

743
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,350
I'm not very close to them,

744
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,960
but I don't want to cause them trouble.

745
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,560
Where do you want to go?

746
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,020
I can go back to the countryside,

747
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,460
just like I planned.

748
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,860
Do you want to leave because of the Jiang family

749
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,070
or because of him?

750
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,220
Why didn't you tell me honestly

751
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,880
that you went to see Zhang Zhe?

752
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,200
What are you keeping from me?

753
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,090
I just ran into him.

754
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,670
I didn't tell you

755
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:08,530
because I knew you'd overreact.

756
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,730
You just ran into him?

757
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:12,190
You ran into him

758
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,750
and then watched the rain with him for so long?

759
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,230
I don't know what's so great about the rain.

760
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,940
It's wet and cold.

761
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,300
You can't flick it off when it falls on you.

762
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,140
The coldness seeps into your body bit by bit.

763
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,410
You may catch a cold if you're not careful enough.

764
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,760
It's not fatal,

765
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,260
but it's a constant nuisance

766
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,390
that keeps making you uncomfortable.

767
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:37,870
Jiang Xuening.

768
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,220
What's so interesting about watching the rain?

769
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,040
Or were you actually trying

770
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,030
to rekindle a romance with him?

771
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:51,870
Xie Ju'an.

772
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,880
I'm not your pet.

773
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,970
Even if I made a plan to meet him,

774
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,470
I don't have to explain it to you.

775
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:00,000
But you've promised to build a future with me!

776
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,690
Jiang Xuening.

777
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:05,200
â™«Close your eyes before darkâ™«

778
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,650
You know what kind of person I am.

779
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,650
â™«I'll see you againâ™«

780
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,720
Since you've given me your word,

781
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,830
I won't let you go.

782
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:11,790
â™«I finally realize that I can't go backâ™«

783
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,949
I won't give you a chance to go back on your word.

784
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,480
â™«To that dayâ™«

785
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:18,159
â™«Only when my weak points are hit can I seeâ™«

786
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:21,020
â™«The fragments deep in my heartâ™«

787
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:26,620
â™«How intimate we were, but we couldn't withstand changeâ™«

788
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:22,929
Jiang Xuening.

789
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:27,310
You're mine.

790
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:30,530
â™«Let me sink into the bottom of the sea soberâ™«

791
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:33,600
â™«You've disappeared as you wishedâ™«

792
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:36,830
â™«I clearly guessed the probability of our loveâ™«

793
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:41,179
â™«But it's not you and me in the endâ™«

794
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,699
â™«I really want to ask youâ™«

795
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:48,040
â™«Why?â™«

796
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,040
â™«In the plots we missedâ™«

797
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,280
â™«Was there any sincerityâ™«

798
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,489
Jiang Xuening.

799
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:57,400
â™«From now on, will you and I measureâ™«

800
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:56,570
I want you.

801
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:00,460
â™«The abyss-like distance between usâ™«

802
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,000
â™«What's the meaning of the decisions I makeâ™«

803
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:07,260
â™«When my hands are tiedâ™«

804
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:10,900
â™«I really want to ask youâ™«

805
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:13,940
â™«Why?â™«

806
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:17,080
â™«In the plots we missedâ™«

807
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:20,230
â™«Was there any sincerityâ™«

808
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,270
â™«From now on, will you and I measureâ™«

809
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,210
â™«The abyss-like distance between usâ™«

810
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,070
â™«What's the meaning of the decisions I makeâ™«

811
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,980
â™«When my hands are tiedâ™«

812
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:36,520
â™«I can't guess or comprehendâ™«

813
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,510
â™«The mystery of fateâ™«

814
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,690
â™«In the boundless world, in the future or the pastâ™«

815
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,820
â™«Have we even met?â™«

816
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,800
â™«From now on, will you and I measureâ™«

817
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:51,720
â™«The abyss-like distance between usâ™«

818
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:55,380
â™«The reflection of time will one dayâ™«

819
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:58,950
â™«Engulf you and meâ™«

820
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:07,880
Stop.

821
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:09,760
What are you here for?

822
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,950
I got news from the camp.

823
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,550
I came to talk with Xie Ju'an.

824
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:13,460
Leave.

825
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,070
What's wrong?

826
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,170
Miss Jiang is inside.

827
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,220
So what?

828
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,480
-She can join the conversation.
-Yeah.

829
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,330
Aren't you usually the smart one?

830
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:24,220
Why are you

831
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:25,930
so dense today?

832
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:31,600
Are theyâ€¦

833
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,520
I can't miss it.

834
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:40,630
Let meâ€¦

835
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,720
Move aside. Let me take a peek.

836
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,700
-Go away!
-Just a peek.

837
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,620
-Move aside.
-Go away or I'll beat you up.

838
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,350
Let me take a peek.

839
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,400
Leave now!

840
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,300
Jiang Xuening.

841
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,120
You are mine.

842
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,070
I'm not.

843
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,150
Then I'm yours.

844
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,300
Let's get married.

845
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,650
[Quheng Residence]

846
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,210
Are you up, Miss?

847
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,380
Mr. Xie sent us to serve you.

848
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:18,380
Miss Jiang.

849
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:28,700
What's this?

850
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,150
Before Mr. Xie left, he said

851
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,870
you got caught in the rain yesterday

852
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:33,340
and was worried that you might catch a cold.

853
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,920
So he asked Physician Zhou

854
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,660
to prepare cold medicine for you.

855
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,840
Where is he?

856
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,420
He got news from the front line

857
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,330
and went to the camp before dawn.

858
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,390
He left before dawn?

859
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,830
How quick and quiet.

860
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:49,650
Tell me

861
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,780
when he comes back.

862
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,470
I have something to tell him.

863
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,400
The medicine.

864
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,030
Tell him to take it himself.

865
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,550
When Yan's troops went south,

866
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:02,150
enough soldiers were left to guard the border.

867
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,720
So the border is quite safe.

868
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,790
But the situation we're in

869
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,380
is full of uncertainty.

870
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:12,180
The Xue family hasn't been eliminated yet.

871
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:16,940
Letting Xie Ju'an and Viscount Yan go to the capital

872
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:18,790
and the troops retreat to the border in the meantime

873
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,600
is not appropriate.

874
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,440
His Majesty

875
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,870
must be aware of that.

876
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,110
However,

877
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,800
the troops are stationed in Yuzhou now.

878
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,740
For those in the capital,

879
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:30,590
we're posing a big threat.

880
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:33,150
We have no intention to rise up,

881
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:34,830
but His Majesty

882
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,980
has good reason to suspect us.

883
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:39,480
If Ju'an and Yan Lin

884
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,540
return to the capital,

885
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,630
I'm afraid they'll be detained.

886
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,230
Even if His Majesty

887
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,890
doesn't mean to harm them,

888
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:49,120
the Xue family

889
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,380
may take the chance to kill them.

890
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,990
It's too dangerous.

891
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,790
Why don't we split the troops into three groups?

892
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:55,650
The first group

893
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,630
will retreat to the border to reassure His Majesty.

894
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,400
The second group will stay with Father

895
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,880
in Yuzhou as our backup.

896
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,440
The third group

897
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,430
are soldiers borrowed from Tongzhou.

898
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,760
They should be transferred back to Tongzhou.

899
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,550
This way,

900
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:09,450
they can go back to the capital with us

901
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,410
in case something happens.

902
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:11,370
That may work.

903
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:12,920
Ju'an.

904
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,410
What do you think?

905
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,040
Brother.

906
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,520
Xie Ju'an.

907
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,280
I'm listening.

908
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,230
Go on.

909
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,810
Are you sure you're listening?

910
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:26,520
Did you not sleep well last night?

911
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,420
You didn't have to get up early this morning

912
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,750
to attend this meeting.

913
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:31,290
I could send Yan Lin to town

914
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:33,440
to discuss it with you.

915
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:35,530
It's fine.

916
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,060
I don't mind coming here.

917
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,050
Go on.

918
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:01,390
Miss Jiang.

919
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,110
It's so late.

920
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:05,190
Why don't you go to bed?

921
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,860
I don't know when Mr. Xie will be back either.

922
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,240
Usually, when he left for a meeting,

923
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,780
he'd come back before noon.

924
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:12,320
Is he avoiding me?

925
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,760
No, he isn't.

926
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,920
If I can't see him today,

927
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,580
I won't see him ever again.

928
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,500
Butâ€¦

929
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:23,220
It's late.

930
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,870
The front line is not safe.

931
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:29,030
I'll have soldiers escort you back.

932
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:29,940
Be careful.

933
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,590
Ju'an has something on his mind today.

934
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,790
I don't think he's here for the meeting.

935
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:49,190
It's more like he's here to avoid someone.

936
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,250
I was young once.

937
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:52,720
Some things

938
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,430
are quite obvious to me.

939
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,080
Are Ju'an and Xuening

940
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:00,490
in that kind of relationship?

941
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,770
These years, I've watched you

942
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:06,390
grow close to Xuening.

943
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:09,020
I know your feelings for her.

944
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,550
Unfortunately,

945
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,720
so many things have happened.

946
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:16,650
Do you feel bad

947
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,090
about them being together?

948
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:23,500
They've been through things

949
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,100
that brought them together.

950
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:28,330
Brother didn't steal her from me.

951
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,780
It's just that she didn't choose me.

952
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:33,030
She has the freedom to do that.

953
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,270
She doesn't need a reason

954
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,060
or to explain it to anyone.

955
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,930
I just want her to be happy.

956
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,850
I wish the same for Brother.

957
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,610
All these years,

958
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,650
he's suffered a lot.

959
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:49,750
Now he's finally met someone

960
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,950
who understands him.

961
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,900
I feel happy for him.

962
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,580
So I have no bad feelings.

963
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:09,320
Mr. Xie.

964
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,480
Mr. Xie, you're finally back.

965
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:15,370
Miss Jiang has been waiting for you all day.

966
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:16,590
She said

967
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,170
if she can't see you today,

968
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,480
she won't see you ever again.

969
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,910
Hurry.

970
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,190
I see.

971
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,020
I've been worried

972
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,440
for them the whole day

973
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:33,240
and careful with everything I said.

974
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:33,980
Do you know

975
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:36,070
what's wrong with Mr. Xie today?

976
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,150
Maybe

977
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,180
he's scared?

978
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:40,950
Scared?

979
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:42,940
He

980
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,620
once had everything.

981
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,500
But something horrible happened

982
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,360
when he was a kid

983
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:49,180
and deprived him of everything.

984
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:50,130
He's been living

985
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:51,790
in the shadow of it ever since.

986
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,090
Although he looks

987
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:54,660
tough and strong,

988
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,090
deep down,

989
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,640
he's extremely insecure.

990
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,010
So,

991
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:01,190
he'd rather never have anything again.

992
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:02,360
But when he does,

993
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:05,020
he'll be terrified of losing it.
