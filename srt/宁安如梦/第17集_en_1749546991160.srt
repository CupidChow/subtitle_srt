1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
As long as I can enter the Ning'an Palace

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,200
and pay all the price

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,600
I will be happy and happy

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,400
The End

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,800
The End

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,800
Everything seems to be a dream

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,400
I have owe many people

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,800
Chaozhe, help me

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,600
I will be a good person after this

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
The End

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
I will be the one to take the throne

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,800
There are some things you can't give me

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
But what about them?

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,000
The life you choose is for Mr. You

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,400
In this world, everyone has the right to escape

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,000
But I can't

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,000
I want to regret it

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,400
and do the wrong thing

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,200
and try my best to return

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Does Mr. Zhang believe that everything is decided?

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I would rather believe in the future

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,000
Your Highness

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,800
Your Highness

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,200
The End

26
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,000
Ning'an, what are you doing?

27
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,000
In the Ming Dynasty

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,600
there is a pair of invisible hands

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,400
that can break everything back to the original position

30
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,200
The revenge is long

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,400
Who are you in the end?

32
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,400
The Emperor of the mortal world is so long-winded

33
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,000
and so absurd

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,800
I got a切 in my stomach

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:03:15,100
nagyon

36
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,100
Step back!

37
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,100
Take him away.

38
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,100
I don't know what day it is.

39
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,100
Be careful, Lord Zhu.

40
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,100
Take care.

41
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,100
Today, everyone is coming to the trouble.

42
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,100
They don't want to see you off.

43
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,100
This love will be forever.

44
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,100
I'll find a way to get rid of him.

45
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,100
Leave the rest to me. Don't worry.

46
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,100
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,100
I promised you many things.

48
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,100
I can't do it now.

49
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,100
Don't say that.

50
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,100
I'll do it.

51
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,100
I'll do it.

52
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,100
I'll do it.

53
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,100
I'll do it.

54
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,100
Don't say that.

55
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,100
Take care of yourself.

56
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,100
I heard that you're a good wife.

57
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,100
Could you give me a song?

58
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:43,100
A song that will be with me forever.

59
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,100
I'll do it.

60
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,100
I'll do it.

61
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,100
I'll do it.

62
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,100
Let's go.

63
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,100
Go.

64
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,100
Remember to keep it for me.

65
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,100
Yanling, don't forget.

66
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,100
The Great Peng is in the same wind.

67
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,100
It's worth tens of thousands of miles.

68
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,100
You'll be safe and sound.

69
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,100
I'll do it.

70
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,100
Search carefully.

71
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,100
The imperial guards have ordered that

72
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,100
all the suspicious letters

73
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,100
or the weapons from the Yinzhang

74
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,100
are not allowed to be released.

75
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,100
Yes.

76
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,100
I can promise to be a judge for Yanling.

77
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,100
Yanling is a good person.

78
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,100
And a good wife.

79
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,100
Yanling, you go to my study.

80
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,100
I'll take the case of the criminal.

81
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,100
And give it to Mr. Xie.

82
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,100
Okay.

83
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,100
My Lord.

84
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,100
Are you okay?

85
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,100
The wind is strong today.

86
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,100
I wonder when it will rain.

87
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,100
I'll go back soon.

88
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,100
Please take care of it.

89
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,100
Okay.

90
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,100
Why haven't you gone back?

91
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,100
Yu'an is leaving.

92
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,100
Before leaving, I want to ask you

93
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,100
what should I do about the post-sacrifice of the Yan family?

94
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,100
Don't interfere in the investigation.

95
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,100
I'll inform you if you have any news.

96
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,100
You helped the Yan family today.

97
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,100
You've been in the Empress Dowager's eyes many times.

98
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,100
Remember to keep it in mind.

99
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,100
Don't worry, I know.

100
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,100
They just searched the imperial residence.

101
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,100
I'm worried that they might find any bad evidence.

102
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,100
The Xie family is smart.

103
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,100
But they don't know that they've been in the prison.

104
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,100
Peace and prosperity

105
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,100
The residence of theIT方面

106
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,100
Master.

107
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,100
Where are you?

108
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,000
Step living room and Yan's Crown Prince

109
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,440
but Xue's Palace took her away.

110
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,760
The Marquis's Manor was confiscated.

111
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,760
The Marquis's Manor was also controlled.

112
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,160
All right.

113
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,400
Leave us.

114
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,000
Yes.

115
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,440
Such a good management.

116
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,240
Such a good man.

117
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,720
Master.

118
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,760
It seems that I didn't allow you to go to this management today.

119
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,720
It's right.

120
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,000
The court is in a difficult situation.

121
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,600
Although the two girls

122
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,640
are all in the same position.

123
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,120
But they can at least say that

124
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,720
they will accompany the Princess.

125
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
In this way,

126
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,280
it doesn't mean that the Jiang family and Master's position.

127
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,280
And this Feng Bu

128
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,600
has nothing to do with our Jiang family.

129
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,360
They won't go in.

130
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,000
Madam.

131
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,720
If the Jiang family can be independent,

132
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,520
it will be a shame to

133
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,680
offend the Master's loyalty

134
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,840
and our Jiang family's affection.

135
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,440
Master.

136
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,440
I know.

137
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,000
What I want to say next

138
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,280
may not be heard.

139
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,240
Maybe you will think that I

140
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,640
am afraid of death and I am afraid of the evil.

141
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,160
But I still want to say

142
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,560
that I want to remind you.

143
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,040
Our Jiang family is no better than those family of the world.

144
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,320
We are independent and independent.

145
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,600
We can't go beyond the wind and rain.

146
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,200
In the past,

147
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,200
it would be okay to help the Yan family in secret.

148
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
But now,

149
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,040
if you stand out and show your strength,

150
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
in the future,

151
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,360
you will be a man

152
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,800
who is determined to make a paper.

153
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,760
It's not impossible.

154
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,600
I am not afraid of these.

155
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,080
Master.

156
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,760
I believe you know

157
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,600
what I just said.

158
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,840
You know

159
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,720
how to judge the situation.

160
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,560
Otherwise,

161
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,600
you won't be stopped by me.

162
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,120
Yan family is in a difficult situation.

163
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,840
Jiang family should think about it.

164
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,440
Although we don't want to be rich,

165
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,840
but we have to

166
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,560
live a peaceful life.

167
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,760
kaar ivy swan.

168
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,680
Xia Linxuan zha reacts to Jiang family

169
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,440
since the Fighter of Xu formation.

170
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,320
Zhe.

171
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,060
Why is Zhang Зhe

172
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,040
a servile warrior?

173
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,200
He never speaks with learnt english.

174
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,400
Had he hearddestory of him from the ön,

175
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
Your Majesty, I saw it in person.

176
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
In the study of the Marquis Yongyi's mansion,

177
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
there are a lot of traces of burning.

178
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,400
It must be because of the Yan family's support

179
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,400
to bring all the past letters to me

180
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,400
when I returned to the palace to add them.

181
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,400
They burned a whole house.

182
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,400
So, please allow me

183
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,400
to do my duty to

184
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,400
treat my father and son in a way

185
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,400
that I can definitely get a result.

186
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,400
Father, don't you understand?

187
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,400
These are all the memorials

188
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,400
of the Marquis Yongyi's family

189
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,400
who colluded with your new 5th-ranked

190
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
and all-powerful Marquis Yongyi.

191
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,400
Some people even pointed out

192
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
that they suspected that you were in prison

193
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,400
and were being killed.

194
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,400
You even wanted me to do my duty

195
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,400
to limit my power to the public.

196
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
Anyway,

197
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
find out the evidence as soon as possible.

198
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,400
Otherwise, the Yan family

199
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,400
will be in a fight.

200
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,400
I have to pursue the past

201
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,400
and get the result.

202
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,400
I understand.

203
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,400
Greetings, Duke.

204
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,400
Young Master.

205
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,400
Young Master, are you busy?

206
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,400
Yesterday, you were in Yongyi's mansion

207
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
to hold the memorials.

208
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,400
Today, you came in.

209
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,400
I'm very busy.

210
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,400
I'm not busy.

211
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
I'm busy.

212
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,400
I'm busy.

213
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,400
I'm busy.

214
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
I'm busy.

215
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,400
I'm busy.

216
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,400
I'm busy.

217
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,400
I'm busy.

218
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,400
I don't know

219
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,400
whether you and Yan family are close.

220
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,400
I'm very close.

221
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,400
I'm Yan Ling's teacher.

222
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,400
I'll teach you a lesson.

223
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,400
If you don't mind,

224
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,400
I'll find you.

225
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,400
No need.

226
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,400
I'm sorry

227
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,400
for the favor of His Majesty.

228
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,400
Please.

229
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,400
Duke Ding was looking for you at the door.

230
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
He's not feeling well.

231
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,400
Duke Ding is looking for the cause.

232
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
He's in a bad mood.

233
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
I don't care.

234
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
You were there yesterday.

235
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,400
What do you think?

236
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,400
I don't care.

237
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
As long as Duke Ding can get back the military power

238
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,400
and find Yan family's support,

239
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,400
I don't care.

240
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,400
What?

241
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,400
Didn't Duke come to teach you a lesson?

242
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
He went to Yan family yesterday.

243
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Duke has been in charge of the mansion for so long.

244
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
He can't find the cause.

245
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,400
He can't even get the important lesson.

246
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,400
Xie Qing, you reminded me.

247
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,400
Since Yan family is innocent,

248
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,400
Duke Ding must be able to get the cause.

249
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,400
Maybe he's really worried

250
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
about his own good old man.

251
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Your Majesty,

252
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,400
Duke Ding is in charge of the military power?

253
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,400
You can't tell?

254
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,400
I was in the mansion yesterday.

255
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,400
It's strange.

256
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,400
Your Majesty has received the news.

257
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,400
Duke Ding is trying to get the news.

258
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,400
It's too long.

259
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,400
Why did Duke Ding choose to be in charge of the mansion yesterday?

260
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,400
He's been in charge of the mansion for so long.

261
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,400
He won't let anyone get out.

262
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,400
If Duke Ding really has a plan,

263
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,400
what he wants to do now

264
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,400
is to kill the master of Yan family.

265
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,400
He'll have everything be proved.

266
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,400
No wonder the old man wants me to give him a decree

267
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,400
to find the master of Yan family.

268
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,400
It turns out that he's using this plan

269
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,400
to make me his knife.

270
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,400
Xie Qing, you go to the prison for me

271
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
to find out the cause.

272
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,400
I need to know

273
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,400
whether the Xue family is in the investigation or the plan.

274
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,400
I understand.

275
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,400
I'll take care of it.

276
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,400
Your Majesty, you're here.

277
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,400
I don't know which person is hiding under Prince Ling's control.

278
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,400
He went to talk to the Yan family.

279
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,400
Empress Dowager is furious.

280
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,400
She asked you to go back,

281
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,400
but you were too stubborn to do that.

282
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,400
You should help her.

283
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,400
Your Highness.

284
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,400
You'll get hurt if you continue to kneel like this.

285
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,480
For the sake of others,

286
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,120
to get the Empress Dowager's heart,

287
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,000
please get up quickly.

288
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,480
Miss Xue, you don't have to persuade me.

289
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,360
I thought you were a righteous person.

290
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,120
But yesterday, in the Marquis's Manor,

291
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,080
I saw how you and Mr. Xue were doing.

292
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,480
I was very clear about it.

293
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,880
Yesterday, I tried my best to stop the conflict.

294
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,080
Could Your Highness

295
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,400
insist on me being the main person's daughter-in-law?

296
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,920
To make your father happy?

297
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,640
I don't want to ask you to do that.

298
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,800
I don't know what to do.

299
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,400
But Miss Xue,

300
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,880
you've always heard me out.

301
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,880
We're not like each other.

302
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,080
We're still a bit far apart.

303
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,160
So as to prevent the mother from misunderstanding

304
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,720
and to make other decisions.

305
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,800
Miss Xue,

306
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,480
you'd better get in first.

307
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,120
The Empress Dowager is waiting for you.

308
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,880
Do you think that we're not like each other?

309
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,880
Is it different from others?

310
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,080
Is it possible for a person like you and me

311
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,480
to have a heart like you and me?

312
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,600
Not everyone is like Miss Xue.

313
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,440
Someone still understands what I've said

314
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,640
and supports my wits.

315
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,040
She's going tooly for me

316
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,840
while someone's asking for mercy.

317
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,720
Ask that scoundrel of mai

318
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,320
whether she's our grandson.

319
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,360
Dear aunt,

320
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,960
you just can't help thinking about

321
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,560
I will understand your pain in the next ten days.

322
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,800
But I don't understand.

323
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,520
Your Highness is the most gentle person in the world.

324
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,840
Why did you suddenly make such a big decision?

325
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,760
Yesterday, in the Mansion of Yong Yi,

326
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,400
that Jiang Xue Ning

327
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,880
dared to openly confront your father.

328
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,360
He was in the palace.

329
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,680
He would definitely make everything up.

330
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,880
Your Highness, something bad happened to Miss Pi.

331
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,160
Don't be ridiculous.

332
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,320
Noble Consort Qin is a stupid thing.

333
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,920
What could she have done?

334
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,920
Aunt, I'll take my leave.

335
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,960
You'd better listen to what's in the palace.

336
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,440
Since you're not around,

337
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,880
you can't be around her anymore.

338
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,040
Tell me.

339
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,000
Your Highness,

340
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,240
we sent a message from the Pixiang Hall.

341
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,840
It said that Noble Consort Qin will be in the future for two months.

342
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,520
I secretly searched the coffin.

343
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,640
I pretended to ask for the name of Ping'an Sect.

344
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,760
What did the coffin say?

345
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,200
Although the pulse is weak,

346
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,040
it should be the pulse that is weak.

347
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,880
His Majesty is weak.

348
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,040
He hasn't had any bloodbath in the palace for many years.

349
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,400
Now that this has happened,

350
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,040
do you find out anything?

351
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,000
Your Highness, I don't.

352
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,560
If he killed the child,

353
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,680
he would have been the future Chu Army.

354
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,520
The child he had in his womb

355
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,800
wouldn't have been close to the A.

356
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,120
Our Xue family would have been in trouble if they had been killed.

357
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,920
This coffin

358
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,040
can't be damaged.

359
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,200
Your Highness,

360
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,920
do you want me to keep it secret?

361
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,000
No.

362
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,120
Aunt,

363
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,640
the palace is yours.

364
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,800
His Majesty knows about it.

365
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,720
If something happens to Noble Consort,

366
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,400
His Majesty will never be worried.

367
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,720
In this way,

368
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,960
he will make Aunt and His Majesty leave.

369
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,880
I have an idea.

370
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,080
If we can solve Aunt's problem,

371
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,120
we can rid the person who loves us.

372
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,000
Tell me.

373
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,240
I received the news that you came here with the emperor's order.

374
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,640
So I changed all the people I saw

375
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,760
into my own brothers.

376
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,360
It's more convenient for you to say it.

377
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,280
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

378
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,440
I'm grateful for your help.

379
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,640
I'm sorry for your kindness.

380
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,960
This is my honor to be your advisor.

381
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,360
Open the door.

382
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,120
Please.

383
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,160
The emperor and the crown prince

384
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,440
have been separated from the crown prince.

385
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,360
Don't worry.

386
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,440
It's not a bad thing.

387
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:26,960
You...

388
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,160
You can talk slowly.

389
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,720
I'll wait for you outside.

390
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,280
I hope it's not his fault.

391
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,640
You're welcome.

392
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,580
Ladies and gentlemen,

393
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,840
please help me.

394
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,120
Please help.

395
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,520
Okay.

396
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,600
Please.

397
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,160
I have a lot left.

398
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,600
Xueyuan's case of the imperial court

399
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,240
is not too difficult.

400
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,680
You don't have to worry.

401
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,600
My Lord.

402
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,560
The Xue family hasn't found the evidence in the Marquis's Mansion.

403
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,760
I want to set up a law to settle the Yan family's crime.

404
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,280
I have already understood the heart of the emperor and Xueyuan.

405
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,000
I think they shouldn't be too fast

406
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,880
to deal with your crime of resistance.

407
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,800
But I came here today

408
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,480
to ask you.

409
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,400
Why are you so stubborn and stubborn?

410
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,280
Do you want to be a coward

411
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,880
and live a life of your own?

412
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,320
What do you want?

413
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,600
I want to give the military camp to His Majesty

414
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,480
and keep your life.

415
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,520
In the meantime,

416
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,200
the Xue family will be in great danger

417
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,560
and will be in great danger.

418
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,960
As long as they stay,

419
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,880
there will be a chance

420
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,080
to kill the Xue family.

421
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,520
But

422
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,240
the armed forces in Yan are

423
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,040
due to me

424
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,040
to colluding with the Party of imp unjust and Raumambhei.

425
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,800
Will His Majesty

426
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,240
really inter necessary for such a case?

427
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,480
Don't worry, My Lord.

428
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,480
Hand over the military power

429
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,040
is only lazy one's words.

430
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,280
I willy fra my combat skills with you.

431
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,600
Fine.

432
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,080
As you said.

433
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:35,080
But if you really want to conquer those soldiers,

434
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,080
you need to go to the camp to get them.

435
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,080
I'll write you a letter.

436
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,080
With these, Yan Liu will definitely help you.

437
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,080
Although the result of the blood-sucking monkey manor is different,

438
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,080
Yan Lin has entered the prison after all.

439
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,080
Is it really hard to change the fate of the foundation?

440
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,080
I'll have to find a chance to ask some more guards later.

441
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,080
Okay. That's all for today.

442
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,080
Class is off.

443
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,080
Greetings, Master Song.

444
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,080
Are you still worried about Yan Lin?

445
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,080
Look, the army is not changing.

446
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,080
As long as we investigate,

447
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,080
they will be satisfied.

448
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,080
When I have a good word with Yan Lin,

449
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,080
I won't punish him.

450
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,080
Your Highness, we didn't go to Yan's Mansion yesterday.

451
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,080
Is it really as the rumor says?

452
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,080
We entered the palace yesterday and got in the car.

453
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,080
I heard that you were taken by Mr. Zhang.

454
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,080
I heard that you were taken by Mr. Zhang.

455
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,080
Sister Yao, your Mr. Zhang is so good.

456
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,080
He's not afraid of the Duke of Xue.

457
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,080
What's wrong?

458
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,080
You and Mr. Zhang...

459
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,080
Zhang Zhe is not a good guy.

460
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,080
He's a small man.

461
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,080
He's always a good man.

462
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,080
He's also a good man.

463
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,080
Besides, I've asked him to settle the case.

464
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,080
He's a good man.

465
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,080
So I thought about it.

466
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,080
I should settle it.

467
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,080
He's a good man.

468
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,080
Isn't it like...

469
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,080
Yes, Your Highness.

470
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:36,080
But I don't like people who are too young to be a good man.

471
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,080
They even took the medicine.

472
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,080
Although they're not as good as me,

473
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,080
they might be able to see the fight between Wang Ba and them.

474
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,080
Jiang Xue Ning!

475
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,080
You lost your hand in a moment.

476
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,080
You're the one who lost your hand.

477
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,080
What were you thinking about?

478
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,080
What were you thinking about?

479
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,080
What do you think?

480
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,080
You're not a thief.

481
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,080
You're a coward.

482
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,080
You're a coward.

483
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,080
Of course you're angry.

484
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,080
Don't be so angry.

485
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,080
I suggest you be more considerate.

486
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,080
After all, it's a good fight.

487
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,080
People around you won't be angry.

488
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,080
But if you're so stubborn,

489
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,080
you have to ruin others' reputation.

490
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,080
I dare to let Manjing City know

491
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,080
what you did to get rid of the enemy.

492
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,080
I'm sorry.

493
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,080
So that's how it is.

494
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,080
Yao Xi.

495
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,080
At least you're the daughter of the Young Master.

496
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,080
You're so stubborn.

497
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,080
Your Highness.

498
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,080
Why did Eunuch Huang come here suddenly?

499
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,080
Empress Dowager and Empress Dowager Qin

500
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,080
are at the Imperial Garden to reward the flowers.

501
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,080
I asked the servants to come and invite you

502
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,080
and all the ladies to go to the wedding.

503
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,080
Didn't I ask the servants to go to the wedding

504
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,080
as soon as I woke up?

505
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,080
Why did you call everyone together?

506
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,080
Your Highness,

507
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,080
the flowers are in good condition today.

508
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,080
It's better to be happy than to be sad.

509
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,080
It's this kind of gift.

510
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,080
Let's go then.

511
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,080
What?

512
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,080
Do I have to invite you?

513
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,080
Miss Jiang.

514
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,080
Please.

515
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,080
Your Highness,

516
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,080
the day is still good.

517
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,080
Look, the day is bright.

518
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,080
I passed the Imperial Garden just now.

519
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,080
The flowers are so beautiful.

520
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,080
I'm so happy.

521
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,080
I'm so happy.

522
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,080
I'm so happy.

523
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,080
I'm so happy.

524
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,080
I'm so happy.

525
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,080
I'm so happy.

526
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,080
I'm so happy.

527
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,080
I'm so happy.

528
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,080
I'm so happy.

529
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,080
The flowers are so beautiful.

530
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,080
It's so sweet.

531
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,080
Thank you, Your Highness.

532
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,080
It's a medicine

533
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,080
from Da Yue State.

534
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,080
It's as good as a miracle.

535
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,080
You have to take good care of it.

536
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,080
Thank you, mother.

537
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,080
Thank you, Your Highness.

538
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,760
The fragrance is so delicate.

539
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,600
Could it be that it's from Miss Xue?

540
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,120
I dare not accept Your Highness' compliment.

541
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,240
The fragrance is from another class.

542
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,240
Really?

543
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,040
It's good that Your Highness likes it.

544
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,280
I like it. It's so pretty.

545
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,160
Thank you, Your Highness.

546
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,520
Don't worry. I didn't remind you.

547
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,160
Take care of yourself later.

548
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,880
I'm looking at Eunuch Huang. It's not very good.

549
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,720
I also think it's not right.

550
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,640
Yesterday, Prince Ling told me

551
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,640
that His Highness is going to ask for a favor from His Highness.

552
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,720
I thought that His Highness should be very kind today.

553
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,320
Why did he suddenly come to the palace

554
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,600
and ask everyone to come with him?

555
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,160
I'm afraid that there's something fishy here.

556
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,680
Mother, why are you so excited today?

557
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,680
Sit down.

558
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,760
I was thinking that you must have had a hard time studying.

559
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,840
It's good that you've made some new ideas today.

560
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,760
You can have a try later.

561
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,200
Sit down, Mother.

562
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,160
The day before yesterday, His Majesty once mentioned to me

563
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,520
that Prince Ling chose Consort Ling.

564
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,840
He said that His Highness was still a young man.

565
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,800
He also asked her to become a housewife.

566
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,720
He could be more stable.

567
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,520
His Majesty and His Highness were in a hurry.

568
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,280
I'm afraid that this time, he will have to work hard to make a living.

569
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,200
I'm looking forward to it.

570
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,640
Let me say it.

571
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,320
How could he use such a waste?

572
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,400
Aren't all the girls in Manjing City who have the most wealth and appearance

573
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,720
here?

574
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,000
Let me say it.

575
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,720
Princess Ling chose half a poison.

576
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,440
It's just a matter of two.

577
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,240
She's trying to choose again.

578
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,560
I'm afraid that Consort Ling

579
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,760
is here right now.

580
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,200
She can only give a few things to the elders.

581
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,840
The key is that she has to like it herself.

582
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,240
Okay.

583
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,920
I'll ask you to come here to enjoy the flowers.

584
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,160
Don't just sit here and chat with me.

585
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,360
Go and have a look. Don't just sit there.

586
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,680
Noble Consort Qing, while the flowers are blooming,

587
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,920
go and listen to Xuexuan

588
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,480
to give me two beautiful flowers to give a fair skin.

589
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,200
Empress Dowager, I'm going to

590
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,440
take the blame myself.

591
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,680
Isn't this what a palace maid can do?

592
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,000
Besides, it's so far from Xuexuan.

593
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
It's a long way to go.

594
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,880
Look.

595
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,120
The bigger the person, the more she'll be able to take the blame.

596
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,440
The flowers there are blooming the best.

597
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,240
I also want to see your good looks

598
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,600
so that you can take the blame for me.

599
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,800
How about this?

600
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,560
I'll find someone to accompany you to go with you.

601
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,080
Okay.

602
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,520
Okay.

603
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,400
Thank you, Miss Jiang'er.

604
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,880
I'll take the best of the two for Empress Dowager.

605
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,000
It's a letter from the Chen's daughter

606
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,400
to be able to accompany Noble Consort Qing.

607
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,720
Didn't you say that you were tired of the palace maid?

608
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,520
Do you want to go with me?

609
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,680
After that, I also want to go see her.

610
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,720
I'll go with you.

611
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,200
You've grown up in the palace.

612
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,320
You've been looking for so many years.

613
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,640
You haven't been tired yet?

614
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,320
Don't go.

615
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,960
Empress Dowager is worried that the Chen's daughter

616
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,760
will take care of you.

617
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,600
But the Chen's daughter is so clumsy.

618
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,240
She only has to contact Noble Consort.

619
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,080
Why don't you

620
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,640
go with Miss Xue?

621
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,720
It's better to talk.

622
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,920
It's rare that Miss Jiang'er is so stubborn.

623
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,720
She's just a little bit far away.

624
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,920
It's good that all of you are here.

625
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,720
Why don't you all go ahead?

626
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,920
Okay.

627
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,120
You all be careful.

628
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,320
Sit down.

629
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,120
We can chat.

630
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,920
You obviously don't like me.

631
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,320
But you insist on me accompanying Noble Consort into the flower.

632
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,520
It seems that your plan is to be with Noble Consort.

633
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,920
It's not that you can't stay here for a long time.

634
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,120
You should hurry and leave.

635
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,320
There are so many flowers everywhere.

636
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,320
You all go and fold yourself.

637
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,920
Don't follow me.

638
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,320
Miss Fang and Miss Zhou,

639
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,920
why don't we go there and have a look?

640
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,520
Let's go.

641
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,920
Miss Jiang'er,

642
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:15,120
Empress Dowager has already said that she will accompany me.

643
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,320
Your Highness,

644
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,520
the Chen's daughter is in a bad mood.

645
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,320
She has a stomachache and needs to go to the flower shop.

646
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,320
Please excuse me.

647
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,320
Wait.

648
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,720
Didn't you just get well?

649
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,920
This... Okay, okay. Go ahead.

650
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,120
Thank you, Your Highness.

651
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,720
What's wrong with her? She is so weird.

652
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,320
Your Highness, you have something to know.

653
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,920
Miss Jiang'er has always been with me.

654
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,720
She used to give us lessons in the past.

655
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,720
She is unhappy.

656
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,120
She also likes to take a break from her health.

657
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,520
She doesn't think about giving me face.

658
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,120
What?

659
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,120
You even asked her not to go to the flower shop with me?

660
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,120
Miss Jiang is so thoughtful.

661
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,520
Where can a Chen's daughter be so thoughtful?

662
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,720
But she is always in a bad mood.

663
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,320
She wanted to be in the Tai'an Hall that day.

664
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,920
Even Empress Dowager couldn't help her.

665
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,320
She is such a good person.

666
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,720
Okay.

667
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,320
I heard about her in the Tai'an Hall.

668
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,920
But I didn't know what she was thinking.

669
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,120
Come, tell me what happened.

670
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,320
That day,

671
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,720
Empress Dowager asked us to go to the Tai'an Hall.

672
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,320
Empress Dowager is right.

673
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,520
I left.

674
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,720
I don't think anything happened.

675
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,520
That day, that hairpin was so long.

676
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,120
No.

677
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,720
She was so worried about her hairpin.

678
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,720
We were all scared.

679
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,720
What's this?

680
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,720
What's this?

681
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,720
What's this?

682
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,720
What's this?

683
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,720
What's this?

684
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,320
What's this?

685
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,320
What's this?

686
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,320
What's this?

687
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,320
What's this?

688
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,320
What's this?

689
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,920
How are you, Your Highness? Are you hurt?

690
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,920
I'm scared to death.

691
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,720
My face is okay, right?

692
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,320
Don't worry. You are fine.

693
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,320
Your Highness, do you want to move around?

694
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,120
Let's see if you are feeling unwell.

695
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,520
I'm not feeling well.

696
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,720
What's wrong with Miss Yao?

697
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,720
You are so careless.

698
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,920
You are pushing her down.

699
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,720
I'm not.

700
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,920
When I come here, I will see it with my own eyes.

701
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,520
How can I change my mind?

702
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,920
Instead of saying the responsibility,

703
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,920
why don't we see if Noble Consort Gu is fine?

704
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,320
If anything goes wrong, no one can get rid of her.

705
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,720
Yes. Noble Consort Gu is safe and sound.

706
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,720
Your Highness, what's wrong?

707
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,720
I feel a little uncomfortable.

708
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,920
Could it be that

709
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,120
this place is cold and easy to get hurt?

710
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,320
Your Highness, you are in a deep state of shock.

711
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,120
Why don't you go back to the Pixiang Hall first?

712
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,720
No!

713
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,320
Your Highness, the girl who is pregnant is considered to be a noble.

714
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,720
She should stay here.

715
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,320
After the doctor is done with the diagnosis, she can move.

716
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,520
Then...

717
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,920
Since Miss Jiang said so,

718
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,120
it's not far from the Imperial Medical Academy.

719
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,120
Instead of letting Her Highness blow the wind here,

720
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:31,520
why don't we help Her Highness to go to the Imperial Medical Academy?

721
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,320
Okay, okay.

722
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,120
Your Highness.

723
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,320
I have been at home and had some medical skills.

724
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,520
I know that if this person falls and gets fat,

725
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,520
he might get injured.

726
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,720
Although this place is cold, the doctor hasn't diagnosed it yet.

727
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,920
We mustn't move.

728
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,920
I... I won't move.

729
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,320
You can't move.

730
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,720
If you get injured, you won't be able to dance for His Majesty anymore.

731
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,320
Miss Xue,

732
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,320
go and help me promote the doctor.

733
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,520
I won't move anymore.

734
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,520
Yes.

735
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,520
Your Highness.

736
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,520
Your Highness.

737
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,520
Your Highness.

738
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,520
Your Highness.

739
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,520
Your Highness.

740
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,520
Congratulations to Your Highness.

741
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,920
Noble Consort of the Pixiang Palace is pregnant.

742
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,520
The Imperial Medical Academy has just been sold.

743
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,920
Her Highness the Empress is here to congratulate Your Highness.

744
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,320
Really? Really?

745
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,320
Really?

746
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,520
Really?

747
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,320
How about you go and see if you believe me?

748
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,320
Hurry! Hurry!

749
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,320
The Pixiang Palace is at a cost!

750
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,520
You should be careful.

751
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,720
You're just doing this.

752
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,320
You've lost a chance to get rid of it.

753
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,720
If Noble Consort of the Pixiang Palace really had the prince,

754
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,520
how would she have been placed?

755
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,320
How would the Xue family have been raised?

756
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,320
You've disappointed me so much.

757
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,120
What did His Majesty say?

758
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,520
Did he find out anything?

759
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,320
I've already taken Noble Consort of the Pixiang Palace

760
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,520
away from the village.

761
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,120
No matter who comes to investigate,

762
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,920
it will only be an accident.

763
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,420
That's the best way.

764
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:14,520
Or else, the Xue family will all be in the same boat.

765
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,720
Don't worry, aunt.

766
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,020
Noble Consort of the Pixiang Palace is pregnant.

767
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,420
She's still pregnant.

768
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,420
There's still a chance to get her back.

769
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:23,320
There's also that Jiang Xue Hui.

770
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,320
I thought that

771
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,920
I'd let Jiang Xue Ning get punished.

772
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,020
I'd let her be implicated and be able to get rid of her illness.

773
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:32,320
I didn't expect that she's also a powerful person.

774
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,820
The Jiang family is all in trouble.

775
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:38,420
If I don't get rid of her illness, I won't be able to settle down.

776
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,320
I didn't know that you were so wise.

777
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,620
You were not well-known,

778
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,320
and you were a good person.

779
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,520
It's really because you raised your mother.

780
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,320
How did you find Noble Consort of the Pixiang Palace pregnant?

781
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,920
I didn't know that.

782
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,720
But looking at the situation today,

783
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,320
I had to ask her to think more.

784
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,020
Now that this has happened,

785
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,420
it's a success.

786
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,520
I'm afraid that it's not all because of your kindness.

787
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,620
You're not a person who's not a good person.

788
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,720
I'm afraid that today, when I heard the Empress Dowager say

789
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,420
that it was about the death of the Prince Consort,

790
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,220
that affected you.

791
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,720
In this matter, Noble Consort of the Pixiang Palace will definitely remember your kindness.

792
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,020
If His Majesty knows, he will also add something.

793
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:22,020
But aren't you afraid of getting the Empress Dowager's forgiveness?

794
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,220
There's something to get and there must be something to give.

795
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,820
How can anyone in this world be able to let everyone see their own fault?

796
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,420
If you get the punishment, then you'll get the punishment.

797
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:32,420
If you don't get the punishment, then you'll be the one to teach me.

798
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,120
You can think that way.

799
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,420
Then I'll help you to get the punishment in advance.

800
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,420
Sister Ning.

801
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,620
If today, according to their plan,

802
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,820
if the only thing that's going to happen to His Majesty is the Empress Dowager,

803
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,620
I'm afraid that it's hard for you to escape.

804
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:52,020
After you think about it, what will you do?

805
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,120
I have my own idea.

806
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,820
Instead of worrying about me,

807
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,620
why don't you worry about yourself first?

808
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,520
You are the one who is the Prince of Lin Zi's new subordinate.

809
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,420
Today, you are in a big trouble again.

810
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:05,420
I'm afraid that you are already on the way to deal with your moves.

811
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:19,620
After Shen Lang died, the Crown Prince of State was sent to the Shen Realm to guard.

812
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,520
The character of the Shen Realm was weak and weak.

813
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,820
It was powerless to fight against the Xue family.

814
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,420
That's why the State of Ding State's imperial guard party kept on fighting.

815
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,320
They fought with the soldiers at the border.

816
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:36,940
They were ambushed by the

817
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,320
Imperial Guards.

818
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,620
If the child was born in a good way,

819
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:45,220
and if he was born as a boy,

820
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,520
then everything that happened from now on

821
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,120
will be the same as the last time.

822
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,020
It seems that no matter whether it's a person or a person,

823
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,020
everything can be changed.

824
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,420
The Yan family will surely have hope.

825
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,020
Are you sure that you want to hand over this item?

826
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:16,120
Do you know that this is the most powerful army in the world?

827
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,820
If you have this item,

828
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,820
you... you don't have to say that you are revenge.

829
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:22,220
You just want to be the emperor. You can even be the emperor.

830
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:25,020
As long as the Yan family is safe and sound,

831
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,220
what is the use of my item?

832
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,420
I already followed your order to

833
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,920
protect the people of the Palace of Justice alive.

834
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:36,520
But there are already the Prince's location and the Yan line in the middle.

835
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,220
What if the news of you being sent back to Jinling?

836
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,220
Then we will take the opportunity to

837
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,720
borrow the imperial guards and

838
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,620
clear all the enemies in the capital.

839
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,820
Even if they want to send the news,

840
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,620
there is no way to leave.

841
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:54,420
Yes, that's the truth.

842
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,220
But how do you explain to the court?

843
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:59,820
You know about the news of the rebels.

844
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,420
Sir.

845
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,620
His Majesty sent Zhao Ning to the Palace.

846
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,620
Thank you for coming.

847
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,220
Your Majesty.

848
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,620
With the imperial guards back,

849
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:25,220
Noble Consort Qin has already been in the palace for two months.

850
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,220
I am very pleased.

851
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:30,220
I am discussing with the Prime Minister about the grand event in the world.

852
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,820
Chang Yan Dao, the people are happy and the spirit is good.

853
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,820
It seems that His Majesty is also like that.

854
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,220
But I came today

855
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,820
to report to Your Majesty about another good news.

856
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,220
I am not as good as I was.

857
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:43,620
I will take the Yan family's seal back with me.

858
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,020
With the plan,

859
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,820
I will take the Yan family's seal back.

860
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,820
Give it to me quickly.

861
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,420
Today, the sword says that

862
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,220
the gold age is as good as the stars.

863
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,420
It is indeed like that.

864
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,220
After the military power,

865
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,220
the court has someone in the back.

866
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,820
It is really a great money.

867
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,220
I dare to ask you,

868
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:21,220
I have sent hundreds of people to find this item.

869
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,820
How did you know?

870
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:26,020
From the front, I know that

871
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,420
I will tell the people to appreciate it.

872
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,020
I will tell them.

873
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:33,420
I cannot believe you.

874
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:18,420
The light is not dark,

875
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:24,620
but I do not know when the snow falls.

876
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:29,220
You came here.

877
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:33,020
I am brave and willing to exchange

878
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:36,820
the other half's worth.

879
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:40,620
I thought I would let go of the memory.

880
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:44,420
The best choice.

881
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:48,020
I am a wind-wrapped thief.

882
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:51,820
I cannot untie the dream.

883
00:44:51,820 --> 00:45:01,220
But the floating sand is snowing.

884
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:40,580
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
