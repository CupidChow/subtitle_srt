1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
As long as I can enter the Ning'an Palace

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,200
and pay all the price

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,600
I will be willing to do my best

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,400
The End

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,800
The End

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,800
Everything seems to be a dream

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,400
I have owed a lot of people

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,800
Chaozhe, help me

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,600
I will be a good person after this

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
The End

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
I will be the one to take the favor

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,800
There are some things you can't give me

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
But what about them?

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,000
The life you chose is for Mr. You

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,400
In this world, everyone has the right to escape

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,000
But I can't

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,000
I want to regret it

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,400
and do the wrong thing

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,200
and try my best to return

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Does Mr. Zhang believe that everything is decided?

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I am more willing to believe in the future

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,000
Your Highness

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,800
Your Highness

25
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,400
We will return to the Nile

26
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,200
We will return to the Nile

27
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,000
Nian'an, what are you doing?

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,200
In the Nile

29
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,600
there is always a pair of hands

30
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,600
that can break everything back to the original position

31
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,400
The revenge is long and the wish is long

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,600
Who are you in the end?

33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,600
The Emperor of Fan Hua is so long-winded

34
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,000
and he is so ridiculous

35
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,900
Wolf Break

36
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,900
Episode 25

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
An An Ruman

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,560
Smart baby, He Fei He

39
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,480
Fei He is your fan

40
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,480
Please take a look at An An Ruman

41
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Miss Jiang

42
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,800
Can I come in?

43
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,400
Come in

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Wow

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,720
This is the famous tiger from the capital

46
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,880
It's so different

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,480
to be dressed like this

48
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,880
Don't talk nonsense

49
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,080
I don't eat this

50
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,200
If you say so

51
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,800
I'm sad

52
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,160
Your figure

53
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,360
is from a large amount of material

54
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,560
I picked it out for you

55
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,280
How about it?

56
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,000
Do I have a good taste in my eyes?

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,760
Is it better than that little treasure?

58
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,920
But you say

59
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,320
Why does this old man

60
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,400
hide so many women's food in the coffin?

61
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,360
Is he hiding a woman?

62
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,120
Okay, okay

63
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,040
Tonight

64
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,560
I've prepared a lot of good wine

65
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,160
Let's not be drunk

66
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,280
You want to go too?

67
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,280
I've spent so much money

68
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,200
to help you

69
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,600
I can't even eat a meal

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,080
Okay

71
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,040
I admit that I am a selfish

72
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,400
Isn't this Xie Shao's plan

73
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,960
to take me back to the capital?

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,480
I'm a man of the dragon

75
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,440
I'm not a man of the road

76
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,360
You don't have to say

77
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,240
You are the most beloved

78
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,200
girl

79
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,400
girl

80
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,200
Mr. Zhang is good at work now

81
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,880
He must be promoted when he goes back

82
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,000
I don't have any other ability

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,480
But I have a good taste in the world

84
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,360
So

85
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,320
Please, Miss Jiang

86
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,440
Take me with you this time

87
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,640
Yanxue and the two families are the world's great family

88
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,040
I really don't know how to give birth to you

89
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,520
Miss Jiang, it's cold outside

90
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,440
You put this on

91
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,720
I found it for you first

92
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,960
Miss Jiang

93
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,760
Wait

94
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,720
There is a treasure

95
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,600
You wait

96
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,440
It's snowing

97
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,120
Miss Jiang

98
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,080
You ask

99
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,200
100 years of Chen Niang

100
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,920
Miss Jiang, you are absolutely strong

101
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,520
Right

102
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,600
Mr. Xie

103
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,720
Mr. Xie

104
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,440
Later, Miss Jiang will be promoted

105
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,400
Do you want to go?

106
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,760
No need

107
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,040
I still have work to do

108
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,360
Work

109
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,600
You can do it anytime

110
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,000
Miss Jiang's body

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,320
Only once a year

112
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,760
You are not in good health

113
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,480
It's cold outside

114
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,080
You should rest well

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Don't

116
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,320
That's the way it is

117
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,560
You can have fun

118
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,000
Miss Jiang

119
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,880
Mr. Zhang

120
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,040
Then let's end it here

121
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,120
I hope it's ok

122
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,000
Then it is

123
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,520
Then we just pass each other

124
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,680
book

125
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,720
Passprint

126
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,120
OK

127
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,160
So little Xueyan 그리고 list

128
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,880
Mr. Zhang asks me to come

129
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,680
I deglaze it so I can just leave it alone finally

130
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,480
and just get theness out and nuclear vomiting.

131
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,680
It doesn't mater if that's what I need,

132
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,720
at least I can just admit it can't 오케이 prawda.

133
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,600
Instantly thank you for teaching me this feature.

134
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,360
I really want to learn it in the future.

135
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,120
Then Qian Feng, I will,

136
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,560
next time we go relax in the Tang Land of десяth.

137
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,720
Still no one can rest in peace?

138
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,720
I hope you can take good care of me.

139
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,720
Thank you again.

140
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,720
Is Young Master Ding Fei going back to the capital?

141
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,720
My surname is Xue Ma.

142
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,720
Even if he's a filial son for the Nidang School,

143
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,720
that's still a good name.

144
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,720
In the end, he still wants to be filial to His Majesty.

145
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,720
But the people in Tongzhou know you.

146
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,720
What do you plan to tell the capital?

147
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,720
I'm a filial son.

148
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,720
I should have been rich in the Nidang School.

149
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,720
But these years, in the capital,

150
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,720
I've been living a life of a useless person.

151
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,720
They're trying to get me on the surface.

152
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,720
They're trying to get me on the surface.

153
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
It's just a name.

154
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720
It's all fake.

155
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,720
This time, I should have taken the responsibility

156
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,720
for what belongs to me.

157
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,720
Ding...

158
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,720
Enough.

159
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,720
Don't talk about my business.

160
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,720
Today, Miss Jiang is the main character.

161
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,720
In the end, I'll be

162
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,720
a girl with a long life.

163
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,720
Now, I can borrow the flower to offer my blessings

164
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
as your birthday gift.

165
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,720
Mr. Zhang,

166
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,720
won't that broken umbrella be your gift?

167
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,720
The wind blows, the rain falls.

168
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,720
Everything is in order.

169
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,720
Everything is in order.

170
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,720
I'm in peace.

171
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
I know it's late.

172
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,720
I didn't have time to prepare.

173
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,720
I just want to draw a portrait for you

174
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,720
and give you some words.

175
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,720
I'll leave it to you.

176
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,720
No, I like it.

177
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,720
I like it.

178
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,720
Mr. Zhang is really talented

179
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,720
and a man of no shame.

180
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
Miss Jiang, you're over the moon.

181
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,720
I just think

182
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
this journey is a bit dangerous.

183
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,720
But the distance from the capital

184
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,720
and the rules are also a rare memory.

185
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,720
Okay, okay.

186
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,720
It's cold.

187
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
Eat some meat.

188
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,720
It's warm.

189
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,720
Here, try this.

190
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,720
Thank you.

191
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
Is there anything you want to say?

192
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,720
Nothing.

193
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,720
I just suddenly remembered

194
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,720
that Li Jing promised my mother

195
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,720
to drive her back before the New Year.

196
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,720
She's not well every winter.

197
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,720
She's not feeling well.

198
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,720
I wonder if she's doing well

199
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,720
when I'm not at home.

200
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,720
I can't tell that

201
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,720
Mr. Zhang is still a filial son.

202
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,720
Look at him.

203
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,720
He's actually a man of no shame.

204
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
Okay.

205
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,720
I, Xue Dingfei,

206
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,720
like to be loyal and loyal.

207
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,720
Here, Mr. Zhang.

208
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,720
I toast to you.

209
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,720
I've read on the book that

210
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,720
there are old customs in Tongzhou.

211
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,720
Every year,

212
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,720
the whole city is filled with fireworks.

213
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,720
The wind and rain are in the air.

214
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,720
There's no doubt about it.

215
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:55,680
This is the real

216
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,720
fireworks.

217
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,720
I wish Miss Jiang

218
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,720
a happy and successful life.

219
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,720
Okay.

220
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,720
I don't dare to ask for anything.

221
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,720
I just hope that

222
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,720
the people I care about

223
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,720
can be safe.

224
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,720
Miss Jiang,

225
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,720
you reminded me of the Yan's death.

226
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,720
The Hou family's case

227
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,720
is the case of the new year

228
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,720
in the Naili Mountain.

229
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,720
As long as we can get rid of this disease,

230
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,720
the Hou family will have a future.

231
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,720
Do you believe

232
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,720
that everything is decided?

233
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,720
I don't think so.

234
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,720
I don't think so.

235
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,720
I don't think so.

236
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,720
I think that

237
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,720
everything is decided.

238
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,720
It's not about the bad power

239
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,720
or the bad spirit.

240
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,720
I'd rather believe

241
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,720
what happened to me

242
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,720
in the past.

243
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,720
I thought

244
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,720
people's abilities are great.

245
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,720
They can change their fate.

246
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,720
But now I feel

247
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,720
that people are so small.

248
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,720
Even if there are some things

249
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,720
that can't be separated

250
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,720
from the past,

251
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,720
let's say that

252
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,720
I used to...

253
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,720
I used to be

254
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,720
the crown prince of the Duke of Ding.

255
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,720
But

256
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
I had a day of

257
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
being a matchmaker.

258
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,720
I was so busy with my work

259
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,720
that I couldn't take a rest.

260
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,720
But now

261
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,720
I'm back to my old days.

262
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,720
I'm going to

263
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,720
re-enact the new year.

264
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,720
So,

265
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,720
please sit down.

266
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,720
Please.

267
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,720
Have a drink.

268
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,720
Come on.

269
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,720
I want a drink.

270
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,720
But why should I care about her?

271
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,720
What's her fate?

272
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,720
What's her fate?

273
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,720
Drink it.

274
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,720
You're right, Young Master.

275
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,720
Although there is a bad spirit in a person,

276
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
as long as you do your best,

277
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,720
there's no chance

278
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,720
you can change it.

279
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
Come on.

280
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,720
Cheers.

281
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,660
This would be extremely tasty

282
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,320
How about it?

283
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,020
Eat!

284
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,660
The nightwalk till solitude

285
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:22,740
Well.

286
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:28,500
And this one here before my grandfather.

287
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,340
Don't hurt me.

288
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,900
He just wants to take you in and put yourself in there.

289
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,260
Seems that Mr. Zhang feels guilty.

290
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,260
This Old Hmong sort of american thing.

291
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:50,780
Young Master.

292
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,460
Young Mistress lives alone overseas.

293
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,380
Young Master lives alone overseas.

294
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,060
Young Master lives alone overseas.

295
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,780
Young Master lives alone overseas.

296
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,620
May you be well!

297
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,380
As Long as you can.

298
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,020
Mr. Zhang, are you all right?

299
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,780
I'm fine because I'm on my way.

300
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,340
Keep your eyes closed, Miss Zhang.

301
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,620
Not now.

302
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:26,940
Let it go.

303
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,740
What are you doing in this town?

304
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,500
Is this Hamish attire즈?

305
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,460
An animal?

306
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,460
Yes.

307
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,460
Close the door.

308
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,460
Yes.

309
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,460
What are you laughing at?

310
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,460
I suddenly remembered that the first time I saw you was at the secret shop.

311
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,460
You were not in a good mood.

312
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,460
You were indeed different from the female lead.

313
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,460
If you were to be replaced by someone else,

314
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,460
I'm afraid you would have been exposed to the evil.

315
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,460
You are right.

316
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,460
I thought I would see Nantou again that day.

317
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,460
I just made a promise,

318
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,460
but I didn't know how to break it.

319
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,460
Luckily, you saved my life.

320
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,460
We were in a hurry.

321
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,460
It seems that it was all because of the case.

322
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,460
It's also a fate.

323
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,460
You look at it from the outside.

324
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,460
You are just a 18-year-old girl.

325
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,460
But you have no fear.

326
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,460
You are truly determined.

327
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,460
You have experienced a lot.

328
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,460
I was born in Jiangfu.

329
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,460
I grew up with my mother since I was a child.

330
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,460
I was not afraid of the sky and the earth.

331
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,460
After my mother left,

332
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,460
I returned to the capital.

333
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,460
When the sky was falling,

334
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,460
I could make the mistakes

335
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,460
and make the effort to make up for them.

336
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,460
Others can make mistakes,

337
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,460
but I can't.

338
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,460
The more I know,

339
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,460
the more I feel like the days are far away.

340
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,460
So,

341
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,460
you want to help Master Yan in the end.

342
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,460
I think Master Yan

343
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,460
must be a very important friend

344
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,460
after you returned to the capital.

345
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,460
I think you are right.

346
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,460
You are a very important friend after you returned to the capital.

347
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,460
After you return to the capital,

348
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,460
you will be in the court.

349
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,460
And that young master Ding Fei

350
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,460
is so filial.

351
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,460
I wonder what's going on.

352
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,460
The Xue family is not in a good mood.

353
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,460
They are thinking about the way to make a living,

354
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,460
but they are not.

355
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,460
Although the dead can't find the dead,

356
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,460
I think the Xue family is better than the Xue family.

357
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,460
Do you think the dead are reliable?

358
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,460
I can't say.

359
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,460
But I don't think the one who uses the dead

360
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,460
will make the mistakes.

361
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,460
Is it beautiful?

362
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,460
You are very close to the girl.

363
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,460
I don't like to talk.

364
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,460
But I have always had the tradition of

365
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,460
talking about the dead.

366
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,460
I have never been good at it.

367
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,460
I can't rely on the talent.

368
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,460
If you come again,

369
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,460
you will be the young master of the dead.

370
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,460
It's better to give it to you.

371
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,460
You have been so considerate.

372
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,460
The Xue family is not in a good mood.

373
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,460
The wind is so gentle,

374
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,460
but it's not enough.

375
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:14,460
You have been so carefree.

376
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,460
Now you are almost dead.

377
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:24,460
You have been so carefree.

378
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,460
But the young master is so considerate.

379
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,460
I don't think he cares about the need for the pre-required.

380
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,460
The silence is not high,

381
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,460
the image is not good.

382
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,460
The wind is so gentle,

383
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,460
but it's not enough.

384
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,460
The wind is so carefree,

385
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,460
but it's not enough.

386
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,460
It's so simple.

387
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,460
But there is no other thought?

388
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,460
Yes.

389
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,460
Now I have it.

390
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,460
I have to wash myself often.

391
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,460
I have to be safe.

392
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,460
As long as I don't devide by others.

393
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,460
I am okay.

394
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,460
Mr knee's condition has been so serious.

395
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:15,460
Youitary leaderbal is the best option to help levelKA.

396
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,140
If ask the safety of your

397
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,460
young master,

398
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,460
I hope you turn a blind eye to pass Clinton S discord.

399
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,460
无気持什么季必寻押给.

400
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,940
Zhang Zhe is a criminal.

401
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,780
Everyone knows that Zhang Zhe is a criminal.

402
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,140
How could he be so impulsive?

403
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,340
It's obvious that he's a criminal.

404
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,580
Zhang Zhe, what's going on?

405
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:43,820
I...

406
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,620
owe you my gratitude.

407
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,380
Your Majesty.

408
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,820
All this...

409
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,540
is all because of Chen Yiren.

410
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,820
It has nothing to do with others.

411
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,060
I beg you to let Zhou Ying go.

412
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,740
I didn't expect to harm you.

413
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,380
I know you hate me.

414
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,300
You're so innocent.

415
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,900
You're so wise.

416
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,580
Even the judge doesn't dare to give you a verdict.

417
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,580
You're a criminal.

418
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,580
But why do you have to judge yourself?

419
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,460
I'm the one who should be punished.

420
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,460
I...

421
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,020
Three days ago,

422
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,300
the dentist told me

423
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,820
that my mother was dead.

424
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,140
The Empress might not know

425
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,420
that she would study for me

426
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,900
and give me a new treatment.

427
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,780
She would leave a scar on Wei Han.

428
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,580
But she wouldn't believe that I would do such a thing.

429
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,900
She could beу

430
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,500
to knock on people when she wasاصutting the polo.

431
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,340
But nobody dared to remove the linen against me.

432
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,140
She pushed it in

433
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,100
for three days every three days.

434
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,980
Sherors countless times and

435
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,700
yet could not break the door for people.

436
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,000
I was followed by much

437
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I was left with seven days to be found.

438
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It's my fault.

439
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm sorry.

440
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Can you forgive me?

441
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I just want you to live.

442
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Zhang Zhe, I won't allow you to die.

443
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It's okay.

444
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Your Highness, you should go.

445
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I have a bad feeling for you.

446
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm not good at it.

447
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm a official, but I'm a criminal.

448
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm not good at it.

449
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Mother raised me.

450
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm not good at it.

451
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm just a little girl.

452
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I've been acting like this.

453
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I don't care what happens.

454
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
No.

455
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
You're a good person.

456
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I've seen you before.

457
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You're the best person.

458
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Then, Your Highness,

459
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
even if I save you,

460
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'll go.

461
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
What's wrong with you?

462
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
You're not feeling well?

463
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I just drank too much.

464
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I'm sorry. I'll go back.

465
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'll go back.

466
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Miss Jiang.

467
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Don't think I know anything.

468
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You're pretending to be sick, right?

469
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Okay, don't worry.

470
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Even if you're hurt,

471
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
you must give me a flower sauce.

472
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Get up.

473
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Miss, Miss Jiang.

474
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Madam said that

475
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
there can't be any injuries on the body.

476
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
She's clearly acting.

477
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
She's sent someone to ask for a doctor.

478
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
If she's really brave,

479
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
she won't spare her.

480
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Yue'er.

481
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Mother, she's acting.

482
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Doctor Anqing, go and see her.

483
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
She was fine last night.

484
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
What's wrong with her?

485
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Yes, madam.

486
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I'm sorry.

487
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Madam, this is a wedding dress.

488
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
What?

489
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You little bitch.

490
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You scumbag.

491
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Madam, there's someone here.

492
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I'm so shameless.

493
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Mother, you're wrong.

494
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
It's all Xiaoxu's fault.

495
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I hope you can help me

496
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
to get rid of the grudge.

497
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
You two are so bold.

498
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
How dare you!

499
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
You're so mean.

500
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,460
You really treat me as a

501
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,460
hundred-year-old uncle.

502
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,000
I'll drag you to the police now.

503
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I'll punish you for being a traitor.

504
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Guards!

505
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Don't worry, mother.

506
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Don't worry.

507
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Xiaoxu brought this dress

508
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
with sincerity.

509
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
What do you mean?

510
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Let's see.

511
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
These three thousand taels

512
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
are not just a few girls.

513
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It's your enemy

514
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
who can marry you.

515
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
No one in the modern world

516
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
knows that

517
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Uncle Qingyuan is not as rich as before.

518
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Or else,

519
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
he wouldn't have sold his daughter.

520
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I got a girl.

521
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
You're a woman.

522
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
You're not as good as before.

523
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
You're so generous.

524
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
You're a commoner.

525
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
You're a commoner.

526
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
You're a commoner.

527
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
This is all true.

528
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
How can you say it's a commoner?

529
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
The marriage is a big deal.

530
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
It's not different from business.

531
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It's not just a two-way deal.

532
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It's a good deal.

533
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
If it's not good,

534
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
the guests will be jealous

535
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
when the three girls

536
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
are married.

537
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Maybe they'll be left behind.

538
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
How dare you threaten me!

539
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Come on!

540
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
So you've figured it out.

541
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I'm the only one who can

542
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
make you so scared.

543
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You're so serious.

544
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
What's the point

545
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
of our family

546
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
to be so scared?

547
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
These are the accounts

548
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
that the father-in-law

549
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
signed outside.

550
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Xiaoxu has helped him to pay it back.

551
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
You're the mother of the family.

552
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Is it a two-way deal

553
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
or a three-way deal

554
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
or a two-way deal?

555
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
You should figure it out.

556
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Boss Li.

557
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Come in.

558
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Didn't you tell me

559
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
to get into the belly?

560
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Why did the doctor say...

561
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I...

562
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I told the doctor

563
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
that I was pregnant.

564
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
And I told Mrs. You

565
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
that the flesh in your belly

566
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
was mine.

567
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I think Mrs. You mentioned Qin.

568
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
She promised to marry you to me.

569
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
But...

570
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Listen to me.

571
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I didn't say

572
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
you should marry me.

573
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I just used this trick

574
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
to help you get out of trouble.

575
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Although it's a bad trick,

576
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
it's the fastest and the most complete

577
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
way to get you out of the family.

578
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Then...

579
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Then you should have told me earlier.

580
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Yes.

581
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
But that day was really hasty.

582
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I didn't have time

583
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
to explain to you in detail.

584
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And you were so naive.

585
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I was afraid that you wouldn't

586
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
have the time to delay the time.

587
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
So I...

588
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
It was all my fault.

589
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Mrs. You.

590
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Mrs. You.

591
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Even if you blame me,

592
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
even if you didn't take the initiative,

593
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I still would help you.

594
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
During this time,

595
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I saw you enter the hotel,

596
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
pay the rent,

597
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
and come to the restaurant.

598
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Even the big building was built.

599
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
You've done enough

600
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
to do things that you didn't dare to do.

601
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Although...

602
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
it's for Miss Jian'er's sake,

603
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
what about your own feelings?

604
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Although you look timid and weak,

605
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I can feel that

606
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
you're hiding a strong heart.

607
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Maybe you don't even know that

608
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
when you're talking business,

609
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
you're blinded by the light.

610
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I think your heaven and earth

611
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
shouldn't be just a house.

612
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
You might not be able to live a life

613
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
with only your parents.

614
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
If you want,

615
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I'll take you away.

616
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
From now on,

617
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
you can do anything

618
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
you want to do

619
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
in the outer space.

620
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
You want to be a businesswoman.

621
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
You want to have power.

622
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
In short,

623
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
you have to choose

624
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
everything.

625
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
The person who can do anything

626
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
is Mr. Lv.

627
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I'm so impressed.

628
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
You...

629
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Don't cry.

630
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
People outside like you

631
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
really think that

632
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I...

633
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I'm afraid that you'll be alright.

634
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
In short,

635
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
let's get out of the You family first.

636
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Let's make a deal first.

637
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
If you want to be free

638
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
in the future,

639
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
let's stay in the river

640
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
and live in the water.

641
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Ready?

642
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I've already written the contract.

643
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
You can feel at ease

644
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
with this.

645
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I'm asking you.

646
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Am I

647
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
the most beautiful person

648
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
in the world?

649
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
What's going on

650
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
in the country

651
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
at night?

652
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Thank you, young master.

653
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
It's alright.

654
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I just think

655
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I didn't

656
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
kill all the rebels

657
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
in their mouth

658
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
to find out anything.

659
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
What a pity.

660
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I heard that

661
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Mr. Xie was in the rebellion

662
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
and found a secret weapon.

663
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
It seems that

664
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
this person is Ding Fei.

665
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

666
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I forgot to thank you for your kindness.

667
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
But the secret weapon

668
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
is indeed a secret weapon.

669
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Others call him

670
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Mr. Ding Fei.

671
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
But I remember

672
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
the secret letter

673
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
that was mentioned

674
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
by the former emperor

675
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
and the prince of Pingnan.

676
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
It seems that

677
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
he's still alive.

678
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
There are many people

679
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
who are the same in this world.

680
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I'm afraid

681
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
it's just a coincidence.

682
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
But how do you think

683
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
this Mr. Ding Fei

684
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
is not a good looking person?

685
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
But there are still

686
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
some similarities

687
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
between the eyes of the emperor.

688
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Disparations?

689
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I think

690
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Mr. Xie

691
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
is a bit too harsh.

692
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Isn't this a good news?

693
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Why is the emperor...

694
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I just

695
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
don't believe it.

696
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
If it's true,

697
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
then congratulations to the emperor

698
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
and the prince of Pingnan.

699
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It's not easy to be a prince.

700
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
There are people in the imperial harem.

701
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
But there are many people

702
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
who are in the imperial harem.

703
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Mr. Ding Fei,

704
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
why don't you meet

705
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
this Mr. Ding Fei?

706
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Haven't you seen him for 20 years?

707
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
He's a bit too close to you.

708
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
The black wind is blowing.

709
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
The prince of Pingnan is strong.

710
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I'm afraid that

711
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
the wind is not strong enough.

712
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I'm going back to my room.

713
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I'm going back to my room.

714
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I'm going back to my room.

715
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Mr. Ding Fei

716
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Mr. Ding Fei

717
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Yanjia Jun has found the way out.

718
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
It's great.

719
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
We can finally go back to the capital.

720
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
But Mr. Ding Fei

721
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Is it okay?

722
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
What if he can't marry the court?

723
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Don't worry.

724
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I have my own arrangement.

725
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
You stay in Tongzhou, watch the jade bell.

726
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Once the wind blows, the first time, write a letter to report.

727
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
How is the arrangement?

728
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I have to find a reliable team of Li Bai Hu personally.

729
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I will be the traitor and steal the way.

730
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I will be ambushed in the city.

731
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I will wait for your order.

732
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Yes.

733
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Then, I will leave this matter to you.

734
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Yan Liu, thank you for your help.

735
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
General Yan is serious.

736
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I will definitely put it in your heart.

737
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
General Zhang.

738
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
We will take a bus together later.

739
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Think about it.

740
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Let's come together and go back together.

741
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
We will have a good time.

742
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
That's great.

743
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Sir, it seems that you have recovered well.

744
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Thank you for your concern.

745
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I am fine now.

746
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
By the way, sir,

747
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I have asked General Yan Liu to escort you.

748
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Everyone, prepare for the next meeting.

749
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Do you hear me?

750
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Yes.

751
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I have a new position to escort you.

752
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
What are you worried about?

753
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Why do you think so?

754
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Of course, it's against the opposition.

755
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Although the opposition in Tongzhou is a corner,

756
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
it is still not sure that there is no chance for it.

757
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I am afraid that

758
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
it is against the opposition and will be a risk for the road.

759
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
That will be safer.

760
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Otherwise, I think that you are defending the country.

761
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Besides,

762
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
the Crown Prince of Ding Fei is important in the world.

763
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I am also worried about the state power of the Crown Prince of Ding Fei.

764
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
What Crown Prince?

765
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
What do you mean by that?

766
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
The State Palace hasn't told you yet?

767
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Through a few days' inquiries,

768
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
the Crown Prince of Ding Fei was the Crown Prince of Ding Fei.

769
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Nonsense!

770
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Xue Ding Fei is dead.

771
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Who knows where he is from?

772
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Who do you think you are?

773
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I tell you.

774
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Do you believe that I will kill you first

775
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
and then beat your legs?

776
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Let's try.

777
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
If the truth is that you are on the power,

778
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
why are you angry here?

779
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
By the way,

780
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I have already found the Crown Prince of Ding Fei.

781
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
The rumor spread to the capital.

782
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
His Majesty is very happy after he got it.

783
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I must personally see the Crown Prince.

784
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Minister Xie,

785
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
the matter of my own family in the State Palace of Ding Fei,

786
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
it's not your fault that you are an outsider.

787
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Does the State Palace want to let His Majesty know

788
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
or not to meet the Crown Prince of Ding Fei?

789
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Minister Xie,

790
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
you are too annoying.

791
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
The matter of the Crown Prince of Ding Fei,

792
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
the matter of my own family,

793
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
and the State Palace of Ding Fei,

794
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
he is the only person in the 300 central villages

795
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
who is the only one who exists.

796
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
The State Palace should know about the important thing.

797
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
As long as I am present,

798
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I won't allow him to have any problems.

799
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Only then can I give His Majesty an answer.

800
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
It's still a matter of time before I can think of a solution.

801
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I am in a hurry.

802
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
All right.

803
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Everyone, get ready.

804
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Let's set off.

805
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Back to the capital.

806
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Let's go.

807
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
The plan is to cancel.

808
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Yes.

809
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Take the painting.

810
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Take it.

811
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
The one on the left...

812
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,960
He must be Fei.

813
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,360
bisher

814
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:45,360
It's a punishment for Xie Qing to send her back to the capital.

815
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,360
It's a pity.

816
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:51,360
After they return to the capital, I'll ask Xun about it.

817
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,360
He was so far away to save me.

818
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,360
He's a loyal official of the capital.

819
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,360
I didn't expect that he'd die in the south.

820
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,360
This time, Xie Qing was found back.

821
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,360
He even worked hard to get the palace.

822
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,360
I should reward him.

823
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,360
Your Majesty really thinks so?

824
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,360
Your Majesty was young back then.

825
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,360
But you're still so old.

826
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,360
Did you forget

827
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,360
why Consort Xue died

828
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,360
because of me?

829
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,360
I'm the emperor.

830
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,360
He's a minister.

831
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,360
I'm the emperor.

832
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,360
I'm the first emperor.

833
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,360
I'm a minister.

834
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,360
I'm a minister.

835
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,360
I'm a minister.

836
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,360
I'm a minister.

837
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,360
I'm a minister.

838
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,360
I'm a minister.

839
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,360
I'm a minister.

840
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,360
I'm a minister.

841
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,360
I'm a minister.

842
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,360
Mother, don't be afraid.

843
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,360
I'll take you to the crown prince.

844
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,360
I'll take you to the crown prince.

845
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,360
He's still young.

846
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,360
He's still young.

847
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,360
Besides,

848
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,360
he still agreed to go.

849
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,360
He still agreed to go.

850
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:03,360
I feel sorry for him.

851
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,360
You're so stupid.

852
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,360
Consort Xue has been in the capital for years.

853
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,360
He's the only one

854
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,360
who can be trusted by the king.

855
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,360
Is he still

856
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,360
the son of Wu Zhi

857
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,360
20 years ago?

858
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,360
Even if it's a past,

859
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,360
Yan Min is dead.

860
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,360
The Yan family is in danger.

861
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,360
Your Majesty thinks

862
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,360
what should he think?

863
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,360
But he's the only one

864
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,360
who's trusted by the people.

865
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,360
I...

866
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,360
The court and the world

867
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,360
all have their eyes on him.

868
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,360
I must give him

869
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,360
an explanation.

870
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,360
Noble Consort Qin is seriously ill.

871
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,360
I agreed to go see him.

872
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,360
I understand what you mean.

873
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,360
As for how to deal with Consort Xue,

874
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,360
I'll ask them

875
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,360
when the minister comes back.

876
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,360
Your Majesty,

877
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,360
I don't care about his situation.

878
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,360
I'll go and talk to him in force.

879
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,360
If you want it,

880
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,360
it's good to me.

881
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,360
I'm going to hand him over

882
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,360
to him at theкв Pouring Tribe板.

883
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,360
Are you sure

884
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,360
he won't be affected by him?

885
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:31,360
I've heard

886
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,360
that you really think he's Consort Xue?

887
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,560
I said he is.

888
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,160
He is.

889
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,360
Just watch.

890
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,560
The good show has just begun.

891
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,600
Young Master Ding Wei,

892
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:54,000
you seem to have no new ideas about Linggu Palace.

893
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,880
When we were separated,

894
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,000
I was probably just like that.

895
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,040
I was only 67 years old.

896
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,200
I've been in the family for so many years.

897
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,280
I can't remember him.

898
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,200
Besides,

899
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,520
after having a stepmother,

900
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,860
there was a sixteenth's dude in my family

901
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,920
who was looking for him everywhere.

902
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,080
Do you still remember Prince Pin Dan

903
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,520
with the thought of making war?

904
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,600
Don't blame me, Zhang Xun.

905
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,640
I have a great parliamentary position.

906
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,480
That reminds me I'm still a devious person.

907
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,200
I don't mention it

908
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,800
nor do I.

909
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,640
Go on..

910
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,480
Go..

911
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,920
He even asks to lie down.

912
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:46,820
說,

913
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,680
But I gotından

914
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,340
on some day,

915
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,800
that we have to abandon

916
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,840
an针.

917
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,460
I'm leaving first.

918
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,560
Your Majesty

919
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,680
M明, diferent

920
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,920
Destroy the Immortal Party denür

921
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,600
Once they face in the face of the people

922
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,520
Defeat all the stubborn guards

923
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,080
Heart-wVEL of the country

924
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,400
It will be your success

925
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,120
by your good spirit

926
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,880
Your Majesty is right

927
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,240
We are on the nationalrait

928
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:32,340
Thus

929
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,900
It can't end like this.

930
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:37,140
How do you walk a light Professions' temple?

931
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,740
Sorry, I can't give it to you without permission.

932
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,260
I hopefully it will.

933
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,040
Thank you, Your Majesty.

934
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,840
Despite our difficulties,

935
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,000
please don't tell anyone that I helped you.

936
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,600
We are absolutely doing it because I'm asking questions related to you,

937
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,720
whether it's your quarrel.

938
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:05,900
to make an operation.

939
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:12,780
My friend gosta is higher.

940
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,740
We defamed her.

941
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,860
My blind daughter is Anhui.

942
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:30,740
She is the reason let somebody she sent me a copy rail.

943
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:35,740
I think you are the son of Duke Xue.

944
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:36,740
I know.

945
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:39,740
I've been in the opposition for years,

946
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,740
but I've been trying to find a way to get the throne.

947
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,740
I've been looking for a way to get the throne.

948
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:44,740
I've been filial to His Majesty.

949
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,740
Now that I've been in the opposition,

950
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,740
I finally see you again.

951
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,740
Young Master,

952
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:55,740
you're the son of Duke Xue.

953
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,740
You're too much.

954
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,740
I've been living and dying.

955
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,740
I've never given up on this name.

956
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,740
I want to be able to come back to you again.

957
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,740
Your Majesty,

958
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:08,740
others may not believe you,

959
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:11,740
but I grew up with you.

960
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:12,740
I've been studying.

961
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,740
Do you remember?

962
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,740
When I was young,

963
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:19,740
I loved eating the peach cake made by my mother.

964
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,740
I was very emotional.

965
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,740
When I was young,

966
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,740
I did have this.

967
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:37,740
It's true that you and I grew up together.

968
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:41,740
I think you're the most reliable son of Duke Xue.

969
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:43,740
We're not as good as the other people.

970
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,740
You should ask Duke Ding.

971
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:47,740
Duke,

972
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:50,740
is he really the son of Duke Xue?

973
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,740
Duke,

974
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,740
are you okay?

975
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,740
I'm fine.

976
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,740
I'm fine.
