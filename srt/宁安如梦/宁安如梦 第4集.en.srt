00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,400
the empress

172
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,909
must be you.

173
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:40,880
You've put in a lot of effort for the Xue family.

174
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,890
I won't let you down.

175
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,660
I know my health well.

176
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,500
What brings you here

177
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:51,780
to see me today?

178
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,460
Your Majesty,

179
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,890
I heard that

180
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,550
you and Empress Dowager intended to choose a study partner for the princess.

181
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,230
I think

182
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,710
that although Her Highness is a woman,

183
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,750
she is still a member of the royal family.

184
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,610
She needs to learn something else

185
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,530
other than the usual lessons taken by ladies.

186
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:11,940
I request

187
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,520
to teach the princess personally.

188
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,180
You're so talented.

189
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,080
I must thank you on behalf of Zhiyi.

190
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,570
I'm flattered.

191
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,310
[Study Partner Enrollment]

192
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,030
[Jiang Xuening, the legitimate daughter of the Vice Minister for Revenue]

193
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,440
How could this happen?

194
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,850
How could it be Ning?

195
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:34,890
My Lady.

196
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,300
You are not mistaken.

197
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,500
The study partner-to-be from the Jiang family

198
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,580
is indeed Ning.

199
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,890
But you clearly told me

200
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,350
that when you submitted the report,

201
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,950
Hui's name was written on it.

202
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,160
How did it become

203
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,800
Ning?

204
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:50,630
I knew it.

205
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,150
My Lady.

206
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,980
You've been lying to me all along.

207
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,240
-My Lady.
-You did it on purpose. You lied to me.

208
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,220
Nonsense!

209
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,070
-What nonsense?
-How could I mess around with this?

210
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,460
The list is to be reported to His Majesty.

211
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,950
This concerns the safety of the Jiang family.

212
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,330
How could this happen?

213
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,560
How could it be?

214
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,760
Was it you?

215
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,700
Did you

216
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,240
plan some schemes

217
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,390
or play some dirty tricks

218
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,990
to replace it with your name?

219
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,840
If I'm really so capable that I could hide it from you,

220
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,240
you should be proud of me.

221
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,920
Then the Jiang family will have no worries in the future.

222
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,130
You...

223
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,130
Stop there!

224
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:34,840
You...

225
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:35,990
Alright, My Lady.

226
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:36,880
Alright.

227
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,920
I'm so angry.

228
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,390
Hui's still here.

229
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,710
Hui.

230
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,530
His Majesty made the list himself.

231
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,070
No one can change it.

232
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,430
But I can promise you,

233
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,000
in the future,

234
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,860
if there's any chance,

235
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,540
I will ensure you are enrolled.

236
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,820
It's okay.

237
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,380
Don't worry about me.

238
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,710
It's a great honor to our family

239
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,040
for Ning to be selected.

240
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,460
It's all the same.

241
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,520
Good girl.

242
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,700
Who is trying to harm me?

243
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:24,940
Miss.

244
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,800
Isn't this a good thing?

245
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,820
How could it be harming you?

246
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,220
A good thing?

247
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,140
Forget it. You don't understand.

248
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:36,320
Miss.

249
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,080
First Young Lady is here.

250
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,990
Mother was too harsh just now.

251
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,560
Please don't take it to heart.

252
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,020
Father asked me to tell you

253
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,270
that after entering the palace,

254
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,830
there's no need to argue with others.

255
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,360
Observe more and talk less.

256
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,290
Ensure you are safe and sound.

257
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,490
If I were you,

258
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,120
who had submitted your name

259
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,600
but failed to get enrolled

260
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,570
and instead

261
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,430
your ignorant sister was chosen,

262
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,690
I would have given it a thought

263
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,540
about whether I was framed and fooled.

264
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,430
Yet you are a hypocrite.

265
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,040
You even came to give me a gift.

266
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,570
Do you think I am unaware

267
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,940
that you want to enter the palace too?

268
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,370
Yes.

269
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,680
I want to enter the palace.

270
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,370
Every woman in the world loves prosperity.

271
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,570
For me,

272
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,580
there's no shame in admitting it.

273
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,670
It's just that I failed this time.

274
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,530
I have nothing to complain about.

275
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,560
Everything has its own law of cause and effect.

276
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,660
Right now, I'm not capable enough

277
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,750
and not destined either.

278
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,050
I remember when I went to the capital four years ago,

279
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,310
you weren't like this.

280
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,360
At least not like now.

281
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,290
Under the cloudy mist,

282
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,540
you are like a living Bodhisattva

283
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,970
and a dummy without joy and sorrow.

284
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,030
Do you know why I don't like you?

285
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,970
It's not just because you're better

286
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,590
and more excellent than me.

287
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,990
You even enjoyed everything I should have.

288
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,850
More importantly,

289
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,950
it's been four years.

290
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,060
You knew your origin,

291
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,310
and you knew everything Wan Niang did

292
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,210
was for you,

293
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,960
but you never

294
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,190
asked me about Wan Niang, not even once.

295
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:25,910
It's getting late.

296
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,270
I'll go back first.

297
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,170
Before Wan Niang passed away,

298
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,110
she had put her heirloom bracelet in my hand

299
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,370
and asked me to give it to you when I came back.

300
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,770
But I never gave it to you.

301
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:41,970
Because I think

302
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,040
you don't deserve it.

303
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,980
Although Wan Niang is my birth mother,

304
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,630
she caused all this.

305
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,250
She made the Jiang family,

306
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,080
Mother,

307
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,790
you and I become a joke.

308
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,650
You're not the only one suffering.

309
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,210
If I don't care about Wan Niang,

310
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,430
I am being ungrateful to her for giving birth to me.

311
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,690
But if I care about her,

312
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,080
I'll let Mother down for raising me.

313
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,940
Since I can't fulfill both sides,

314
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,950
why can't I

315
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,010
be worldly-wise and keep myself safe

316
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,620
like what my mother taught me since I was young?

317
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,270
What wisdom.

318
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,270
Jiang Xuehui.

319
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,170
In this world,

320
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,450
not everyone is like you,

321
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,800
who weighs the pros and cons,

322
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,460
being indifferent like a cold-blooded animal.

323
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,120
So it's right that you hate me.

324
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,830
I never thought of taking revenge on you.

325
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,610
Why didn't I realize

326
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,160
that you are the one who has what it takes to be the empress?

327
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,550
Last time,

328
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,150
I took the chance from Jiang Xuehui on purpose.

329
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,540
But this time,

330
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,440
I have already avoided the palace as much as possible.

331
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,570
Why couldn't I change the direction of the development?

332
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,030
No way.

333
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,400
I can't just resign myself to fate.

334
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,830
The walls in the mansion are like nothing.

335
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,370
If Father finds out

336
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,670
that someone keeps playing the same trick without reflecting on it,

337
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,150
he'll start to nag again.

338
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,680
He didn't find out this time, did he?

339
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,420
Now that you've accepted my gift,

340
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,280
you can't tell Mr. Jiang about it.

341
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,670
It's only been a few days.

342
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,960
How did you hurt your hand?

343
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,910
I went to the military camp

344
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,790
to train using swords and sticks.

345
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,510
It's inevitable to get hurt.

346
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,440
It's no big deal.

347
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,900
Who in the Tongzhou Camps

348
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,060
dared to hurt you?

349
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,830
One of the Xingwu Guards.

350
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,350
Although he was led astray,

351
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,690
he is a good man.

352
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,230
Recently, he often came to the camp

353
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,090
to duel with me.

354
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,240
Speaking of him,

355
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,670
I heard something new about him recently.

356
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,150
It is said that

357
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,150
he has a good horse

358
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,190
and he loves it very much.

359
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,550
Everyone in Xingwu Guards knows that.

360
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,540
But one day,

361
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,150
when he heard that the horse was sick,

362
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,940
he hurried back to his residence

363
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,800
and found that it was hard to cure,

364
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,030
so he killed the horse

365
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,280
with his own hands.

366
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,450
Others asked him why he did so.

367
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,510
Guess what he said.

368
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,900
"The horse was like my close kin.

369
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,000
However, it was seriously ill.

370
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,310
To save it from torture,

371
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,560
I killed it on my own.

372
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,410
Firstly,

373
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,110
to give it a quick death.

374
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,230
Secondly,

375
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,050
to give a good end to my love for it over the years."

376
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,060
Ning.

377
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,960
Do you think he is somehow

378
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,530
a little unusual?

379
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,510
Ask someone to tell Zhou Yinzhi

380
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,460
that his beloved horse is sick and dying.

381
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,390
He should come back and have a look.

382
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:59,030
Are you talking about Zhou Yinzhi?

383
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,120
How do you know?

384
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,800
Do you know him?

385
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,420
I heard about him.

386
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,250
But Zhou Yinzhi

387
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,589
was originally an orphan found on our farm.

388
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:09,650
He grew up raising horses on the farm.

389
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:11,460
Then he used me to enter the capital

390
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,319
and joined the Ministry of Revenue with my father,

391
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:16,069
and then joined Xingwu Guards after the Ministry of Revenue.

392
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,599
Anyway,

393
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,050
he's a social climber.

394
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,920
I don't think he's simple.

395
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,339
Regarding the rumor saying that he killed the horse,

396
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:24,339
what do you think?

397
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,290
I don't know whether it's true or false,

398
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,190
but since he could kill his horse,

399
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,850
his decisiveness

400
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,700
is evident.

401
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,110
I think the other way.

402
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,570
He liked the horse so much,

403
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,090
but he killed it without hesitation.

404
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,350
He's really ruthless.

405
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,130
You must be careful

406
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,460
with this kind of person by your side.

407
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,520
You worry too much.

408
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,030
Even if he's really here for something,

409
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,200
I'm not afraid

410
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,460
because I did nothing wrong.

411
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,690
That's not true.

412
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,780
Alright, let's not talk about him.

413
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:51,370
Open it.

414
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,200
I know you are too lazy to shell pine nuts.

415
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,250
Didn't you hurt your hand?

416
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,560
It's not a big deal.

417
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,960
I still can do it even if my finger is broken.

418
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:10,170
What's wrong?

419
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,680
You don't like it?

420
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,340
I knew it.

421
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,690
I should have bought chestnuts for you.

422
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:14,960
No.

423
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:16,590
I like it.

424
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,680
Why aren't you eating?

425
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,560
Forget it.

426
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,490
Let it be.

427
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,390
Next time,

428
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,590
I'll bring you something else.

429
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,190
Tell me.

430
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,850
Aren't you going to the palace

431
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,450
to be the study partner of the princess these days?

432
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,650
Your teacher is even going to be Mr. Xie.

433
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:32,640
How do you feel?

434
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:35,380
Wait.

435
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,010
You just came back,

436
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,970
yet you know that I'm going to be a study partner?

437
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,200
The princess told me earlier that

438
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,320
she would want to choose a study partner.

439
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,450
I told her

440
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,600
to add you in.

441
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:44,820
Weren't you curious

442
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,670
about things you'd never seen before?

443
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,630
You were also keen to know about the palace.

444
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,490
This is a great opportunity.

445
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,480
How could I forget my Ning?

446
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,230
How is it?

447
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:53,980
Did I

448
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,390
do well on this?

449
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,920
At the end of the day,

450
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,890
you're the one who messed with me?

451
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,030
You really did a good job.

452
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,090
What a surprise.

453
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,320
It's worth it knowing you are glad.

454
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,130
Speaking of Mr. Xie...

455
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,200
Today is a good time to do so.

456
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:11,740
Let's go.

457
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,200
I'll take you to a place.

458
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,320
Let's go.

459
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:16,140
Let's go.

460
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,750
The sound of the qin is delicate.

461
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,590
It feels like a phoenix living on a Chinese parasol tree.

462
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,630
It's indeed a great qin, which is rare to be found.

463
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,960
Although it's top-quality,

464
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,890
unfortunately,

465
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,810
this is the shop owned by Forever the Second Best.

466
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,220
I wondered who it was.

467
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,440
Isn't this the Scholar Jia,

468
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,260
who failed the exam three times?

469
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,350
You can't even write a good article.

470
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,010
How dare you call me a bad omen?

471
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,750
Instead of that, I'm afraid

472
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,110
[Master of Youhuang Store, Lyu Xian]

473
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,750
you'd ruin the ambience of my place.

474
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,350
Lyu Xian,

475
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,870
you started a business.

476
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,740
You should welcome all kinds of guests.

477
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,270
Besides,

478
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,840
you and Mr. Xie took the exams together all the way.

479
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,320
When he ranked first in the Entry-Level Exam, you ranked second.

480
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,900
When he ranked first in the Provincial Exam, you ranked second.

481
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,210
When he ranked first in the National Exam,

482
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,610
you still ranked second.

483
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,230
Was I wrong

484
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,610
to say you are Forever the Second Best?

485
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,950
Are you buying or not?

486
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:07,880
Pay up if you are.

487
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,550
It costs 880 taels of silver.

488
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,350
So expensive?

489
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,290
The original price of the qin was 88 taels.

490
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,770
I'll use the rest

491
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,320
to burn incense and wash my hands

492
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,330
to get rid of

493
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,350
his pedantic stupidity revealing his poverty.

494
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,970
Lyu Xian, you've gone too far!

495
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:22,470
What?

496
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,000
Do you want to fight?

497
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm not talented,

498
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,560
but a scholar from Hanlin Academy.

499
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,750
My left eye

500
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,730
has read all the classics.

501
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,440
So it costs 500 taels of gold.

502
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,890
My right hand

503
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,340
has written notes on all thousand-year articles.

504
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,270
Its price is 1,000 taels of silver.

505
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,400
Just with you?

506
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,960
Can you afford to hurt them?

507
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:39,470
This...

508
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,110
You're a disgrace to the educated class.

509
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,770
I don't want to argue with you.

510
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:43,540
Let's go.

511
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,130
-Let's go.
-Is he Lyu Xian?

512
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,550
I often heard people say that

513
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,610
you must buy the qin sold by a scholar.

514
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,310
He's indeed trying to rip us off.

515
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,400
It doesn't matter if it's expensive.

516
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,470
What matters is the stuff is of top quality.

517
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,870
Mr. Xie loves playing the qin.

518
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,110
Now that you are going to the palace to learn to play the qin,

519
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,300
you should bring a good one with you.

520
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,570
Even if Mr. Xie is strict when teaching,

521
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,720
he will be more tolerant of you

522
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,980
for the sake of the qin.

523
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:03,980
Your Royal Highness,

524
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,270
you are finally here.

525
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:10,830
Originally,

526
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,400
I found five qins.

527
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:15,800
One of them was newly made by Gu Benyuan in Jiangning.

528
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,260
But I arrived too late.

529
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:17,990
When I went there,

530
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,430
Gu Benyuan had already given that qin

531
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,550
to Xie Ju'an.

532
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,600
He's a famous qin master.

533
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,410
Now, he's over 70 years old.

534
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,710
It'll take at least three years to get one qin from him.

535
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,950
Yet he gave it to others as a free gift.

536
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:28,660
Exactly.

537
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,020
It was such a good qin.

538
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,590
If I bought it with thousands of taels of gold,

539
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,340
I'd even dare to sell it to you after doubling the price.

540
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,400
Xie Ju'an

541
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,120
cut off my way of making money.

542
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,470
He must be tired of

543
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,180
living.

544
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,850
Ning, which one do you like?

545
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,110
At my level,

546
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,380
they are all the same to me.

547
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,440
How about that one?

548
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,720
You indeed have good taste.

549
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:52,420
This qin is an ancient qin from 300 years ago.

550
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,970
It's called Jiao'an.

551
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,790
Its sound is deep and resonant on open strings,

552
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,240
while its overtones sound clear and smooth.

553
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,130
And it's not expensive,

554
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,590
only costing 3,000 taels.

555
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,700
Let's take it.

556
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,470
No way.

557
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,250
Yan Lin.

558
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,620
This is too pricey.

559
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,820
Besides, you've given me so many gifts.

560
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,550
If you buy me this qin on top of that,

561
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,860
I won't be able to repay you all my life.

562
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,990
Why bother to repay?

563
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,510
I want you to owe me forever.

564
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:14,110
Your Royal Highness, you're indeed generous.

[Yousheng Store]

566
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:21,590
Where is Qing Feng goofing around?

567
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,360
I'll go and get a carriage.

568
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,290
Wait for me here.

569
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:29,830
Miss Jiang.

570
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:32,650
Fangyin?

571
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:33,800
Why are you here?

572
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,580
Did You Yue bully you again?

573
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,920
She didn't bully me.

574
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:41,020
I wanted to visit you at Jiang Mansion.

575
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,020
I didn't expect to run into you here.

576
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,790
This is the money you gave me last time.

577
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,290
After arranging my mother's funeral,

578
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,110
I still have much left.

579
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,490
I'll return it to you first.

580
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,390
As for the rest,

581
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,190
I'll pay you back in the future.

582
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,720
What I gave you is yours.

583
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:54,660
Miss,

584
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:55,850
please take it.

585
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,400
Is this what you meant by saying that

586
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,600
she didn't bully you?

587
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,290
Fangyin,

588
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,490
do you still want to live like this?

589
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,120
You used to be careful in every detail of life

590
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,420
because of your mother.

591
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,750
But now that she's gone,

592
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,970
are you still going to be mistreated in the You family?

593
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:14,600
But do I...

594
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:17,900
have a choice?

595
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,480
If you trust me,

596
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,020
do as I say.

597
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,340
Although you can't leave the You family for now,

598
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,700
you can surely change your fate

599
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,270
very soon.

Let's go.

605

I'm so exhausted.

606
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:10,830
Thank you.

607
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,040
I've finally found out.

608
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,970
Miss Jiang

609
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,840
is indeed entering the palace.

610
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,210
But she seemed

611
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,040
reluctant to do so.

612
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:25,300
I see.

613
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:26,810
That's it?

614
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:29,090
What else?

615
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,460
Jiang Boyou is just a Vice Minister.

616
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,960
There's nothing you can ask from him.

617
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,060
Why did you help the First Princess

618
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,860
to send Miss Jiang to the palace?

619
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,120
I think

620
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:42,020
Miss Jiang is quite good-looking.

621
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,610
He tried so hard

622
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,990
to be her teacher.

623
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,810
Does he have a crush on her?

624
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:49,430
Mr. Lyu indeed has literary talent.

625
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,870
In spite of that,

626
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,800
what did you mean

627
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,180

628
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,000
It was needed in that situation.

629
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,380
I was just simply saying.

630
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,670
Did you also simply record the 3,000 taels of income

631
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:00,940
in the account book?

632
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:02,670
You...

633
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,330
You even know about business matters?

634
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,290
I worked hard to make money for you.

635
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,580
You should spare me

636
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,840
some of the the earnings, shouldn't you?

637
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:13,520
Fine.

638
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,330

Besides, the late payment interest

641
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,120
will be paid with a few good qins outside.

You are such a scourge.

643
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,780
You will surely be cursed for a thousand years.

You've been lighting it for four years.

00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,240
Do it again in front of me.

851
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:12,890
Her Highness is here now.

852
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:15,710
Let's see how Matron Su could show her partiality.

853
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,510
Yes.

854
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,610
Madam Su.

855
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:48,360
Look.

856
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,740
She knocked over the things in the palace.

857
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,070
But her expression hasn't changed at all.

858
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,170
She is so calm

859
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:55,480
and still.

860
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,900
Your Highness is right.

861
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,890
Miss Jiang is so sedate

862
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,520
that she must be a great person in the future.

863
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,450
Jiang Xuening,

864
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:07,820
what tricks did you use?

865
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,880
How could you fool even Her Highness?

866
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:10,780
How dare you!

867
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,500
Your Highness.

868
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,920
Miss You was right.

869
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,820
I grew up in the countryside.

870
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,330
Yet I'm lazy and stupid.

871
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:19,930
I can't learn the etiquette in the palace well.

872
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,720
I'm afraid I've let you down.

873
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,830
Please send me out of the palace.

874
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:25,930
There you go.

875
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,590
I like you so much.

876
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:32,600
The etiquette in the palace is just a formality.

877
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,370
It doesn't matter if you can't master it.

878
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,370
I'll protect you.

879
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,380
Miss Jiang can do the make-up

880
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:38,390
for Your Highness

881
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,310
to cheer you up.

882
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:42,310
She must be a skillful and kind-hearted person.

883
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:44,620
I watched Your Highness grow up.

884
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:46,660
I am truly glad from the bottom of my heart

885
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,170
for Her Highness

886
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,440
to have a friend like you.

887
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,990
In order to let you enter the palace,

888
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:53,120
Her Highness has put in a lot of effort.

889
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,770
At first, Yan Lin

890
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:57,450
asked me to nominate you,

891
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,890
and I did want you to enter the palace.

892
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,680
But there are rules for the selection of a study partner.

893
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,110
If the name was not presented at the beginning,

894
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,440
she couldn't be my study partner.

895
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,870
It took me a long time

896
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:06,910
to get permission from His Majesty.

897
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:07,520
What do you think?

898
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,340
Am I nice to you?

899
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,540
Are you glad for that?

900
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,110
It turns out that the princess is also involved in sending me to the palace.

901
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:14,640
I'm glad.

902
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,450
I'm so glad.

903
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,780
I like you anyway.

904
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,990
If anything happens in the palace these days,

905
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:22,400
just ask someone to report to me.

906
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,530
Mother needs me now.

907
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,460
I'll take my leave first.

908
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,460
See you tomorrow.

909
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,770
Have a safe trip, First Princess.

910
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:43,330
That's what happened.

911
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,910
It's my fault for sneaking into your place to steal the test paper.

912
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,460
I'm willing to accept the punishment.

913
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,040
But,

914
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,150
please don't get Lord Linzi involved.

915
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:53,610
Yan Lin.

916
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,090
Today, I taught you the classics.

917
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,310
"The three hundred poems in The Book of Songs

918
00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:59,770
are all about sincerity."

919
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:02,190
Viscount Yan is a candid man.

920
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,490
I have no reason to punish you.

921
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,880
But I have a question

922
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,740
to ask you.

923
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:11,610
Are you sure

924
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,790
the person you love also loves you?

925
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,140
I think

926
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,370
it doesn't matter.

927
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:21,490
You said

928
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:24,340
a gentleman should do what he should and not what he shouldn't.

929
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,670
I only do what I want to do

930
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,470
without forcing others.

931
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,050
Okay.

932
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,190
You may leave now.

933
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,010
Thank you, sir.

934
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:35,790
Let's go.

935
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:37,900
Sir,

936
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,440
can you help Ning

937
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,760
for the sake of our friendship?

938
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,960
Don't push your luck.

939
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:43,560
Let's go.

940
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:46,500
Let's go.

941
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,140
Why didn't my mother tell me

942
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,900
that entering the palace could be so torturing?

943
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:57,280
Exactly.

944
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,190
The divination tells us that after rain comes the sunshine.

945
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,920
But who would have thought that

946
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:04,740
we would be so exhausted just by studying etiquette?

947
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:07,740
And there's much more suffering to come in the future.

948
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,860
The beginning is always hard.

949
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:11,400
Her Highness is friendly

950
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,790
and easy-going.

951
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:15,910
Everything will be fine when the class starts.

952
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:16,610
Shu,

953
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,580
I don't see Her Highness much,

954
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,630
but I rarely see her being so nice to someone.

955
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:24,520
The second daughter of the Jiang family

956
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,280
only put on makeup for her.

957
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:29,080
Why was she worth being treated like this?

958
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,500
If it was just makeup,

959
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,680
it wouldn't be like this.

960
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:35,730
What matters is what she said back then.

961
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:37,790
Those words...

962
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,230
Xi,

963
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,310
you and I will never be able to say them.

964
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:52,660
If I hadn't acted rashly in the You family that day,

965
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:55,280
I wouldn't have gained acknowledgement from Her Highness.

966
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,720
Although I've avoided the calamity I went through before,

967
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,580
I'm involved in another trouble.

968
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:05,640
It'll not work anymore to provoke Matron Su.

969
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,440
I have to change to another plan.

970
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,270
There will be a written test later.

971
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:13,970
There's no way First Princess can handle Xie Wei.

972
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:16,950
The other scholars in the palace are very conservative too.

973
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:19,110
If I scribble nonsense on the test paper,

974
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,030
I will surely be expelled from the palace.

975
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:22,060
Is Miss Jiang here?
