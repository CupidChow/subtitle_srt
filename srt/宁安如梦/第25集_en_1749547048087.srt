1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
As long as I can enter the Palace of Peace

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,000
and pay all the price

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,400
I will be willing to do so.

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,400
The End

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,400
The End

7
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,400
Everything seems to be a dream.

8
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,400
I have owed a lot of people.

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,400
Chaozhe, help me.

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,400
I will be a good person after this.

11
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,400
I will be a good person after this.

12
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,400
I will be a good person after this.

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,400
You can't give me something.

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
But he...

15
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,400
I want to help you.

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,400
I want to help you.

17
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,400
Everyone in the world has a right to escape.

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,400
But I can't.

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,400
I want to do the wrong thing

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,400
and go back in time.

21
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,400
Do you believe that everything is decided?

22
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,400
I believe in the future.

23
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
Congratulations, Your Highness.

24
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,400
Congratulations, Your Highness.

25
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,400
The End

26
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,400
Nian, what are you doing?

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,400
But there is always a pair of hands

28
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,400
that can destroy everything.

29
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,400
The revenge is long.

30
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Who are you?

31
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,400
The Emperor of the mortal world is so long-winded.

32
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,400
The Emperor of the mortal world is so long-winded.

33
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,400
The Emperor of the mortal world is so long-winded.

34
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,400
The End

35
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,400
The End

36
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,400
I think the bloodline is the most important.

37
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,400
No matter how many people are around me,

38
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,400
I'd rather ask Duke Ding.

39
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,400
You're so generous.

40
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
I'm the Crown Prince.

41
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
How can you beat me?

42
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
I want you to admit defeat.

43
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,400
Your Highness,

44
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,400
you've won a point.

45
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,400
How can you be so stupid?

46
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,400
You're the stupid one.

47
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,400
I'm telling Uncle that I won't play with you anymore.

48
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,400
Brother, I'm sorry.

49
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
Don't be angry.

50
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Let's compete again.

51
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,400
I'll make you win this game.

52
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,400
Okay?

53
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
No!

54
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
Xue Dingfei.

55
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
Xue Dingfei.

56
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
Father.

57
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
I've told you before.

58
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
You must remember the Crown Prince.

59
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,400
You're young.

60
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
You know how to fight for your life.

61
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
You're so ignorant.

62
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
You've lost my face.

63
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,400
Father.

64
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
Stay here until you know

65
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
your mistakes.

66
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
Father.

67
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,400
Yes, Duke.

68
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,400
Duke Dingfei's identity

69
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,400
is not only about Xue's family,

70
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,400
but also about the state affairs.

71
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
The Crown Prince of Dingfei

72
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,400
was the loyal official of the army.

73
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,400
And Duke Dingfei's identity

74
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,400
is the official official of the army.

75
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,400
At that time,

76
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,400
Duke Dingfei didn't believe

77
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
Duke Dingfei's identity.

78
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
I didn't expect that.

79
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,400
But I really didn't expect

80
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,400
that such a loyal and powerful person

81
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,400
could be the Crown Prince.

82
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,400
Who else could it be?

83
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,400
Your Majesty.

84
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,400
This son's scar

85
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
is really

86
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
not as good as mine.

87
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,400
But I was so worried

88
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,400
and heartless.

89
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,400
I should thank you for that.

90
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,400
When I was young,

91
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
I taught him

92
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,400
to love the state.

93
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,400
Now, you're helping the state affairs.

94
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,400
Now, you're helping the state affairs.

95
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
You're doing justice to the state affairs.

96
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,400
That's what I, Xue's family,

97
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
and the loyal official of the emperor

98
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,400
have done to the state affairs.

99
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,400
Good.

100
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Duke Dingfei, get up.

101
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

102
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
The emperor of the right hand

103
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,400
protects the crown prince.

104
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
The state affairs are in the hands of the emperor.

105
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,400
From today on,

106
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
you're the body of Xie Wei.

107
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
From now on,

108
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
your name

109
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,400
will be Xue Dingfei.

110
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,400
If it wasn't for Dingfei,

111
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,400
I would have died.

112
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
Now, it's up to you

113
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
to judge the situation.

114
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
I

115
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
must reward you

116
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
with my loyalty.

117
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
Thank you.

118
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
Your Majesty, wait.

119
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
I still have a question.

120
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,400
I'd like to ask Duke Dingfei to answer.

121
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,400
He's the minister of the Ministry of Justice,

122
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Gu Chunfang,

123
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,400
and also the minister of the State Affairs.

124
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,400
In the past, the King of Pingnan was in trouble.

125
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,400
He was in trouble for the crown prince.

126
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Duke Dingfei

127
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,400
was in trouble for the crown prince.

128
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,400
He was in trouble for the crown prince.

129
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,400
He was in trouble for the crown prince.

130
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,400
How could he be in trouble?

131
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
Your Majesty,

132
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
the matter of the past

133
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,400
is also a big issue

134
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,400
that involves arresting the crown prince.

135
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
So I think

136
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,400
it's better to

137
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
think about it privately.

138
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,400
You're right.

139
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
It's because the officials are important

140
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
that we should clear the case.

141
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,400
300 cases of the soul-containing case

142
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,400
are the business of my money.

143
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,400
The whole court needs an explanation.

144
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,400
Zhang Qingyan is right.

145
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,400
Dingfei,

146
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,400
you can continue.

147
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
Yes.

148
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,400
It's a shame.

149
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,400
The battle was fierce

150
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,400
and fierce.

151
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,400
I was only 6 or 7 years old.

152
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,400
I was scared to death.

153
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
When I woke up,

154
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
I was caught by the traitor.

155
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,400
I was caught by the traitor.

156
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
Even if we can't remember the war,

157
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
what happened in Jinling?

158
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
We should remember it.

159
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,400
King of Pingnan's old man,

160
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,400
he asked me to go to Jinling.

161
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
I was so desperate.

162
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
So I wanted to know

163
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
what he was going to do.

164
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
Since many years ago,

165
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,400
I've only found out that

166
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
he wanted to take my heart.

167
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
In order to find a way to

168
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,400
send me back to the capital,

169
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
the blood was shed.

170
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
The official's new official,

171
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
Yan Shun,

172
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,400
sent two troops to Tongzhou.

173
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
He was a puppet.

174
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
He used his heart to poison me.

175
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
I think you must have

176
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
suffered a lot these years.

177
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,400
It's all in the past.

178
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,400
I just wanted to

179
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,400
help the court secretly.

180
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
In the south of Dezhinan,

181
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
Fengming River

182
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,400
led a large group of people

183
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,400
to go to Tongzhou.

184
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
I was worried that this time,

185
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,400
Ruocheng would be in danger

186
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
for Jinling.

187
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
So I thought of

188
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
the way to send you back.

189
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,400
I didn't expect that

190
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,400
I would go to Tongzhou later.

191
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,400
I found out that you were

192
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,400
really so.

193
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
I was so anxious

194
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,400
about the position of the opposition.

195
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
If it wasn't for you,

196
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
I'm afraid you would have

197
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
already taken the initiative.

198
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,400
You are indeed

199
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,400
a person of great power.

200
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,400
But you are not in your heart.

201
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,400
I am in your eyes.

202
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
Since you came back safely,

203
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
and you are doing your best,

204
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
I will appoint you as the loyal and filial position.

205
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,400
You are in charge of the military affairs.

206
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,400
You can go to the palace in time.

207
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,400
As for the place where you live,

208
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,400
I am very worried.

209
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,400
Please allow me to

210
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,400
return to the Imperial Palace

211
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
and live with you.

212
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,400
I have been with the Imperial Palace

213
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
for many years.

214
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,400
You are very filial.

215
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
I am in charge.

216
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

217
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,400
As for the chaos in Tongzhou,

218
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,400
and the treasonous plot,

219
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,400
I will report to Gu Qing

220
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
and the imperial court

221
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
to the palace.

222
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,400
I will reward you

223
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,400
and punish you.

224
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

225
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
Good night.

226
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,400
I hope you can be a good girl.

227
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,400
Yes.

228
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
You are very good.

229
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,400
Your Highness,

230
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,400
I am Chen Ying,

231
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
the deputy minister of the Ministry of Justice.

232
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,400
I have seen the loyal and filial position.

233
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
You are welcome.

234
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
I will appoint you as the loyal and filial position.

235
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

236
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
Thank you.

237
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
I heard Consort Ding

238
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
say that

239
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,400
Yan Bi is the Duke

240
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
or the Duke's father,

241
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
but she is not a father.

242
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
I don't know where she is.

243
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
I don't know.

244
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,400
I have never

245
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
ever been loyal to the emperor

246
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
for the past 20 years.

247
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,400
But I have only been a man of the past.

248
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
I am very lucky.

249
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
What is it?

250
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Mrs. Yan is not filial.

251
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,400
She is kind and considerate.

252
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,400
However,

253
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,400
it has been three months

254
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
since she died.

255
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,400
The Duke's father has been absent.

256
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,400
Even if I am alive,

257
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
I am not happy.

258
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,400
Nonsense.

259
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
What nonsense are you talking about?

260
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400
If you can be born as a Nian,

261
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,400
you are not a good man.

262
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
You...

263
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
The Duke's family is famous.

264
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
He is a good man.

265
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
He is a good man.

266
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
He is a good man.

267
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
The daughter of the seven months

268
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,400
hasn't been in a bad mood.

269
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,400
He is still alive.

270
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,400
Grandpa Gu.

271
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
You are so right.

272
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
You are not good at the first mother.

273
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
You are so disobedient.

274
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,400
I don't want to know

275
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,400
about your behavior.

276
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
That ugly woman

277
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,400
is a coward.

278
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
You are a traitor.

279
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
I...

280
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
What?

281
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,400
You want to be a coward

282
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
in front of me?

283
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,400
You want me to be filial to you.

284
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
Why don't you treat me as a traitor

285
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400
and kill me?

286
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,400
Everyone.

287
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,400
Today is my first day in the capital.

288
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,400
I booked a banquet at the building.

289
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
If you are not busy,

290
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,400
we can have a drink together.

291
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
We can have a drink.

292
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,400
Okay.

293
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,400
Master.

294
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
Wait for me.

295
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,400
Let's go.

296
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
Let's go back tonight.

297
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,400
Duke Gu.

298
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
Please.

299
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
You mean

300
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,400
the military and blood

301
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
of Duke Dingguo

302
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,400
who is the leader of the Tang State?

303
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,400
I think Duke Dingguo

304
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,400
is not only like that.

305
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,400
Do you remember

306
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,400
the case of Prince Pingna

307
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
who colluded with the Hou family

308
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,400
in the past?

309
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
I didn't find

310
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,400
any evidence about the attack

311
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
in the Tang State.

312
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
I found out

313
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,400
that Duke Dingguo

314
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,400
was the one who

315
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,400
was involved

316
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,400
in the military and blood

317
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
of the Tang State.

318
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
The military and blood

319
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,400
was the only one

320
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
who was involved in the attack.

321
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
We can't believe

322
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
that Duke Dingguo

323
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,400
was involved in the attack.

324
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
We can't believe

325
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,400
that Duke Dingguo

326
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
was involved in the attack.

327
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
I think

328
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Duke Dingguo

329
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
is the one who

330
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,400
was involved in the attack.

331
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
I suspect

332
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
Duke Dingguo

333
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
was involved in all the attacks.

334
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,400
But the letter from your father

335
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
broke out the case of Yan.

336
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Zhang Zheng, you are so bold.

337
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,400
Do you know what you are talking about?

338
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
I don't know.

339
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,400
I don't know what you are talking about.

340
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,400
Your Majesty,

341
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,400
you are right.

342
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,400
Lord Zhang,

343
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
you are a good man.

344
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,400
You are a good man.

345
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
You are a good man.

346
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,400
Please don't be angry.

347
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,400
Forget it.

348
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
If you are a good man,

349
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,400
I won't chase you.

350
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,400
But you can't

351
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,400
talk nonsense.

352
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,400
You can talk nonsense,

353
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,400
but I can't.

354
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,400
The Yan family is willing to let go

355
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,400
of Duke Dingguo's one-hand-hand-hand attack.

356
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
I

357
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
beg Your Majesty to

358
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,400
resign from the position

359
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,400
and review the case of Duke Wei Yongyu.

360
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Your Majesty, I am old.

361
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
I don't want to be old.

362
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
Lord Zhang, you must be tired.

363
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
Let's take care of

364
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
something.

365
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,400
I beg Your Majesty

366
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,400
to allow me to leave first.

367
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

368
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,400
Your Majesty.

369
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,400
Let's go.

370
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
It's okay to be a stranger.

371
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,400
Why did you

372
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,400
do the justice for him?

373
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
Your Majesty,

374
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,400
there are indeed

375
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,400
some inappropriate things

376
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,400
in the new five of us.

377
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,400
His Majesty

378
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,400
was not satisfied with me.

379
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
I think so.

380
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,400
Since I can't

381
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
get rid of him on the way,

382
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
I'd rather

383
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
put him under the nose.

384
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
And if he comes,

385
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
he will be in trouble.

386
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,400
In other words,

387
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,400
he is the creditors of the Duke Wei Yongyu.

388
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
He is the creditors of my Xue family.

389
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,400
It's nothing inappropriate.

390
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,400
It's okay to be a Zhang Zhe.

391
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,400
Xie Wei is also a member of the Xue family.

392
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,400
Now you are a Zhang Zhe.

393
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,400
Don't forget that

394
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,400
if it wasn't for you,

395
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,400
could King of Pingnan

396
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,400
have killed him?

397
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,400
If he had told the world

398
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,400
about the past,

399
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,400
the whole Duke of Dingguo

400
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,400
and even the family

401
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,400
would be killed

402
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
by the country.

403
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,400
What do you think

404
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,400
about this policy?

405
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
The military system is self-sufficient.

406
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,400
But it can't be

407
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,400
determined by the Duke of Dingguo.

408
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,400
But,

409
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,400
no matter who

410
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,400
is the one who is here,

411
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,400
the court is in a hurry.

412
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,400
I think

413
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,400
you should let Mr. Zhang

414
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,400
investigate the case.

415
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,400
You are right.

416
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,400
Speaking of Duke of Dingguo,

417
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,400
do you think

418
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,400
that today,

419
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,400
on the court,

420
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,400
his reaction is a bit wrong?

421
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,400
Your Majesty also noticed that.

422
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,400
Now he is about to

423
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,400
enter the Duke of State's Mansion.

424
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,400
If he has any intention,

425
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,400
I will definitely kill him

426
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,400
and kill him.

427
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,400
But since Your Majesty

428
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,400
has sealed his loyal son,

429
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
why don't you

430
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,400
put this case down first?

431
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,400
After Shunli

432
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,400
marries Prince Lin,

433
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
he won't be late to the capital.

434
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Now,

435
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
we can only do this.

436
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,400
Your Majesty,

437
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,400
I heard that

438
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
His Majesty

439
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,400
invited a doctor

440
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,400
who was already a senior doctor

441
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,400
to sell the family affairs.

442
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,400
It is likely that

443
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,400
he is a prince.

444
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,400
If so,

445
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
then our plan...

446
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,400
What do you want me to do?

447
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,400
His Majesty is now

448
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
like a pig.

449
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
The whole P-stripe shop

450
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
is outside the house.

451
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
I can't even find

452
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
a finger.

453
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,400
What else can I do?

454
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,400
Your Majesty,

455
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,400
His Majesty's closest body

456
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,400
is in the palace.

457
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,400
What do you mean?

458
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,400
I'm telling you.

459
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,400
The only thing

460
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
that can be done is the court.

461
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,400
The harem will arrange it.

462
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,400
The heart is half broken.

463
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
It's hard to untie it.

464
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,400
In this case,

465
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,400
the Xue family has to be careful.

466
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,400
In case they are caught.

467
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,400
Do you understand?

468
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
Yes, I understand.

469
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,400
In the case of

470
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,400
the ancient meat of Duke Ding

471
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,400
in the palace,

472
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,400
no one in the court

473
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,400
would want

474
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,400
Consort Xue to return safely

475
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,400
than him.

476
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,400
But she is

477
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
so mysterious

478
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,400
in the court today.

479
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,400
She is so mysterious.

480
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
She is so mysterious.

481
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,400
I'm afraid.

482
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,400
Exactly.

483
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
I have a secret

484
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,400
in my heart.

485
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
And this matter

486
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,400
will never be small.

487
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,400
Your Majesty,

488
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,400
do you know

489
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,400
the contents of this?

490
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,400
Mother and uncle

491
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
are always the same.

492
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,400
But I know

493
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
that the root of the root

494
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,400
is called Shen

495
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
and not Xue.

496
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,400
Xing Qing,

497
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
what do you mean?

498
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
Chen Meng, the Empress Dowager,

499
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
is the most filial

500
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,400
and decisive one

501
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,400
in the court today.

502
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,400
I,

503
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
should be grateful to you

504
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,400
for your care for the world.

505
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

506
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,400
I'm afraid.

507
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,400
Your Majesty,

508
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
please leave the Yan Army

509
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,400
to me for now.

510
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,400
Before the Xue family's

511
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,400
intention is taken,

512
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,400
the Yan Army

513
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,400
must not be caught

514
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,400
by Duke Ding.

515
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,400
In this way,

516
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,400
it will ensure

517
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,400
your safety.

518
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,400
It must be heavy to have

519
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,000
fifty or twenty scholars

520
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,400
and log lessons.

521
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,400
What are these all about?

522
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
They'll teach you a lesson

523
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
when you pass by 很差地方.

524
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
All right.

525
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,400
As you say.

526
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

527
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,800
I think the Yin family is destined to be together forever.

528
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,520
You've worked hard.

529
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,760
What's the difference

530
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,400
between Xie Shao Shi and the other people?

531
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,200
Although Xiang Sheng is not sure about Yin Qing,

532
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,520
he is a good person.

533
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,080
There are many things that can't be explained.

534
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,120
But he saved us today.

535
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,280
So can you

536
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,360
not tell the officials and the court?

537
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,760
Today,

538
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,200
he suddenly found Xue Ding Fei.

539
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,320
I feel strange.

540
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,200
When did he

541
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,080
contact with the Nidang?

542
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,800
Why didn't he tell us?

543
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,840
Xie Shao Shi did everything for the court.

544
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,120
He was in the Shangxing Hall

545
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,080
and was in danger of his life.

546
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,840
There was nothing wrong with him.

547
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,600
If so,

548
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,560
let him go.

549
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,600
Although the case of the Yin family is not correct,

550
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,680
before you came back,

551
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,960
His Majesty had made a mistake

552
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,160
for Xue Yuan Lin Zhen.

553
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,160
The Ministry of Justice

554
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,000
can investigate in the dark now.

555
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,480
They have more evidence

556
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,480
and go to His Majesty.

557
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,720
Then the student will go to the Ministry of Justice immediately.

558
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,920
No hurry.

559
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,200
Your mother came to me before.

560
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,800
She asked you what you did.

561
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,400
I didn't know the truth.

562
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,480
I'm afraid she can't be worried about you.

563
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,280
You'd better go back and have a look.

564
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,520
Yes.

565
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,720
I'm sorry.

566
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,280
Please punish me.

567
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,240
Okay.

568
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,280
No need to thank me.

569
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,880
Xie Shao Shi told me

570
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,600
that you have made a lot of efforts

571
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,240
in the court.

572
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,440
But he is worried about his future.

573
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,960
So he didn't tell His Majesty.

574
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,000
But Xie Shao Shi promised me

575
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,960
that he had reminded Mr. Zhang

576
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,120
and the State of Xue

577
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,120
not to mention it.

578
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,240
Okay.

579
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,360
Let's be safe.

580
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,760
That's all.

581
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,360
Don't mention it anymore.

582
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,280
Don't blame yourself.

583
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,040
What did you say?

584
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,120
You've been so rude to him.

585
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,680
You dare to make trouble for the things you did.

586
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,480
How many lives do you have?

587
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,680
Aren't you afraid of death?

588
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,280
Mother.

589
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,600
Don't worry.

590
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,880
I'm worried about you.

591
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,400
I'm worried about what?

592
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,840
Miss Jiang Er is very considerate.

593
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,960
She never listens to what my mother said.

594
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,600
I'm worried

595
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,480
that if something happens to her,

596
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,480
she will be implicated by the whole Jiang family.

597
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,080
What are you talking about?

598
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,440
Please don't worry.

599
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,680
I'll bear the consequences.

600
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,360
I won't be implicated by the Jiang family.

601
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,480
What did you say?

602
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,200
You...

603
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,120
Okay, okay.

604
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:36,840
Madam.

605
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,440
Madam.

606
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,240
Okay, okay.

607
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,360
Are you going to kiss me?

608
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,280
Are you satisfied?

609
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,080
Be careful.

610
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,840
You've been so busy all the way.

611
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,840
You must be tired.

612
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,080
Go back to your room and rest.

613
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,840
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

614
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,600
Uncle, madam.

615
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,600
You're always worried about her.

616
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,600
You're always worried about her.

617
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,840
Now that she's back,

618
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,120
you're talking about it with your mouth shut.

619
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,680
Why are you...

620
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,160
Am I worried about her?

621
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,800
Madam.

622
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,840
Madam.

623
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,800
You're finally back.

624
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,640
I thought I couldn't see you again.

625
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,920
I've been looking for you every day.

626
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,560
I'm so worried that you'll come back safely.

627
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,840
I know you're worried.

628
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,240
I'm back.

629
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,360
Don't worry.

630
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,360
I won't come back.

631
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,200
There's nothing in the middle.

632
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,400
I haven't washed a clean-up.

633
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,560
I'm so dirty.

634
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,160
I'll go get some hot water for you.

635
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,200
Yes.

636
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,080
I'll get the changed.

637
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,000
Wait.

638
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,760
Why haven't I seen your clothes?

639
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,140
It was 《 Birth write》

640
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,560
that Mrs. Yang sent for you.

641
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,260
You and the PERFECT actress.

642
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,600
I thought you had a motherly love to die.

643
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,980
I didn't expect you'd see me.

644
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,400
You let me see you with the ointment,

645
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,280
why am I going to watch this?

646
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,360
No way.

647
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:44,940
You should leave this Garlic

648
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,320
my darling

649
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,240
Mom!

650
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,080
Mom?

651
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,120
Mom!

652
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,620
Mom...

653
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,500
Mom.

654
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,520
me

655
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,720
Think of

656
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,420
the trash

657
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,520
Give it back

658
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,120
Mom

659
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,720
Mom

660
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:46,420
Wake up

661
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:47,920
Wake up

662
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,040
Mother.

663
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,560
Mother.

664
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,840
Miss. Miss.

665
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,000
What happened?

666
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,800
Speak slowly.

667
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,000
I heard

668
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,600
that Lord Zhang's mother died.

669
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,080
Lord Zhang.

670
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,240
Miss Jiang, you're here.

671
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,120
Lord Zhang.

672
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,400
Where is Lord Zhang?

673
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,880
He doesn't know Lingtang.

674
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,800
Anzhi and my wife

675
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,400
locked themselves in the room

676
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,560
and didn't come out.

677
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,040
Lord Zhang was filial

678
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,400
and didn't know.

679
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,240
But because of this,

680
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,720
he lost his mother.

681
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,600
When did that happen?

682
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,840
When you were in Tongzhou,

683
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,880
Lord Zhang didn't tell the family

684
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,720
about the mission.

685
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,640
He thought Lord Zhang was wronged

686
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,600
and was wronged.

687
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,480
He was wronged, too.

688
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,880
Who knew that

689
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,560
he would be in the college

690
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,280
and be in the same situation?

691
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,000
It's obvious that

692
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,520
after the death of

693
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,880
the dead man

694
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,560
in the head of Zhou Ying,

695
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,000
the blood and the fate

696
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,520
are the same.

697
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,800
Lord Gu.

698
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,240
Lord Gu.

699
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,120
How is he?

700
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,600
He's been with his mother for many years.

701
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,320
Now he hates himself.

702
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,720
He doesn't even want to drink water.

703
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,640
He's always thinking about

704
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,480
the decision-making.

705
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,480
I'm afraid it's more difficult this time.

706
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,640
Lord Gu.

707
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,480
Let me try.

708
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,000
This is the second lady of the Jiangshang Uncle's Mansion.

709
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,360
She's talking to Lord Zhang.

710
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,680
Sir.

711
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,920
I just sent someone to inform you

712
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,240
that the mother of Lord Zhang

713
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,600
passed away.

714
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,160
What a pity.

715
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,960
Lord Zhang was trying to get away.

716
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,600
I'm afraid

717
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,080
he'll be dead for three years.

718
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:02,880
Then

719
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,200
you should find another person

720
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,200
for the blood and the fate.

721
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,200
You started to make a move

722
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,240
after killing the public doctor.

723
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,640
Step by step.

724
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,680
Everyone is your ex-husband.

725
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,160
You can kill them at any time.

726
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,120
Kill them all.

727
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,040
Lord Zhang is in a coma.

728
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,960
I'll go to the high position.

729
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,800
I'll go to see him in the car.

730
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,480
Yes.

731
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,480
Sorry.

732
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,320
I'm sorry.

733
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,760
I'm sorry.

734
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,120
I'm sorry.

735
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,320
I'm sorry.

736
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,360
I'm sorry.

737
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,400
I'm sorry.

738
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,600
I'm sorry.

739
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,880
I'm sorry.

740
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,000
I'm sorry.

741
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,000
I'm sorry.

742
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,000
I'm sorry.

743
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,080
I'm sorry.

744
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,080
I'm sorry.

745
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,080
I'm sorry.

746
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,080
I'm sorry.

747
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,080
I'm sorry.

748
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,080
I'm sorry.

749
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,080
I'm sorry.

750
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,080
I'm sorry.

751
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,080
I'm sorry.

752
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,080
I'm sorry.

753
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,080
I'm sorry.

754
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,080
I'm sorry.

755
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,080
I'm sorry.

756
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,080
I'm sorry.

757
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,080
I'm sorry.

758
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,080
I'm sorry.

759
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,240
If you hadn't forced me

760
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,800
to investigate the case of the Yan family,

761
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,200
you wouldn't have entered this bureau.

762
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,760
You wouldn't have been in the prison.

763
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,240
Lord Zhang,

764
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,240
you should blame me for it.

765
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,920
It's not your fault.

766
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,480
It's me.

767
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,920
It's me who killed my mother.

768
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,520
When I was young,

769
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,960
my father was killed by someone.

770
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,920
He was killed by the Yuan family.

771
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,400
Before the death,

772
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,200
my mother sent me to the court.

773
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,240
I must be a good official of the Qing Dynasty

774
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,680
and investigate the world.

775
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,120
You did it.

776
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,640
The court didn't force you to be a better official.

777
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,120
Today, I, even as a teacher,

778
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,880
have made the case of the Yan family.

779
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,160
I've been in the prison for a long time.

780
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,520
My mother has been in the prison for a long time.

781
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,680
I've been woman demarcated.

782
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,600
I only configured to uphold the emperor

783
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,800
and forget about my brothers.

784
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:37,360
But I'm suffering from

785
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,560
a total endless pain.

786
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,560
I'm not like this.

787
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,560
I'm such a person.

788
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,560
I'm a person who can't even control myself.

789
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,560
What should I live for?

790
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,560
No.

791
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,560
It's me.

792
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,560
It's me who caused you to be so impolite.

793
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,560
It's me who caused auntie's death.

794
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,560
I'm a good official.

795
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,560
I'm a good person.

796
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,560
I should be a good person.

797
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,560
I should be a good person.

798
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,560
I'm not a fool who's always

799
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,560
being so stupid and stupid.

800
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:24,560
Everything is my fault.

801
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,560
Miss Jiang, don't be like this.

802
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,560
Everything is my fault.

803
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,560
It has nothing to do with you.

804
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,560
I should have thought about it

805
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,560
when I was in the school.

806
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,560
I knew it.

807
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,560
I should have thought about it.

808
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,560
Mr. Zhang.

809
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,560
I asked the school manager

810
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,560
if I could trust anyone.

811
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,560
I asked you if you could trust anyone.

812
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,560
You can trust me.

813
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,560
You can't trust me.

814
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,560
I've had a dream.

815
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,560
In my dream,

816
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,560
you were a person who was misunderstood and abandoned.

817
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,560
You were a college graduate.

818
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,560
You were a famous figure.

819
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,560
I was a famous figure.

820
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,560
I was a man of hate.

821
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,560
Everything happened

822
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,560
in a real way.

823
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,560
That's just a dream.

824
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,560
No.

825
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,560
It's me.

826
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,560
I knew you were in Tongzhou

827
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,560
and would be so tired.

828
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,560
But I didn't tell you anything

829
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,560
about the case of the Yan family.

830
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,560
You don't have to say it.

831
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,560
I know you're not like that.

832
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,560
You're not like that?

833
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,560
Chen Zhe.

834
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,560
Do you really know me?

835
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,560
From the time I was born,

836
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,560
I knew you were a hard-working,

837
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,560
humble and good-for-nothing.

838
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,560
You and Yao Xi's marriage

839
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,560
really think I'm a righteous man?

840
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,560
You're so capable and sincere.

841
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,560
No one wants to waste your time.

842
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,560
You said

843
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,560
I was a good-for-nothing.

844
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,560
I knew it.

845
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,560
If you were to protect me,

846
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,560
I would be so useless.

847
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,560
Enough!

848
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,560
Stop talking.

849
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,560
I killed your mother.

850
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,560
You still protect me.

851
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,560
How could you be so stupid?

852
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,560
I've used it for so long.

853
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,560
Why didn't you continue?

854
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,560
I'm useless

855
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,560
to people like me.

856
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,560
That's why I'm so useless.

857
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,560
Now that you're going to leave,

858
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,560
I'm useless to me.

859
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,560
I'm also too lazy to play games.

860
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,560
Chen Zhe.

861
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,560
Last time you hated yourself

862
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,560
because of your mother.

863
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,560
You lost your life.

864
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,560
This time,

865
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,560
you killed your mother's mouth

866
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,560
and let me take care of it.

867
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,560
I thought I could change my fate.

868
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,560
But in the end,

869
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,560
I still haven't changed.

870
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,560
You used to lead my life

871
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,560
to the end of the world.

872
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,560
Now, if we continue,

873
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,560
I'm afraid I'll hurt you again.

874
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,560
If that's the case,

875
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,560
I'd rather part ways.

876
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,560
Zhang Zhe.

877
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,560
I'm sorry.

878
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,560
Please spare my life.

879
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,560
I just hope you can live well.

880
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,560
Lord Gu.

881
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,560
Lord Xie.

882
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,560
Lord Jing is here.

883
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,560
Lord Jing is here to see you.

884
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,560
Ling'er.

885
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,560
Wait a minute. I'll go check.

886
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,560
Sir.

887
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,560
Don't follow me.

888
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,560
You're the best person

889
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,560
in the world.

890
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,560
Then, Your Highness.

891
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,560
Even if I save you,

892
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,560
let's go.

893
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,560
What are you doing here?

894
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,560
Are you here to see me laugh?

895
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,560
You're a married woman.

896
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,560
You're a married woman.

897
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,560
You're sick and hurt.

898
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,560
No matter what happens,

899
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,560
you shouldn't do this.

900
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,560
You're not a person like that.

901
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,560
Of course you won't be sad.

902
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,560
But the world is not like you.

903
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,560
You have your own personal opinion.

904
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,560
Why bother me?

905
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,560
If you really have this kind of decision,

906
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,560
I'll let you go.

907
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,560
But you can't let go of your own opinion.

908
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,560
Why do you force yourself?

909
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,560
Is this your ability?

910
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,560
What do you know?

911
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,560
I don't know.

912
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,560
If you like it, you shouldn't let go.

913
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,560
But if you let go,

914
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,560
you'll be in trouble.

915
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,560
Sir.

916
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,560
You've never done this for me.

917
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,560
You're a man.

918
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,560
You can't control yourself.

919
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,560
Can you really be so over-reliant?

920
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,560
What are you laughing at?

921
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,560
You're right.

922
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,560
I can't control my heart.

923
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,560
Do you know Bai Yuping?

924
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,560
He's known by the name of Longzhou Bai Yu.

925
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,560
He's unruly and unruly.

926
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,560
He's the best man in the world.

927
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,560
But if one day,

928
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,560
he'll be in trouble,

929
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,560
and his mouth will be broken.

930
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,560
He'll be left behind.

931
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,560
And if he's the best man in the world,

932
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,560
he'll be able to fix his past.

933
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,560
So?

934
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,560
Before I was a witness,

935
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,560
I knew too much.

936
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,560
Too much.

937
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,560
I thought

938
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:37,560
I could be anything.

939
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,560
But it didn't turn out to be.

940
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,560
Something happened.

941
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,560
It happened.

942
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,560
Even if we were forced to make up,

943
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,560
we'd still be left with hatred.

944
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,560
Just like Bai Yuping.

945
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,560
He's such a good man.

946
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,560
We shouldn't have left him next time.

947
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,560
I think he's very good.

948
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,560
I'd rather he hates me.

949
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,560
I wouldn't let him hate himself.

950
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,560
But why can't I do it?

951
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,560
Why is my heart

952
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,560
still so sad?

953
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,560
Even if I want to do something,

954
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,560
I can't give me a answer

955
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,560
if I can't get into his heart.

956
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,560
Why?

957
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,560
Bai Yuping is a past

958
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,560
no matter what.

959
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,560
Ling'er,

960
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,560
since you've chosen,

961
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,560
just look ahead.

962
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,560
But he's a good guy.

963
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,560
If I can't forget him,

964
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,560
then I'll find someone better.

965
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,560
You lied to me.

966
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,560
In this world,

967
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:25,560
I'll never have someone better than him.

968
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,560
Then,

969
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,560
find someone more suitable.

970
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,560
He'll definitely have someone.

971
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,560
Ling'er, he'll definitely have someone.

972
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,560
Sorry.

973
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,560
Ling'er,

974
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,560
since you've chosen,

975
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,560
just look ahead.

976
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,560
But he's a good guy.

977
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,560
If I can't forget him,

978
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,560
then I'll find someone better.

979
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,560
I've missed such a good person.

980
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,560
I'll find someone better.

981
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,560
I'll find someone better.

982
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,560
I've missed such a good person.

983
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,560
I won't be able to do anything.

984
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,560
Miss, Changzhuo is back.

985
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,560
Let him in.

986
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,560
Miss.

987
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,560
Mr. Zhang.

988
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,560
How is my family?

989
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,560
I've already taken Master's name to visit the Zhang family.

990
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,560
Although you're busy,

991
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,560
Master Gu is helping you.

992
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,560
The funeral is still going on.

993
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,560
But Master Zhang locked himself in the house.

994
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,560
He doesn't want to see anyone.

995
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,560
But I heard that he used some water rice.

996
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,560
Master Gu is watching.

997
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,560
I'm sure that the Zhang family won't have any trouble.

998
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,560
It's good that we can eat.

999
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,560
It's good that we can eat.

1000
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,560
Please keep an eye on me.

1001
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,560
If Master Zhang has anything,

1002
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,560
please come.

1003
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,560
If there's any shortcoming in the funeral,

1004
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,560
just help me.

1005
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,560
I'll go and talk to my father.

1006
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,560
Yes, Miss.

1007
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,560
Miss,

1008
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,560
you've been eating all day.

1009
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,560
You're going to ruin yourself.

1010
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,560
What's wrong with you?

1011
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,560
If there's any misunderstanding,

1012
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,560
explain it clearly.

1013
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,560
Misunderstanding.

1014
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,560
Since you've made your decision,

1015
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,560
you shouldn't turn back.

1016
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,560
Even if there's misunderstanding,

1017
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,560
there's still misunderstanding.

1018
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,560
Why are you so hardworking?

1019
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,560
Miss.

1020
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,560
Miss.

1021
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,560
There was a kid who came to deliver the iron.

1022
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,560
He said that Miss Fang Ying wanted you to stay in the mansion.

1023
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,560
Fang Ying?

1024
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,560
Why did you ask me to go to the mansion?
