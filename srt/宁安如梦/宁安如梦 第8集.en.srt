It is a rumor which started 20 years ago.

54
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,560
Lord Pingnan is the younger brother of the former emperor.

55
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,030
He lost in the competition for the throne

56
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,360
and was sent to the fief.

57

But he didn't give up.

58
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,329
He trained troops in secret.

59
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,110
20 years ago, he led his troops to the north

60
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,570
and occupied the capital.

61
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,760
The troops of Lord Pingnan surrounded the palace.

62
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,180
The former emperor escaped because he had left the palace for his recuperation.

63
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,620
Empress Dowager was an empress at that time.

64

His Majesty was a crown prince at that time.

Lord Pingnan broke into the palace,

but he found no trace of Empress Dowager and His Majesty.

[Lord Pingnan]

72

So he suspected there was a secret passage

73
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,270
which helped them escape from the palace.

74
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,850
Hurry up.

75
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,300
But the rebels had surrounded the city.

76
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,260
If Empress Dowager and His Majesty

77
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,270
escaped from the palace,

78
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:07,040
they must pass the gates of the city before leaving the city.

79
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,880
The rebels sent soldiers to guard the gates of the city immediately.

80
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,410
No one was allowed to leave.

81
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,150
Stop!

82
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,420
Lord Pingnan hated the former emperor so much.

83
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,880
He refused to give up unless he found His Majesty.

84
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,600
So,

85
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,079
he sent soldiers to search the city.

86
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,420
When the soldiers met children,

87
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,750
they arrested them without explanation.

88
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,680
It was a winter.

89
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,390
Lord Pingnan asked a servant to identify the crown prince.

90
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,590
It was bitterly cold.

91
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,230
The children wore thin clothes

92
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,430
and knelt in the snow.

93
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,890
But none of them was the crown prince.

94
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,040

Not him.

97

Lord Pingnan was so furious

98
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,140
that he ordered people

99
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,540
to hand over the crown prince in three days.

100
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,900
Otherwise, the people who were arrested

101
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,460
would be killed.

102
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,110

103
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,240
Hand the crown prince over in three days.

104
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,120
Otherwise,

105
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,360
I'll kill all the people

At the critical moment,

110

seven-year-old Viscount Dingfei, who was from the Mansion of Duke of Xue,

111

stepped forward.

Later,

Duke of Xue and Marquis of Yan

124
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,700
sent reinforcements to defeat the rebels

125
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,300
and recaptured the capital.

126
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,690
Before Lord Pingnan escaped,

127
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,260
he set fire

128
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,410
to destroy the corpses and his trace

129
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,050

After that,

131
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:57,040
the former emperor ordered a great funeral for the 300 loyal souls

132
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,440
and placed gravestones at a mountain behind the Baiguo Temple.

133

Viscount Dingfei was also buried there.

Every time

139
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,360
Empress Dowager thinks of this,

140
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,100
she feels sorry for those innocent people.

141
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,400
So she never allows anyone to mention it.

142
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,050
If she felt sorry for those innocent people,

143
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,380
she should feel guilty.

144
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,580
But Empress Dowager

145

didn't seem to feel guilty today.

But

00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,390
Lord Pingnan captured innocent people

to smoke His Majesty out.

Viscount Dingfei already posed as His Majesty.

150

Why did he still kill them all?

151
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,870
Lord Pingnan was a tyrannical rebel.

152
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,590
Maybe he just wanted to vent his anger.

153

Miss Yao,

00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,500
what do you think?

155
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,730
I'm not sure.

156
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,370
But I think even if he were a rebel,

157
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,570
he wouldn't kill people for no reason.

158
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,340
The 300 innocent lives

159

were in the hands of Lord Pingnan.

160

Viscount Xue stepped forward

not only for the righteousness of the world,

but also for the loyalty of the officials.

At such a young age,

164
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,180
he made such a decision.

165
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,650
I really admire him.

166

So Viscount Xue

was Sister Xue's older brother?

168
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,640
That's right.

169
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,990
Viscount Dingfei was not only the son of Duke of Xue,

170

his birth mother was also the older sister of Marquis of Yan, Yan Mu.

00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,230
He was the only person

172
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,910
whose parents were both from noble families.

173
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,580
I know that.

174
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,360
Madam Yan was prostrate with grief after her son's death.

175
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,160
She divorced Duke Xue that year.

176
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,500
[Mansion of Duke of Xue]

177
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,540
Shortly after returning to Mansion of Marquis of Yan,

178
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,669
she died of illness.

179
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,780
The Yan family and the Xue family

180
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,500
seemed to be estranged

181
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,620
after this matter.

182
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,169
I also heard

183
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,420
the former Duke of Xue had three sons.

184
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,660
Today's Duke Xue was not supposed to inherit the title.

185
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,990
But later, Duke Xue married Madam Yan.

186
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,860
With the support of the Yan family,

187
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,310
Duke of Xue turned the tables

188
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,210
and won the title.

189
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,210
[Respect and Peace]

190
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,080
But three months after Madam Yan passed away,

191
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,510
Duke Xue married another woman.

192
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,450
Indeed,

193
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,580
the huge Mansion of Duke of Xue

194
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,620
needed to be run by a woman.

195
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,570
It was not wrong of him to marry again

196
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,590
a few months after his first wife's death.

197
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,630
But his new wife gave birth to their first daughter

198
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,890
less than seven months

199
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,360
after their marriage.

200
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,380
This is

201
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,370
quite interesting.

202
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,640
Sister Yao.

203
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:23,710
Is it true

204
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,110
that Sister Xue was born prematurely?

205
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,710
That's true.

206
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,740
What are you talking about?

207
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:38,920
Shu.

208
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:40,540
I'm sorry.

209
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,180
I didn't mean to...

210
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,230
Although my mother is my father's second wife,

211
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,830
she's still his lawful wife.

212
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,640
There's nothing you can't say.

213
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,970
But we're in the palace.

214
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,060
How dare you

215
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,740
talk about things

216
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,910
you don't know well?

217
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,540
Are you tired of

218
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,130
being alive?

219
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,340
Do you want to die?

220
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,220
Sister Xue.

221
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,220
It's all my fault.

222
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,570
I insisted on asking them about the past.

223
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,870
This is why many things were mentioned.

224
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,100
All right.

225
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,640
You must know if others heard

226
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,130
what you said today,

227
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,580
you would be in trouble.

228
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,980
We have class tomorrow.

229
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,680
You may leave now.

230
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,100
Yes.

231
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,720
Why do I think so much?

232
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,930
No matter how tragic the case of the 300 Loyal Souls is,

233
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,260
it happened in the past.

234
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,060
It has nothing to do with me

235
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,120
and the Yan family.

236
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,700
Why bother?

237
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,280
Huang Renli.

238
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,850
You've been in the palace for 40 years.

239
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,850
You should know that there is no good-for-nothing in the palace.

240
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,230
If you find nothing in the Imperial Household Department, investigate the whole palace.

241
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,620
I don't believe

242
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,380
that Jade Ruyi Scepter

243
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,550
appeared out of thin air.

244
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,450
Get out and investigate!

245
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,000
Yes.

246
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,110
Mother.

247
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,120
Mother.

248
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,970
In my opinion,

249
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,110
we can let it go.

250
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:57,670
Didn't Brother say

251
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,090
we can't sway people?

252
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,230
It's just a Jade Ruyi Scepter.

253
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,070
Just destroy it.

254
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:01,740
Why should we

255
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,020
stir things up?

256
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,220
Those bastards are as bold as brass.

257
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,860
If we don't punish them severely,

258
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,970
they'll make trouble again.

259
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,950
If you only act on impulse,

260
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,410
how will you rule the world in the future?

261
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,330
I don't care about the world.

262
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,620
Why do you twist my arm?

263
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,760
Your brother is sick.

264
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,180
Zheng failed to give birth to a prince.

265
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,550
If you don't inherit the throne,

266
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,320
are you going to

267
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,720
give the throne to the rebel, Lord Pingnan?

268
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,640
Why don't you

269
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,660
kill me and your younger sister now?

270
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,360
You're always like this.

271
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,320
Sometimes I can't even tell

272
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,190
whether you're Empress Dowager

273
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,250
or the mother of us.

274
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:37,850
You...

275
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,590
Brother.

276
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,560
Stop it.

277
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,590
Show some respect!

278
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,740
Mother, don't be angry.

279
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,370
I'm not going to class today.

280
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,890
I'll stay here with you.

281
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:58,530
[Xie Mansion]

282
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,190
The situation is tense.

283
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,440
Are you still going to teach lessons in the palace?

284
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,590
You've allayed His Majesty's suspicion yesterday.

285
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,920
You don't have to worry.

286
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,510
That's a temporary solution.

287
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,610
Only by going on as usual

288
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,640
and keeping calm,

289
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,690
won't we let the cat out of the bag.

290
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,850
What's more,

291
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,950
the Imperial Household Department investigated the whole night.

292
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,060
I'm afraid

293
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,950
our men have already been in trouble.

294
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,110
So no matter what,

295
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,900
I have to send them a message.

296
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,890
You're going to the palace alone.

297
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:27,980
You must be careful.

298
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,710
Don't worry.

299
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,660
I'll ask Dao Qin to find out the whereabouts of Gongyi Cheng

300
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,750
and ask Lyu Xian to keep an eye on the Xue family and the Yan family.

301
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,700
If you have any news,

302
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,420
tell me immediately.

303
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:39,830
Yes.

304
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,900
First Princess asked for leave today.

305
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,530
You

306
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,880
can learn some simple poems first.

307
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,480
Turn to page one

308
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,600
and read the poem together.

309
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,350
The valley is full of pines.

310
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,680
There is no end in sight.

311
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,880
Read louder.

312
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,700
I can hear voices.

313
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,620
I can hear the sounds of streams.

314
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,070
It is a long road in the wilds.

315
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:18,930
Jiang Xuening.

316
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,840
Why don't you read it?

317
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:22,840
Sir.

318
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,230
I'm slow-witted.

319
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,150
This poem is quite obscure.

320
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,380
It is hard to understand it just by reading it.

321
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,040
Could you paraphrase it first

322
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,200
so that we can learn it well?

323
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,600
You...

324
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,890
I only asked you why you didn't read it.

325
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,420
Did I ask you to talk so much?

326
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:36,970
I...

327
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,530
Just do as I say.

328
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,220
How could you ask questions casually

329
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,600
in the class?

330
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,360
Why are you still studying if you know nothing?

331
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:45,710
Go.

332
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,160
Stand outside.

333
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,870
A teacher is someone who can propagate the doctrine, impart professional knowledge, and resolve doubts.

334
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,400
If I knew everything,

335
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,420
I would chop off your head first.

336
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,550
I wouldn't need you.

337
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,680
For the next part,

338
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,350
you read after Miss Xue.

339
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,260
Miss Xue.

340
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,120
The word "Wang" in this line

341
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,870
is uncommon.

342
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,320
If you want to know what it means,

343
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,370
you just need to...

344
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:17,900
Sir.

345
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:18,820
I know.

346
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,600
Good.

347
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,080
You're indeed a noble lady of the Xue family.

348
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,760
You're really talented.

349
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,330
First Princess can have you as her study partner.

350
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,590
I'm really relieved.

351
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,130
I'm really relieved.

352
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,510
Miss Xue.

353
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,720
Please read.

354
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,980
I have walked a long way in the dark.

355
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,220
I feel hopeless.

356
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,780
I cannot understand.

357
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,100
I do not know the reasons.

358
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,690
I have walked a long way in the dark.

359
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,290
I feel hopeless.

360
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,240
I cannot understand.

361
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,490
I do not know the reasons.

362
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,180
Hanlin Academy seems to have no power,

363
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,950
but the officials here are close to His Majesty.

364
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,900
Imperial examinations, compilation of books, records of history,

365
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,040
and drafts of imperial edicts.

366
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,260
These jobs are done by the officials in Hanlin Academy.

367
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,190
Taking charge of Xingwu Guards doesn't satisfy the Xue family.

368
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,250
They even have designs on this place.

369
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,460
No wonder the Yan family couldn't defeat the Xue family.

370
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,250
But I am grateful.

371
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,620
Because you are with me the whole way.

372
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,080
OK.

373
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,290
That's all for today.

374
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,220
Get some rest.

375
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:40,320
Mr. Xie.

376
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,040
Your class starts at half past eight.

377
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,440
Why are you here so early?

378
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,750
This is my first qin lesson.

379
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,060
I dare not slack off.

380
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,040
So I came early.

381
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,980
I want to prepare for it just in case.

382
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,570
You really deserve to be the Junior Preceptor.

383
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,100
You're really meticulous.

384
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:56,890
In that case,

385
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:57,730
I won't

386
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,370
waste your time.

387
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,040
Come in and sit down.

388
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,450
Place your qins on the table.

389
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,910
The class will start soon.

390
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,420
Emei?

391
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:42,710
Stop.

392
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,750
Wenzhao Pavilion.

393
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,850
Is it Xie Wei?

394
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,060
Xie Wei loves the qin.

395
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,430
I heard

396
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,850
he made his qin himself.

397
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,210
It is called Emei.

398
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:01,160
Yes.

399
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,660
Which poem was the name quoted from?

400
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,040
Was it quoted from "There is snow as far as the eye can see on the north of Mount Emei.

401
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,110
The sea was covered with ice which can be carved into a pot"?

402
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:12,880
Well...

403
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:14,920
I don't know.

404
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,240
Your Majesty!

405
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:24,710
Your Majesty!

406
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:26,810
Your Majesty!

407
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:27,340
Bad news!

408
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,680
Xie Wei burnt his qin and rebelled.

409
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,940
He and Yan Lin's troops

410
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,650
have stormed into the capital.

411
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,310
He burnt his qin and rebelled?

412
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,630
So "Emei" was quoted from "When you have a good reputation,

413
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,760
admire the moon with me in Emei again."

414
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,300
Xie Wei!

415
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:51,140
So did Xie Wei become the emperor

416
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,900
or admire the moon in Emei eventually?

417
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,160
He did so many things

418
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,740
that everyone thought was wrong.

419
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,400
and killed so many people.

420
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,460
If he hadn't become the emperor in the end,

421
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,720
I'm afraid he would have come to a bad end.

422
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,860
I know

423
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,260
all of you,

424
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,280
including First Princess,

425
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,300
know about the qin.

426
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,850
But I hope

427
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,060
you can forget everything you've learned

428
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,570
and start over.

429
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,300
It is not easy to play the qin.

430
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,760
Sometimes, it is even harder than studying.

431
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,480
After learning three years, you can be at an elementary level.

432
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,760
After learning five years, you can be at an intermediate level.

433
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,380
After learning seven years, you can be at an advanced level.

434
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,120
This is true in the academic field.

435
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:31,750
However,

436
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,340
learning to play the qin is learning the skills.

437
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,800
When you learn the skills,

438
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,770
you'll know how to play the qin.

439
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,050
You're still young.

440
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,730
I can't teach you much

441
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,310
in six months.

442
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,770
But if you can learn some knowledge

443
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:46,610
and skills,

444
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,090
that is not bad.

445
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,050
Sir, you said learning to play the qin is difficult.

446
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,620
How many years have you been learning to play the qin?

447
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,030
What level are you at now?

448
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,290
I've been learning to play the qin since I was four.

449
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,670
Now, I’m still at an elementary level.

450
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,110
You've been learning to play it for more than 20 years.

451
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,660
You're still at an elementary level.

452
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,660
I'm slow-witted.

453
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,590
If you are gifted and intelligent,

454
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,380
it won't take so long.

455
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,450
Sit up straight while learning to play the qin.

456
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,370
Miss Ning'er posture is quite standard.

457
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,180
I'm flattered.

458
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,240
It's a good qin.

459
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,240
Play a part of the Sound of High Mountains.

460
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,700
Let me see your fingering.

461
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,450
The Sound of High Mountains?

462
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,700
Playing Plum Blossom is also okay.

463
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,010
Please forgive me.

464
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,870
I'm not good at playing the qin.

465
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,520
Do what I do.

466
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,450
Enough is enough.

467
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,030
You sat up straight,

468
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,030
but your performance was terrible.

469
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:37,560
Ning'er.

470
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,220
You haven't learned to play it at all, have you?

471
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,520
Didn't you ask us

472
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,250
to forget what we've learned

473
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,720
and start over again?

474
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,370
It is a pity that this good qin

475
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,030
is in your hands.

476
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,470
How about I change it to a bad qin?

477
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,430
Jiang Xuening.

478
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,120
I only knew you were naughty.

479
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,130
I didn't expect you to be a good-for-nothing.

480
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:57,740
Get out.

481
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,000
I...

482
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,830
Stand outside until the class is over.

483
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:01,760
Don't slack off.

484
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,280
I've told him I'm not good at playing the qin.

485
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,480
Nobody is perfect. How can he punish me?

486
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,070
I've been punished all day.

487
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,730
I'm so unlucky.

488
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,600
Even the wind is bullying me.

489
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,610
Good.

490
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:52,230
Miss Xue, just practice according to this method.

491
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,840
Stand up straight.

492
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,040
What are you doing?

493
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,590
Sir, let me explain.

494
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,020
I'm standing here. I'm not slacking off.

495
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,830
There's no need for you to cry.

496
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:25,750
I didn't...

497
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,280
Don't pretend to be strong.

498
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:27,830
I know.

499
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,160
You must be scared in the Tai'an Hall

500
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,880
yesterday.

501
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,350
No way!

502
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,370
It turns out that it works on Xie Wei.

503
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,970
I didn't mean to punish you.

504
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,390
When you played, the sound was too harsh.

505
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:41,040
I was afraid you would disturb others.

506
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,760
I know

507
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:44,300
you've been worried about Yan Lin.

508
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,760
It is understandable that you couldn’t play well for the moment.

509
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:50,810
All right.

510
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:52,160
Go in.

511
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:53,670
I...

512
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,020
I don't know how to play it.

513
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,580
If I could play it well,

514
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,090
I wouldn't have come to learn.

515
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,360
As a teacher, how could you be so strict?

516
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,640
What else do you want?

517
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,710
Although I'm devoted to learning,

518
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,160
I'm not talented.

519
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,950
I can only give up.

520
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,260
Why don't you

521
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,070
stop my qin lessons?

522
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,210
You stopped pretending?

523
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,500
It's okay if you don't stop them.

524
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,660
But you promised

525
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,600
to let me go back.

526
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,880
You can't go back on your word.

527
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,010
After school today,

528
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:41,550
stay here alone.

529
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,550
Even a silk purse can be made out of a sow's ear.

530
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,210
You're bad at playing the qin.

531
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,660
As a teacher,

532
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,640
I should go to the trouble of teaching you.

533
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,220
I don't understand.

534
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,660
The rebels finally infiltrated the palace.

535
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,090
They didn't assassinate or poison others.

536
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:04,090
They just made a Jade Ruyi Scepter

537
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,620
and carved some words on it.

538
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,990
What's the point of it?

539
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,650
It is nothing in your eyes.

540
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,450
But you don't know

541
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,550
it is a thorn

542
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,660
in other people's eyes.

543
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,780
I don't understand my mother.

544
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,510
My brother is always ill.

545
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:19,890
All the officials haven't talked about inheriting the throne yet.

546
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,220
But she kept forcing me.

547
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,090
Do I have to live for her?

548
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,660
What about you?

549
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,600
Do you really not want to be the crown prince?

550
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,430
It is fine if others don't know me.

551
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,320
Don't you know me?

552
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,580
Crown Prince?

553
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,320
Lord Linzi?

554
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,950
I just want to be an ordinary person.

555
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,740
I want to escape from those hypocritical things

556
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,250
and be myself.

557
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,340
Everyone wants it.

558
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,090
But it is hard.

559
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,960
We can't get what we want.

560
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,840
Some people compete for power,

561
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,880
while others don't want it.

562
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,430
It's destiny.

563
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,610
I feel

564
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,560
you've changed a bit lately.

565
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,680
The date of the coming-of-age ceremony is drawing near.

566
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,140
Isn't it good to be mature?

567
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:07,810
You're right.

568
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:08,920
Forget it.

569
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,540
Stop talking about this.

570
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,600
I'm here today

571
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,280
because I want to go for a walk with you.

572
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,380
I know there's a deserted forest in the south.

573
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,470
We can hunt some wild rabbits.

574
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,000
How about

575
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,530
having a match?

576
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,490
Let's go.

577
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,120
The loser should buy alcohol.

578
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:24,370
OK.

579
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,110
Let's go.

580
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:43,930
[Wenzhao Pavilion]

581
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,040
I heard

582
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,830
that you saved a eunuch named Zheng Bao

583
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,090
at the door of Ning'an Palace yesterday.

584
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,880
Her Highness saved him.

585
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:16,510
Really?

586
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,730
I did help him.

587
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,170
I met a weak person

588
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:22,970
and saved him.

589
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:23,890
It is nothing.

590
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,610
There's no need to mention it.

591
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,410
I thought after a few things happened,

592
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,950
you and I

593
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,830
could trust each other.

594
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,280
Although Zheng Bao

595
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,120
is inconspicuous in the palace,

596
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,720
he is in the good graces

597
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,820
of Wang Xinyi in the Imperial Study.

598
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:54,390
Wang Xinyi has been thinking about promoting Zheng Bao.

599
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:56,120
You helped him out of kindness.

600
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,020
What a coincidence!

601
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,480
I didn't expect you to know so much

602
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,480
about the palace.

603
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,170
You also know what happens

604
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,430
in the Imperial Study.

605
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,400
I always come to the palace.

606
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,600
Of course I know more than you do.

607
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:11,950
What about you?

608
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,680
Did you know the relationship between Zheng Bao and Wang Xinyi

609
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,520
and save him purposefully?

610
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,720
Who is Wang Xinyi?

611
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,430
I've only been in the palace for a few days.

612
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,160
I don't know.

613
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,160
Really?

614
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,630
You even know about raw silk.

615
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,710
What else do you not know?

616
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,240
I've explained it.

617
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,460
It was a coincidence.

618
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,260
I just came to the palace.

619
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,520
I have no one to rely on.

620
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,750
You wanted me to enter the palace.

621
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,760
Her Highness has been taking good care of me.

622
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,960
I'm in the limelight.

623
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,620
Some people will be envious.

624
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,150
If no one helped me,

625
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,340
I might die one day.

626
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,610
That's why I thought

627
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:14,460
if I could save a eunuch,

628
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,490
he might be useful in the future.

629
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,860
My motive was not pure.

630
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,000
But it had nothing to do with the safety of the Yan family.

631
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,860
I didn't break my promise either.

632
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,530
You suspected me.

633
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,090
Does it count as trust?

634
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,270
You feel wronged?

635
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,820
You said

636
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,160
I don't have to pretend

637
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,020
in front of you.

638
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,460
I've told you the truth.

639
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,790
Are you angry again?

640
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,380
Forget it.

641
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:46,940
Things in the palace are always changing.

642
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,500
It is not bad for you to be careful.

643
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,290
But I have to remind you.

644
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,420
If you got involved in the dispute,

645
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:56,960
you might be in danger.

646
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,160
I was entrusted by Yan Lin.

647
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,180
I also agreed to your father's request.

648
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,840
That's why I'm reminding you.

649
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:04,860
You're still young.

650
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,800
Be careful.

651
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,360
Don't make mistakes.

652
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,470
You're also young.

653
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:11,990
What did you say?

654
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,220
I'm asking

655
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,990
if Zheng Bao will really

656
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,700
be promoted by Wang Xinyi in the future.

657
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,360
He's not as good as you.

658
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,160
All right.

659
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,000
Play the tune

660
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,610
that you learned in class.

661
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,670
Are you really going to teach a lesson?

662
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:28,180
What?

663
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,680
You don't want to learn?

664
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,340
Fine.

665
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,070
Just stay here.

666
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,290
Go back when the door closes.

667
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:10,640
Sir.

668
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,650
Let's call it a day.

669
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,270
Why do you torture me

670
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,640
and yourself?

671
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:16,500
Shut up.

672
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,120
Keep playing.

673
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,140
What's wrong with him?

674
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,770
Why did he pick on me?

675
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,820
Does he have nothing to do?

676
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,660
Isn't it good to go home early?

677
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,940
Every line in this tune corresponds.

678
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,040
When it comes to the end of every line,

679
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,950
you have to press a finger against the string.

680
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,500
You're pressing your finger against the string too hard.

681
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,640
You need to relax.

682
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:31,700
Are there any problems?

683
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,380
Why don't you get up?

684
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:39,690
I was reckless.

685
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,300
Luckily, the qin is fine.

686
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,660
I'm glad you know that.

687
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,270
Where did the cat come from?

688
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,090
It's so cute.

689
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,770
Sir, look.

690
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,300
Sir, look.

691
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,179
How dare you do that?

692
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:10,540
I...

693
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,510
I asked you here to learn to play the qin,

694
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:14,550
not to have fun.

695
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,380
If you can't play well tomorrow,

696
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,540
don't come to class again.

697
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,810
Go back!

698
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,150
He said we should trust each other,

699
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,429
but he went off all of a sudden.

700
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:48,440
He's moody.

701
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,590
I wanted to ask him about the Jade Ruyi Scepter.

702
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,300
Now...

703
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:54,880
Miss Jiang.

704
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,990
Greetings, Miss Jiang.

705
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,510
Thank you for saving me yesterday.

706
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,680
How do you know I saved you?

707
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,590
Yesterday, it was Her Highness who saved you.

708
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,290
I've been in the palace since childhood.

709
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:10,100
I know what I should know.

710
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:13,710
The palace is full of people who safeguard themselves.

711
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,160
Even if we were old friends,

712
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,740
no one dared to save me.

713
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:18,560
Only you

714
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,600
dared to speak up for me at that moment

715
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,130
even though we didn't know each other before.

716
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,060
I want

717
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,330
to thank you for what you did.

718
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,640
But do you know

719
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,340
my motive

720
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,720
was not pure?

721
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,170
Are you disappointed?

722
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:38,540
Not really.

723
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,860
I'm just confused.

724
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,730
So you came to me today

725
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,590
to repay me?

726
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:46,440
That was my plan.

727
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,330
What about now?

728
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,400
You saved me.

729
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,130
If you hadn't told me,

730
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,920
your motive was indeed not pure.

731
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,320
Since you told me just now

732
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,870
your motive was very pure.

733
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,360
That's true.

734
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,650
After all, I helped you

735
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:02,790
in the hope that you can be used by me.

736
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,280
You're very honest.

737
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:08,380
You've never seen me being hypocritical.

738
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:10,780
What did you say?

739
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,060
I know you are an honest and kind person.

740
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,280
If you have loyalty,

741
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,570
swear it to someone who is worthy of it.

742
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:18,710
I

743
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,460
will stay in the palace for only six months.

744
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,440
I'll be honest.

745
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,060
And I won't hurt others.

746
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,890
I'm just afraid

747
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,820
no one will help me when I'm in trouble one day.

748
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,780
So I want to find someone who can help me in advance.

749
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,040
If something happens,

750
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,690
I won't be caught off guard.

751
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,900
You're my saviour.

752
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:34,870
If you don't want to hurt others,

753
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,470
why can't I help you?

754
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,770
I can be counted as your saviour?

755
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,340
Some things should be judged by people's deeds instead of motives.

756
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,600
There's no good person

757
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,530
who do things out of kindness.

758
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,430
Yes, there is.

759
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,130
Who is it?

760
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,110
I'll let you meet him in the future

761
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,240
if there is a chance.

762
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,480
Thank you for your ledgers.

763
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,410
I learned a lot after reading them.

764
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,650
Please have a seat.

765
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:21,970
But

766
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,680
there seem to be two errors.

767
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:26,880
Some accounts are lacking.

768
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,720
I made a calculation again

769
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,850
and wrote them down.

770
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,610
Have a look.

771
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,110
Yes. This page.

772
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:34,960
Have a look.

773
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:36,640
Was I wrong?

774
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,460
You might not be wrong.

775
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,620
Maybe I didn't learn well.

776
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,650
I might be wrong.

777
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,390
I was wrong.

778
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,010
You've been learning to do accounts

779
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,040
for a short time.

780
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,060
You've already learned a lot.

781
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,070
No.

782
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,310
I'm slow-witted.

783
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,370
You taught me well.

784
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,120
By the way, Mr. Xu,

785
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,240
the price of silk has multiplied.

786
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,670
Please sell all the silk for me.

787
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,990
Of course I will give you commission.

788
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:07,540
Miss,

789
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,960
you helped me and the silkworm farmers before.

790
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,780
You don't have to give me

791
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,510
commission.

792
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:12,600
But

793
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,590
the price of silk keeps rising.

794
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,150
Are you going to sell it now?

795
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,260
I've read your accounts which have been recorded in recent years.

796
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,430
The price of silk will stop rising or falling sooner or later.

797
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,360
The price is almost the highest price.

798
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,760
I don't want to be greedy.

799
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,040
Why do you look at me like that?

800
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,130
Nothing.

801
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,440
I just think

802
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,840
you're suitable

803
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:35,360
to do business.

804
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,650
Let me have a look.

805
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:43,300
Sister Yao.

806
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,160
Let me have a look.

807
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,520
Let us have a look.

808
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:47,650
Sister Yao, tell us.

809
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,370
What does the letter say?

810
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,990
Why are you blushing?

811
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,310
You're annoying.

812
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,660
You're making fun of me.

813
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,250
Isn't this Miss Jiang?

814
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,520
What a coincidence!

815
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,370
There's a piece of good news about Sister Yao.

816
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:02,650
What happened?

817
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,620
Nothing.

818
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,370
My mother sent me a letter.

819
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,410
It says that my father proposed to the Zhang family for me.

820
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,470
I'll stop talking.

821
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,140
Your father is so strange.

822
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,470
How can a girl take the initiative?

823
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:15,670
No.

824
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,880
Why did you choose Zhang Zhe again?

825
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,550
If I broke off the engagement,

826
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,310
people would criticize me.

827
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,960
But I've thought about it.

828
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,720
It doesn't matter that his family background is poor.

829
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,350
It doesn't matter that his mother is a widow.

830
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,590
I have everything anyway.

831
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,990
I don't need him to worry.

832
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:31,810
Miss Jiang also said

833
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,820
Mr. Zhang is outstanding.

834
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:34,920
It's not bad.

835
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,540
I think

836
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,420
you should thank Miss Jiang

837
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,270
for this good marriage.

838
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:42,670
Xuening.

839
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:44,770
I misunderstood you before.

840
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,280
If you hadn't said it,

841
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,730
I would have been lost.

842
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:48,720
Thank you.

843
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,590
You're really a good person.

844
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,950
Miss Yao, you don't have to do this.

845
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:54,850
This marriage

846
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,530
has nothing to do with me.

847
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,300
Miss Jiang is so kind.

848
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:00,570
You haven't married yet,

849
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:03,200
but you still have time to care about others.

850
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:05,950
Why hasn't Viscount Yan come to see you lately?

851
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,090
Did your dream fall through?

852
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:09,310
You Yue.

853
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,230
[Wenzhao Pavilion]

854
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:27,690
Sir.

855
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,210
How is it?

856
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,340
Half of our people in the palace died.

857
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,140
The rest dare not act rashly.

858
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:40,880
What happened?

859
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,500
Mr. Gong Yi

860
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,580
marshalled many people in the palace

861
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,050
in the name of you

862
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,870
and sent that Jade Ruyi Scepter to the Imperial Household Department

863
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:50,470
after it evaded inspection.

864
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,360
Because all the people in the palace

865
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,930
contact with only one person at a time.

866
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:55,340
It was too late

867
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,270
when I knew it.

868
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,370
It was really him.

869
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,140
Yesterday, Eunuch Huang

870
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,300
checked the records of the Imperial Household Department.

871
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,720
Although he didn't find any evidence,

872
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:07,190
he found

873
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,490
the time you came to the palace to teach was inappropriate.

874
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:12,530
I was afraid that you might be framed,

875
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:14,190
so I took a risk to remind you

876
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,570
outside the Imperial Study.

877
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:16,170
It's okay.

878
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:17,710
You did a good job.

879
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,100
But

880
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,520
the situation in the palace is tense.

881
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,020
I'm afraid you can't stay in the Imperial Study anymore.

882
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:24,840
Find a chance

883
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:26,410
to transfer to another place.

884
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:26,790
Yes.

885
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:38,740
She's willing to marry into a poor family even though she’s from a noble family.

886
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,940
She provides timely help and never adds insult to injury.

887
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:43,660
She's not snobbish.

888
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,190
She never breaks promises.

889
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:46,480
Zhang Zhe.

890
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,440
Yao Xi must be a good girl

891
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:50,300
in your eyes.

892
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,880
Will you agree to this marriage?

893
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,070
It’s you again.

894
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,020
Why did you come out again?

895
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,870
How dare you mess around at the door of Wenzhao Pavilion?

896
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:09,870
Do you want to die?

897
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,640
You're just like me.

898
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:15,980
We know what we can't do.

899
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,420
But we can't control ourselves.

900
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:27,720
You don't have to interfere in the matter of the Jade Ruyi Scepter.

901
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,450
You don't have to take a risk to come to me anymore.

902
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:33,750
The Jade Ruyi Scepter?

903
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:35,360
It has something to do with him?

904
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:35,950
But

905
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:38,330
Duke of Xue has perceived something.

906
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,110
Without our help,

907
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,430
you...

908
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,160
It's fine.

909
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,560
I can handle it.

910
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,890
I saved you from Jinling.

911
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,570
I don't want you to die.

912
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:48,870
From now on,

913
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,620
you don't have to serve others anymore.

914
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,070
You're just a eunuch

915
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:54,500
in the palace.

916
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,030
Yes.

917
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:56,670
There's one more thing.

918
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:59,270
The people sent by Gongyi Cheng told me

919
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,390
that Jade Ruyi Scepter

920
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:04,690
was used to frame the Yan family for being disloyal.

921
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,450
I see.

922
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:09,800
Go back.

923
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,740
Be careful not to be seen.

924
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:12,890
Yes.
