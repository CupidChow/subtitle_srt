the failure of the Tongzhou military camp rebellion last time

was also his work.

160

In my opinion,

161
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,130
we must go back to Jinling immediately

162
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,610

163
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,290
about this.

164
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,020
No.

If we leave now,

167
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,030
we can't take back

00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,960
If he has defected,

175
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,100
I'll kill him immediately.

176
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,590
But the prison

177
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,750
is guarded by Xingwu Guards.

178
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,730
How can we barge in with the few men

179
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:58,860
we have?

180
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,870
To be honest,

181
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,150
a few days ago,

182
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,120
I heard that

183
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,750
a while ago, Lord Pingnan

184
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,590
sent Feng Mingyu to the capital secretly

185
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,050
with gunpowder to blow up the Tongzhou Pass.

186
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,200
Gunpowder?

187
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,060
So,

188
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,260
we'll find the right time

189
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,560
to bring Gongyi Cheng out of the capital.

190
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,220
Then, General Feng will take us back to Jinling.

191
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,250
Why didn't you tell me

192
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,890
about such a major matter?

193
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,440
Huang.

194
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,250
I really regarded you as my brother.

195
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,110
How could you hide things from me?

196
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,320
Lord Pingnan told me to keep it from you.

197
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,500
I follow Lord Pingnan's orders.

198
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:36,900
Fine.

199
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,880
Feng Mingyu is already here.

200
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,809
It seems that Lord Pingnan

201
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,440
doesn't want to lose his plan in the north.

202
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,300
In that case,

203
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,830
let’s take action

204
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,880
on the day the Yan family is exiled.

205
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,720
At that time,

206
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,740
a large portion of the Xingwu Guards

207
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,400
will be out for escort duties.

208
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,670
The prison will be empty

209
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,930
and it'll be easier for us to take action.

210
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:56,740
Fine.

211
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,630
Xue Dingfei sent a message.

212
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,710
According to what you taught him,

213
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,910
he managed to spur Huang Qian

214
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,310
to break into the prison.

215
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,430
But

216
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,690
there has been a slight change in this matter.

217
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,250
Change?

218
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,010
What change?

219
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,410
Lord Pingnan secretly sent Feng Mingyu to the capital

220
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,980
and he brought along a lot of gunpowder

221
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,640
to destroy the Tongzhou Pass.

222
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,240
For Huang Qian's prison break this time,

223
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,440
Feng Mingyu will also come to assist us.

224
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,540
Back in Jinling,

225
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,540
Gongyi Cheng and I

226
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,320
were strategists under Lord Pingnan's command.

227
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,070
Lord Pingnan is prone to suspicion

228
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,000
and often reinforced checks and balances between the two of us.

229
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,530
That's why I looked for a gap

230
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,700
to plot in secret.

231
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,000
But Feng Mingyu is different.

232
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,940
Under Lord Pingnan's command,

233
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,900
he's the only commander leading the military.

234
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,720
He's deeply trusted by Lord Pingnan.

235
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,320
Although he has never met me,

236
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,680
he must know a lot about me.

237
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,270
It won't be easy

238
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,820
for Zhang Zhe to act as Dujun

239
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,750
directly

240
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,160
under his nose.

241
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:02,510
Sir.

242
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,940
Then what should we do?

243
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,420
If Zhang Zhe slips up,

244
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,660
Feng Mingyu would definitely figure out

245
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,860
that it was your plan.

246
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,100
Exactly.

247
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,530
Xue Dingfei

248
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,090
is unreliable.

249
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,360
We can't be sure that he won't betray you.

250
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,000
But now's not the time

251
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,950
to cross swords with Lord Pingnan.

252
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,830
For now,

253
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,670
we can only take the risk

254
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,750
and tell Zhang Zhe things about Dujun

255
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,060
and hope

256
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,430
that he can stay alive until Tongzhou.

257
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,300
With Zhang Zhe's intelligence,

258
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:32,540
what you are doing is tantamount to
drinking poison to quench your thirst.

259
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,140
Even if you hide it from Feng Mingyu,

260
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,750
after Zhang Zhe returns to the capital,

261
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,780
you'll be interrogated by the Ministry of Justice.

262
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,580
If Zhang Zhe insists on doing it,

263
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,340
we can only use Feng Mingyu

264
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,850
to kill everyone

265
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,930
in Tongzhou.

266
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,620
Previously, you proposed to Shen Lang

267
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,720
to send Xue Yuan to Tongzhou to meet him

268
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,500
so that he'd fight with the rebels

269
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
and you'd reap the benefits easily.

270
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,140
But now, Feng Mingyu has gunpowder.

271
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,970
It's impossible to survive the explosion.

272
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,970
Do you intend to also let Xue Yuan...

273
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,090
Yes.

274
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,950
Those who have committed many crimes

275
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,050
should be punished.

276
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,580
But after all, he is your...

277
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,590
Think it through again.

278
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,470
-Let’s go.
-Sir.

279
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,310
Miss.

280
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,010
Mr. Zhou sent a message

281
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,560
saying that the court has issued a decree today

282
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,260
and Viscount Yan will be exiled tonight.

283
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:51,980
He asked you

284
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,460
if you want to see him off.

285
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,340
Tonight?

286
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,010
Why is it so sudden?

287
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,550
The last time, this didn't happen so quickly.

288
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,250
Miss.

289
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:03,820
I want to see him off.

290
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,270
Ask him to arrange it for me quickly.

291
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:05,640
Yes.

292
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,460
I don't know what happened today.

293
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,030
The exile date was suddenly decided

294
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,490
and many of the men of the Xingwu Guards were dispatched.

295
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,390
That's why I got the chance

296
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,990
to let you meet Viscount Yan.

297
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,110
Although I left in a hurry,

298
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,710
luckily, you told me in time.

299
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,590
If I weren't able to see him off,

300
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,900
I'd feel uneasy.

301
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,690
Don't mention it.

302
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,420
It's right ahead.

303
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,170
I've unlocked the door.

304
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,510
No one will come for the time being,

305
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,280
but hurry up.

306
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,870
I'll wait for you outside.

307
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:04,840
Don't move.

308
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,060
Didn't His Majesty order them

309
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,120
not to torture you and Marquis of Yan?

310
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,600
How dare they beat you?

311
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,790
How dare you come here?

312
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,920
You're all grown up.

313
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,550
You haven't recovered yet.

314
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,510
When you get the Huangzhou,

315
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,060
who knows how much more you'll have to suffer.

316
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,860
A few days ago,

317
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,850
Xue Ye looked for me

318
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,070
and caused trouble.

319
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,040
But everyone who had to hit me

320
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,840
knew about His Majesty's order.

321
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,930
They didn't dare to use actual force.

322
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,280
This is just a front

323
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,540
to scare others.

324
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,800
It doesn't hurt at all.

325
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,680
How many times have I been beaten by my father?

326
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,810
Others may not know,

327
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,830
but you do.

328
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:49,740
All right.

329
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,110
Look at

330
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,620
how dazed you are.

331
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,150
I'm afraid I can't rest assured

332
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,080
when I have to leave for Huangzhou.

333
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,170
Yan Lin.

334
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,440
I'm not stupid.

335
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,380
I know.

336
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,300
You were the one who detected Xue family's plot

337
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,770
early on and informed us.

338
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,880
You were also the one

339
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,010
who looked for Zhou Yinzhi and bribed Xingwu Guards to look out for me.

340
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,670
There must be many other areas

341
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,330
you're helping me out with

342
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,170
that I don't know about.

343

00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,810
If there are many people breaking in,

515
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,140
there might be trouble.

516
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:57,350
How about this?

517
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:57,830
Miss.

518
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,540
Take this

519
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,380
and run along the path.

520
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,460
Find an empty prison cell to hide in.

521
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,130
Don't come out no matter what you hear.

522
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:02,900
What about you?

523
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,250
I have to take a look first.

524
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,220
I'll come to you when things calm down.

525
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:06,500
Okay.

526
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,160
Don't come out no matter what.

527
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:10,730
Let me out!

528
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,990
Let me out!

529
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,260
Let me out!

530
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,770
I'm innocent!

531
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,980
I'm innocent!

532
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,740
I'm innocent, Sir.

533
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,780
Be quiet!

534
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,740
Let us out!

535
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,870
Shut up!

536
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:21,880
I'm innocent!

537
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,010
I'm innocent, Sir!

538
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:23,810
Sir!

539
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,140
I'm innocent!

540
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,170
Let us out!

541
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,790
Let us out!

542
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,030
Let us out now!

543
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,770
-Brother!
-Brother!

544
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,190
Let us out!

545
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,320
Sir.

546
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,460
What's going on outside?

547
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,540
The gangsters who broke into the prison broke the chains everywhere

548
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,740
and released the prisoners.

549
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,660
We're already short-handed.

550
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,900
Now, we're even surrounded by enemies.

551
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,810
Don't panic!

552
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,060
Hurry and get out from the back.

553
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,920
Ask Duke to send reinforcements.

554
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,380
Yes.

555
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,280
Bastard official!

556
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,330
When I get out,

557
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,830
I'll kill you.

558
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:06,620
Brother!

559
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,150
Brother.

560
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,330
Instead of letting these prisoners

561
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,940
cooperate with the gangsters,

562
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,940
why don't we kill them all here?

563
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,580
Do it!

564
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,560
Sir.

565
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:20,640
They

566
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,100
aren't all death row inmates.

567
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,710
Things are urgent.
I can't take everything into consideration.

568
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,140
When those gangsters rush in later,

569
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,830
we'll be the ones to die.

570
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,280
Kill them!

571
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:30,810
Yes.

572
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:31,820
Let's go!

573
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:38,490
Help! Help!

574
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,830
Who's there?

575
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,740
Brothers.

576
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,740
Let's fight these bastard officials!

577
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,350
Kill them!

578
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,010
Why are you here?

579
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:15,450
Hurry and find Mr. Gongyi!

580
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,660
Pardon me, Miss Jiang.

581
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,220
But this is not the time to talk.

582
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,700
The rebels will come and search here soon.

583
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,060
Please change your clothes.

584
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,780
It's too exquisite. It's easy to be suspected.

585
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,370
Rebels?

586
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,830
The ones who broke into the prison are rebels?

587
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:46,730
I'll do it myself.

588
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,840
♫Wind blows gently♫

589
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:04,820
♫The fallen flowers bloom in my heart♫

590
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:11,270
♫Your whisper under the moonlight sounds beautiful♫

591
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,900
♫Getting closer gently♫

592
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,200
♫The season stays in dreamland♫

593
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,470
♫The snow is very light♫

594
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:25,070
I'll use this to tie your hair.

595
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:32,670
♫It doesn't stop even after filling all the cracks in the eaves♫

596
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,250
Tonight, the court

597
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,910
plans to trap the rebels here.

598
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:38,910
♫You left in a hurry, leaving traces in the snow♫

599
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,470
If you go out now,

600
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:37,340
I'm afraid your life would be in danger.

601
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,140
Later, please stay by my side

602
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,060
and act cautiously.

603
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,830
♫They're about to be erased now♫

604
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,620
Please forgive me

605
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,920
if I offended you.

606
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,160
♫Disrupting my expectations♫

607
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:58,680
Attack!

608
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,290
Duke.

609
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,020
The prison is in chaos now.

610
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:40,820
Please tell us

611
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:41,930
what we should do.

612
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,190
How dare those petty gangsters

613
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,650
wreak havoc under my nose?

614
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,470
Every one who's caused trouble in the prison tonight

615
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,080
must be killed.

616
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:52,790
Yes.

617
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:10,970
Kill!

618
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:37,610
Huang.

619
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,570
I haven't seen Mr. Gongyi.

620
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:40,810
He's not there either.

621
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:41,650
The information is clear.

622
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,850
How could it go wrong?

623
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:43,530
Keep searching.

624
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:43,890
Yes.

625
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:45,740
Stop searching.

626
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,080
Gongyi Cheng is not in the prison.

627
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,140
You've fallen into the court's trap.

628
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,120
Who are you?

629
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,360
I'm like you,

630
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,320
one of Lord Pingnan's men.

631
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,350
Stop talking.

632
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,330
It's still not too late.

633
00:31:58,330 --> 00:31:59,330
Go out with me now.

634
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:00,890
Wait.

635
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,460
We didn't declare our identities.

636
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,940
How did you know who we are?

637
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:10,980
If you can't explain this,

638
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,910
don't blame me for being ruthless.

639
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:28,140
Kill!

640
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,290
Huang!

641
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,070
Huang!

642
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,310
Huang.

643
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,080
There are many men from the Xingwu Guards outside

644
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,100
and all our comrades are dead.

645
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:50,730
Let's run away.

646
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:51,250
What?

647
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,290
What are you waiting for?

648
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,370
The court deliberately released the news that Gongyi Cheng is here

649
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:56,520
to trap you.

650
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:57,820
If you don't leave now,

651
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,870
it'll be too late.

652
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,540
There are so many people outside.

653
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,470
How can we leave?

654
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,230
Follow me.

655
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:12,060
Let's go.

656
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,350
Everyone, stop what you're doing!

657
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:45,550
Tell me.

658
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:49,050
Who ordered you and what do you want to do

659
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,280
by breaking into the prison?

660
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,590
Cut the crap.

661
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:53,930
Kill me if you want.

662
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,450
Someone will avenge me.

663
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:03,840
Ye.

664
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,630
Bring some men to search the capital.

665
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,840
I don't believe a dozen of bandits

666
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:09,739
could

667
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:12,199
have wreaked such havoc in the prison.

668
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,190
There must be

669
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,370
something fishy in this.

670
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:16,270
Yes.

671
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,540
Duke, you are wise.

672
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,219
It's not that our defense was weak,

673
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:23,380
but that a lot of our men were dispatched to the court tonight.

674
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,489
There were barely any men for defense duties.

675
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:25,080
So...

676
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,090
That's just an excuse.

677
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,350
No matter how many men were dispatched,

678
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,560
the government will surely

679
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,489
leave enough men here for defense.

680
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,210
How could it've turned out like this?

681
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:39,070
I think there's someone among you

682
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:41,810
who either left their post without permission,

683
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:42,540
or is

684
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:45,780
colluding with the bandits.

685
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:48,110
Duke.

686
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,670
I...

687
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,100
I think Zhou Yinzhi is very suspicious.

688
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,130
He'd previously left his post without permission

689
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,730
for three consecutive days.

690
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,430
Who knows what he was up to.

691
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,020
Besides,

692
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,180
he was the one who ordered for

693
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,980
the prisoners here to be killed.

694
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,070
Left my post without permission?

695
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,810
I think you're the one who left your duty without permission.

696
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:09,610
Weren't you the last one to show up

697
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,620
when the bandits were causing chaos?

698
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,560
Nonsense!

699
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:14,930
Duke.

700
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,450
I can testify for Sergeant Zhou.

701
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:18,560
Wei Xi.

702
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,720
-You...
-Duke.

703
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,230
If we didn't kill these prisoners,

704
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,570
they'd definitely have joined the bandits in causing chaos.

705
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:25,720
Not only that,

706
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,630
they'd also have become eyewitnesses

707
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:31,490
to testify about the Xingwu Guards' incompetence.

708
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:32,510
I believe

709
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:33,830
that if you were there,

710
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,630
you'd have made the same choice.

711
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,270
If you don't believe me,

712
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:38,980
you can take

713
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,690
my life!

714
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:12,690
Thank you, Duke.

715
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:17,010
Get up.

716
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:19,820
I killed him

717
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:21,950
not because I trust you

718
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:23,970
or

719
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,480
that I want to protect you,

720
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,260
but to warn you.

721
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,650
And you.

722
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,580
See?

723
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,340
This is his end.

724
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,350
In my hands,

725
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,160
no matter if you're a stupid traitor

726
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,130
or a scheming

727
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:44,700
traitor,

728
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,480
no one will be spared.

729
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:47,930
Yes.

730
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:07,580
Huang.

731
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,320
They're coming this way soon.

732
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,520
Are we still leaving from the East Gate?

733
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:15,680
How did you know

734
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,840
about Gongyi Cheng?

735
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,180
And about your identity,

736
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,240
can you tell me now?

737
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,620
I entered the prison to save Gongyi Cheng

738
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:24,350
and now, I've rescued you from the Xingwu Guards.

739
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,320
Does it matter

740
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:26,630
who I am?

741
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:27,980
What do you mean?

742
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,690
You've been by Lord Pingnan's side for so many years.

743
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,340
Haven’t you heard of

744
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,190
Dujun, the Hermit?

745
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,000
Dujun, the Hermit?

746
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,160
You're Mr. Dujun?

747
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:40,960
Huang.

748
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,190
We can be saved.

749
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,650
We have Mr. Dujun here.

750
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,250
He'll have a way to get us out.

751
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,110
Dujun, the Hermit?

752
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,600
Under Lord Pingnan's order, it's true that

753
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,600
Mr. Dujun has been lurking in court.

754
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,100
But we've never seen

755
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,350
his face before.

756
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,670
How can I believe you?

757
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,780
You should have some way to prove it.

758
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,240
Was what happened tonight

759
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:03,790
not enough proof?

760
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,090
When Gongyi Cheng was arrested,

761
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:08,930
I tried my best and used every means to fool everyone

762
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:10,660
and entered the prison to find him,

763
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,760
but found nothing.

764
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,450
After thinking about it,

765
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:15,410
I realized I'd fallen into the court's trap.

766
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:16,870
Fortunately, I had a plan.

767
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,750
But I ran into you fools.

768
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:26,030
Do you mean that the court

769
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,850
knew we were going to break into the prison?

770
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,520
But we were ordered to come to the capital secretly.

771
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,780
How could it be leaked?

772
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,940
If my guess is right,

773
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,250
Gongyi Cheng must have already defected.

774
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,490
The court has found out

775
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:38,750
everything about you.

776
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:40,890
The East Gate must be heavily guarded right now.

777
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:41,850
We can't escape.

778
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,460
You can clarify my identity

779
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:48,070
by sending someone to the East Gate to have a look.

780
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,640
You go.

781
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:49,770
Be careful.

782
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:50,150
Yes.

783
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,930
Black clothes and prisoner clothes are too obvious.

784
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,340
Get some ordinary clothes.

785
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:57,670
Yes.

786
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:10,210
There are four city gates in the capital.

787
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:12,050
At night, His Majesty would order

788
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,130
the imperial guards

789
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:15,290
to be garrisoned at the East, South, and North gates in groups

790
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:16,200
and feign an ambush.

791
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,200
Only the West Gate will be unguarded.

792
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,100
By then, you'll

793
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:21,530
just have to bring the rebels who escaped from the prison

794
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:22,460
to the West Gate.

795
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,490
Once you say the secret code,

796
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,880
they'll let you go.

797
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,380
This move

798
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:28,870
will be enough

799
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,690
to gain the rebels' trust.

800
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,340
I heard that Dujun, the Hermit is very elusive.

801
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,190
This move

802
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,770
is feasible indeed.

803
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,630
If I’m right,

804
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,750
after the rebels leave the capital,

805
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,100
they'll find a place to stay outside the city

806
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,230
and gather their men

807
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:45,930
before heading to Tongzhou.

808
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:47,970
There are three routes

809
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,450
from the capital to Tongzhou.

810
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:49,990
I

811
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,930
can’t predict their choice.

812
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,300
So on this journey,

813
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,630
you're on your own.

814
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,140
On the way,

815
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:05,500
I'll try to find out where all the rebel strongholds are.

816
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:07,130
After you've

817
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,590
entered Tongzhou,

818
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,920
use this secret code again to find Yongding Pharmacy.

819
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,270
At that time, the people from the court will assist you.

820
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:14,670
Okay.

821
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,510
But

822
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:20,230
you seem to be very familiar with the rebels' behavior.

823
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,040
Are you sure

824
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:24,120
you got all this just from the confession of the rebels?

825
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,250
You work in the Ministry of Justice.

826
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,800
You handle unjust cases every day.

827
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,290
It's good to be cautious.

828
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,120
But if you go too far,

829
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,960
it's paranoia.

830
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,860
Paranoia

831
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,890
is not good for yourself.

832
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:42,310
Am I right?

833
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,510
Huang.

834
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:14,000
There are many soldiers at the East Gate.

835
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,930
We can't get out.

836
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:16,830
Gongyi Cheng

837
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:19,370
that bastard really sold us out.

838
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,760
It's not too late to find out now.

839
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:24,860
Now, the Xingwu Guards are searching the city

840
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:27,170
and the city gates are heavily guarded.

841
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:29,210
Do you still not believe what I said?

842
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:32,330
You make it sound like you can get us out.

843
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:34,130
I've been in the court for years.

844
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,550
I still have manpower.

845
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,780
If you want to live,

846
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:39,830
come with me.

847
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:43,710
Huang.

848
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:45,090
What should we do?

849
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:46,120
What else can we do?

850
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:46,650
Let's go.

851
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,500
Guys, check carefully.

852
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:58,820
Over there.

853
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,720
See if there's anyone else alive.

854
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,290
This one.

855
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:09,890
Okay.

856
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:30,940
Miss.

857
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:36,700
Miss!

858
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:51,720
Oh no.

859
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:07,260
At this point,

860
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:09,220
you still don't believe me?

861
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,370
If nothing happens at the city gate,

862
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:11,900
I'll return your men to you.

863
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,500
Who are you?

864
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:23,020
Boss Huang from Western City.

865
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:23,690
I have goods

866
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,810
that I have to pick up urgently from outside the capital.

867
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:27,690
The procedures are done

868
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:29,250
and all the documents are there.

869
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:30,450
Please open the gate.

870
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:33,820
So it's Boss Huang who needs to leave the city.

871
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,880
Open the gate.

872
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:35,900
Yes.

873
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:38,190
I've long heard that Mr. Dujun

874
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:38,880
is a spy

875
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,500
planted in the court by Lord Pingnan.

876
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,500
I didn't expect him to be so capable.

877
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,680
Guys.

878
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:05,940
Ning'er was kidnapped?

879
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,080
How did she get involved in this?

880
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,670
Junior Preceptor Xie.

881
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:11,530
You know about the prison matter?

882
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,430
Please forgive me.

883
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:19,170
It’s my fault.

884
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,150
I failed to protect her.

885
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,970
Those gangsters were vicious.

886
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,960
I was just worried about her safety.

887
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,200
If I weren't careful,

888
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:31,350
it might taint her innocence.

889
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:32,630
So

890
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,840
I didn't dare to report it to the Duke.

891
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:36,600
I have no choice.

892
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,620
I can only come to you.

893
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:40,210
You're a smart person.

894
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,700
You mustn't tell anyone anything

895
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:46,350
about Miss Ning'er being at the prison tonight.

896
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:47,110
Otherwise,

897
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,070
I'll kill you.
