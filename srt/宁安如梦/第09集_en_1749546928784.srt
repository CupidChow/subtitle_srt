1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
Royal Maids

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:17,420
Episode 12

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,960
However far I have gone

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,080
with His Majesty's order

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,540
I was tempted to更one the Doomsday Ofzukі

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:25,640
as long as we promise 2022

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,840
It's a trap!

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,040
It's a trap!

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,360
It's a trap!

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,640
It's a trap!

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,760
The kill is a trap.

12
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,920
The life is a trap.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,080
Everything seems to be a dream.

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,640
I've owed a lot of people.

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,120
Your Majesty, help me.

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,800
I'll be a good person after this.

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,240
I'll be a good person.

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,840
I'll be a good person.

19
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,240
I'll be a good person.

20
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,240
Something you can't give me.

21
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,240
But he...

22
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,240
I'll help you with your life.

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,640
In this world, everyone has the right to escape.

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,240
But I can't.

25
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,440
I want to regret the past.

26
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,440
I'll regret it.

27
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,440
I'll do my best to return.

28
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,440
Do you believe in the past?

29
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,440
I'd rather believe in the past.

30
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,440
Your Highness.

31
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,440
The world is a trap.

32
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,440
Ming'er, what are you afraid of?

33
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,440
In the future,

34
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,440
there will be a pair of invisible hands

35
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,440
that will break everything back to the original position.

36
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,440
The revenge is a long story.

37
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,440
Who are you in the end?

38
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,440
Emperor Fan Hua is really a long battle.

39
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,440
He's a wild man.

40
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,440
He's a strong man.

41
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,440
There's a proof.

42
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,440
I'm very warm and considerate.

43
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,440
I hope you can see my dreams.

44
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,440
Your Highness, you've improved a lot.

45
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,440
When did you practice?

46
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,440
Qing Feng, you're a horse-drawn horse.

47
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,440
We're the best in the world.

48
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,440
You're the best.

49
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,440
What's wrong with you?

50
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,440
I'm so sorry.

51
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,440
I'm so humble.

52
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,440
But what happened?

53
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,440
Is it bad?

54
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,440
Ding Guogong?

55
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,440
He's being stopped by the emperor.

56
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,440
Why is he in the wilderness?

57
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,440
Qing Feng, I have something in the mountain.

58
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,440
Take him back.

59
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,440
I'll be right back.

60
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,440
Yes.

61
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,440
What's that?

62
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,440
Take me with you.

63
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,440
Your Highness, wait.

64
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,440
Let's go back first.

65
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,440
Give me a reason to not kill you.

66
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,440
You just passed by.

67
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,440
You didn't mean to ask for my secret.

68
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,440
The person just said

69
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,440
that Yu Ruyi came here to smoke.

70
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,440
You should have asked me this.

71
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,440
It's about Yanling.

72
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,440
If you don't tell me,

73
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,440
I'll just tell the others about what happened tonight.

74
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,440
Ning,

75
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,440
do you think I'm too soft-hearted?

76
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,440
You're too good at talking, right?

77
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,440
I've warned you when you entered the palace.

78
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,440
Don't make me angry.

79
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,440
You're smart and you think you're incompetent.

80
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,440
You thought you could interfere with the court

81
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,440
when you were in charge of Zhou Yingzhi's case.

82
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,440
You thought you cared about Yanjia,

83
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,440
but you didn't know

84
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,440
how much you would be lied to Yanling

85
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,440
for doing what you did.

86
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,440
You're so ignorant.

87
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,440
You're so stubborn.

88
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,440
You don't know how to change things.

89
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,440
You're right.

90
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,440
What about you?

91
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,440
What's the relationship between

92
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,440
what the person just said and you?

93
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,440
How much is it about Yu Ruyi?

94
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,440
I'm the one who called Yanjia.

95
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,440
Or you?

96
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,440
Yan Ling,

97
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,440
give me a break.

98
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,440
They want to find out.

99
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,440
I'll call myself an 줄女.

100
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,440
You shouldn't use them for nothing.

101
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,440
Stop.

102
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,440
Stop!

103
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,440
I Во d Ng invoke Trauma.

104
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,880
So, you have your own way.

105
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,880
So, you have your own way.

106
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,600
I do have my own way.

107
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,800
I do have my own way.

108
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,560
But I'm not a saint.

109
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm not a saint.

110
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,080
Jiang Xue Ning.

111
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,440
You're a little clever.

112
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,520
You never act recklessly.

113
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,760
But you should remember.

114
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,120
If you don't want to touch anything,

115
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,800
don't suppress yourselfada.

116
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,540
Maybe you're nervous,

117
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,960
even you can't take a turn.

118
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,880
In terms of military spirit?

119
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,800
Yes.

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,080
I watched the entire night.

121
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,480
č out of disaster, cold grass, and weapons,

122
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:35,860
it's military spirit's

123
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,160
thick.

124
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,560
If we count it down, we can raise at least 3,000 people.

125
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,960
Four!

126
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,960
Three!

127
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,360
Four!

128
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,560
Four!

129
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,160
Five!

130
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,960
One!

131
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,360
Four!

132
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,560
Two!

133
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,760
Three!

134
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
Four!

135
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,360
Three!

136
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,560
Four!

137
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,160
Five!

138
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,360
One!

139
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,760
Four!

140
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,360
The Star of the Five Seasons is the best of the emperor's.

141
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,160
Although Xue Yuan is in charge,

142
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,560
everything is in use.

143
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,960
The court has decided.

144
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,160
He has collected so many things.

145
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,960
It seems that he is trying to change the Yangtze Army.

146
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,760
Changing the Yangtze Army is a serious crime.

147
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,960
His Majesty won't agree.

148
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,560
Is Xue Jia afraid of the Great Taoism and dares to hide it from His Majesty?

149
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,760
Xue Yuan is ambitious and is very ambitious.

150
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,960
When His Majesty was ascending the throne,

151
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,960
Empress Dowager had given the military power to the chief.

152
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,760
Later, the court was in charge.

153
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,560
The court was in charge of the imperial decree.

154
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,960
These years, he hates our Yan family.

155
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,760
He has the army in his hand.

156
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,760
It's not enough to change the Yangtze Army.

157
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,160
If we take this matter to the heavens,

158
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,760
we can defeat Xue Jia Qi.

159
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,160
His Majesty is weak.

160
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,960
Empress Dowager is dedicated.

161
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,560
I'm afraid it's not that easy.

162
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,360
Father said that this is a matter of the Yan family.

163
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,960
I'm afraid Empress Dowager will be in trouble again.

164
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,760
But they want to push Prince Lingzi into the throne.

165
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,160
They have soldiers in their hands.

166
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,360
I'm afraid that if something happens to His Majesty,

167
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,360
there will be a big mess.

168
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,560
Such a large amount of military and evil weapons

169
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,360
is likely to be sent by a coincidence.

170
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,560
It's impossible to get out of the faraway place.

171
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,760
It's likely to be left from Tongzhou.

172
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,160
Father secretly went to a place in Tongzhou to search for the Long River to sell.

173
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,560
He thought of ways to go to the heaven.

174
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,160
And there was a time when Xue Yuan Xun was forced to catch that official.

175
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,960
He also wanted to send someone to the prison to talk about his news.

176
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Although he has been in the woods,

177
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,960
but he still hasn't met this person yet.

178
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,760
He doesn't know what's going on.

179
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,360
If this continues, I'm afraid that the Yan family will be more passive.

180
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,760
Father, don't worry. I'm here.

181
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,960
If father finds out, he can send a letter back. I'll prepare it in advance.

182
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:10,140
Xiao

183
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:18,160
Tomorrow morning, at night time of

184
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,960
Yan home, ahuscome to Tongzhou.

185
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,560
It's possible

186
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,760
Maybe toIEA?

187
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,720
I'm glad to hear that.

188
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,600
Wait.

189
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,000
You went to the palace to attend the lesson yesterday

190
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,440
to send the message.

191
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,840
The message is already sent.

192
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,760
Why are you still so flustered?

193
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,640
Could it be

194
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,000
for Jiang Er?

195
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,880
I think

196
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,880
Jiang Er is too cunning.

197
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,920
She knows everything.

198
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,040
She even dares to say that to Mr. Jiang.

199
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,080
She must find a chance

200
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,200
to get rid of him.

201
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,840
No.

202
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,760
Why?

203
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:00,800
She is now

204
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,040
holding our arm now.

205
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,160
She might be in trouble

206
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,160
if she doesn't get rid of him.

207
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,960
She has a lot of secret groups.

208
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,280
But she's not bad.

209
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,640
She might not be

210
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,120
able to be with you

211
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
for a long time.

212
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,280
But you said

213
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,360
that she wants to get rid of him.

214
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,360
You don't understand what I said, do you?

215
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,160
I said that she's not a enemy.

216
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,760
Why should she be so bold?

217
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,720
Besides,

218
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,160
I'm the one who is watching.

219
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,200
What can I do?

220
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,040
But you still say that

221
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,880
I'm a bad person.

222
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,880
You go out first.

223
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,160
Leave the outside to us.

224
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,720
Don't worry.

225
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,040
Mr. Oh, Miss.

226
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,880
Missб어 Silvia danke.

227
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,880
What are you doing?

228
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,120
What's going on?

229
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,520
I'm saving you.

230
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,640
the nuptial deer

231
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,440
didn't sleep well?

232
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,240
This should be distinguishable.

233
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:14,840
It's safer to grab a bye

234
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,040
than to get a 했i.

235
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,000
You really plan to go to Fengcheng Hall to learn?

236
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,800
This Young Master Xie has ordered us to go to the lecture.

237
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,000
He has made such a fuss.

238
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,600
He is just a little bit of a wise man.

239
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,800
Shiyi, you don't know what to say.

240
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,200
Young Master Xie is young and intelligent.

241
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,600
He always has some unusual ideas.

242
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,800
But we have been in the Hanling Garden for so many years,

243
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,800
it is also a good thing that we can learn.

244
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,600
Moreover, Miss Xue is also in the middle of the world.

245
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,400
She told the State Palace that something was wrong.

246
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,200
But it is not beautiful.

247
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,400
That is what she said.

248
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,800
Not long ago, the State Palace had two of you

249
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,600
raise the emperor's memorial.

250
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,400
I don't know why she was suppressed.

251
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,800
As for the State Palace, it is not fun anymore.

252
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,200
What trouble do we have at this time?

253
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
You say...

254
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,800
Why don't you teach this book?

255
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,600
That's right.

256
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,600
How can you learn these things?

257
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,600
Old Master Wang,

258
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,600
how long can we learn Young Master Xie?

259
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
You can't learn it.

260
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
You can't learn it.

261
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,600
You can't learn it.

262
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
You can't learn it.

263
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
You can't learn it.

264
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,480
How long can we learn the book that

265
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,400
the단 teacher Yan Fei recently wrote?

266
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,760
Apply My Queen즙,

267
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,100
Saintess turning all of us to takerá

268
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,400
allowing all of our customers to know the truth.

269
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:06,200
Without having these 받고,

270
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,600
I heard there was someone having a look in the obeisance hall

271
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,600
and act as she is captured and decorate it.

272
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,400
Even the girl with a delicateHolaque."

273
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,000
It's impossible to be boring.

274
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,840
You are otroinka,

275
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,360
with a convincing and heavy conscience.

276
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,880
Today Iία changed a course.

277
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,280
And I'll tell you

278
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,320
why I'm women.

279
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,480
Please move aside.

280
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,880
As man and woman,

281
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,400
so the hopes are always inité.

282
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,120
Ghosts on the street inside her chest

283
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,100
keep her Un defenseless.

284
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,380
This is why they make this complete mistake,

285
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,500
which is nothing but ill give or take.

286
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,780
They all try to hide from me.

287
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,760
I'm wronged by God Realm.

288
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,760
Chiled by Xu Weijing So is my mistake.

289
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,800
We're now sick of these actions.

290
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,800
What about the empress?

291
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,800
In their eyes,

292
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,800
she's just a woman.

293
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,800
Sometimes, they use these dirty tricks to make a crime.

294
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,800
Your Highness, you don't need to understand those people in the Imperial Household.

295
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,800
People in the Imperial Household?

296
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,800
But how many people are the real people

297
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,800
who are playing tricks on the whole money?

298
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,800
Since ancient times, the royal court has been in danger.

299
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,800
It's a matter of time.

300
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,800
It's more than a woman's choice to be taken out of the court.

301
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,800
So, as a woman,

302
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,800
you must behave yourself.

303
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,800
Jiang Xuan Ning,

304
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,800
what do you think of the will?

305
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Sir,

306
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,800
disgusting.

307
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
How dare you!

308
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,800
How dare you say such a thing!

309
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,800
It's really strange.

310
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,800
I said I was disgusting.

311
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,800
How could you say I was scolding people?

312
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,800
I was eating my stomach yesterday

313
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,800
and I smelled something that was not good.

314
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
If I continue to smell it,

315
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
I'm afraid I'll get a bad smell.

316
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
I'm afraid I'll get a bad smell.

317
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
I'm sorry, I'll take my leave.

318
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
You...

319
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,800
You're a bad girl.

320
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
You're so cruel.

321
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,800
You're also a good match for me.

322
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,800
I'm not afraid of you.

323
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Your Ning Ning.

324
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,800
Ning Ning?

325
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,800
So, this is the Jiang Er girl in the news.

326
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
We finally meet today.

327
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
Your Majesty, don't joke.

328
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
Miss Jiang Er is not good at playing with me.

329
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
It's fine to be under her.

330
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
If the rumors spread to my father's ears,

331
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
I'll be scolded for being a fool.

332
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Miss Jiang Er is very innocent.

333
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,800
I hope you can forgive me.

334
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
I'm not good at speaking.

335
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
I hope...

336
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,800
Miss Jiang Er is not good at it.

337
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,800
Look at her.

338
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,800
This is our Yan prince.

339
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,800
When you like her, you pretend to be nothing.

340
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
You're good at reading.

341
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,800
You're so affectionate.

342
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
I think you're doing well.

343
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,800
We don't want you as our prince.

344
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
I can consider it.

345
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Xue Yi, don't talk too much.

346
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,800
You look like you've read a few books.

347
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800
You're a good writer.

348
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,800
There are many things that Yan prince doesn't want.

349
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
I'm afraid he can't look at them.

350
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
You don't deserve it.

351
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,800
You...

352
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
Enough.

353
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,800
Miss Jiang is a good reader.

354
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,800
You don't have to talk about it.

355
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,800
Okay, let's go.

356
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,800
Aren't you going to see Mr. Xie?

357
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
Let's go.

358
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,800
Yan Ling.

359
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,800
Stop talking.

360
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,800
I...

361
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
What did I say?

362
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
I didn't say anything.

363
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,800
What's wrong with me?

364
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,800
You fool.

365
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,800
Why are you here?

366
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,800
Sir, my father said I've been in school for half a year.

367
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,800
I have to take the test these days.

368
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,800
If I can't take the test,

369
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,800
I'm afraid I'll be punished.

370
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,800
I'll be a good student.

371
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,800
I'll take the test.

372
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,800
Please take a look.

373
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,800
Why are you laughing?

374
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
I'm laughing today.

375
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,800
I'm getting drunk.

376
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,800
The emperor's homework is good these days.

377
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
It's true.

378
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
In Tongling,

379
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
the school is also the first one.

380
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
It's written in the book of the unauthorized.

381
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,800
I'm sure you won't remember it.

382
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,800
But since you brought it,

383
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,800
why don't you let me take a look at it?

384
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,800
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

385
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,800
Yes.

386
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
I'll take my leave.

387
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,800
Prince Yan.

388
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,800
I've selected some wood for the wedding.

389
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,800
I can't use it.

390
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,800
Can you help me move it?

391
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,800
Thank you, sir.

392
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,800
You two can go back first.

393
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,800
What are you doing?

394
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,800
Miss Ning'er,

395
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,800
you've been learning to love here for days.

396
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,800
You should let go of your love.

397
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Although she's naughty,

398
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,800
she's not smart,

399
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,800
but she's smart.

400
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,800
Yan Shi,

401
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,800
you should let her go.

402
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,800
I'll take care of her.

403
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,800
I'll take care of her.

404
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,800
I'll take care of her.

405
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
I'll take care of her.

406
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
I'll take care of her.

407
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
I'll take care of her.

408
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,800
I'll take care of her.

409
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,800
I'll take care of her.

410
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,800
You're right.

411
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,800
Yan Shi,

412
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,800
you're very considerate.

413
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,800
Thank you, sir.

414
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,800
But it's easy to let go of your love.

415
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,800
By the way,

416
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,800
I heard that your father is sick and needs rest.

417
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,800
It's okay.

418
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,800
My father had several drinks.

419
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,800
He retired on the battlefield.

420
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,800
But it's fine.

421
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,800
Thank you, sir.

422
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
Is there anything new about Lord Yan?

423
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,600
The so-called poet has been told that he's getting a job.

424
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,600
He's also in the process of getting a job.

425
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,800
If you believe me,

426
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,800
there will be nothing else that can be done to me.

427
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,800
Thank you, sir.

428
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,200
The other things that Yan Ling can solve.

429
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,800
It's just that...

430
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,800
he's the only one in the palace who has nothing to rely on.

431
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,800
His mood is very straightforward.

432
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800
It's hard to say wrong things and offend people.

433
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,800
If you're convenient,

434
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,800
please take care of Yi'er for me.

435
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,800
Take care.

436
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
Okay.

437
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,800
Try it.

438
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,800
Ning Ning, you're finally back.

439
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,800
You were scared by that old man just now, right?

440
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,800
Thank you for your concern.

441
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,800
But I don't want to attend his class.

442
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,800
I was just out to hide for a while. I'm so happy.

443
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,800
Don't say that.

444
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,800
I've heard that he's a vicious man.

445
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,800
His Highness also thinks that he's not allowed to do that.

446
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,800
I've only heard that he's going to learn the truth from his daughter.

447
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,800
I've never been worried about that.

448
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
Today, he's really a big-headed man.

449
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
How can he treat his daughter as a person?

450
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,800
What's so great about it is that

451
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,800
he can't get anything from the table.

452
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,800
He can also get the merit and the school.

453
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,800
But luckily, Mr. Xie is a guest of the Qin and Wen class.

454
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,800
He'll be able to attend his class later.

455
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,800
He's more painful than the old man of the previous generation.

456
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,800
Greetings, Mr. Xie.

457
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
Don't be polite.

458
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,800
Feng Chen's school is not that bad.

459
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Who let him go?

460
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
Mr. Hui,

461
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,800
Mr. Wang said that students and other non-discipline people

462
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,800
were trying to change the truth.

463
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,800
He told me that women should be treated with mercy.

464
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
Throw them all away.

465
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,800
Mr. Wang, please.

466
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,800
There are so many women in the world.

467
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,800
It's not like you're here to study.

468
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,800
If you still want to learn the truth,

469
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
just stand up.

470
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
I'm not jealous.

471
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,800
Class is over.

472
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,800
I'm sorry.

473
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,800
I'm sorry.

474
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
I'm sorry.

475
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,800
I'm sorry.

476
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,800
I'm sorry.

477
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,800
I'm sorry.

478
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,800
I'm sorry.

479
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,800
I'm sorry.

480
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,800
I'm sorry.

481
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,800
This class is over.

482
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,800
Please take your leave.

483
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
Miss Ning,

484
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,800
please stay here.

485
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
Did you understand my class today?

486
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
I'm afraid that I'm going to be in trouble.

487
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Mr. Xie is concerned.

488
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,960
I understand.

489
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,960
I'll save him.

490
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,040
If there's nothing else,

491
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,520
I'll ask Zhao Ge.

492
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,120
No need.

493
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,480
I'm not willing to play with you.

494
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,000
It's a waste of time to go to class.

495
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,680
You misunderstood.

496
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,040
Your love is standing in my place.

497
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,520
I just want you to get it.

498
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,040
Thank you, sir.

499
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:18,880
Goodbye.

500
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,200
Do you really think

501
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,520
I just want you to get it?

502
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,560
What else?

503
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,960
The medicine.

504
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,440
Forget about the net.

505
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,640
You're injured.

506
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,920
You should take the medicine.

507
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,000
Wait.

508
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,040
Get in first.

509
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,120
And then wash your hands.

510
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,440
anda.

511
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,000
Open your hands.

512
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,720
Is he crazy?

513
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,540
I dare not.

514
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,320
Yesterday is here

515
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,620
because I got hurt by Patrick May at the maritime's!!!!!

516
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,900
I don't want to be angry at you

517
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,920
and curse at you,

518
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,920
anything I did last night.

519
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,960
I know

520
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,800
you can make the fuck out of me

521
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,020
because you have been so nervous

522
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,080
for a while,

523
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,040
shouldn't I say another word to that guy?

524
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:51,140
It's his worth.

525
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,240
Are you making a mistake?

526
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,240
I'm doing it because I know Yu Ruyi.

527
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,080
I'm here because of Yanjia.

528
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,760
It's hard to be in a good mood.

529
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,560
I'm angry with you.

530
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,120
I asked you to come here today

531
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,440
to tell you

532
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,720
that I'll deal with Yu Ruyi.

533
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,960
And

534
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,360
Yanling's plan to let you enter the palace

535
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,040
is to let you learn some real talents.

536
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,600
You're a good person.

537
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,240
If you don't, it's a pity.

538
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,720
Pu Yu?

539
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,240
Where did you find out that I'm Pu Yu?

540
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,120
On the way to the capital,

541
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,640
a smart girl

542
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,520
was afraid of being robbed and being robbed.

543
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,320
She was afraid of running away.

544
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,680
She was in danger.

545
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,640
It's hard to get rid of her.

546
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,400
She broke the cord and cut the snow.

547
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,600
She used this gun to kill her.

548
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,520
She used all her strength

549
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,880
to save my life.

550
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,160
Jiang Xuanning,

551
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,520
I've seen you before.

552
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,800
I was looking forward to it.

553
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,960
So I was disappointed.

554
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,640
Disappointed?

555
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,400
I went to Jiangfu's mansion

556
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,240
after I went to the capital.

557
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,280
I found you in a tight suit.

558
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,240
You were not in a hurry.

559
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,520
So I scolded you

560
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,480
and your age.

561
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,720
I'm sorry, miss. I was wrong.

562
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,240
It's not good to do this.

563
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,120
Cry. Cry. Cry.

564
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,960
If you cry again,

565
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,360
I'll sell you out.

566
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,240
I'll sell you out.

567
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,840
Your eyes are very strange.

568
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,640
I even suspect

569
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,800
whether the incident

570
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,000
that happened on the way to the capital was true.

571
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,360
Later,

572
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,600
I heard that you were more and more ignorant.

573
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,440
You were so noisy.

574
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,040
I think

575
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,960
the prosperity in the capital

576
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,720
is always harmful.

577
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,080
I slowly

578
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,280
stole that

579
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,000
old silver and star

580
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,680
from it.

581
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,720
So

582
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,640
you're a spy?

583
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,360
I'm not a spy.

584
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,640
It's a pity.

585
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,040
Sometimes, people are hard to get into.

586
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,800
But if at this time,

587
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,480
someone can tell you to be good or bad,

588
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,200
I might not be able to return to the right path

589
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,240
and start over.

590
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,760
It's a pity that you changed.

591
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
It's a pity that

592
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,480
no one can teach you well.

593
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,240
But now,

594
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,800
you're not good or bad.

595
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,200
You're kind and kind.

596
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:26,960
Although

597
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,960
you're still a little bit naughty,

598
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,080
you're a little better than the previous years.

599
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,040
You're

600
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,120
not as good as Puyu, right?

601
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,080
So

602
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,880
do you still want to

603
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,600
come to my place to learn love tomorrow?

604
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,640
Hahahaha

605
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,160
Mom

606
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,960
Ning'er

607
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,840
I'm anime.

608
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,480
You actually played pretty well.

609
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,920
I quietly followed mom toEEEE sure.

610
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:19,820
It couldn't be any of those who sold Jiang's Father's ultimate sword

611
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,220
because Xun Ping's weapon and sword were endless.

612
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,140
were ever shrimp's wonders.

613
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,180
It was akomor,

614
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,400
It could hold a sword,

615
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,260
Given the power of Worshipping,

616
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,980
it certainly was one of Sister's favorite lightト (*ieu of wage and not gems as a fancy item.)

617
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:29,580
Otherwise,

618
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,220
The words of her father

619
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:31,960
Shen Lianzi said

620
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,080
it seemed truly

621
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:33,920
If her soul was do or not

622
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,780
she would always misunderstood in challenge.

623
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:36,420
She just said

624
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,600
she finished so fast on her own this year.

625
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,780
What is the matter with this?

626
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:41,740
Yum?

627
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:42,820
I told Cham get lucky

628
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,220
since her soul is on fire.

629
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,320
She's satisfying this no.

630
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,360
But she is a real fils.

631
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,480
But now, it's a bad time.

632
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,880
I asked him, but he didn't tell me.

633
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,480
So I can only ask you.

634
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,080
There are many things in this world that are hard to tell.

635
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,480
If you are willing to do it,

636
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,880
I would like to ask you to bring a sentence to Yanling.

637
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,680
You only tell him,

638
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,480
the wind blows through the grass,

639
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,680
the moon rises and sets.

640
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,880
If there are some things that can be kept,

641
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,080
there will be a chance.

642
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,480
What a great gift.

643
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,480
Mr. Wang.

644
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,480
Miss Xue.

645
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,480
I've seen Miss Xue.

646
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,480
Mr. Wang is tired.

647
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,480
In the middle of the reading,

648
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,480
everyone has their own strengths.

649
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,480
But it's hard to choose one.

650
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,480
When my uncle sees my father,

651
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,480
he will definitely be a good teacher.

652
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,480
Thank you, Miss Xue.

653
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,480
I'm not very good at reading.

654
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,480
But there is one thing that you may not know.

655
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,480
Today, on the class,

656
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,480
Mr. Xie lost his book of truth outside the store.

657
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,480
This...

658
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,480
How did he...

659
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,480
Yes.

660
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,480
Mr. Xie is very kind and kind.

661
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,480
He always treats people warmly.

662
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,480
Why is he so long-time today?

663
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,480
He only has one possibility.

664
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,480
Someone hates Mr. Wang.

665
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,480
But he has a strong personality.

666
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,480
You mean...

667
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,480
Jiang Xue Ning?

668
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,480
I just thought about it.

669
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,480
However, some people who don't follow the rules

670
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,480
may not be suitable for reading in the palace.

671
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,480
If we have to stay,

672
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,480
not only will our father get hurt,

673
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,480
but also we can't be at ease.

674
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,480
Am I right?

675
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,480
He's gone.

676
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,480
How could he be like this?

677
00:30:48,480 --> 00:31:00,260
All the military and military

678
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,480
and military officials in the camp are in charge of the management of Zhao Guang.

679
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,480
Where is he?

680
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,480
He just disappeared.

681
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,480
He went to find him.

682
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,480
General, we have found out the entire camp.

683
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,480
We found out that Zhao Guang is missing.

684
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,480
General,

685
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,480
you are feeling better today?

686
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,480
You are a good person.

687
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,480
If you don't control yourself,

688
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,480
it's a pity.

689
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,480
I was too rude yesterday.

690
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,480
Please forgive me.

691
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,480
You are so self-aware.

692
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,480
If that's the case,

693
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,480
you can take me to the camp.

694
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,480
I will.

695
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,480
I will.

696
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,480
If that's the case,

697
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,480
you can send me the truth

698
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,480
that I told you yesterday.

699
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,480
I will send it to you.

700
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,480
Why are you still asking about the truth?

701
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,480
You lost your book.

702
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,480
And you didn't tell me about the truth yesterday.

703
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,480
It's a pity that others can't tell me.

704
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,480
But this Miss Jiang

705
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,480
is so talented and educated.

706
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,480
Even I don't want to listen to her.

707
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,480
I think you are already

708
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,480
as good as a good person.

709
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,480
Mr. Hui,

710
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,480
I can't be sent back.

711
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,480
You are the guest of Master Zhao.

712
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,480
You said you don't know how to read and write.

713
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,480
Then you are my guest.

714
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,480
You don't want to listen to me?

715
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,480
You are a good person for three days.

716
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,480
I thought you are a talented person.

717
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,480
You are a little arrogant.

718
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,480
But I didn't expect

719
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,480
you can't even memorize such a small piece of paper.

720
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:47,480
You are a talented person.

721
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,480
Mr. Hui, you are too much.

722
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,480
You think he is not...

723
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,480
Your Highness,

724
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,480
you are supposed to study with your teacher

725
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,480
to learn how to read and write.

726
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,480
When I taught the late emperor to read,

727
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,480
I was so proud of him.

728
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,480
I never did anything wrong.

729
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:13,480
Do you even have to do anything wrong

730
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,480
to the late emperor?

731
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,480
You...

732
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,480
Your Highness,

733
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,480
stop arguing with me.

734
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,480
I am willing to be punished.

735
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,480
Good.

736
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,480
Then today,

737
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,480
I will help the parents of Hanlin Academy.

738
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,480
I will teach you a lesson.

739
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,480
If you do anything wrong,

740
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,480
you will be punished.

741
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,480
Wang Jiu is a bad person.

742
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,480
He is a bad person.

743
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,480
I will...

744
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,480
Your Highness, be gentle.

745
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,480
I have been a little bit arrogant.

746
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,480
I can't count the small things.

747
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,480
You are a good person.

748
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,480
You are my person.

749
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,480
No.

750
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,480
I will go to mother now.

751
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,480
I will kick Wang Jiu out of the palace.

752
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,480
Sister Jiang,

753
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,480
does His Highness really let Wang Fuzi leave?

754
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,480
Wang Jiu was a former monk.

755
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,480
He is old and old.

756
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,480
It is not easy to be a good person.

757
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,480
But my father said

758
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,480
he never taught me any lessons.

759
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,480
It is because of the rebellion of the Pingnan King.

760
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,480
He killed many Hanlin.

761
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,480
That is why he has the power.

762
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,480
Now I know it is useless.

763
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,480
Old man Wang asked me to be a cook.

764
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,480
He said I need to check it in the afternoon.

765
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,480
I can't do anything serious.

766
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,480
I should think about how to deal with it.

767
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,480
If you don't mind, you should go to the temple.

768
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,480
My god.

769
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,480
What's wrong?

770
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,480
Tell me.

771
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,480
This is a small person.

772
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,480
I said

773
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,480
you offended the person.

774
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,480
That's why you were treated like a father.

775
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,480
Ning'er.

776
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,480
I am sorry.

777
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,480
I am sorry.

778
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,480
I am sorry.

779
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,480
I am sorry.

780
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,480
Ning'er.

781
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,480
It should be him.

782
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,480
What a coincidence.

783
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,480
Since you like the color of your clothes the most,

784
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,480
I am old to see you two young.

785
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,480
Your highness.

786
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,480
This is the tea of the Shi Lake.

787
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,480
It is good for your health.

788
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,480
It is the most suitable for winter.

789
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,480
Thank you.

790
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,480
I will eat it.

791
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,480
All right.

792
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,480
Thank you.

793
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,480
Ning'er.

794
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,480
You went to school in the past.

795
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,480
You don't seem like you can do that.

796
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,480
Mother.

797
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,480
I thought

798
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,480
if there is nothing to talk about,

799
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,480
you can't talk about it.

800
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,480
I don't need to.

801
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,480
I have an appointment with Yanlin.

802
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,480
I can't sit here any more.

803
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,480
Have a seat.

804
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,480
Mother.

805
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,480
Mother.

806
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,480
I am so confused.

807
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,480
What's the matter?

808
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,240
I...

809
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,360
I'm here to see Brother Wang.

810
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,600
Uncle is here too.

811
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,880
Brother Wang,

812
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,480
this is your fault.

813
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,080
Uncle hasn't been married yet.

814
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,160
You two are not suitable for each other.

815
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,800
You grew up together.

816
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,920
You're a family.

817
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,520
What's wrong with that?

818
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,880
Mother,

819
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,840
Master Wang said

820
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,240
that the marriage is a marriage between a man and a woman.

821
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,920
This is the etiquette from ancient times.

822
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,520
Master Wang also said

823
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,160
that men and women must not be married when they are seven.

824
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,960
And women in the harem must not be married when they are young.

825
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,520
What's the point of

826
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,800
teaching such an old thing to a woman?

827
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,280
Where's the man?

828
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:16,880
Aunt,

829
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,640
Master Wang is a good person.

830
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,600
He mentioned the matter of the Emperor a few days ago.

831
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,160
What Emperor?

832
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,000
Mother,

833
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,720
I'll go to the imperial physician first.

834
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,080
I won't disturb you.

835
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,040
Let's go.

836
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,720
Let's go.

837
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,360
What's wrong?

838
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,480
Greetings, sir.

839
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,520
What's the matter?

840
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,320
You don't want to learn love, right?

841
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,040
I'm not good at it.

842
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,600
I'm here to apologize to you.

843
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,600
Please don't make me

844
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,560
trouble you.

845
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,600
What do you mean?

846
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,240
So it's not you.

847
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,760
What's going on?

848
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,720
Tell me more.

849
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,160
Second Brother,

850
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,960
you should thank me.

851
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,160
If I'm not smart,

852
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,640
you'll be a good man.

853
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,360
What's the fuss?

854
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,000
I think you're on the wrong path.

855
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,080
No.

856
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,320
It's your fault.

857
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,240
I promised you to get rid of Wangjiu

858
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,960
but he must think I'mkey in making trouble.

859
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,800
Wangjiu

860
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,840
他早已破了外 M Tutor He got back

861
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,040
the un exercise device afterOSSing half-doctor

862
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,360
and she risked for revenge again.

863
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,540
Zhaoyin Hong

864
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,360
did a job server

865
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:24,880
and ill-treated Grace of Seven Pease.

866
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,480
Zhao Yan?

867
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,840
Zhao Yan?

868
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,040
He's right.

869
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,560
But he owns an old place.

870
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,560
Such people

871
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,800
can't keep them alive.

872
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,000
But I've been looking at them these days.

873
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,520
I think Wang Jiu

874
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,640
is in great danger.

875
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,840
You mean

876
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,680
this is not the meaning of the Xue family?

877
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,640
You even found out about them.

878
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,120
What do you mean by that?

879
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,760
A month ago,

880
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,840
Wang Jiu and Zhao Yehong

881
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,040
started a memorial for Duke Ding.

882
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,920
It was a matter of the imperial family.

883
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,360
Fortunately, the Xue family

884
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,560
was话 it wants to suffer due to addressing him

885
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,720
because it's officially هذه.

886
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,240
The Xue family preparing troops

887
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,840
surrounding the Ministry

888
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,640
and including Yan a LEDs

889
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,480
of Jingku.

890
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,000
His Majesty was Ast According to cases

891
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,000
to attend us the Zheng danger

892
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,360
.

893
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,960
With the Xue family's Yan family

894
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,320
making detain Matte film for Yan Zhouding.

895
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,400
Correct.

896
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,400
But the dishes in Yan family are too条.

897
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,720
Now the money

898
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,720
It's hard to predict the future of the country.

899
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,720
The Xue family wants to move the Yan family.

900
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,720
The people are not to be moved.

901
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,720
That's why they have to make up for it.

902
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,720
That's it.

903
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,720
No wonder they let Zhou Yingzhi enter the Marquis's Manor

904
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,720
to steal the Marquis's notes.

905
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,720
They want to make up for the letter from the Nidang.

906
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,720
But now the emperor has handed over the case to the Nidang.

907
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,720
The emperor used the Fourth of the Cao Yun case to trap Xueyue.

908
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,720
It's not bad.

909
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,720
But I can't figure it out.

910
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,720
I'm just a mere half-dead.

911
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,720
I have no place to be.

912
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,720
The Xue family is willing to fight against me.

913
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,720
You're just making up for it.

914
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,720
Don't be so rude.

915
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,720
I'm going to die in my mouth sooner or later.

916
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,720
Although the material is not good,

917
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,720
but...

918
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,720
Didn't you say Wang Jiu wanted you to be a teacher?

919
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,720
I have a plan.

920
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,720
You can write it to him.

921
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,720
We'll see what he says.

922
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,720
Ye Yue is as bright as the jade.

923
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,720
The sky and mountains are not changing.

924
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,720
The clouds come and go, the clouds stop and the wind goes away.

925
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,720
It's so good.

926
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,720
Can you believe it?

927
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,720
It's okay.

928
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,720
You just need to say that you did it yourself.

929
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,720
Sir, do you want to help me?

930
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,720
I'm so proud of you.

931
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,720
I'm in charge of the Crown Prince's master.

932
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,720
I'm going to get all the evidence from the Xue family.

933
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,720
Your act is just a mere act.

934
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,720
It's you.

935
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,720
You were always making up for the attack.

936
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,720
Why didn't you take the opportunity to attack?

937
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,720
I don't like the palace.

938
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,720
But this is the highest place to stand.

939
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,720
Only if you study hard, you'll be better.

940
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,720
That's why you can help the Yan family and the Yanling.

941
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,720
The student is leaving sooner or later.

942
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,720
But I hope he won't leave without regret.

943
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,720
If you want to change your fate, you can't waste your time.

944
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,720
Change your fate?

945
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,720
I'll just make a move now.

946
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,720
Wait.

947
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,720
Actually, the injury is not serious.

948
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,720
It's just that the coat of clothing hurts.

949
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,720
So it's a bit thick.

950
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,720
The imperial decree is in the palace.

951
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,720
The imperial decree sent by the Inner Council is all from the border.

952
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,720
And I'm using the imperial decree from the Chengxing Hall.

953
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,720
You can memorize it and go back to Moxian.

954
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,720
So that people can see you.

955
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,720
You're really a criminal. You never let go of such details.

956
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,720
Did you hear me?

957
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,720
You're right. I'll memorize it now.

958
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,720
I'll go back to Moxian.

959
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,720
