Hundreds of Xingwu Guards were sent out

39

but failed to find it.

How did you get it?

reasoned with him,

43
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,870
and told him His Majesty's good intentions.

44
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,250
He came around and gave it to me.

45

Mr. Xie, with all due respect,

46
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,620
I don't buy it.

47
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,290
If Marquis Yan had the official seal with him,

48
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,090
why didn't Xingwu Guards find it

The official seal of Yan's troops is important.

51
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,890
Marquis Yan hid it in a secret compartment in his mansion.

52
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,220
Xingwu Guards didn't know that

53
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,620
so they couldn't find it.

After Marquis Yan

55
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,000
knew that His Majesty meant well,

56
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,390
he told me where the official seal was.

we've got the official seal

and both Tongzhou and Jinling

are in the clear.

62
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,820
The Yan family's action

63
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,060
has proved their loyalty.

64
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,900
It's inappropriate to keep a marquis in prison

00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,250
But the sentence for disobeying an imperial edict

69
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,450
can be light or heavy.

As to how to punish the Yan family,

71
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:27,450
we need

72
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,420
your instructions.

77
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,810
have been thinking about this.

At the ceremony,

Yan Lin disobeyed the imperial edict.

81
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,730
There was no rebellion in Tongzhou,

82
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,160
but

83
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,200
if he received no punishment,

84
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,460
he'd set a bad example for your subjects.

85
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,460
In the future,

86
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,579
everyone would think they could defy you.

87
00:03:57,579 --> 00:03:59,370
Mr. Xie, you just said

88
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,500
Yan Mu

89
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,500
willingly gave the official seal to His Majesty.

90
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,200
I

91
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,740
thought Mr. Xie

92
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,250
trusted the Yan family.

93
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,620
I do trust them,

94
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:09,570
but

95
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,420
I still have worries.

96
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,930
The half a letter Duke Xue

97
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,820
presented to His Majesty

98
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,070
was indeed in Yan Mu's handwriting.

99
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,079
We haven't found the other half yet,

100
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:20,680
but as they say,

101
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,600
one can't be too careful.

102
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,460
If the Yan family's loyalty had wavered,

103
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,120
reinstating Yan Mu and Yan Lin

104
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,150
would bring disaster to the court.

105
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,570
You have a point.

106
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,630
Mr. Gu.

107
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,010
According to the law,

108
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,450
what's the sentence for disobeying an imperial edict?

109
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,250
Your Majesty.

110
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,700
In most past cases,

111
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,159
the offenders were sentenced to death.

112
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:46,720
However,

113
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,050
some were given lighter sentences.

114
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:49,900
Your Majesty.

115

Noble Consort Qin is pregnant now.

116
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,080
It's a blessing for the country.

117
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,060
Since you want a general amnesty,

118
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,490
how about

119
00:04:59,180 --> 00:04:59,900
reducing

120
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,360
the Yan family's sentence?

121
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,050
Spare innocent family members

122
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,990
and just exile Yan Mu and Yan Lin

123
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,440
to Huangzhou.

124
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,200
Huangzhou?

125
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:08,810
Yes.

126
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,030
Huangzhou is a remote place

127
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,340
in the northwest,

128
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,960
far away from Tongzhou.

129
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,300
This way,

130
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,540
even if the rebels of Lord Pingnan are up to something,

131
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,470
the Yan family can't get involved.

132
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,740
You've thought of everything, Official Xie.

133
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,870
Let's do it your way.

134
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,300
Mr. Gu.

135
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,190
Are you clear?

136
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:28,780
Yes,

137
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,460
Your Majesty.

138
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,260
Just now, in front of His Majesty,

139
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,690
what Junior Preceptor Xie said didn't make any sense.

140
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,890
Don't you think there's something off?

141
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,690
Since you do too,

142
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,550
I'll go back and tell His Majesty.

143
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,960
You

144
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,510
are so tactless.

145
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,940
Junior Preceptor Xie got the official seal back today

146
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,550
and His Majesty was very much pleased.

147
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,280
Even if you voice your concern,

148
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,030
His Majesty

149
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,790
is not likely to believe you.

150
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,930
The task that was supposed to be assigned to Duke Xue

151
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,070
was assigned to Xie Wei by His Majesty.

152
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,400
Duke Xue turned the Yan Mansion upside down

153
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,970
but still couldn't find the official seal,

154
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,100
but Xie Wei found it.

155
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,120
No matter how he made it,

156
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,460
it shows that His Majesty

157
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,020
is already on guard against the Xue family.

158
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,500
And the man who's pulling the strings

159
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,590
is Xie Wei.

160
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,060
The Yan family did nothing wrong

161
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,409
but he exiled them to Huangzhou,

162
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:43,400
a remote place.

163
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,570
Xie Wei

164
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,659
is up to no good.

165
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,900
Are you really going to let him

166
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,430
stay by His Majesty's side?

167
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,260
We must

168
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,190
be patient.

169
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,190
We need to find evidence against him

170
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,980
to convince His Majesty.

171
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:11,900
Move, move.

172
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,580
Put it there.

173
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,350
Give it to me.

174
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,000
Hurry up.

175
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,420
Put it here.

176
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,060
His Majesty ordered

177
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,420
a thorough investigation after Noble Consort Qin fell

178
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,080
and almost had a miscarriage.

179
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,050
Yao Xi is the daughter of a minister,

180
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,310
so she wasn't punished

181
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,100
and only has to leave the court.

182
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,500
Miss Jiang, everyone who had issues with you

183
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,030
was kicked out of the court.

184
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,800
First, it was You Yue.

185
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,540
Now it's Yao Xi.

186
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:48,380
It seems that fate is always on your side, Miss Jiang.

187
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,300
No wonder everyone says you're lucky, Miss Xue.

188
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,800
Every time you carried out your scheme,

189
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,260
someone else bore the consequence for you.

190
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,130
Congratulations.

191
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,590
You got away with it again.

192
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,909
Even if you know I did it,

193
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:00,950
what can you do?

194
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,660
Do you have evidence?

195
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:04,830
You…

196
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,600
Put them down.

197
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,850
What are you doing?

198
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,450
I'm the daughter of a first-rank official.

199
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,180
How dare you treat me like this?

200
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,300
Miss Yao.

201
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,900
There are rules in the court.

202
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,770
I have to check all your belongings.

203
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:17,770
If you sneak out

204
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,570
something that belongs to the royal family,

205
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:20,900
I'll be punished.

206
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,220
His Majesty only asked Miss Yao to leave the court

207
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,940
and didn't give her any punishment.

208
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,770
I'll ask Her Highness tomorrow

209
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,830
to see if there is really such a rule.

210
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:32,690
Let's go.

211
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,809
Like you care.

212
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,590
Are you happy now?

213
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,140
I've been ordered to leave the court

214
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,140
and can't compete with you over Zhang Zhe anymore.

215
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,780
I thought you'd learned your lesson in this matter.

216
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,920
Don't say anything

217
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,190
so ridiculous again.

218
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,650
Don't be so cocky.

219
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,540
After the Yan family gets punished

220
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,740
and Yan Lin gets beheaded,

221
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,710
you will…

222
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,310
Instead of being angry with me,

223
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,540
you should think about

224
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,090
why you ended up like this.

225
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,860
There is a reason for everything.

226
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,520
It's the same for this matter.

227
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,020
When everyone was picking flowers,

228
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,480
why were you staying with Noble Consort Qin?

229
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,730
You're stubborn and obsessed

230
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,350
but aren't clever enough to see what's going on.

231
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,970
All you do is act out.

232
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,160
Take my advice.

233
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,630
Find out

234
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,600
who your enemy is first.

235
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,340
Shu.

236
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:44,550
Shu.

237
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,050
Shu.

238
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,780
I'm busy today.

239
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,860
I can't be there when you leave.

240
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,560
Take care.

241
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,860
I didn't push Noble Consort Qin.

242
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,550
Why did you make me take all the blame?

243
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,050
Why did you

244
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,330
set me up?

245
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,400
Xi, what are you talking about?

246
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,510
Stop pretending.

247
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,150
We grew up together.

248
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,910
Don't you see me as your friend?

249
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:10,830
Xi.

250
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,140
That day,

251
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,140
you dropped Jiang Xuening's sachet in the Imperial Garden.

252
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,200
Why did you do that?

253
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,650
You wanted to use me

254
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,530
against her too, didn't you?

255
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,060
So I guess,

256
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,710
we're even.

257
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,580
So you know everything.

258
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,100
Why didn't you tell me?

259
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,460
This is what you can never learn.

260
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,770
You know many things others don't,

261
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,190
but you don't know what to reveal

262
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,630
and what to keep secret.

263
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,810
You wanted to cozy up to Noble Consort Qin

264
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,670
and use her against Jiang Xuening

265
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,820
but didn't know

266
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,180
that you'd crossed a line.

267
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,390
I don't mind my ambition being known,

268
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,910
nor do I mind what I did being revealed.

269
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,210
But you're in no place

270
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,870
to gossip about the Xue family

271
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,270
and the empress dowager.

272
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,230
You've been let off easy this time

273
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,030
and just need to leave the court.

274
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,540
You should be grateful.

275
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,170
What if Noble Consort Qin really had a miscarriage?

276
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,290
I would die!

277
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:19,410
See?

278
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,210
You've crossed a line again.

279
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,780
His Majesty has been expecting an heir for a long time.

280
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,660
How dare you say something like that?

281
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,920
Someone as thick as you

282
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,180
should shut up

283
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,030
and stay quiet.

284
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,220
Don't cause trouble

285
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,060
for Minister Yao.

286
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,730
You want to leave the court?

287
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,320
Why?

288
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,130
Has someone picked on you again?

289
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,550
It's not like I won't come back.

290
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,260
There's something I need to do outside.

291
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,870
Yan Lin has been imprisoned for many days.

292
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,800
I don't know the current situation

293
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,740
and want to make some inquiries.

294
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,310
Okay.

295
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:01,230
Brother Lang is in a good mood these days.

296
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,290
I'll go ask him

297
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,870
to let you girls leave the court for a break.

298
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,130
Speaking of that,

299
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,050
I heard that Lord Linzi

300
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,200
was punished for pleading for Yan Lin.

301
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,100
How is he now?

302
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,530
Do you remember Mr. Zhang Zhe?

303
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,810
A few days ago, he gave Jie an idea.

304
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,150
They invited Duke Xue into the court.

305
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,830
The three of them went to Brother Lang

306
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:24,490
to sort out the details of the Yan family's case.

307
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,430
As you know,

308
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,580
my uncle is a military official.

309
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,540
He couldn't out-argue Mr. Zhang.

310
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,470
I heard that he was so angry that he stayed in bed all day after going home.

311
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,070
He didn't even eat anything.

312
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,920
Duke Xue

313
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,780
must hate Mr. Zhang's guts now.

314
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,790
He sure does.

315
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,790
Mr. Zhang impressed me.

316
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,180
Although he's cold,

317
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,530
he's good-looking

318
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,500
and capable.

319
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,300
Now that he's broken off his engagement,

320
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,560
I wonder who will marry him in the future.

321
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,540
Now that you two have come back unscathed,

322
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,620
I can be relieved.

323
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,030
Fortunately,

324
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,030
you're smart and cautious.

325
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,710
Otherwise, who'd know

326
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,750
what would've happened to the royal heir?

327
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,930
Our family

328
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,370
has been given a commendation

329
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,060
written by His Majesty.

330
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,020
These days,

331
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,280
the house is so lively.

332
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,430
Many people

333
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,740
have come to propose marriage.

334
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,260
What's wrong?

335
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,010
Mother.

336
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,680
I don't want

337
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,070
to get married yet.

338
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,160
That's nonsense.

339
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,860
You're a girl.

340
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,500
You should get married after coming of age.

341
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,990
It's okay. Don't worry.

342
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,800
I have no intention

343
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,160
to force you to marry up.

344
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,190
What matters most is that you can be well treated.

345
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,270
So you must marry a man of honor.

346
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,090
He doesn't have to be exalted.

347
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,540
If you can often come back to visit me and your father after getting married,

348
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,850
I'll be very happy.

349
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:48,690
I think

350
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,260
Madam seems to have changed.

351
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:52,690
In the past, she always hoped

352
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,970
her two daughters could marry up.

353
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,150
Now she thinks

354
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,890
the grooms don't have to hold high positions

355
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,900
as long as they're of good character.

356
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,030
In the past few days,

357
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,790
so many things have happened.

358
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,040
Madam must have been scared.

359
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,050
Anyway, it's good to be safe.

360
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,420
Miss,

361
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,730
First Young Lady brought honor to this family this time.

362
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:11,730
It's a good thing.

363
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:12,970
But her servants

364
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,470
all have their noses

365
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,880
in the air like this now.

366
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,280
Why are you even pettier than me?

367
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,920
Jiang Xuehui doing great

368
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,260
won't do me any harm.

369
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,130
Miss, you're educated and different now.

370
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,660
You've become more mature.

371
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,170
I indeed have.

372
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,020
I can't fight with her at home

373
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,550
over such trivial matters.

374
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,240
Besides,

375
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,460
trying to outshine everyone

376
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,580
will only land me in trouble.

377
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,140
Second Young Lady.

378
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:44,520
[Chang Zhuo, the Jiang family's servant]

379
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:41,950
Second Young Lady.

380
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,570
Someone outside asked to see you.

381
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,080
He said

382
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,450
his name is Zhang Zhe.

383
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,020
Mr. Zhang,

384
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,650
what brought you to me today?

385
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,690
I'm sorry

386
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,150
to have come uninvited.

387
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,730
I wanted to ask you in the court,

388
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56,670
but after I went to find you,

389
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,730
I was told you'd gone home for a break.

390
00:14:59,090 --> 00:14:59,750
It's fine.

391
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,980
I owe you big time, Mr. Zhang.

392
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,220
If you have any questions,

393
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,420
just go ahead and ask.

394
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,140
That day in the Yan Mansion,

395
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,020
I noticed

396
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,460
that you and Junior Preceptor Xie were very close.

397
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,260
To be honest,

398
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,170
recently,

399
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,980
I've gone to the Ministry of Personnel and checked

400
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,850
Junior Preceptor Xie's personnel records.

401
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,210
I found that four years ago,

402
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,740
he came to the capital from the south with you.

403
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,640
So I want to ask you face-to-face

404
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,180
if you really know what kind of person he is.

405
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,030
He's my father's friend.

406
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,040
That's why we traveled together.

407
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,340
Mr. Zhang,

408
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,960
why are you asking about him?

409
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,980
His Majesty has announced that Marquis Yan and his son

410
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,220
will be exiled to Huangzhou.

411
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:33,940
It's

412
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,830
Junior Preceptor Xie's idea.

413
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:36,820
Exile?

414
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,970
How's that possible?

415
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,250
Things have changed in this life.

416
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,520
Why have they ended up being exiled again?

417
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,180
Miss Jiang.

418
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,820
Junior Preceptor Xie is sophisticated.

419
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,630
In my opinion,

420
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,820
you should keep a distance from him.

421
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:49,860
Mr. Zhang.

422
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,660
You may not know this.

423
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,250
Junior Preceptor Xie…

424
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,990
He's indeed hard to read,

425
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,000
but after spending time with him,

426
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,220
I don't think he's that bad.

427
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,150
A tiger is a tiger

428
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:06,030
because its brutal nature can't be changed.

429
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,150
Miss Jiang.

430
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,020
If you befriend a tiger,

431
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,420
you'll inevitably be bitten by it one day.

432
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,420
Do you understand

433
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,450
what I mean?

434
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,820
Leave it there.

435
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,430
It's going to snow tonight.

436
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,360
Are you sure you're to take action today?

437
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,720
Dragging it out only means more trouble.

438
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,180
I just want

439
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,710
to get it over with.

440
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,010
What have Xingwu Guards been doing?

441
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,700
Xue Yuan conducted a thorough search but didn't find anything.

442
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,970
Then he was informed that the Yan family

443
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,170
would only be exiled.

444
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,480
He wouldn't back down.

445
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,810
But as you arranged, many officials

446
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,290
have impeached Xue Yuan in the court

447
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,430
for abuse of power.

448
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,080
So now,

449
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,780
he's too busy saving his own ass

450
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,750
to mess with the Yan family.

451
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:07,970
Good.

452
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,220
I'm not feeling very well these days

453
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,280
and some plans may have been delayed.

454
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,849
Sorry for burdening you.

455
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:18,060
I just hope that before the Spring Festival,

456
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,660
nothing will go wrong again.

457
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,230
If you don't get proper treatment in time,

458
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,470
you'll collapse sooner or later.

459
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:28,640
[Xie Mansion]

460
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,360
Your source in Shuzhong sent back a message.

461
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,340
What did he say?

462
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,650
Ren Weizhi has run away with my money, hasn't he?

463
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:42,520
It's good news.

464
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,990
His bamboo salt well

465
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,670
has turned out to be a success.

466
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,330
The salt production has increased by several times.

467
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,460
He's made a fortune.

468
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:51,620
Many merchants are scrambling to buy into his business.

469
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,740
First, it was the raw silk.

470
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,780
Now, it's the salt well.

471
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,500
Is Jiang Xuening

472
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,180
a business genius?

473
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,540
She could always find lucrative businesses

474
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,540
that nobody thought would take off.

475
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,310
I'm busy today.

476
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,860
I'll go ask You Fangyin another day.

477
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,860
How did Jiang Xuening get all that information?

478
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:22,480
How's it?

479
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,900
Did you get anything?

480
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,350
As you ordered,

481
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,220
I secretly went to the government office of Xingwu Guards to meet Mr. Zhou.

482
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:28,970
He said

483
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,100
the Yan family has indeed been sentenced to exile.

484
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,880
They'll hit the road before the Spring Festival.

485
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,140
How could this happen?

486
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,690
Are you sure

487
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,350
it was Xie Wei who advised His Majesty to do so?

488
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:38,930
Well…

489
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,060
Miss,

490
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,490
this matter is very clear now.

491
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,900
Chang Zhuo from the forecourt

492
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,550
is Master's valet.

493
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,200
He told me

494
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,260
that now,

495
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,850
everyone in the capital is saying

496
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,770
that Mr. Xie went to hold the Coming-of-Age Ceremony in the Yan Mansion

497
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,780
just to help His Majesty

498
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,380
find the commander's tally.

499
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,530
In my previous life, after I became the empress,

500
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,730
I wanted Shen Jie to summon Yan Lin back.

501
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,010
But he went missing in Huangzhou

502
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,550
and no one knew where he was.

503
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,800
When Xie Wei broke into the court with rebels,

504
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,720
Yan Lin was somehow with him.

505
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,450
Is making Yan Lin a rebel

506
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,280
part of Xie Wei's plan too?

507
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,490
Is that why he's exiled him?

508
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,150
Miss.

509
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,980
The imperial edict has been issued.

510
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,150
It's a done deal now.

511
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,150
You should just accept it.

512
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,640
How can I accept it?

513
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,530
Everything I did

514
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,020
was to change this ending.

515
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,260
Xie Wei.

516
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,590
How could he lie to me?

517
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,080
-Miss.
-Miss.

518
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,110
-Miss.
-Miss.

519
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,070
It's snowing outside.

520
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,530
Where are you going?

521
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,730
I'm going to ask him for an explanation.

522
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,170
[Xie Mansion]

523
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:46,590
Mr. Xie.

524
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,120
Don't be rude to Gongyi Cheng.

525
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,600
You may leave.

526
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,660
We'll have tea together.

527
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,820
Don't let anyone disturb us.

528
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:00,580
But…

529
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:04,490
Yes.

530
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,610
Why are you staring at me, Mr. Gongyi?

531
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,060
I'm just staring at the fox

532
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:34,010
Lord Pingnan let into the henhouse 20 years ago

533
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,060
and the tiger he set loose 4 years ago.

534
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:40,890
You're comparing me to a fox and a tiger.

535
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,880
That sounds too harsh.

536
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,590
Mr. Gongyi,

537
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,720
you plotted against the Yan family again and again

538
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,300
and sowed chaos in the court.

539
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,430
You almost ruined my plan.

540
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,880
How should we

541
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,300
settle that score?

542
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,450
Is that why you're going against me

543
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:04,500
and Lord Pingnan?

544
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,420
Do you know how hard it was for us

545
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,250
to gain our foothold in Tongzhou

546
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,450
and how many people died

547
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,400
before we finally infiltrated Yan's troops?

548
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,350
All that

549
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,960
was ruined by you.

550
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,560
You're not Junior Preceptor Xie in the court.

551
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,420
You're Dujun, the Hermit, in Jinling!

552
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,320
Have you forgotten

553
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,490
who left you to die that year?

554
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,430
And who saved you in the end?

555
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,970
Take back the Imperial City at all costs!

556
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,300
Charge!

557
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,560
I've never forgotten that!

558
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,820
I came to the capital 4 years ago

559
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,010
to destroy the Xue family.

560
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:11,510
I'm still

561
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,040
determined to do that.

562
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,540
But Mr. Gongyi, have you ever thought about

563
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,070
how many innocent people will die

564
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,300
if a rebellion is stirred up

565
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,210
in Tongzhou?

566
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,370
I don't care!

567
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,970
Compared to our great cause,

568
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,470
the lives of those insignificant people

569
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,680
are nothing!

570
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,230
Leave none alive!

571
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:41,870
In a time of unrest,

572
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,420
a saint

573
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,470
is nothing but a loser!

574
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,670
This world

575
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,160
can only be subverted by heartless men.

576
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,300
From the day you chose this path,

577
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,820
there was no turning back.

578
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,460
You helped Yan Mu.

579
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:55,600
But do you dare to let him know

580
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,260
what you did for Lord Pingnan?

581
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,860
You don't want to work with us,

582
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,380
but Lord Pingnan

583
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,260
can tell the court your identity anytime.

584
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,960
What will you do then?

585
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:07,090
You think you're above everyone and can control everything.

586
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:10,220
But that's just an illusion

587
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:12,260
that can be shattered anytime!

588
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,630
I can give you another chance.

589
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:24,110
Don't interfere in the affairs in the capital anymore.

590
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,030
As for Lord Pingnan…

591
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,620
Where did you take Mr. Gongyi?

592
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:20,900
Be patient.

593
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,150
You'll meet him soon.

594
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:23,840
Boys.

595
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,700
Take him down.

596
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,710
You're right.

597
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,600
A saint is useless.

598
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,140
What this world needs is heartless men.

599
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,720
Those who abide by the rules

600
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,460
can't move forward fast.

601
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,480
Then screw the rules.

602
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:36,970
The things they did,

603
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,980
I can too.

604
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:56,500
Don't worry.

605
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,040
You won't be alone.

606
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,500
Dujun, you…

607
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,480
Those in Jinling

608
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,030
will join you sooner or later.

Cleanse the court of traitors and sycophants.

610

Cleanse the court of traitors and sycophants.

611
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,600
Civilians are human,

612

Mr. Xie, warm your hands.

00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,190
Mr. Xie, here is your medicine.

646
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,320
Golden Stone Pills.

647
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,020
No.

648
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,310
Golden Stone Pills can relieve pain and keep you clear-minded,

649
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,550
but they'll do great harm to your body

650
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,860
and may even endanger your life.

651
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,020
You can't take those pills.

652
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,800
Give them to me!

653
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,120
But…

654
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,940
The cut on Mr. Xie's hand is so deep.

655

What if he can't play the qin anymore?

656
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:31,740
And those pills…

657
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:34,820
I know.

658
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,250

669
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,640

670
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,520
nothing has been changed.

671
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,230
What should I do?

672
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,460
Miss Jiang.

673
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,060
What brought you here?

674
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,690
Mr. Zhang.

675
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,390
Yan Lin is innocent.

Please.

677
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:43,300
Please save him.

678
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,300
The imperial edict has been issued.

679
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,370
I know that.

680
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,310
But he's my best friend,

681
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,740

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,480
for their own interests.

685
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,210
But Yan Lin has never done that.

686
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,040
Why should he bear the brunt

687
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,300
of the power struggle?

688
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,200
I finally came back

689
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,640
and changed everything.

690
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,290
Why am I back where I started?

691
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,630
Why can't I have a chance

692
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,320
to be a good person and make up for him?

693
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,140
Sorry.

694
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,220
I'm the one who should apologize.

695
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,530
I'm just angry at myself.

696
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,070
I'm angry at this unfair world.

697
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,720
I shouldn't have taken it out on you.

698
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:29,960
Actually,

699
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,870
this matter has nothing to do with you.

700
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,890
I shouldn't have come to you.

701
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,210
Miss Jiang, you and Viscount Yan

702
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,210
grew up together.

703
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,540
Your friend is about to be exiled to a desolate place.

704
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,730
It's understandable

705
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:41,830
that you feel sad.

706
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:42,900
I know.

707
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,150
What's done is done.

708
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,270
I can only accept it.

709
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,010
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

710
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:52,620
I'm leaving.

711
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,640
Miss Jiang.

712
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,750
The Yan family's case has been closed,

713
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,810
but I'll still get to the bottom of it.

714
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,780
If things take a turn for the better,

715
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,840
I'll try my best to get Viscount Yan back to the capital.

716
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:17,850
I trust you.

717
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:21,639
Mr. Xie.

718
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,150
The Jiang family's servant told me

719
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,550
that Miss Jiang went out early this morning.

720
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,610
She's not home now.

721
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:28,500
Mr. Xie.

722
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:29,870
You're not feeling well.

723
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:30,969
Let's go home.

724
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:31,719
No.

725
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,230
Go to the prison.

726
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,150
Maybe she's there.

727
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:37,670
Yes.

728
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,780
It's getting cold.

729
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:42,730
I prepared winter clothes for you.

730
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:43,900
If you need anything else,

731
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,020
ask Mr. Zhou for it.

732
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:46,870
Take good care of yourself.

733
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,210
I have everything I need here.

734
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,340
Mr. Lyu comes a lot and brings me stuff.

735
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:51,830
But look at you.

736
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,040
You don't look well.

737
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,980
Has something happened?

738
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,080
Is it that obvious?

739
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,370
Mr. Zhou told me

740
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,620
His Majesty decided to exile Viscount Yan.

741
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,950
Is that why you look sad?

742
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,270
I planned to visit Yan Lin today,

743
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,400
but there are too many guards there

744
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,860
and I need His Majesty's permission to go in.

745
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:11,880
Fangyin.

746
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,680
I feel so useless.

747
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,630
I thought I could change lots of things,

748
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,190
but now in retrospect,

749
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,980
I was just being ridiculous.

750
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,670
I thought I could save Yan Lin,

751
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:25,850
but I couldn't change anything.

752
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,140
I thought

753
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:29,090
I made life easier for you

754
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:32,810
but I just locked you in another prison.

755
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,310
No.

756
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,140
I really like my life now.

757
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,220
If it weren't for you,

758
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,300
I would've died in the You Mansion.

759
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,760
Look at me now.

760
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,420
I've learned to do accounts

761
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,690
and learned to do business.

762
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:46,410
I've also made many new friends.

763
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,070
You made those things happen.

764
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:49,850
You changed everything.

765
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:52,570
I'm not well-educated

766
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:55,620
and don't know how to make an eloquent speech.

767
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,670
But my mother once told me

768
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:59,270
that death

769
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,340
was the end of everyone's life,

770
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:04,300
but the process could have thousands of possibilities.

771
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,560
I'm already very lucky

772
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,250
to have you in my life.

773
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,660
It's the same for Yan Lin.

774
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,830
He's to be exiled again

775
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,300
but the process was different this time.

776
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,340
He may not end up on that path again.

777
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,220
I don't understand what you mean.

778
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:23,500
But look at me.

779
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,660
Although I'm still here,

780
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,090
although I'm still not as smart as you,

781
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,750
things are different now,

782
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:30,780
aren't they?

783
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,320
Mr. Xie?

784
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,100
Mr. Xie.

785
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,820
Are you here for Miss Jiang?

786
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,640
I'll take my leave.

787
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,630
Take care.

788
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,020
I was going to see you

789
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:01,830
but you came to me first.

790
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,270
You have something to say to me?

791
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,450
I have nothing

792
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,190
to say to you.

793
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,880
But don't you think

794
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,830
you owe me an explanation?

795
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,690
What happened last night was an accident.

796
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:13,760
I didn't expect you to come.

797
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,220
I'm talking about Yan Lin.

798
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,560
If I hadn't gone to you,

799
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,660
when would you tell me about the exile?

800
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,120
You said you'd save Yan Lin

801
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,060
but you exiled him.

802
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:23,850
If you're here to threaten me,

803
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:24,850
save your breath.

804
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,260
I'm not interested

805
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,460
in your secrets

806
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,620
and won't tell anyone about them.

807
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,450
If you save Yan Lin

808
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,680
as you promised,

809
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,160
in the future,

810
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,180
I'll stay out of your way.

811
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,570
Miss Jiang.

812
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,230
Have you no conscience?

813
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,550
You know how much Mr. Xie loves qin.

814
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,400
If you hadn't come uninvited last night,

815
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,020
he wouldn't have hurt himself.

816
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:47,550
Today,

817
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:48,890
to come out to find you,

818
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,750
-he took Golden Stone…
-Jian Shu.

819
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,230
Ning'er.

820
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,790
If you really care about Yan Lin

821
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:59,890
and want to know how the Yan family will end,

822
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,300
come to my place with me.

823
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,070
Last night…

824
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,690
I won't mention it to anyone.

825
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:22,170
Don't worry.

826
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,060
The man last night

827
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,880
was called Gongyi Cheng.

828
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,280
He was Lord Pingnan's counselor.

829
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,470
The assassination of the official in the capital,

830
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,450
Jade Ruyi Scepter incident in the court,

831
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:36,260
the poisoned arrow Marquis Yan got shot by,

832
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,260
the half a letter,

833
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,420
and the rebellion in the Tongzhou Camps

834
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:41,630
were all his doings.

835
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,770
If he were alive,

836
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,010
he'd undermine the Yan family again.

837
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:47,470
So I had to do away with him.

838
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,130
It was I who advised His Majesty

839
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,020
to exile the Yan family.

840
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:56,230
It was also I who submitted the commander's tally.

841
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:58,160
But it's really not what you think.

842
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,980
The Yan family

843
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:03,110
has too many enemies in the capital.

844
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,910
There's nothing they can do to turn the tide.

845
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,470
A gambit

846
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:09,360
is their only way out.

847
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,270
Do you know

848
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,930
what kind of place Huangzhou is?

849
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,200
It's barren

850
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,480
and boiling hot.

851
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,140
There is never enough food.

852
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:20,640
Yue people may invade it

853
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,910
at any time.

854
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:24,710
Yan Lin will go crazy if he goes there!

855
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,090
I know.

856
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:29,230
Suffering builds character.

857
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,950
Only after he survives that

858
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:33,340
can he become a truly great general.

859
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,990
If what you said is true,

860
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,490
why didn't you tell me earlier?

861
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,560
You asked me many times

862
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:44,000
what my relationship with the Yan family is.

863
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,310
Have you got an answer?

864
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,200
I have a guess.

865
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,770
What's it?

866
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,790
Every time it snows, you suffer from schizophrenia.

867
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,930
Only those who were once in a life-and-death situation

868
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:57,130
can get that disease.

869
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,760
Your surname is Xie.

870
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:00,830
The Xie family is rich and prestigious.

871
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:03,360
They're not likely to have been through that.

872
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,060
Besides,

873
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,490
Jinling is in the south.

874
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:06,690
It never snows there.

875
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:08,150
Something

876
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,470
is not right.

877
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,360
So?

878
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,140
In the court,

879
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,290
after Jade Ruyi Scepter incident,

880
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,180
I heard you mention Gongyi Cheng

881
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,310
to that eunuch.

882
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:21,270
It means you must be involved with the rebels.

883
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,250
You have

884
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:24,700
well-trained guards like Jian Shu and Dao Qin

885
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,610
and a resourceful friend like Lyu Xian.

886
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:27,620
In just four years,

887
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,150
you won His Majesty's trust

888
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:31,630
and gained great influence in the court.

889
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,250
So your identity

890
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,200
must be fake.

891
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:40,650
Why are you laughing?

892
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,470
Since you entered the court,

893
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,930
I've been observing you

894
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:45,590
and you've been observing me.

895
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,300
We know each other better than anyone else.

896
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,400
Someone said

897
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,360
that everything I have now

898
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,940
is just an illusion.

899
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,830
It can be easily shattered.

900
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:57,300
But now it seems

901
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,620
he could be wrong.

902
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,730
You know Xie Wei is a fake name

903
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,050
but still trust me.

904
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,280
That's enough.

905
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:07,650
I never said I still trust you.

906
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:10,560
You'd even hurt yourself when you were sick.

907
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,620
How can I trust you?

908
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:13,310
So when it snows again,

909
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:15,470
don't come near me.

910
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:18,640
Ning'er.

911
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,760
I don't want to do anything that I'll regret.

912
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:28,850
Don't worry.

913
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,890
Unless it's about Yan Lin,

914
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:32,280
I won't come to you.

915
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,510
[Jiang Mansion]

916
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:42,770
[Carefree]

917
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:45,750
Father.

918
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,670
What brings you here today?

919
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:51,780
I want to ask you

920
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:52,800
for a favor.

921
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:57,950
This is a list

922
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:00,050
of all the gifts Yan Lin gave me.

923
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,500
After all these years,

924
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,520
they're quite a lot now.

925
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,660
Now the Yan family is in trouble.

926
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,570
I want

927
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:05,900
to sell them

928
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,940
and give the money

929
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,080
to Yan Lin

930
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,010
so that he can use it in Huangzhou.

931
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,530
These are a lot of gifts.

932
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:15,610
But if

933
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,560
we sell them in a hurry,

934
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,820
they'll inevitably be underpriced.

935
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,460
That'll be a waste

936
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,500
of the Yan family's valuables.

937
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:24,910
The Yan family is leaving.

938
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,450
They have no need for these things anymore.

939
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:28,460
Now that many people in the court are willing to help the Yan family,

940
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,590
this may still work.

941
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:32,340
After the Yan family is gone and forgotten,

942
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,610
no matter how much money we can collect,

943
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:35,060
it'll be too late.

944
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:40,270
How about this?

945
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:42,500
Tomorrow, I'll ask the butler to pick out those

946
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,700
without the Yan family's seal

947
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,540
and sell them.

948
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,630
We'll keep those of great value

949
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,090
in our depository

950
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,270
and take the money

951
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,560
out of our account.

952
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,430
This way,

953
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,270
we can raise money more quickly.

954
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:56,030
But that'll be a lot of money.

955
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,630
We've known the Yan family for a long time.

956
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,650
Although I have concerns

957
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,280
about certain things,

958
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,680
I'll do what I can

959
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,070
to help them.

960
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:10,950
Besides,

961
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,390
this is what my precious daughter wants to do.

962
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:15,250
As your father,

963
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,640
I must support you.
