This guy must be an outlaw coming at Xie Wei.

180

Can't you put politics aside for one second?

You don't need to doubt

If you are willing to let her go,

I can ask my men to give you a pass

He'll in no way let this rebel escape.

342
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,900
It's Jian Shu's question.

343
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:30,840
Sir,

344
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,300
why didn't you tell to Miss Jiang that you had no intention

345
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,050
to kill her?

346
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,710
It's good that she's afraid of me.

347
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:38,930
Fear

348
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,320
makes her behave.

349
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,240
Ning.

350
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,170
Ning, I was worried sick.

351
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,390
They told me everything.

352
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,360
I'm so shocked

353
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,310
that you ran into a rebel in broad daylight.

354
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,040
Are you okay?

355
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,530
Don't worry. I survived just fine.

356
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,870
Don't be afraid.

357
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,760
I'm here now.

358
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,670
I won't let anyone hurt you.

359
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:09,870
It's all my fault.

360
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,900
If I hadn't wasted my time

361
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,510
in the You Mansion

362
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,050
and let you wait for me at Cengxiao Restaurant alone,

363
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,110
you wouldn't have met that assassin.

364
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,590
It's not the assassin who I'm afraid of.

365
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:19,850
Yan Lin,

366
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,730
I didn't know you and Mr. Xie are close.

367
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,830
Mr. Xie is the Junior Preceptor.

368
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,700
He's our teacher,

369
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,560
so we meet a lot,

370
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,680
but I wouldn't say we're close.

371
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:29,270
Why?

372
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,110
Was he hard on you?

373
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,020
They're definitely

374
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,580
not just teacher and student.

375
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,780
Xie Wei seems to be Yan Lin's friend

376
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,920
instead of enemy.

377
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,620
That's good news.

378
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,170
Let's leave these unhappy things behind.

379
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,950
You said you'll take me to see the lanterns.

380
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:54,480
Let's go.

381
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,330
But you just had quite a fright.

382
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:58,140
-We can see them next year. -No.

383
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,180
I want to go.

384
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,400
Fine, if that's what you wish.

385
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:04,970
How about Tang'er?

386
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,230
I've sent her and the coachman back.

387
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:07,840
Tonight,

388
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,210
no one can disturb you.

389
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:09,800
Let's go.

390
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,920
See? I didn't lie to you.

391
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,170
There are so many people this year.

392
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,230
They're the delicious sugar figurines I mentioned.

393
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:07,800
See if you like anything.

394
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,730
They're all freshly made

395
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:09,860
and very delicious.

396
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,160
We'll take this one.

397
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,700
Thank you, Sir.

398
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,830
Congratulations. You're right.

399
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,160
They're posing lantern riddles over there.

400
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,220
Congratulations.

401
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,140
You're so smart.

402
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:23,740
Thank you.

403
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:24,550
Bravo!

404
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:25,770
Why don't we give it a shot too?

405
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,730
Next riddle.

406
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,180
What has lots of bark,

407
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,150
but no bite?

408
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,430
Who will take a guess?

409
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,520
Tree.

410
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,800
The winner gets a reward.

411
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,220
I know.

412
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:33,880
Sir.

413
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:34,880
It's tree.

414
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:35,870
Correct.

415
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,580
Come on.

416
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,210
Let's have more fun.

417
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:45,810
Next riddle.

418
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,450
Are they fox nuts?

419
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:35,750
Yes, Miss.

420
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,460
They're first-class fox nuts

421
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,890
shipped from Suzhou a few days ago.

422
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,630
The Cao River has been turbulent recently.

423
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,090
They can't be from Suzhou.

424
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,620
Even royal tributes

425
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,060
can't arrive so quickly.

426
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,290
They must be from some lake nearby.

427
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,440
You're an expert.

428
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,350
But their taste

429
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,700
is comparable to those from Suzhou.

430
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,370
Try one.

431
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:55,090
Is it good?

432
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,270
Then I'll buy all of them

433
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,730
together with the basket.

434
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:00,670
Thank you, Sir.

435
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:03,760
Keep the change.

436
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:04,950
Thank you, Sir.

437
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,530
Let's go.

438
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,910
The evening chanting has long ended.

439
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,220
Why did you take me to the temple?

440
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,420
This is the place I carefully selected.

441
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,280
Come on.

442
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:23,130
Look.

443
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,710
What a view!

444
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:44,910
Here.

445
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,160
You're the same as you always were.

446
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,690
You eat like a little chick.

447
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,240
Isn't it good to stay the way I was?

448
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,550
Yes.

449
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,700
It is.

450
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,320
But Ning,

451
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,850
I'll come of age soon.

452
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:42,880
Yan Lin,

453
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,890
you're so nice to me.

454
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,200
What do you see in me?

455
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,790
The moment I laid my eyes on you,

456
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,660
I knew you were different from those girls in the capital.

457
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,580
Your eyes

458
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,010
are starry.

459
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,300
You never hide your emotions.

460
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,590
I still remember the first time I saw you.

461
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,730
You were truthful at that time.

462
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,810
You took what you wanted

463
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:11,170
and didn't fake smiles when you were moody.

464
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,430
When you were happy,

465
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,570
you could be so sweet and adorable.

466
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:17,410
When you were sad,

467
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,800
you hid up and cried alone.

468
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,030
At that time, I thought

469
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:26,230
you were a girl who should be doted on.

470
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,500
I never thought

471
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,420
that you'd turn out to be the best liar I've ever known.

472
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,950
I know you're awake.

473
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,840
Jiang Xuening.

474
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,480
You're a liar.

475
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,200
But no one likes me.

476
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:56,450
Wan Niang didn't like me.

477
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,840
Mother doesn't like me.

478
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,950
The servants in the mansion don't like me.

479
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,890
Everyone else in the capital doesn't like me either.

480
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:07,950
So,

481
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,870
have you ever thought

482
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,470
that you've fallen in love with the wrong person?

483
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,100
Nonsense.

484
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,280
Think about it.

485
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,440
Wan Niang

486
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,700
didn't have to let your father know

487
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:22,490
that you and your sister were swapped.

488
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:23,690
If she had kept quiet,

489
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,890
your sister would still

490
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,920
be the only legitimate daughter of the Jiang family.

491
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,050
When Wan Niang died,

492
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,200
she'd bring the secret

493
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,670
with her to the grave.

494
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:33,340
She could've done that,

495
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,950
but before she died,

496
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,420
she revealed the truth

497
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,150
and sent you back to the capital

498
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,740
despite the risk

499
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,740
of making her own daughter suffer.

500
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,200
If you see things this way,

501
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,800
you can't say that she didn't love you.

502
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:48,800
My Ning

503
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,320
deserves the best love in the world.

504
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,180
But I won't always be the girl

505
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,440
who settles for

506
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,260
just being the apple of your eye.

507
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,120
I'll grow up.

508
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,340
I'll become a bad woman.

509
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,490
You won't.

510
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,280
You'll always be the best.

511
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:18,570
♫How many people can one love in a lifetime?♫

512
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,360
I'm not the best.

513
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,700
You are.

514
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,650
Jiang Xuening

515
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,060
♫Can you understand the love and hate♫

516
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,610
doesn't deserve your love.

517
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:26,490
♫In the eyes looking at you?♫

518
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,350
It's up to me

519
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:26,820
to decide that.

520
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:34,450
♫How much true love exists in this vast world♫

521
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,110
In my eyes,

522
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,940
you are the best.

523
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:36,800
♫To be worthy of so many poems?♫

524
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:40,900
♫There are too many stories to be written♫

525
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,300
Don't cry.

526
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,810
It breaks my heart.

527
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,150
♫We were too young to know about pain♫

528
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:49,160
♫We drank under the moon amidst flowers♫

529
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,140
♫We saw flowers blooming yesterday♫

530
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,700
♫And thought they'd still be blooming tomorrow♫

531
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,590
♫When we were young♫

532
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,680
Something happened to my family.

533
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,420
I have to go.

534
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,540
♫We believed that as long as we could♫

535
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:01,910
Ning.

536
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:03,310
Wait for me.

537
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:04,940
One day,

538
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,490
I'll clear the name of my family

539
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,630
♫Hold those warm hands♫

540
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,110
and come back to marry you.

541
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:12,980
♫We could be with our beloved one forever♫

542
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,520
Yan Lin,

543
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,730
I'll marry Shen Jie.

544
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:18,420
♫Time flies and everything's like a dream♫

545
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,510
I want to be the empress.

546
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:27,350
♫I traveled so far but still couldn't forget you♫

547
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:22,370
There are things

548
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,030
you can't give me,

549
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:25,910
but he can.

550
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:33,970
♫I spent half my life loving you but ended up being a joke♫

551
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,810
If you need to blame someone,

552
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,130
blame yourself.

553
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,100
♫My heart is broken♫

554
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,270
♫But I never regret loving you♫

555
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:47,940
Sorry.

556
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:49,620
I forgot my manners.

557
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,410
Thank you for being so nice to me,

558
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,570
but I only take you as my best friend.

559
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,550
Sorry. I...

560
00:28:59,390 --> 00:28:59,990
Forget it.

561
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,220
It's too late.

562
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,550
I should go back.

563
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:05,930
Ning.

564
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,390
After my coming-of-age ceremony,

565
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,210
marry me.

566
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:32,630
Miss.

567
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:34,520
Miss.

568
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,120
You're finally back.

569
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,380
I was so worried.

570
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,010
Are you hurt?

571
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:41,770
I'm fine.

572
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,890
Still in one piece.

573
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,900
Miss, His Lordship and Her Ladyship asked for you.

574
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,190
Have they known that I was held hostage?

575
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:49,730
No.

576
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,110
Mr. Xie's men said

577
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,830
what happened today must be a secret,

578
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:56,140
so I didn't tell His Lordship and Her Ladyship.

579
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,670
It's about something else.

580
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,280
Hui.

581
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:02,860
My Lady.

582
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,940
Stay quiet when you watch us play.

583
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,770
Don't give her any clues.

584
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,160
Hui has improved.

585
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,420
You can't give her advice.

586
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,700
She has to rely on herself.

587
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,070
What will you do next?

588
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,370
Mother, look.

589
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,020
I told you

590
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,680
you should play it this way.

591
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,340
-Father. -You…

592
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,690
Ning, you're back.

593
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,280
Did you have fun tonight?

594
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:29,230
You asked for me.

595
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,190
Here's the thing.

596
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,060
I heard

597
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,580
that Princess Leyang went to the You Mansion

598
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,070
and talked to you.

599
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,500
So I guess

600
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,450
you must have known about that matter.

601
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:42,890
Do you mean

602
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:45,540
entering the palace as a study partner?

603
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,000
Yes.

604
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,290
Father and Mother

605
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,500
didn't mean to keep it from you.

606
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:51,670
You know

607
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,440
that one can't be too careful

608
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,950
in the palace.

609
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,370
You'd be uncomfortable there.

610
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:00,030
So it's better to let your sister go.

611
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,290
I know

612
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,520
it's unfair for you.

613
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,520
I can understand

614
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:06,920
if you're angry with us.

615
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,020
I have no objections.

616
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,550
After all, it's related to…

617
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,440
What did you say?

618
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,420
I'm not interested in entering the palace.

619
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,220
Really?

620
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,220
Ning, you...

621
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,700
If there's nothing else, I'll take my leave.

622
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,860
Good night, Ning.

623
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,760
Ning has grown up.

624
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,190
She's so thoughtful now.

625
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:43,610
You heard her?

626
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,620
She didn't make things hard for us

627
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:48,090
and made sacrifices for her sister.

628
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,610
This feels so unreal to me.

629
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,170
You're paranoid.

630
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,400
It's weird.

631
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,310
Mr. Chen has looked into it.

632
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,370
The assassin today

633
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:03,130
had the tattoo of the rebels.

634
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,530
The knife he used had the stamp of Lord Pingnan's troops.

635
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,790
He was indeed a rebel.

636
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,390
Lately,

637
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,590
many high-ranking officials in the capital

638
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,520
have been assassinated by rebels.

639
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,080
No wonder Xue Yuan

640
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,710
wanted to take the chance to slander the Yan family.

641
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,040
But…

642
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,000
The rebels in the capital

643
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,260
are all at your disposal.

644
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,460
How come that assassin

645
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,790
didn't know who you are?

646
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,190
This is so strange.

647
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,380
It seems

648
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,680
that Lord Pingnan is getting suspicious of me.

649
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,010
Dao Qin.

650
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,720
Send a letter to Jinling.

651
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,660
Find out

652
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,360
who sent that assassin.

653
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,550
Yes.

654
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:37,480
Sir.

655
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,430
Isn't it too risky?

656
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,820
You came here to carry out

657
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,900
Lord Pingnan's order of weakening the forces in the capital.

658
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,500
The Xue family and the Yan family are at each other's throats now.

659
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,220
It's exactly what Lord Pingnan wants to see.

660
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,100
You helped the Yan family

661
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,010
again and again.

662
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:50,570
If Lord Pingnan finds out

663
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,830
and exposes your identity,

664
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,360
the court won't let you off.

665
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,310
That came out wrong.

666
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,650
I'll go to work now.

667
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:12,440
[Mansion of Duke of Xue]

668
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,900
Yesterday,

669
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,710
another assassination happened.

670
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,490
Xie Wei was the target this time.

671
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:30,000
The Ministry of Justice is conducting interrogations.

672
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:32,390
The military officer from Yan's troops

673
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,270
was interrogated too.

674
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,430
In your opinion,

675
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,810
what should we do?

676
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,160
Duke,

677
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,480
we did our best

678
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,080
during the interrogation.

679
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,550
Those rebels are tough,

680
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,000
especially that military officer.

681
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,600
No matter how we grilled him,

682
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,630
he wouldn't tell us

683
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:51,690
who is the mastermind in the capital.

684
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,460
Listen.

685
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,630
You're a moron!

686
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,670
I've made it very clear.

687
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,910
Arresting and grilling the rebels

688
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,560
is not the goal!

689
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,220
What I want

690
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:04,290
is to get the evidence of the Yan family's treason

691
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:05,950
from those rebels.

692
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,330
You didn't get anything out of them!

693
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,920
If Chen Ying finds out about my plan,

694
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,170
do you know

695
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,889
what the consequence will be?

696
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:19,920
Sorry. I failed you.

697
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,060
I'm incompetent.

698
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:21,520
Enough!

699
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:25,659
I don't need someone useless like you.

700
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,570
Guards!

701
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:31,810
Duke.

702
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:32,699
Duke.

703
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,530
Please spare my life!

704
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,010
Duke.

705
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:35,830
Please spare my life!

706
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:36,480
Duke.

707
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:40,120
-I've worked hard for so long, -Please spare my life.

708
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:43,600
but still can't bring down the Yan family.

709
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,900
Power struggles are never easy.

710
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,840
I'm at the end of my wits now.

711
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:52,909
Duke,

712
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:54,170
I think

713
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:55,679
the current situation

714
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,340
can be a blessing in disguise.

715
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:58,270
Everyone knows

716
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,470
that the Xue family and Yan family are at odds.

717
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,020
Now,

718
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:03,350
the Ministry of Justice is in charge of the investigation.

719
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,780
No matter what the result is,

720
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,700
at least we're spared

721
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,060
from gossip and speculations.

722
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,860
The Yan family's days are numbered.

723
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,360
It'll topple sooner or later.

724
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,760
His Majesty is paranoid.

725
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,920
To achieve your great plan,

726
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,800
you need a drastic measure.

727
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,830
Over the past years,

728
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,710
that old coot Yan Mu

729
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,980
has always had it in for me.

730
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,830
Since we can't find any evidence,

731
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,580
we'll create some.

732
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,820
Go find someone capable

733
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,090
in Xingwu Guards.

734
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,840
Tell him to penetrate the Yan family.

735
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:40,940
I want to get

736
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,060
Yan Mu's handwriting

737
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,430
and seal.

738
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,960
Yes, Duke.

739
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,070
Xingwu Guards. We're ordered

740
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,290
to search for rebels here.

741
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,290
Get out of the way!

742
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,180
His Majesty has made

743
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,940
the Ministry of Justice in charge of the purge of rebels.

744
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,220
May I ask

745
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,950
who gave you that order?

746
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,030
Don't tell me it's Duke of Xue.

747
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:29,910
Viscount Yan.

748
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,700
Be careful with what you say.

749
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,660
Duke of Xue

750
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,890
sent us here to search for rebels

751
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,000
for the peace of the State of Qian.

752
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:39,350
Are you stopping us from searching

753
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,950
because you're afraid that we may find something?

754
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,720
Have you really

755
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,870
hidden someone in Tongzhou Camps?

756
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:47,620
Nonsense!

757
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,780
Wait, My Lord!

758
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:54,560
Kill them!

759
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:56,600
Kill!

760
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:57,600
Hey, guy!

761
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,440
Stop!

762
00:36:59,010 --> 00:36:59,520
Guys!

763
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,680
Stop fighting!

764
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:16,790
Stop fighting!

765
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,400
Sir.

766
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:37,960
Zhou Yinzhi, what're you doing?

767
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,190
[Zhou Yinzhi, Sergeant of Xingwu Guards]

768
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,430
Duke of Xue asked us to investigate

769
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,300
instead of searching.

770
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,190
The soldiers in the camps are all protesters of the people.

771
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,780
Why do we have to fight them?

772
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,330
Get away!

773
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:45,850
Which side are you on?

774
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,480
Do you still want to work in Xingwu Guards?

775
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,470
Stop fighting!

776
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,200
Stop!

777
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,160
In Tongzhou Camps,

778
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,390
everyone should obey the rules set by the Yan family's ancestors.

779
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,720
This is a military base,

780
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,260
so unless with an imperial edict,

781
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,160
no one can enter it.

782
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:16,340
The Yan family's spears

783
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,930
killed countless enemies.

784
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,460
If anyone ignores our rules,

785
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,010
I don't mind teaching them a lesson.

786
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:29,670
Sir.

787
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,800
Let's wait and see.

788
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,960
You're a good man.

789
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,960
Xingwu Guards are corrupt.

790
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,110
You deserve a better position.

791
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,280
How about

792
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,720
coming to work for me?

793
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,530
Thank you for your kind offer.

794
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,830
My name is Zhou Yinzhi.

795
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,830
I'm used to staying in Xingwu Guards.

796
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,420
I'll just stay this way.

797
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,480
I won't force you.

798
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,150
You fought well just now.

799
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:05,030
Come here to spar with the soldiers when you're free.

800
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:05,450
I will.

801
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,590
Yan Lin.

802
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:20,960
Xie Wei.

803
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,640
The Yan family.

804
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,190
The Xue family.

805
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,720
I want to save the Yan family,

806
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,250
but I'm nobody now.

807
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,790
Who can I ask for help?

808
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:33,410
Zhou Yinzhi?

809
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,920
Back then, to strengthen my position as the empress,

810
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,230
I put him in an important position to do my dirty work.

811
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,350
He's a dangerous man.

812
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,990
[Zhou Yinzhi, Commander of Xingwu Guards]

813
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,440
But given the circumstances,

814
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,060
he seems to be the only person

815
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:46,740
I can take advantage of.

816
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,420
[Zhou Yinzhi]

817
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,150
Back then, Xingwu Guards revealed that the Yan family

818
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,960
played a part in Lord Pingnan's rebellion

819
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,580
and led the investigation.

820
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:56,020
Zhou Yinzhi should be a Sergeant in Xingwu Guards now.

821
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,350
Maybe he can help me get some information.

822
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,120
Wait.

823
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:01,530
Sergeant.

824
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,290
To keep an eye on Yan Lin,

825
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,410
I introduced Zhou Yinzhi to him.

826
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:08,710
Before the Yan family was charged with treason,

827
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,920
Zhou Yinzhi suddenly became Staff Sergeant

828
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,610
and then Sergeant First Class after the incident.

829
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:16,210
I thought he got promoted so fast because he was able,

830
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:17,270
but in retrospect,

831
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,420
he may have been involved in the Yan family's doom.

832
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,390
Coming.

833
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,330
Who are you?

834
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:36,250
Is Mr. Zhou home?

835
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,400
He went to work early in the morning.

836
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,060
I don't know when he'll be back.

837
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,280
If you want to see him,

838
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,920
you can come in and take a seat.

839
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,890
I'll send someone to inform him immediately.

840
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:46,190
Don't mention my coming.

841
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,890
Just tell Zhou Yinzhi

842
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,320
that his beloved horse is dying

843
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:53,110
and he should come back to see it one last time.

844
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:08,800
Yinzhi.

845
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,930
You came back quickly.

846
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,580
I haven't visited you in a long time.

847
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,840
How impertinent of me.

848
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:33,070
Sorry that you had to come here in person.

849
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,160
Please forgive me.

850
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:35,880
You came at a good time.

851
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,180
I was about to go to you.

852
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:37,840
Really?

853
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,420
You came to the capital four years ago.

854
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,770
At first, you were just a coachman in my house.

00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:43,430
Now you work in Xingwu Guards.

856
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,310
I don't see why you should

857
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,710
bother to pay me a visit.

858
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:48,950
Please don't say that, Miss Jiang.

859
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:49,870
If it weren't for you,

860
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:50,990
I'd still be feeding horses in the countryside.

861
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,480
I came to the capital thanks to you.

862
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,060
I'll never forget

863
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,380
your kindness to me.

864
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,830
Save the pleasantries.

865
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,610
In the past few days,

866
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,360
Zhang Zhe, the Supervising Secretary for the Division of Criminal Justice,

867
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,890
impeached your superior.

868
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:03,320
And rebels kept making attempts

869
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,210
to assassinate court officials.

870
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,830
If His Majesty wants

871
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:08,910
to attribute them to Xingwu Guards' negligence,

872
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:10,040
I'm afraid your life

873
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,450
will be quite hard.

874
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:12,780
I know you.

875
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,060
You're a clever man

876
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,340
and have ambitions.

877
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,190
But you have neither money

878
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,280
nor connections.

879
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,530
That's why you thought of me, right?

880
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,450
I guessed right.

881
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,010
It seems that if I want to get to him,

882
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,340
I have to take my chances

883
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,370
and break him down mentally first.

884
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:30,860
Mr. Zhou.

885
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,450
I might as well take another guess.

886
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,000
I'm just a powerless woman.

887
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,050
What you want to make use of

888
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,080
is my relationship with Yan Lin.

889
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,760
Instead of cozying up to

890
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,130
your superiors in Xingwu Guards,

891
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:44,840
you tried to get close to the Yan family which is the implacable enemy of Xingwu Guards.

892
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,040
I'm afraid you're up to something else.

893
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,480
I guessed right again.

894
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,200
It seems that he really played a part

895
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,060
in the Yan family's destruction.

896
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,230
Are you afraid

897
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:56,370
because I guessed everything right?

898
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,220
Let me give you some advice.

899
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:01,350
Stay out of the fight between the Yan family and the Xue family.

900
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:03,660
No matter what mission the Xue family gave you,

901
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,670
if you succeed,

902
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,500
you may have a meteoric rise to fame and fortune,

903
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:10,380
but you'll be disposed of as a useless pawn eventually.

904
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,090
I'm afraid one day,

905
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:13,660
you'll come to a violent demise

906
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,090
with no one to lay you to rest.
