00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,303
It is?

181
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,766
That's not good.

182
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,350
I was going to go with you.

183
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,144
I know.

184
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,229
I was going to go to your game too
for morale support.

185
00:13:34,229 --> 00:13:35,898
Can you go by yourself?

186
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,483
You have a lot of stuff to bring.

187
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:43,072
I think I'll have to ask someone
to help carry all the stuff.

188
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,951
- Seung Won?
- Hey.

189
00:13:47,951 --> 00:13:51,163
I'm not telling you not to.

190
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,664
If I finish quickly...

191
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:55,042
No, no, I'll just ask
to change the schedule.

192
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,002
Oh, stop it!

193
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,671
Don't. And don't even think about coming.

194
00:14:03,515 --> 00:14:06,053
I want you to focus on your game.

195
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,971
I'll focus on my audition.

196
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:10,391
And Seung Won is just my friend.

197
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:14,645
You acting jealous is kind of cute,
but you're going overboard.

198
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,647
Would you like it if I told you
not to hang out with Hee Su?

199
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,234
There's someone.

200
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,113
Other than Seung Won.

201
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,514
You feel sorry, right?

202
00:14:31,514 --> 00:14:33,914
No. Why would I?

203
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,959
I'm using Seung Won?
I have a fish tank?

204
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,253
I've been friends with him longer than you!

205
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,966
Would you like it if I said that
about you and Chan Young?

206
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:47,314
You're sorry, right?

207
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,056
Well...

208
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,017
If you're sorry,
make some time on Saturday.

209
00:14:54,017 --> 00:14:55,936
Why?

210
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,855
I need help.

211
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:01,400
- Why?
- Your friend Chan Young can't help because of tennis

212
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,237
and my friend Seung Won doesn't
want to help me because of you.

213
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:10,827
Seung Won doesn't want to help?

214
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,703
So, you have to help me.

215
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,248
You won't help?

216
00:15:17,248 --> 00:15:19,251
Oh well then.
I'll just ask Seung Won...

217
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:23,380
Okay, I'll help. Saturday.

218
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,266
Hey, Seung Won!

219
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:38,352
You should come earlier.

220
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,715
Let's go.

221
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,920
Didn't you go to bed yet?

222
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,296
Where did you go?

223
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,423
Tennis.

224
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,592
- What about the academy?
- There's a competition...

225
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:10,136
I made money and sent you
to the academy and school,

226
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,596
but all you do is hit a ball all day?

227
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,604
This is so exhausting.

228
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,149
Dad, it's...

229
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:25,900
Children never turn out
the way you want them to.

230
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:29,655
Is it fun to play second fiddle
to others every time?

231
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,241
- Dad!
- Face reality!

232
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,951
Even if you come in first,
it's hard to make a living.

233
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,663
Have you ever won first place?

234
00:16:35,663 --> 00:16:38,648
You've been always 2nd or 3rd place.

235
00:16:38,648 --> 00:16:40,543
What could you achieve like that?

236
00:16:40,543 --> 00:16:43,669
When you have your own kids,
can you provide as much as I do?

237
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,798
At least...

238
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,258
I wouldn't do this.

239
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,342
What?

240
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,471
You think this is as far as I'll go.

241
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:54,974
You don't even think
I could do better than this.

242
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:57,108
I haven't even given my all once,

243
00:16:57,108 --> 00:16:58,686
but you think this is it.

244
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:00,143
Chan Young.

245
00:17:00,143 --> 00:17:02,715
That's not what I mean.
You have other things you're good at.

246
00:17:02,715 --> 00:17:04,191
How do you know?

247
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:05,857
What?

248
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:07,861
How far I can go,

249
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,906
whether I'll always be second or third,
or if I can ever be first.

250
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:12,783
How would you know?

251
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:13,909
I don't even know that.

252
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:15,494
Exactly! You don't even know!

253
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:18,787
That's why.
I have to try to know.

254
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,872
I'm going to try.

255
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:26,003
I'm going to throw all that away.

256
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,255
Not while you're under my roof.

257
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,756
You know.

258
00:17:29,756 --> 00:17:33,047
I didn't raise you
to be second fiddle to others.

259
00:17:37,472 --> 00:17:39,765
Ju Chan Young!

260
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,109
Why is this so heavy?
What's inside?

261
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:49,442
- Is it really heavy?
- A bit.

262
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,405
Why did you suddenly come here?

263
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,906
This.

264
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:56,700
This?

265
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,826
What about this?

266
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:00,495
I came here to audition, you dummy.

267
00:18:00,495 --> 00:18:02,539
You?

268
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,375
What audition?
What would you do?

269
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,082
Hey!

270
00:18:07,082 --> 00:18:09,504
What would you sing?

271
00:18:09,504 --> 00:18:11,672
- Are you good at singing?
- Yeah.

272
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:17,179
So that's why you had your guitar.
I had no idea.

273
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,267
Alright, two groups per match
according to the matchup order.

274
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:22,186
- Gyeong Su, you be the ref.
- Yes, coach.

275
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:25,687
Alright, everyone, warm up.
Don't just stand there.

276
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,816
We'll start on the dot.
Get ready!

277
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:29,440
Yes, coach!

278
00:18:55,842 --> 00:18:58,219
Game goes to Ji Hun.

279
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,069
Wait, this is really you?

280
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:14,277
- Yeah.
- No way.

281
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,449
- Why are you doing this?
- What do you mean why?

282
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,660
- You get good grades.
- So?

283
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,370
I mean...

284
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:23,870
I'm good at this too.

285
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,125
Aren't I good?

286
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,504
Hey, you're unbelievably annoying.

287
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:33,883
Numbers 127, 130, 132, get ready.

288
00:19:33,883 --> 00:19:35,966
- Yes!
- Yes.

289
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,028
Are you nervous?

290
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,447
No.

291
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,247
What are you looking for?

292
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,874
My phone. I think I lost my phone.

293
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,500
Where is it?

294
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,339
Oh, darn.

295
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:17,007
Nobody's answering.

296
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,508
Where can it be?

297
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,936
You're nervous.

298
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,354
I told you I'm not!

299
00:20:31,354 --> 00:20:35,233
You didn't look at your phone once.
You didn't even take it out.

300
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:37,946
You must have left it at home.

301
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:40,238
You can look for it at home later.

302
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,121
Here, drink this.

303
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:05,513
Do you know how
a gazelle survives in the wild?

304
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:13,730
If a lion attacks even when it's sleeping,
it runs at its top speed immediately.

305
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:18,276
It's always tense even when sleeping,
so its muscles are ready.

306
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:24,199
<i>Being tense means you're fully prepared.</i>

307
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,453
<i>So, it's okay to be nervous.</i>

308
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,079
Nice!

309
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,057
Even so, one still dies...

310
00:21:52,435 --> 00:21:54,770
You're normally not last place, are you?

311
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,526
That's true.

312
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,903
Number 135, get ready.

313
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,315
Hey, Hee Su.

314
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,253
Thanks for that.

315
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,514
Chan Young.

316
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,648
Looks like you've got the hang of it.

317
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,065
- Yes.
- Prepare well for the next match too.

318
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,400
Yes, coach.

319
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,738
You should wear your uniform.
What is that?

320
00:22:42,738 --> 00:22:44,237
I'm sorry.

321
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,657
- Good job.
- Thank you.

322
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,682
Good job, everyone.

323
00:22:48,682 --> 00:22:51,643
- Thank you, coach.
- Goodbye.

324
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:57,544
[Did you do well?]

325
00:22:57,544 --> 00:23:00,469
[Are you done?]

326
00:23:10,805 --> 00:23:12,223
Hey!

327
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,143
Are you sleeping?

328
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,356
No, it's just the tension letting up.

329
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,608
I said we could just go home
if you were tired.

330
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:24,281
You helped, so we should eat.

331
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,490
Hey, the oil is splattering.

332
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,348
[Pass]

333
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,333
What will you do?

334
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:41,336
You can't text Chan Young
'cause you don't have your phone.

335
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,296
I can do it later.

336
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,925
Why? Do you want to do it for me?

337
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:47,845
Why should I?

338
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:50,053
You two still haven't made up?

339
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:59,187
I get it now.

340
00:24:00,525 --> 00:24:01,483
What?

341
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:04,608
Why Chan Young and Seung Won like you.

342
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,148
Don't do anything and sit still.

343
00:24:12,148 --> 00:24:14,285
I'm going to get the side dishes.

344
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,783
Where's Hee Su?

345
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:39,412
Oh? Where did he go?

346
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,182
<i>66 million years ago,</i>

347
00:26:04,182 --> 00:26:07,381
<i>a giant asteroid collided with Earth.</i>

348
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,986
<i>The dinosaurs vanished,</i>

349
00:26:11,986 --> 00:26:15,364
<i>and 75% of life on Earth went extinct.</i>

350
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:21,663
<i>But after a long time passed,</i>

351
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:25,500
<i>after the ice age,
the Earth warmed up again,</i>

352
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,615
<i>and completely new life forms appeared.</i>

353
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:32,590
<i>If the asteroid hadn't collided,</i>

354
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:36,094
<i>and if there hadn't been an ice age,</i>

355
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,448
<i>a new era wouldn't have come.</i>

356
00:26:41,606 --> 00:26:43,810
<i>Every beginning</i>

357
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,716

Did you tell him to break up with me?

427

If not, then why would he dump me?

428
00:33:52,202 --> 00:33:56,069
You follow him around and interfere
because you like him.

429

Confessing.

You never confessed.

449
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,227

Did you kick them out again?

460
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,048
No, I didn't.

461
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,800

going to keep this up?

- This.

mopes around after getting dumped.

00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,206
You didn't leave your room
for a week after you got dumped.

474
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:11,236
And then you're seeing him again?
Or are you? What's the deal?

475

If I want to see him again,
I'll see him ten or a hundred times.

Why not when I can?

481

But have you even done anything?

482

You threatened to break up all the time,

483
00:36:45,202 --> 00:36:47,624
and made him stand outside for hours,

484
00:36:47,624 --> 00:36:50,291

Spread out on the couch?

or are you just mad he dumped you?

00:43:20,169 --> 00:43:22,349
So... Where are you going?

542
00:43:23,202 --> 00:43:26,102
Oh, I was just...

543
00:43:26,102 --> 00:43:28,935
Class is about to start. Let's go.

544
00:43:28,935 --> 00:43:30,357
Yeah.

545
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:40,236
<i>But before I collide with the asteroid
and lose this world,</i>

546
00:43:40,236 --> 00:43:42,635
<i>I decided to do what I can.</i>

547
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:45,455
The carrot wants to meet me.

548
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,936
Yeah, I saw.

549
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,635
Are you going to go?

550
00:43:55,632 --> 00:43:59,901
<i>Right now, protecting my world
is more important.</i>

551
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:02,306
No.

552
00:44:03,765 --> 00:44:05,433
I'm not going.

553
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,022
Why not?

554
00:44:13,269 --> 00:44:15,502
There's someone I like.
