00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:09,030
You know about my mom,
my dad, my brother,

187
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,613
Ji Yu, tennis...

188
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,531
You know everything.

189
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,627
But why do I feel like
I don't know anything about you?

190
00:17:18,453 --> 00:17:20,037
Tell me.

191
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,593
True...

192
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:56,994
Hey.

193
00:17:59,026 --> 00:18:00,660
Isn't that your brother?

194
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,327
Why did you come?

195
00:18:10,327 --> 00:18:11,675
Did mom ask you to drag me home?

196
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:13,467
She doesn't even know I'm here.

197
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,594
I'm going back on the last train.

198
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:26,021
Use it for what you need.

199
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,727
There isn't much in it.

200
00:18:29,126 --> 00:18:31,327
I heard dad threw everything away.

201
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:33,987
You have a competition,
so you'll need money.

202
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,659
You don't have much money yourself.

203
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,327
You live on allowance.

204
00:18:40,993 --> 00:18:43,955
I work part-time. Tutoring and stuff.

205
00:18:43,955 --> 00:18:45,493
Wow.

206
00:18:45,493 --> 00:18:47,360
Dad will have a fit if he finds out.

207
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,544
He'll say the perfect med student
is wasting time.

208
00:18:49,544 --> 00:18:51,727
Mom and dad don't know.

209
00:18:53,393 --> 00:18:55,050
Why are you doing this?

210
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,848
Keep playing tennis.

211
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:03,683
If that's what you want to do.

212
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,360
I'm going to go now.

213
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,626
At least go home.
You shouldn't run away.

214
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,126
Did you drop money or what?
Why are you looking down like that?

215
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:22,060
Don't!

216
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,705
What? Why are you so down?

217
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:25,162
Because you!

218
00:19:26,926 --> 00:19:29,417
I got rejected because of you.

219
00:19:30,093 --> 00:19:33,259
I wasn't even thinking of confessing yet.

220
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,393
You did it on purpose, right?
You knew I'd get rejected!

221
00:19:39,393 --> 00:19:40,427
Nope.

222
00:19:40,427 --> 00:19:43,793
I assumed Seol Hee would like it.

223
00:19:43,793 --> 00:19:45,993
You're not bad.

224
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:48,436
That's weird...

225
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:55,318
You're not bad.

226
00:19:58,427 --> 00:19:59,740
Hey.

227
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,227
So, what do you like about me?

228
00:20:01,227 --> 00:20:02,327
It's a secret.

229
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:05,037
Come on, tell me.

230
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,456
Look at this, isn't it super cute?

231
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:10,501
You're cuter, of course.

232
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:14,339
- Don't you feel a sense of urgency?
- What?

233
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:17,051
The sense that you'll grow old
and die all alone?

234
00:20:18,327 --> 00:20:20,860
I really can't watch this anymore.

235
00:20:23,293 --> 00:20:26,393
What will you do?
Should I get you a blind date?

236
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:29,227
- Forget it.
- Forget what?

237
00:20:29,227 --> 00:20:31,354
You've heard about dying alone, right?

238
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:33,993
There is.

239
00:20:33,993 --> 00:20:35,316
What?

240
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,407
Someone I like.

241
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,827
Who?

242
00:20:49,956 --> 00:20:53,044
Who is it? Just tell me.
I won't do anything, I swear!

243
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,545
How could I not know?

244
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,160
At our school?
Is she in our class?

245
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,993
Enough!

246
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:02,760
Want something to eat? I'll treat.

247
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,126
How could you?
You're not even going to tell us?

248
00:21:06,126 --> 00:21:07,360
I will.

249
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,660
So, tell us!

250
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,063
I'll tell you in a bit, just a bit.

251
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:16,651
Oh boy! Don't! Don't say a word!

252
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:18,093
I won't listen!

253
00:21:18,093 --> 00:21:20,780
Hee Su, you're a traitor.

254
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,571
Let's go!

255
00:21:29,193 --> 00:21:30,665
Internet cafe and then fried chicken?

256
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:32,623
Yeah! My treat.

257
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:36,586
Sorry, didn't see you there.

258
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,630
Want to come with us?

259
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,259
We'll count you in
if you tell us who it is.

260
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,469
Forget it. I'm leaving.

261
00:21:45,393 --> 00:21:47,723
Gee, who is it?

262
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,850
Why is it so hard?

263
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,293
Just tell us.

264
00:21:51,293 --> 00:21:54,293
What's the big secret?
You've been struggling for days.

265
00:21:54,293 --> 00:21:55,860
What's the problem?

266
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,948
How is it so easy for you?

267
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,867
What?

268
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,869
I'm not like that.

269
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,494
It's not as easy for me
as it is for you.

270
00:22:13,427 --> 00:22:15,626
Some people are just like that.

271
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,493
Not everyone is like you.

272
00:22:18,493 --> 00:22:20,126
So...

273
00:22:20,126 --> 00:22:22,093
You should be able to tell me.

274
00:22:22,093 --> 00:22:23,301
Aren't I someone special?

275
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:24,970
I tell you everything.

276
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,428
Do you think it's easy for me?

277
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,093
I tell you because it's you.

278
00:22:28,093 --> 00:22:30,348
So why don't you tell me?

279
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,979
Forget it.

280
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,690
I guess that's all I am to you.

281
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,149
No...

282
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,200
Hey, Chan Young!

283
00:24:17,997 --> 00:24:19,957
I guess that's all I am to you.

284
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,171
<i>There's a black hole</i>

285
00:24:25,171 --> 00:24:27,173
<i>inside of me too.</i>

286
00:24:28,174 --> 00:24:32,762
<i>A deep, dark void
created by the secrets</i>

287
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:35,139
<i>piled up deep within.</i>

288
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:46,526
[I really have to stay up all night
because of a professor's experiment.]

289
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:49,094
[Go home, Hee Je.
I really can't go home today.]

290
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,643
Hee Su, just a moment.

291
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,939
A few minutes won't make you late, right?

292
00:25:24,939 --> 00:25:26,900
No, why?

293
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,361
Hee Je! Hee Sin!
Get up and come here.

294
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,228
What's going on?

295
00:25:33,228 --> 00:25:35,261
I have something to say.

296
00:25:35,261 --> 00:25:38,328
Hee Je! Hee Sin!
Hurry, I have to go.

297
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:40,862
What's so urgent this early?

298
00:25:40,862 --> 00:25:43,082
Come sit down.

299
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,716
I'm going to move out.

300
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,135
I'm quitting my job today.

301
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,805
Oh, that's gross!

302
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,261
You're quitting?

303
00:25:58,261 --> 00:25:59,295
Suddenly?

304
00:25:59,295 --> 00:26:01,893
Yeah, today's my last day.

305
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,562
- Why?
- I'm going to study abroad.

306
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:06,273
It's Hyo Seok.

307
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,690
Are you crazy?

308
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:10,662
- What's he to you that...
- It's not that.

309
00:26:10,662 --> 00:26:12,861
I want to study more.

310
00:26:13,762 --> 00:26:15,628
And back then...

311
00:26:15,628 --> 00:26:17,242
I didn't go.

312
00:26:18,628 --> 00:26:22,261
We agreed to go together,
but I didn't go.

313
00:26:22,261 --> 00:26:26,584
I said we should go,
then chickened out at the last minute.

314
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:30,046
He's suffering in another country because of me.

315
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:35,426
We're not dating again now,
and I don't know what will happen.

316
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,028
What a surprise.

317
00:26:40,695 --> 00:26:42,128
I just...

318
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,270
I think I can go now.

319
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,819
Anyway, I wanted to tell you.

320
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:56,614
I'll explain more in detail at dinner.
I'm going to work.

321
00:27:06,628 --> 00:27:08,162
Is it okay?

322
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,062
Sure.

323
00:27:12,662 --> 00:27:16,050
They're alright, but you'll be
a senior next year.

324
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:19,361
I thought maybe I should wait.

325
00:27:19,361 --> 00:27:22,307
You're not mom.
Don't worry about it.

326
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,892
Right?

327
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,229
Yeah.

328
00:27:29,962 --> 00:27:31,962
- Hey, sis.
- Yeah?

329
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:35,028
Aren't you scared?

330
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,446
Of what?

331
00:27:37,662 --> 00:27:39,395
Well...

332
00:27:39,395 --> 00:27:40,795
Everything.

333
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,995
Quitting your job now.

334
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:50,662
Starting over in a place
you don't know.

335
00:27:50,662 --> 00:27:52,528
A little?

336
00:27:52,528 --> 00:27:54,088
But still...

337
00:27:54,088 --> 00:27:57,132
At least I'll have someone to lean on.

338
00:27:57,717 --> 00:28:00,428
I thought you're not seeing him.

339
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:02,597
He's still my best friend.

340
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:06,059
It's over ten years if you include
before we dated.

341
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:10,562
He still knows me the best,
and I feel the most comfortable with him.

342
00:28:10,562 --> 00:28:13,441
Breaking up doesn't change that.

343
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,401
It really doesn't change?

344
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,989
Not everything stays the same,

345
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,028
but some things do.

346
00:28:22,825 --> 00:28:26,620
The most important part
of our relationship remains the same.

347
00:28:27,762 --> 00:28:29,562
What is that?

348
00:28:29,562 --> 00:28:31,329
That he's my best friend?

349
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:45,181
Summer, I mean, Ji Yu sings really well.

350
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:47,295
- Isn't she Ji Yu in class 4?
- Unbelievable.

351
00:28:47,295 --> 00:28:49,853
- This is Ji Yu?
- I even turned on notifications.

352
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,312
She has a totally different air.

353
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,814
She sings so well.

354
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,274
I turned on notifications.

355
00:28:57,834 --> 00:28:58,995
She's so good.

356
00:28:58,995 --> 00:29:00,740
- It's really Ji Yu.
- I know.

357
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,573
She sings well.

358
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:09,371
Ji Yu is incredibly versatile.

359
00:29:16,829 --> 00:29:18,381
Hey.

360
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,761
Hey!

361
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:23,295
Are you okay?

362
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:24,678
What?

363
00:29:25,695 --> 00:29:28,141
Do you know your video was released?

364
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,762
Yeah, I know.

365
00:29:29,762 --> 00:29:31,436
I uploaded it.

366
00:29:32,695 --> 00:29:34,856
I uploaded it last night.

367
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,495
You should have
turned on the notifications.

368
00:29:37,495 --> 00:29:39,328
Since you're here, take this.

369
00:29:39,328 --> 00:29:42,988
Seriously, worrying about you
is such a useless thing to do.

370
00:29:49,962 --> 00:29:51,362
I...

371
00:29:52,395 --> 00:29:54,459
I don't like her!

372
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,971
I really don't like her.

373
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,682
It's just that I'm her only friend.

374
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,476
I didn't say anything.

375
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,062
Well, I...

376
00:30:14,361 --> 00:30:16,063
I didn't want you to misunderstand.

377
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,858
What's to misunderstand?

378
00:30:32,538 --> 00:30:34,165
Is Ji Yu okay?

379
00:30:35,438 --> 00:30:37,772
Yeah, she uploaded it herself.

380
00:30:37,772 --> 00:30:39,712
She said to turn on notifications.

381
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,605
You know...

382
00:30:43,605 --> 00:30:45,802
I thought about what to do
for the festival.

383
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,346
What is it?

384
00:30:50,805 --> 00:30:52,850
I'll show you after school.

385
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:07,705
Chan Young.

386
00:31:07,705 --> 00:31:09,616
You're going up against me today.

387
00:31:10,505 --> 00:31:11,786
Yeah.

388
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:14,472
- You won doubles, right?
- Yeah.

389
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:15,998
Then just do that.

390
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,001
This is just a selection round.

391
00:31:19,001 --> 00:31:21,921
Let's not waste our energy
before the main tournament.

392
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,422
No.

393
00:31:26,338 --> 00:31:27,844
No?

394
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,572
Whether it's the selection round
or the main tournament,

395
00:31:30,572 --> 00:31:32,140
it's still a match.

396
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,505
Okay then.

397
00:31:33,505 --> 00:31:34,971
Give it your best shot.

398
00:31:50,705 --> 00:31:53,285
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

399
00:31:58,546 --> 00:32:00,250
15 - Love.

400
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,106
40 - Love.

401
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,584
Game over!

402
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,085
Wu Hyeok.

403
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:49,581
[Kang Wu Hyeok]
[Ju Chan Young]

404
00:32:56,098 --> 00:33:00,538
<i>When I heard you ran away,
I was actually happy about it.</i>

405
00:33:00,538 --> 00:33:03,314
And when you said you'd keep
playing tennis,

406
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,274
I was jealous.

407
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:08,471
<i>You're going to make something happen.</i>

408
00:33:08,471 --> 00:33:11,614
<i>You can continue to have expectations.</i>

409
00:33:12,405 --> 00:33:15,243
Do what you want.

410
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:19,273
<i>Don't worry about what to do later,
just think about what to do now.</i>

411
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,591
Okay.

412
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,638
15 - Love.

413
00:33:48,638 --> 00:33:50,277
Okay!

414
00:34:19,538 --> 00:34:21,391
What will you do here?

415
00:34:23,638 --> 00:34:25,038
Look.

416
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,610
Everyone has secrets.

417
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:37,283
But if you keep those secrets to yourself,

418
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:39,073
they pile up.

419
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:46,667
Then even small things become so big
that you can't handle them.

420
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:52,798
That's why everyone comes to me
for advice all the time.

421
00:34:52,798 --> 00:34:54,758
Because they want to talk.

422
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:00,711
But once they talk about it,

423
00:35:00,711 --> 00:35:03,078
it's not as big as deal as they thought.

424
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:07,405
So even if they just come
and talk about themselves,

425
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:10,072
they feel like their problems
will be solved.

426
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,272
In a dark place like this,

427
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,839
not knowing who the other person is,

428
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:35,838
you can tell your secrets to anyone.

429
00:35:36,438 --> 00:35:39,605
You tell anyone whatever you want.

430
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:43,372
Like a secret room?

431
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:46,810
Since everyone's anonymous,
there won't be any rumors.

432
00:36:05,438 --> 00:36:07,080
Do you...

433
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,291
have some?

434
00:36:11,072 --> 00:36:12,605
Secrets?

435
00:36:25,572 --> 00:36:26,938
Yeah.

436
00:36:28,405 --> 00:36:30,405
Now, I'm going to tell too.

437
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,983
<i>Before my secret swallows me up.</i>

438
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:38,448
<i>Before I fall...</i>

439
00:36:38,448 --> 00:36:40,757
<i>Into this dark hole forever.</i>

440
00:36:50,471 --> 00:36:52,835
Good job, good job.

441
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,044
- Gyeong Su.
- Yes.

442
00:36:54,044 --> 00:36:57,538
With Wu Hyeok, the list
for singles is set?

443
00:36:57,538 --> 00:36:58,905
Yes, coach.

444
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,677
Chan Young!

445
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:04,371
The doubles match is important too,
so prepare well.

446
00:37:04,371 --> 00:37:06,015
Yes, coach.

447
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:09,505
Alright, good job today. That's it.
Clean up and go home.

448
00:37:09,505 --> 00:37:11,339
- Thank you, coach.
- Okay.

449
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,162
When did you get here?

450
00:37:33,438 --> 00:37:34,938
A while ago...

451
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,964
When I was getting crushed?

452
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,305
Hey!

453
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,135
He's a good player.

454
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:46,638
I was on a long break,
so it can't be helped.

455
00:37:46,638 --> 00:37:50,059
Next season, I'll show you
how you really crush someone.

456
00:37:52,572 --> 00:37:54,611
Were you okay today?

457
00:37:54,611 --> 00:37:57,149
Did the kids talk about the video?

458
00:37:57,149 --> 00:38:00,110
It was chaos.

459
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,863
I regretted it so much.

460
00:38:03,872 --> 00:38:06,992
The third round is open anyway,

461
00:38:06,992 --> 00:38:10,572
I thought it'd be better for them
to know before that.

462
00:38:10,572 --> 00:38:12,039
I figured wrong.

463
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,249
There were so many comments.

464
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:19,713
Well, it would be great
if they voted for you later, right?

465
00:38:19,713 --> 00:38:21,840
I don't know.

466
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,052
Ah, how will I do the audition?

467
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,972
I've never sung
in front of people, you know.

468
00:38:29,471 --> 00:38:30,505
You can do it.

469
00:38:30,505 --> 00:38:31,562
How do you know?

470
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:34,419
I just know. You'll do really well.

471
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,979
[Hee Su]

472
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,413
<i>You tell anyone whatever you want.</i>

473
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,073
<i>Now, I'm going to tell too.</i>

474
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,360
<i>There's someone I have to tell first.</i>

475
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:29,241
Hee Su! Are you here?

476
00:39:32,786 --> 00:39:34,121
Why did you turn off the lights?

477
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,789
Just leave it.

478
00:39:40,085 --> 00:39:43,255
Hey, what is this?

479
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,572
I can't see anything.

480
00:39:45,572 --> 00:39:46,971
Yeah.

481
00:39:48,093 --> 00:39:50,804
That's the point, so don't turn it on.

482
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,565
I have something to tell you.

483
00:40:03,525 --> 00:40:07,105
But I just can't face you
when I tell you.

484
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,939
But I think I should still tell you.

485
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,660
What is it?

486
00:40:21,438 --> 00:40:24,272
I told you I like someone.

487
00:40:26,256 --> 00:40:28,634
I was going to confess.

488
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:31,470
But no matter how much I tried,
I couldn't find the words.

489
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,057
Why?

490
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,726
Why couldn't I say anything?

491
00:40:39,853 --> 00:40:41,871
But then I thought about it.

492
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,943
It was the first time
I ever had to say something like that.

493
00:40:50,572 --> 00:40:52,339
Isn't it weird?

494
00:40:54,505 --> 00:40:56,539
I'm eighteen.

495
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,957
And there's something
I never said before.

496
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,472
And then I realized,

497
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:13,470
there's something else
I never said before.

498
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,605
Something I didn't even tell you.

499
00:41:18,505 --> 00:41:21,698
I think that's why I couldn't say it.

500
00:41:21,698 --> 00:41:23,438
What is it?

501
00:41:23,438 --> 00:41:25,038
Tell me.

502
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:37,453
<i>This is my black hole.</i>

503
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,884
<i>A deep and dark hole</i>

504
00:41:39,884 --> 00:41:41,790
<i>that swallows...</i>

505
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,625
<i>everything.</i>

506
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,629
I liked you.

507
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,509
For quite a long time.

508
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:56,388
I liked you.
