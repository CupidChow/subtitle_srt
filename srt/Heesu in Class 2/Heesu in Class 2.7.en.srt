I've known her for a long time.
She even works part-time.

00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:24,822

00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:22,045
He already has a girlfriend.

183
00:15:24,918 --> 00:15:27,518
She's not that great.

184
00:15:27,518 --> 00:15:29,261
I'm better than her.

185
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,918
Why doesn't he know that?

186
00:15:31,918 --> 00:15:33,719
How can...

187
00:15:34,618 --> 00:15:36,268
nobody know that?

188
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,651
Why do you think nobody knows?

189
00:15:39,651 --> 00:15:42,718
Not knowing that is your problem.

190
00:15:42,718 --> 00:15:44,276
Wanna see?

191
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,785
Wanna see how amazing I am?

192
00:15:49,585 --> 00:15:52,117
Go and sleep.

193
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,746
Go to your room and sleep.
I said go to sleep!

194
00:15:58,651 --> 00:16:00,334
What will you show?

195
00:16:01,852 --> 00:16:03,378
What are you going to show?

196
00:16:03,378 --> 00:16:07,752
That I'm a really amazing woman.

197
00:16:07,752 --> 00:16:09,785
As you can see, this...

198
00:16:10,677 --> 00:16:11,985
This is how I look.

199
00:16:11,985 --> 00:16:13,585
I'm bright.

200
00:16:13,585 --> 00:16:15,718
I'm smart.

201
00:16:15,718 --> 00:16:18,018
- I'm intelligent!
- Hey!

202
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,020
That's all the same thing.

203
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,689
Anyway, I'm going to show him.

204
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,153
Hee Su, don't learn
anything from her, okay?

205
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,654
I'll show him.

206
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:33,785
<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear dad ♪</i>

207
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:38,205
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

208
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:41,041
Doesn't he speak really well?

209
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,294
Wow, really. I thought he was
an announcer or something.

210
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:47,552
- Hold on, there's a video where he does ABCD.
- ABCD!

211
00:16:47,552 --> 00:16:51,218
Yeah, he already knows the alphabet.

212
00:16:52,985 --> 00:16:56,014
Please, just one semester.

213
00:16:56,014 --> 00:16:58,519
Supervise the astronomy club
just once a week for one semester.

214
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,752
It doesn't add up to that many times.

215
00:17:00,752 --> 00:17:02,885
Instead, I'll do whatever
you ask me to do, really.

216
00:17:02,885 --> 00:17:05,190
I don't have anything to ask you to do.

217
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,785
Just come to school on time
and go home on time.

218
00:17:07,785 --> 00:17:09,487
I don't need anything else.

219
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,655
Oh, come on.

220
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:18,245
Listen, do you even have anyone else?

221
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,985
You know you can't have
a club by yourself.

222
00:17:19,985 --> 00:17:21,832
You need at least 6 people.

223
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:25,504
You need to gather five more besides you
before I can be an advisor or whatever.

224
00:17:25,504 --> 00:17:29,423
Yes! I'll gather them!
I'll gather about 50 people!

225
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,133
- I won't do it.
- Five.

226
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,218
Just five. I'll get them right away.

227
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,052
Whatever. Get lost.

228
00:17:35,052 --> 00:17:38,585
Okay! Thank you!
I'll be back!

229
00:17:38,585 --> 00:17:40,785
Ho Sik! Ho Sik!

230
00:17:41,651 --> 00:17:42,811
Join another club!

231
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,646
I'm too busy.

232
00:17:45,518 --> 00:17:48,275
It's astronomy club.
You only have to come once a week at night.

233
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,069
Don't do anything. Just show up.

234
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,655
You'll do it, right?
I'll fill out your form, okay?

235
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,615
I'll buy you fried chicken, deal?

236
00:17:56,752 --> 00:17:58,785
Who do you think I am?

237
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:03,085
Tell me. Who do you think I am?

238
00:18:03,085 --> 00:18:06,877
Do you think I'm some pathetic guy
who chases a girl he likes and knits,

239
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,752
hangs out at the Internet cafe
after school with nothing to do,

240
00:18:09,752 --> 00:18:14,426
and just goes along without any dream
if someone buys me fried chicken?

241
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,762
What? Is this a self-introduction?

242
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,785
Sure, you can think that.

243
00:18:20,785 --> 00:18:24,618
But did you ever think maybe I study hard
when you're not around,

244
00:18:24,618 --> 00:18:27,230
and I have my own life at night?

245
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,648
No.

246
00:18:33,785 --> 00:18:35,655
Right, I don't.

247
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,620
- I won't do it.
- Why not?

248
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,585
I have a disease where I can't stay
at school after sunset.

249
00:18:45,585 --> 00:18:49,961
If I'm at school after the sun
goes down, it hurts.

250
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:52,088
Plus I'm loyal to the knitting club.

251
00:18:52,752 --> 00:18:54,918
- Aren't you loyal to me?
- Nope.

252
00:18:54,918 --> 00:18:57,845
- Why are you suddenly acting up?
- What?

253
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:02,140
Why are you suddenly
making a fuss about starting a club?

254
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,142
To show.

255
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:06,603
Show what? To whom?

256
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,084
How is the recruiting going?

257
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:31,651
- What?
- The astronomy club.

258
00:19:31,651 --> 00:19:32,963
Did you get some members?

259
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,006
This isn't to show you.

260
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,093
Oh...

261
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,552
Oh, that's not what I meant.

262
00:19:45,016 --> 00:19:48,062
All right, check the matchups
for the selection round.

263
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,551
Yes, coach.

264
00:19:49,551 --> 00:19:51,523
- Louder!
- Yes, coach!

265
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,318
- There isn't much time left, so work hard.
- Yes, coach!

266
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,903
Clean up.
See you tomorrow. Dismissed!

267
00:19:56,903 --> 00:19:58,752
Yes, coach! Thank you.

268
00:19:58,752 --> 00:20:00,185
Good job.

269
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,079
- Chan Young.
- Yes, coach.

270
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,707
Stay back for a bit. Let's check your serve again.

271
00:20:09,551 --> 00:20:11,585
- Come on.
- Yes, coach.

272
00:20:35,618 --> 00:20:38,085
Hi. Are you done?

273
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:42,157
Oh, really?

274
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,908
When will you be done?

275
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,541
Did you see this?

276
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,752
Someone put it up in our spot,
so I took it down.

277
00:20:54,752 --> 00:20:58,297
Who keeps sticking stuff like this in our spot?

278
00:20:58,885 --> 00:21:01,885
Seriously, no manners.
They'd better hope I don't catch them.

279
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:02,985
Right?

280
00:21:02,985 --> 00:21:04,346
Still...

281
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,152
Really, no manners at all.

282
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:10,719
Oh, I'll be right back.

283
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,651
It's not like...

284
00:21:19,651 --> 00:21:21,551
we have anything to put up.

285
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:23,585
She didn't have to remove it.

286
00:21:24,818 --> 00:21:26,585
Should I join too?

287
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,412
We're allowed to do one more.

288
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,247
No, it's okay.

289
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:33,585
I can get five people today.
I've practically got all five.

290
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:35,352
Oh yeah?

291
00:21:38,618 --> 00:21:40,752
Well...

292
00:21:40,752 --> 00:21:44,852
You're going to study liberal arts.
This will be useless for you.

293
00:21:44,852 --> 00:21:47,097
It'll just be a waste of time.

294
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,850
Why is it a waste of time?

295
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,353
It's important to you.

296
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,699
Yeah...

297
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,786
It's important to me.

298
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,018
I know.

299
00:22:10,685 --> 00:22:12,538
I can help.

300
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,833
Just say so.

301
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,313
Hi, what?

302
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,648
Right now?

303
00:22:39,752 --> 00:22:41,185
For an hour?

304
00:22:42,918 --> 00:22:44,352
Okay.

305
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:49,868
I have to go.

306
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,746
- Ji Yu needs help with something.
- What?

307
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,585
Something she's filming.

308
00:22:55,585 --> 00:22:58,501
- Where are you going?
- To her house.

309
00:22:58,501 --> 00:22:59,920
Her house?

310
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,296
What is she filming?

311
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,714
I don't know.

312
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,069
Hey, we have a good camera at my house.

313
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:08,785
I'll bring it. Have her come here.

314
00:23:08,785 --> 00:23:10,119
It's okay. It's nothing that import...

315
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:12,390
Tell her to come here. I'll bring it.

316
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,060
- I said it's okay.
- Why!

317
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,187
Why is she asking you?

318
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,522
I told you she's managing a fish tank.

319
00:23:19,522 --> 00:23:21,941
- No...
- She's...

320
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,866
Look, I'll just bring it.

321
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,585
You're home early.

322
00:23:55,585 --> 00:23:57,051
Yeah.

323
00:24:03,752 --> 00:24:06,778
I'm just going to borrow this.
I'll bring it right back.

324
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:10,115
It's okay. Take it.

325
00:24:27,518 --> 00:24:29,009
Is something wrong?

326
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:32,512
No, just go about your business.

327
00:24:43,818 --> 00:24:46,067
You did it again, didn't you?

328
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:49,112
It's not wrong to like someone.

329
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:53,408
It's not a crime to tell someone
you like them.

330
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,995
He has a girlfriend.

331
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:57,162
I know.

332
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,852
So I only told him.

333
00:24:59,852 --> 00:25:00,853
And?

334
00:25:00,853 --> 00:25:03,085
His girlfriend came after me.

335
00:25:03,852 --> 00:25:05,718
I didn't tell her I liked her.

336
00:25:05,718 --> 00:25:08,618
You should've waited
until they broke up.

337
00:25:08,618 --> 00:25:10,216
I'd like to!

338
00:25:10,216 --> 00:25:12,052
Do you think I want to be
rejected all the time?

339
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,618
I'm not the neighborhood punching bag!

340
00:25:14,618 --> 00:25:16,056
But I...

341
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:21,018
I can't hold back.
I just can't!

342
00:25:22,376 --> 00:25:25,066
<i>Can't... hold back.</i>

343
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:28,777
You still didn't return
the other one you borrowed.

344
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,111
Sorry.

345
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:35,118
- Should I?
- I don't want that.

346
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:37,202
Hey, we have a good camera at my house.

347
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,496
Tell her to come here. I'll bring it.

348
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:48,922
That's crazy.

349
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,340
What?

350
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,453
Me?

351
00:25:58,618 --> 00:25:59,974
Hey.

352
00:26:01,585 --> 00:26:02,977
Me?!

353
00:26:04,852 --> 00:26:07,085
Did you just say I'm crazy?!

354
00:26:14,113 --> 00:26:15,949
How about this?

355
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,662
Not that great?
Should I just wear the other one?

356
00:26:17,662 --> 00:26:19,228
Oh, come on!

357
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,206
Okay, okay.

358
00:26:26,329 --> 00:26:27,586
Does my face look alright?

359
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,963
Yeah. This is the first round
of the audition?

360
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,395
Yeah.

361
00:26:31,395 --> 00:26:34,592
The second round is the judges,
and performances start from the third.

362
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:37,177
Why did you call me
instead of your boyfriend?

363
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,629
My boyfriend?

364
00:26:39,629 --> 00:26:43,142
You mean the boyfriend I have
to date secretly because of you?

365
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,394
Well...

366
00:26:46,262 --> 00:26:48,064
What secret? Everyone who needs
to know already knows.

367
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:50,358
My sentiments exactly.

368
00:26:57,329 --> 00:26:59,367
You know Hee Su knows, right?

369
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,596
You've seen how he's been
treating me, right?

370
00:27:06,596 --> 00:27:09,529
It's because he still thinks
you like me.

371
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:11,215
Sort it out.

372
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:14,499
Confess your feelings or, let them go.

373
00:27:16,295 --> 00:27:17,996
About that...

374
00:27:19,496 --> 00:27:21,723
You chose natural sciences.

375
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,929
I heard you're recruiting for a club.

376
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:34,395
- Yeah.
- Where's the application form?

377
00:27:34,395 --> 00:27:35,612
You want to join?

378
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,655
I heard you need people.

379
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:39,363
You need five.

380
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:45,538
Seung Won.

381
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,162
Did you tell her?

382
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,459
Yeah.

383
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,676
Do you even know what it is?

384
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,970
Yeah, the astronomy club.

385
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,890
Looking at stars, right?

386
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,851
What's going on?
What are you doing?

387
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,062
She's applying to natural sciences.

388
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,066
Did you ask her?

389
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:16,653
- It wasn't like it was a favor...
- Can't he ask?

390
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,530
You need people and I owe...

391
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,363
Exactly!

392
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,079
Are you helping him

393
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,623
so you can just call him
anytime you need him?

394
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,541
Hey, what's wrong with you?

395
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:32,529
Don't you think it's strange?

396
00:28:32,529 --> 00:28:35,004
She's only using Seung Won
when she needs something.

397
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:37,562
She's managing a fish tank
when the person she's seeing is...

398
00:28:37,562 --> 00:28:39,050
Seung Won, you'd better speak up.

399
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,510
It's not her fault.

400
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,428
She can't help it if Seung Won likes her.

401
00:28:42,428 --> 00:28:45,295
It's not like that. Stop it.

402
00:28:45,295 --> 00:28:48,852
- I hate that you like my girlfriend.
- Hey...

403
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:52,897
Seung Won, you know, right?
That I'm dating Ji Yu?

404
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,359
Chan Young.

405
00:28:58,763 --> 00:29:00,613
You selfish bastard.

406
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:06,827
What's his problem?

407
00:29:07,429 --> 00:29:09,962
What's going on?
What's this strange vibe?

408
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:15,878
Hey, what's going on?
What is it?

409
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,363
You okay?

410
00:29:48,494 --> 00:29:49,954
Sorry.

411
00:29:51,295 --> 00:29:53,583
What are you sorry about?
I'm the one who's sorry.

412
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:56,085
I was going to tell you
about Ji Yu and Chan Young, but...

413
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:59,255
It's okay. Really.

414
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:00,840
It doesn't matter.

415
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,552
Are you okay?

416
00:30:14,937 --> 00:30:17,064
<i>It's a complete mess.</i>

417
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:34,292
You're coming home early these days.
Aren't you seeing Jong Gu?

418
00:30:34,292 --> 00:30:35,804
Forget him.

419
00:30:35,804 --> 00:30:37,793
What do you think of this?

420
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,091
What the...

421
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:49,432
We broke up. It's partly your fault.

422
00:30:49,432 --> 00:30:53,601
Shouldn't you at least buy me dinner?
Or a drink?

423
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,602
Oh boy, what should I do?

424
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,024
Oh, don't!

425
00:30:58,024 --> 00:30:59,151
Who is it?

426
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:00,817
A new guy.

427
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:08,325
<i>I hate Ji Yu.</i>

428
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:10,660
<i>And I'm mad at Chan Young.</i>

429
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:14,247
<i>But no matter
how much I think about it,</i>

430
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:17,284
<i>I can't find a good reason.</i>

431
00:31:17,284 --> 00:31:18,702
Hee Su!

432
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:21,170
Let's go.

433
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:25,676
Slow down a bit.

434
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:28,276
Look, there's another one!
Did you see it?

435
00:31:37,901 --> 00:31:40,481
<i>There are plenty...</i>

436
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,858
<i>of unreasonable reasons.</i>

437
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,779
<i>But ignoring them...</i>

438
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,614
<i>is no use.</i>

439
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,059
Why did you bring that?

440
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:20,354
To show everyone later tonight.
Club promotion.

441
00:32:22,773 --> 00:32:24,357
Good things...

442
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:27,319
You can tell when you see them.

443
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:42,216
Excuse me.

444
00:32:42,216 --> 00:32:45,450
Is this where we can see stars?

445
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:46,882
Yeah, that's right.

446
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:48,350
Just stay here?

447
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,349
Yeah, just a minute.

448
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,140
There, take a look.

449
00:33:01,116 --> 00:33:03,016
Let me see too.

450
00:33:06,817 --> 00:33:09,487
What you're seeing now is Jupiter.

451
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,948
Today, you can also see Saturn.

452
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,517
Excuse me for a sec.

453
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,166
There, take another look.

454
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,465
Can I see too?

455
00:33:31,133 --> 00:33:32,635
I'll wait my turn.

456
00:33:39,516 --> 00:33:40,976
All set.

457
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,850
What you're seeing now is Lyra.

458
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,849
The bright star up top is Vega.

459
00:33:51,849 --> 00:33:54,782
It's the brightest star
you can see in summer.

460
00:33:56,951 --> 00:34:01,038
Then what's that ring-like thing in between?

461
00:34:02,283 --> 00:34:03,833
You can see that?

462
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,417
Yeah, look.

463
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:13,467
This usually isn't visible.

464
00:34:14,183 --> 00:34:15,846
That's called the Ring Nebula.

465
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:18,013
It's the remnants of a dead star.

466
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,749
A star dies?

467
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,353
Then what happens next?

468
00:34:26,772 --> 00:34:29,734
What happens after a star dies?

469
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,584
Is that it?

470
00:34:34,613 --> 00:34:36,716
Does it completely vanish?

471
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,916
<i>What happens next is...</i>

472
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:45,791
<i>the remnants of the star
disperse in space.</i>

473
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:49,462
<i>Some wander in space forever,</i>

474
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,797
<i>some vanish,</i>

475
00:34:51,797 --> 00:34:53,749
<i>and some...</i>

476
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:56,676
<i>become new stars.</i>

477
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,351
<i>Even after the feeling
of liking someone ends,</i>

478
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:06,103
<i>some of it remains as a memory,</i>

479
00:35:07,217 --> 00:35:09,184
<i>some is forgotten,</i>

480
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:11,900
<i>and some...</i>

481
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,821
<i>become a new heart.</i>

482
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:19,366
<i>Once again...</i>

483
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,080
<i>it becomes a feeling of liking someone.</i>

484
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,956
It doesn't vanish.

485
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,028
It becomes a different star.
