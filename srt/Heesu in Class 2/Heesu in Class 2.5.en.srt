Everyone knows that Chan Young dumped me.

43
00:04:47,622 --> 00:04:52,388
Even kids at other schools know.
It's so humiliating.

44
00:04:52,388 --> 00:04:56,547
Chan Young is famous
for letting girls come and go.

45
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:58,716
So why did he dump me?

46

If not, then why would he dump me?

53

You follow him around and interfere

That's not by yourself.
We're going the same way.

<i>Do people get mad because I'm different?</i>

90

<i>Or does the thought of being different
make them uncomfortable?</i>

91

92
00:07:57,155 --> 00:08:00,388

I have to do something.

109
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,813
Leave the racket.

110
00:09:52,716 --> 00:09:54,927
You're a smart kid.

111
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,889
Think realistically.

112
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:59,517
The top players are already
playing at the top.

113
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:01,519
You're at the bottom
no matter what you do now.

114
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,894
You may think that.

115
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,579
But I don't.

127
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,598
Yes, coach.

128

When did you get here?

131
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:23,990
I've been watching you

132
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,853
I guess you saw everything.

133
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,021
How embarrassing.

134
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,607
No reason to get embarrassed.

135
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,626
All I saw was you getting totally beaten.

136
00:11:37,821 --> 00:11:39,988
Come on, I'm just kidding.

137
00:11:41,783 --> 00:11:44,286
I came early because I hardly
ever get to see you.

138

I'm just not feeling that great today.

139

Aren't you pushing yourself too hard?

Pushing myself?

00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,122
What do you mean?

143
00:12:01,122 --> 00:12:03,516
You're suddenly working so hard...

144
00:12:03,516 --> 00:12:05,599
I should at least work hard.

145
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,976
Even if I do, I get beaten.

146
00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:09,255
Hey...

147
00:12:09,255 --> 00:12:11,272
You do everything well,
so you wouldn't know.

00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,900
Working hard...

149
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,188
It might seem a bit lame,
but that's how most people live.

150
00:12:17,188 --> 00:12:21,298
Not everyone can do well
even if they do it easily like you.

151
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,688
Yeah?

152
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,680
Did it seem easy to you?

153
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,228
You think you're the only one
who has it rough?

154
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,722
I'm not mad.

155
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,855
Did you come early?

156
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,521
Yeah.

Yeah, you.

163
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:08,680
I'm busy.

164
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,221
Doing something.

165
00:14:11,933 --> 00:14:13,643
Want to hang out?

166
00:14:13,643 --> 00:14:14,688
Let's watch a movie.

167
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,412
- No.
- Sure!

168
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:20,250
Okay, Seung Won will be there too.

169
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:32,367
Doesn't it seem like
Ji Yu is a bit interested in you?

170
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:34,499
See? The academy is a game-changer, right?

171
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:37,233
You have to keep seeing
each other's faces.

What?

175
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,238
Just asking. Are you okay?

176
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,646
Hey, I'm not going to go.

177
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:01,108
I won't make it 'cause something's
suddenly going to come up at home.

- So have fun.
- That's not it...

179
00:15:05,028 --> 00:15:07,171
If you don't go, then I won't go.

00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:11,118
Hey, you can't do that.

181
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,621
Make an effort.

00:32:46,925 --> 00:32:49,802
So, you're home alone?
Where's your mom?

362
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:52,008
She's on a business trip.

363
00:32:52,008 --> 00:32:54,608
Where were you going
to use the bathroom?

364
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:59,541
The convenience store or subway station?

365
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,831
I'm going to go now. Thanks.

366
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:08,210
Hey, sleep over.

367
00:33:09,111 --> 00:33:12,406
Your place is flooded.
You can't even use the bathroom.

368
00:33:12,406 --> 00:33:15,493
What will you do in the morning?
Sleep here.

369
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:18,287
Why is it so loud?

370
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,582
I'm sorry.

371
00:33:19,582 --> 00:33:21,290
You surprised me.

372
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,211
My friend who lives next door, Seung Won.

373
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:24,935
He's sleeping over.

374
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:30,357
What a handsome guy.
Keep it down though.

375
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,636
What's wrong with her?

376
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,341
Let's go.

377
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,306
Come on.

378
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,320
Your mom's away on business?

379
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,974
Yeah, she'll be back next week.

380
00:33:50,974 --> 00:33:52,280
What about your dad?

381
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,156
He's not around.

382
00:33:54,156 --> 00:33:55,758
I just have two moms.

383
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,307
Is that possible?

384
00:34:02,074 --> 00:34:03,608
Hold on.

385
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,310
So, that picture...

386
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:09,421
So what...

387
00:34:09,421 --> 00:34:12,508
Is it like your birth mom
and the mom who raised you?

388
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,359
Is it a birth secret?

389
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,724
- Are you a trust fund kid?
- Is this a soap opera?

390
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:19,515
Then what?

391
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:22,326
My mom and her lover.

392
00:34:25,771 --> 00:34:27,664
That's even crazier...

393
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:33,373
She's been living with my mom
for about a year since the divorce.

394
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:37,408
That's insane.

395
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,908
Sorry, I didn't mean...

396
00:34:40,908 --> 00:34:42,974
It is pretty insane.

397
00:34:54,466 --> 00:34:56,473

398
00:34:59,471 --> 00:35:01,106

399
00:35:02,349 --> 00:35:04,117

401
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:12,319
What's not to be okay?

402
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:15,044
They live together
'cause they like each other.

403
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,883
Yeah?

404
00:35:21,535 --> 00:35:25,674
It's much better than living
with someone you don't like.

405

just for being myself,</i>

<i>I'm meeting someone.</i>

414
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,440
Find me a high schooler

415
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,607
who prepares breakfast and dinner
when he has three sisters.

416
00:36:42,607 --> 00:36:45,413
It's not breakfast and dinner.
You're responsible for dinner.

417
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:48,374
But you skipped dinner yesterday,
so you're making breakfast now.

418
00:36:48,374 --> 00:36:50,166
That's right.

419
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,211
I should go live with mom.

420
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:55,171
If you think it's unfair,
just pay rent, right?

421
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:59,550
If our youngest contributes,
our lives would be a bit richer, right?

422
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,263
Do you want to say that
to your adorable youngest brother?

423
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,475
- Did you sleep well?
- Good morning.

424
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:06,774
Oh, Hee Su's friend!

425
00:37:06,774 --> 00:37:10,561
We met last night. Come here.
We're about to eat breakfast.

426

Hee Su has a knack for making
friends with good-looking guys, right?

427

Nobody's stopping you.

430
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:26,785
If you miss mom that much,
I said I'd get you a ticket.

431
00:37:26,785 --> 00:37:28,386
One way, of course.

432
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,332
Where's your mom?

433
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:35,185
China. Dad got assigned
to a Chinese branch, so they're there.

434
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,758

- No.

Alright! Two for me.

00:37:45,095 --> 00:37:47,433
- Do you want another one?
- No, it's okay.

439

- Take care of me.
- Eat your own.

440
00:37:49,602 --> 00:37:51,770
- What's your name?
- Kim Seung Won.

441
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,105
Seung Won?

442
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:55,163
- Same class?
- Yes.

443
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:58,194
- He's the class president.
- Oh? He is?

444
00:37:58,194 --> 00:38:00,903
You must have great leadership skills.

445
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:03,531
- Ranked 2nd in school.
- 2nd in the entire school?

446
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,744
You get good grades too.
Come over often and study together.

447
00:38:06,744 --> 00:38:08,577
- Eat a lot.
- Yeah, eat up.

448
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:09,997
- That's mine!
- No, no.

449
00:38:09,997 --> 00:38:11,997

- Split it.
