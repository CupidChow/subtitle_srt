Come on. You're going to eat
something anyway.

154
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,894
Should I call my sister
and tell her to have it ready?

155
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,980
I can't. I really have to go.

Yeah.

160

But you like it.

161
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:14,215
Hee Su, that's enough.

162
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,091
That's far enough.

163
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:19,386
It's my business. I'll handle it.

164
00:11:19,386 --> 00:11:22,473

so accommodating,</i>

165

You didn't come when I asked.

You should've come sooner.

178

You don't go to academies.

You said it's a waste of time.

184
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:32,084
Yeah, it is.

185
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,868
Then why are you here?

186
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,206
Because of you.

187
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,711
It's like... I have this crush on you.

188
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,005
What the heck?

189
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:49,643
Do Seung Won and Ji Yu know each other?

190
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:52,538
Yeah, they're really close.

191
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,778
Alright, let's take a 10-minute break
and then we'll continue.

192
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,905
Yes, ma'am.

193
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,749
Ji Yu.

194
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,867
Wanna go to the convenience store?

195
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:16,369
Let's go to the store.

196
00:13:19,923 --> 00:13:23,594
I wanna go too!
Let's all go together.

197
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,388
Seung Won, you come too.

198
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:28,674
I'm good, you guys go ahead.

199
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,276
Hey! What are you doing?

200
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,695
What? What's wrong?

201
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,980
You should've said something...

202
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,993
Never mind, forget it.

203
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,872
Get something for Ji Yu.

204
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:51,914
Are you done?

205
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,375
Yeah, I'm all set.

206
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:58,438
Alright, remember there's a pop quiz
before class next week.

207
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,877
Wanna go get some ramyeon?

208
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,297
Did you come here to eat?

209
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:12,935
I'm in the growing phase.
Gotta hit 190cm.

210
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,479
Lee Hee Su, Kim Seung Won,

211
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,190
stop by the office
and fill out forms before you leave.

212
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,234
Okay.

213
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,269
I'm hungry...

214
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,905
Hey, you'll wait, right?

215
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,398
I'm gonna go. See you tomorrow.

216
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,735
Thanks a lot.

217
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,564
Here.

218
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,033
What's this?

219
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:12,870
Concert tickets. It's next Friday.

220
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,957
Oh, are you planning to go with Ji Yu?

221
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:20,327
Seung Won! You have your own plans, huh?

222
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,007
Yeah, but if she can't go,
you have to go.

223
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,175
Why?

224
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,636
I can't go alone.

225
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:30,388
If I fail, you should be responsible.

226
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:33,224
What kind of twisted logic is that?

227
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,072
Oh, right.

228
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,061
Here.

229
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:41,098
Ji Yu doesn't drink that.
You can have it.

230
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:45,361
Did you buy this for her?

231
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,854
You're hopeless.

232
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,621
You need to step it up.

233
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:59,249
She's a model student, a diamond spoon,
and super popular.

234
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,292
Says who?

235
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,252
You're the only one who doesn't know.

236
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,412
She's got it all except a nice personality.

237
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,257
Yeah?

238
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,885
She lacks a nice personality?

239
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:13,305
I'm sure you don't think so.

240
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,640
Hey.

241
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,308
I'm rooting for you.

242
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,851
I said I'd help you.

243
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,970
So you should make an effort too!

244
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:24,390
What about you?

245
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,277
The carrot juice...

246
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,480
- You still don't know who it is?
- Don't change the subject!

247
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,859
I'm just wondering...

248
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,416
Almost done?

249
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,460
Yes, I just have to finish this.

250
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,714
Good job. Balancing studying
and a part-time job must be tough.

251
00:16:47,714 --> 00:16:49,384
All I do is close up.

252
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,969
It's only two hours a day,
so it's kind of a sweet gig.

253
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,926
That's good to hear.

254
00:16:55,827 --> 00:16:57,015
I'm going to go now.

255
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,708
Okay, take care!

256
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,327
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

257
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,664
[Mom: At the academy? Should I come pick you up?]

258
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:53,314
[#FavoriteSong #Practicing Listen along!
Summer]

259
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,498
[Love the song, I'm going to sue you
for stealing my heart]

260
00:18:03,498 --> 00:18:05,250
[I love you, Summer]

261
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,171
[Thanks for a great song once again!]

262
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:09,579
[Summer: I'm doing it because I want to]

263
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,519
Impressive.

264
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,286
'I'm doing it because I want to.'

265
00:18:46,452 --> 00:18:49,719
- Where are we going?
- Just hurry up.

266
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:50,754
I have a lot to do.

267
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,341
You can't get Ji Yu
if you make time for everything else.

268
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,619
I...

269
00:18:54,619 --> 00:18:57,844
Where's the concert ticket? Where is it?

270
00:18:57,844 --> 00:18:59,420
Hey!

271
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,799
What's wrong with you?

272
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:11,557
I don't have it with me right now.

273
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,906
Gee, keep it on you!

274
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:17,781
Hey, there's Ji Yu. It's Ji Yu.

275
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,410
- You got the ticket? Ask her.
- Now?

276
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,861
Yes, now! You want to go next year?

277
00:19:23,452 --> 00:19:25,453
Go, go!

278
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:29,985
Hey.

279
00:19:34,386 --> 00:19:36,086
What's this?

280
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,049
You don't have it?

281
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,185
- It's so sudden.
- What's wrong with you?

282
00:19:53,185 --> 00:19:54,919
Sorry...

283
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:57,519
Why didn't you ask her?
Why, why, why?!

284
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:59,981
Well, it's...

285
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,019
Can I really leave?

286
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,543
- Yeah.
- You know, you're acting so weird.

287
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,486
We'll talk later. Just hurry up and go!

288
00:20:14,486 --> 00:20:16,119
Okay.

289
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,666
Thanks.

290
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,636
Do you...

291
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,367
Do you actually like me?

292
00:20:37,552 --> 00:20:39,687
Just go already.

293
00:20:40,552 --> 00:20:43,200
Right? Yeah.

294
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,386
See you.

295
00:20:45,386 --> 00:20:46,986
Oh, Ji Yu.

296
00:20:48,586 --> 00:20:50,916
Are you popular?

297
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,619
They say you're a diamond spoon
and you're really popular.

298
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,089
But you're not a diamond spoon.

299
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:58,381
Oh, Seung Won. Did you make a friend?

300
00:20:58,381 --> 00:21:00,586
That's just gossip.

301
00:21:00,586 --> 00:21:02,552
That diamond spoon...

302
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:05,619
Does it include a deadbeat dad
who doesn't pay child support?

303
00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:07,386
Probably not.

304
00:21:08,219 --> 00:21:09,985
Too bad.

305
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,188
It's a diamond,

306
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,319
but it's tarnished.

307
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:17,150
- Right?
- Yeah.

308
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,519
And yeah, I'm kinda popular.

309
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:21,187
You just don't know it.

310
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,574
What?

311
00:21:33,386 --> 00:21:35,052
What is it?

312
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:40,619
No, it's not that.

313
00:21:40,619 --> 00:21:42,333
It's not what?

314
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:49,516
He has something to give you.

315
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:50,519
Where is it?

316
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,385
Come on.

317
00:21:57,486 --> 00:21:58,900
<i>Oh, no...</i>

318
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,952
What are you guys doing?

319
00:22:02,285 --> 00:22:03,653
I'm so sorry.

320
00:22:03,653 --> 00:22:06,941
Yeah, sorry. It's nothing.

321
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,460
Are you okay?

322
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,212
<i>It's the worst.</i>

323
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:28,046
You really!

324
00:22:29,452 --> 00:22:31,266
Are you close with Ji Yu?

325
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,884
- Super close!
- Huh?

326
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:50,319
Want to hit the convenience store?

327
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:52,086
You want to eat again?

328
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,886
You guys go ahead.

329
00:22:57,886 --> 00:22:59,452
No ramyeon?

330
00:22:59,452 --> 00:23:01,829
Nope. Not for me.

331
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:12,586
Looks like you'll have to go to the concert.

332
00:23:12,586 --> 00:23:14,509
Do you like hip-hop?

333
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:17,062
Are you serious?!

334
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,639
I laid out the perfect setup for you!

335
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:24,852
Honestly, it wasn't perfectly set up.
You just pushed me into it.

336
00:23:26,386 --> 00:23:28,198
Yeah, fair enough.

337
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:31,252
I can't even set up my own stuff.

338
00:23:31,252 --> 00:23:34,404
If you ask me,
I think we're both doomed.

339
00:23:35,252 --> 00:23:37,123
Yeah?

340
00:23:37,123 --> 00:23:38,686
I think I've got a shot.

341
00:23:38,686 --> 00:23:40,653
No, you're wrong.

342
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:44,872
You and me? Single forever.
It's a done deal. Case closed.

343
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:50,961
Let's just do magic tricks together
when we hit 30, huh?

344
00:24:00,855 --> 00:24:02,653
Doesn't that hurt?

345
00:24:02,653 --> 00:24:04,252
It hurts.

346
00:24:36,891 --> 00:24:38,685
Normal People.

347
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:41,804
That song by Summer
was inspired by this book.

348
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,978
Ji Yu!

349
00:24:53,352 --> 00:24:56,152
I told you Summer's a genius, didn't I?

350
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,319
What if I said it's not me?

351
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:07,653
I know it's you.

352
00:25:07,653 --> 00:25:09,624
This is pretty common.

353
00:25:10,341 --> 00:25:13,179
The same bracelet and same voice
aren't common though.

354
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,945
It's not me.

355
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:20,386
You're pretty amazing.

356
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,563
It's a secret, okay?

357
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,732
How are you good at everything?

358
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,642
Didn't you say I'm a genius?

359
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,819
Geez.

360
00:25:30,819 --> 00:25:33,119
I work ridiculously hard.

361
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,658
Why?

362
00:25:35,658 --> 00:25:36,951
Why what?

363
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:38,829
Why work ridiculously hard?

364
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:41,653
You don't have to.

365
00:25:41,653 --> 00:25:43,419
Good question.

366
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,127
Just because I like it.

367
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,287
I'm good at it too.

368
00:25:49,653 --> 00:25:51,552
You're so arrogant.

369
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:53,885
It's a fact that I'm good at it.

370
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,419
Even if I weren't, I'd still do it.

371
00:25:56,419 --> 00:25:59,518
You seriously have personality issues.

372
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:02,685
No, I don't. I have a great personality.

373
00:26:02,685 --> 00:26:06,151
I'm just good at prioritizing
and focusing than others.

374
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:10,619
I focus on the people who matter to me.

375
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:13,012
- How does that work?
- What?

376
00:26:13,012 --> 00:26:15,422
Being a person that matters to you.

377
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,952
It's not easy.

378
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:21,955
I'm good at the not easy stuff.

379
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,748
- Chan Young!
- Yes.

380
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,658
Have you thought about it?

381
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:30,152
Why don't you give me an answer?

382
00:26:30,152 --> 00:26:31,653
Come here.

383
00:26:31,653 --> 00:26:34,319
Go on. I have to go.

384
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:35,519
Yeah.

385
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:37,419
Thanks for the bracelet.

386
00:26:43,452 --> 00:26:44,686
Is this the power of love?

387
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:47,252
Don't talk to me. I need to focus.

388
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,620
- You dropped a stitch.
- Where?

389
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,112
I'm kidding. Dummy.

390
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:56,252
Aw, come on! What's her problem?

391
00:26:56,252 --> 00:26:57,949
Were you late?

392
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:02,552
No, the gym teacher
held me up this morning.

393
00:27:02,552 --> 00:27:05,152
- Tennis?
- Whatever.

394
00:27:06,486 --> 00:27:09,253
Hey, what are you doing tonight?

395
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:11,329
If you're free, wanna come over?

396
00:27:19,653 --> 00:27:21,380
Who's there!

397
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,753
- Jong Gu?
- Hee Je.

398
00:27:26,753 --> 00:27:28,438
Oh, you're Hee Su.

399
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,139
You're doing this again?

400
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,719
I got a cramp.

401
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,453
Help me up.

402
00:27:38,786 --> 00:27:40,553
Ugh, my legs.

403
00:27:47,219 --> 00:27:48,886
Here, drink this.

404
00:27:48,886 --> 00:27:50,453
Thanks.

405
00:27:51,352 --> 00:27:53,922
How long were you sitting there?

406
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:57,258
Not long, maybe three hours?

407
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,760
Three hours?!

408
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,672
Three hours is nothing.
I waited more than ten before.

409
00:28:04,275 --> 00:28:05,486
Listen.

410
00:28:05,486 --> 00:28:08,686
What are you lacking to date my sister?

411
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:11,319
She's got a terrible temper
and she's a gangster.

412
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:12,919
Right?

413
00:28:13,653 --> 00:28:15,553
Oh, gangster.

414
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:22,552
Jong Gu, just find someone else
and start over.

415
00:28:22,552 --> 00:28:24,369
You're a great person.

416
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,686
I'll admire you
even if you break up with my sister.

417
00:28:27,686 --> 00:28:29,407
Hee Su.

418
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,419
She's cute.

419
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,786
The gangster's so cute
and she's like a hamster, isn't she?

420
00:28:34,786 --> 00:28:36,258
Oh, gross.

421
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:38,486
She's so cute.

422
00:28:38,486 --> 00:28:40,293
Oh, it's Hee Je.

423
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:44,653
Seriously. Think it through
one more time before it's too late.

424
00:28:44,653 --> 00:28:45,807
- Hee Je
- Jong Gu...

425
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:49,353
Huh? Why are you guys here together?

426
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,452
My question exactly.

427
00:28:52,452 --> 00:28:54,252
I'm leaving.

428
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,152
I missed you.

429
00:29:01,686 --> 00:29:03,352
Stop!

430
00:29:03,352 --> 00:29:04,952
Stop.

431
00:29:08,162 --> 00:29:10,114
Chan Young! Up here!

432
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,720
- I saw your sister on the way here.
- Which one?

433
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,591
The second one. She was at the park.

434
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,311
She's still there?

435
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,486
She was with her boyfriend.

436
00:29:33,486 --> 00:29:37,352
She's been with that guy
for ages, hasn't she?

437
00:29:37,352 --> 00:29:39,152
Yeah.

438
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:42,947
In my opinion, relationships are poison.

439
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,519
They make people stupid.

440
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:46,233
What the...

441
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:50,872
But they say it's nice,
so what can you do?

442
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,949
You figure it must be.

443
00:29:57,686 --> 00:29:59,964
I'm simply saying.

444
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,135
Just like what you like.

445
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:04,368
At least tennis isn't a gangster.

446
00:30:04,368 --> 00:30:06,420
What are you talking about?

447
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:15,486
Remember when you first started swimming?

448
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:23,490
You said you'd rather die.

449
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,486
If you got compared to your brother.

450
00:30:25,486 --> 00:30:29,786
But I forced you to go
saying I'd go with you.

451
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,154
So you went there crying. Remember?

452
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,386
I remember.

453
00:30:36,386 --> 00:30:38,878
And I think it was in the 5th grade.

454
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:41,352
You pretended to be sick
to skip the school trip.

455
00:30:41,352 --> 00:30:44,177
Do you remember that my mom drove you?

456
00:30:44,177 --> 00:30:46,344
I said I wouldn't go if you didn't go.

457
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,952
Yeah.

458
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,674
Gee, you're such a pain.

459
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:56,345
But do you remember who was
the most excited back then?

460
00:30:57,419 --> 00:30:59,523
Me.

461
00:30:59,523 --> 00:31:01,100
Exactly.

462
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:09,160
You're pulling out all the stops.

463
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,027
Quite an improvement.

464
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:14,386
Pretty good, huh?

465
00:31:20,252 --> 00:31:23,419
So, don't give up what you like.

469
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,354
I'm sorry.

470
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,401

471
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,729
Hey!

472
00:31:56,729 --> 00:32:00,001
We didn't even do anything as a couple!

473
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,762
We didn't even have a meal.

474
00:32:01,762 --> 00:32:04,088
So...

475
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,929
Let's just pretend this never happened.

476
00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:07,550
Are you kidding me?!

477
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:11,262
How can you dump me
when we haven't even done anything?!

478
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,639
You're stepping all over my pride!

479
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:17,163
You were always busy
hanging out with your friends.

480
00:32:17,163 --> 00:32:18,769
This is ridiculous.

481
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:20,354
It's so embarrassing.

482
00:32:20,354 --> 00:32:21,981
I'm sorry...

483
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,682
Listen.

484
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,603
I'm the one dumping you.

485
00:32:30,862 --> 00:32:32,729

- What?
- This.

490
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:15,326
It's at 8, so should we grab dinner first?

491
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,079
Oh, hey, I have plans today.

492
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,963
Like what?

493
00:33:19,963 --> 00:33:23,496
I have this thing with Chan Young. I'm sorry.

494
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,172
Try asking Ji Yu.

495
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:31,500
It's not like you're confessing.
It's just a concert.

496
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:36,863
Look, I really have to go.
Sorry. See you!
