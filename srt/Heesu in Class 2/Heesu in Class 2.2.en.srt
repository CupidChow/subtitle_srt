To confess.

If you confess, you'll become

Are you watching that?

162
00:10:52,286 --> 00:10:53,361

Looks.

165

I don't think so.

166
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,619
It can't be.

Come on!

168
00:11:05,286 --> 00:11:07,619
If that's true,
nobody would like Ho Sik.

169
00:11:07,619 --> 00:11:11,060
I'm telling you, it's looks.
I care about looks.

170
00:11:19,952 --> 00:11:21,513
Geez!

171
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:22,932

Why aren't you seeing him these days?

175
00:11:31,577 --> 00:11:33,618
We broke up.

Yeah.

178
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,909
Was it a threat or for real?

179
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:42,369
Ninety percent threat, ten percent real.

180
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,202
We really did break up to some extent.

181
00:11:44,202 --> 00:11:47,439
He's been slacking off,
so I need to straighten him out.

182
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,119
Are you a gangster or what?

183
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:52,660
Why even date if all you do
is fight and break up?

184
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,202
That's what dating is.
You fight, then make up.

185
00:11:55,202 --> 00:11:58,784
If you're always polite and say
nice things, that's not a boyfriend.

186
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:00,994
That's an acquaintance.

187
00:12:05,534 --> 00:12:07,501
Looks, huh?

188
00:12:09,035 --> 00:12:10,811
No way...

189
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,477
[With my best friend Chan Young]

190
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,404
<i>Or maybe it really is about looks.</i>

191
00:12:38,077 --> 00:12:40,576
Chan Young looks so good.

192
00:12:52,808 --> 00:12:54,625
Who's here at this hour?

193
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,560
Why didn't you go home?

194
00:13:02,284 --> 00:13:04,475
I came to see the supermoon.

195
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,935
It's not time yet.

196
00:13:08,335 --> 00:13:10,039
I just...

197
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,457
didn't feel like going home.

198
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,733
Why not?

199
00:13:18,743 --> 00:13:20,435
The moon is huge.

200
00:13:21,578 --> 00:13:23,644
It'll be the biggest in two days.

201
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,350
Hey.

202
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,126
Didn't you say when a supermoon
appears, there's an earthquake?

203
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,646
I hope there is an earthquake.

204
00:13:34,646 --> 00:13:36,982
There won't be.

205
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,452
If you hate home, run away.

206
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,452
We can't have an earthquake
just because of you.

207
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:42,852
I guess not.

208
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:48,269
Why?

209
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,771
Is your brother home?

210
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,565
Yeah.

211
00:13:55,295 --> 00:13:57,778
Isn't a med student supposed to be busy?

212
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,727
I don't know. He just came for a while.

213
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,494
It's too cold to run away.

214
00:14:05,494 --> 00:14:07,287
I'll sit for a bit and go.

215
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:10,477
<i>Chan Young's one weakness.</i>

216
00:14:12,202 --> 00:14:14,286
<i>It isn't some golden boy his mom knows.</i>

217
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:17,477
<i>It's his older brother.</i>

218
00:14:24,743 --> 00:14:26,098
You're back late.

219
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,936
Yeah, didn't you go to sleep?

220
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,252
Hey, why do you still have
those old medals lying around?

221
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,062
I didn't keep them. Mom did.

222
00:14:42,244 --> 00:14:44,116
Most of them are yours anyway.

223
00:14:45,286 --> 00:14:47,560
Aren't you playing tennis these days?

224
00:14:48,868 --> 00:14:50,160
No, I'm not.

225
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,623
Why not?

226
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,393
You know why.

227
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,480
What's the point of always
being second place?

228
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,049
Even you quit
when you were always first place.

229
00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:01,615
Playing tennis as a hobby is good enough.

230
00:15:02,454 --> 00:15:04,027
I need to study.

231
00:15:04,027 --> 00:15:05,471
Did dad say that?

232
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:10,868
Put mine away.
Do what you want with yours.

233
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,146
Good night.

234
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:44,953
What are you doing?

235
00:15:44,953 --> 00:15:46,479
We're late! Run!

236
00:15:58,621 --> 00:16:00,358
We almost missed it.

237
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,571
You should have left sooner.

238
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:08,783
If I didn't make you run,
you'd be late.

239
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:13,639
Did we switch seats yesterday?

240
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,307
This is your seat.

241
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,602
Is it a bomb?

242
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:18,746
Just open it!

243
00:16:18,746 --> 00:16:20,705
- Should I?
- Don't touch it!

244
00:16:20,705 --> 00:16:23,521
- What's his problem?
- Now what?

245
00:16:24,496 --> 00:16:26,203
I'll open it by myself.

246
00:16:26,203 --> 00:16:27,945
Quietly.

247
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,079
When no one's around.

248
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,604
Suit yourself.

249
00:16:35,052 --> 00:16:36,745
You really didn't see who it was?

250
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:39,270
You were the last one to leave yesterday.

251
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,460
I didn't.

252
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,621
Who could it be?

253
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:47,787
Who's secretly crushing on me?

254
00:16:47,787 --> 00:16:49,050
Hey.

255
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,179
Are you sure it's yours?
Did it have your name on it?

256
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,304
Chan Young.

257
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:57,457
You're 200 times more of a jerk
when you say stuff like that.

258
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:06,341
See that? Ho Sik with a heart.

259
00:17:07,014 --> 00:17:09,004
Yeah, yeah. Just eat.

260
00:17:09,004 --> 00:17:10,287
Maybe it's Seol Hee.

261
00:17:10,287 --> 00:17:11,805
Could be, right?

262
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,867
She blocks your messages,
but leaves you a gift?

263
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:17,227
That's new.

264
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,855
What do you know!
She taught me how to pick up stitches!

265
00:17:21,855 --> 00:17:23,609
Oh, she scared me.

266
00:17:24,882 --> 00:17:28,030
We're eating. That's so rude.

267
00:17:30,663 --> 00:17:32,551
It's your fault!

268
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,387
I can't eat with all this noise. Geez.

269
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,360
What did I do?

270
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:57,350
<i>I can't believe Ho Sik received a confession.</i>

271
00:17:58,772 --> 00:18:00,838
<i>The universe has gone crazy.</i>

272
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,240
Hey!

273
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,497
- Are you okay?
- Huh?

274
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:18,855
Yeah.

275
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:24,463
Uh, yeah, I'm okay.

276
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,816
Why did you hit it like that?

277
00:18:32,816 --> 00:18:36,181
What are you talking about?
You should receive it!

278
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:45,818
Ugh, this is so heavy.
There's so much water.

279
00:18:45,818 --> 00:18:48,151
Why is there so much water!

280
00:18:53,441 --> 00:18:56,091
Oh, no. I'm sorry!
Are you okay?

281
00:18:57,904 --> 00:19:00,192
I'm so sorry.

282
00:19:00,192 --> 00:19:02,874
Ugh, it even smells...

283
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:06,586
It's okay.

284
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:11,425
- Hee Su, hurry up.
- I'm almost done.

285
00:19:12,775 --> 00:19:14,945
Hey, Hee Su.

286
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,900
Can we talk?

287
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,449
I'm so sorry about earlier.

288
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,267
It'll just be a moment.

289
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:24,479
Let's talk in the counseling room.

290
00:19:25,872 --> 00:19:27,941
Okay, I'll be there.

291
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,258
<i>Oh, I'm doomed.</i>

292
00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:39,786
What was that?

293
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,342
Sorry, you guys go ahead without me.

294
00:19:46,357 --> 00:19:47,603
I need to talk to Seung Won.

295
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,025
You're doomed, dude.

296
00:19:49,025 --> 00:19:51,774
If he doesn't get into college,
he's going to blame it on you.

297
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,651
Come on...

298
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:56,399
Text me if you make it out alive.

299
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:58,530
I'll be at the Internet cafe.

300
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,890
See you.

301
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,348
What is it?

302
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:20,660
Well... I need to tell you something.

303
00:20:21,923 --> 00:20:23,346
What is it?

304
00:20:23,346 --> 00:20:25,053
Well, uh...

305
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:32,691
Well...

306
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:34,716
<i>This feels familiar.</i>

307
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,799
Do you...

308
00:20:41,743 --> 00:20:43,308
Need counseling?

309
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,645
Relationship advice?

310
00:20:50,234 --> 00:20:51,857
Yeah.

311
00:20:51,857 --> 00:20:53,067
Give me some advice.

312
00:20:53,067 --> 00:20:55,067
Why are you dragging it out like that?

313
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:57,024
You scared me for a bit there.

314
00:20:57,024 --> 00:20:58,468
Seung Won!

315
00:20:58,468 --> 00:21:01,316
I thought all you did was study.

316
00:21:01,316 --> 00:21:03,053
Are you dating?

317
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,248
No, I'm not dating.

318
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,258
Is it a crush?

319
00:21:09,174 --> 00:21:10,942
Yeah.

320
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:13,088
Why'd you buy so much stuff?

321
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,650
Want some other stuff?

322
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,592
No, no, no.

323
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,983
I like this.

324
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:25,566
Yeah, you mentioned it last time.

325
00:21:25,566 --> 00:21:27,936
You said the carrot juice post
was about you.

326
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:30,858
Well...

327
00:21:30,858 --> 00:21:33,441
It might not be me.

328
00:21:33,441 --> 00:21:35,300
But I do like it.

329
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,816
Hey, tell me about your problem.

330
00:21:45,816 --> 00:21:48,983
Everyone says you only care
about getting into college.

331
00:21:48,983 --> 00:21:51,476
If they find out you like someone,
they'll be shocked.

332
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,561
Who said that?

333
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,025
Everyone.

334
00:21:54,025 --> 00:21:56,900
They say you're practically
an AI on college admission.

335
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,300
I am?

336
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,638
So, who is it?
You must really like her.

337
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:10,312
Buy them carrot juice.

338
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,415
What's next?

339
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,125
Come on, stop it.

340
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,816
No, seriously.
What comes after a drink?

341
00:22:17,816 --> 00:22:20,088
What are you supposed to do?

342
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,525
Well...

343
00:22:21,525 --> 00:22:23,617
Keep giving them what they like?

344
00:22:24,858 --> 00:22:26,344
What does she like?

345
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:28,139
I don't know.
What do you like?

346
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:29,983
Me?

347
00:22:29,983 --> 00:22:31,550
Well...

348
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:34,733
I don't know.

349
00:22:34,733 --> 00:22:36,063
What did you eat yesterday?

350
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,816
Yesterday?

351
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:40,234
Tteokbokki. Chan Young wanted to eat it.

352
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,192
Right, he likes tteokbokki.

353
00:22:42,192 --> 00:22:44,441
Other than food.

354
00:22:44,441 --> 00:22:45,489
Chan Young likes tennis?

355
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,300
Not Chan Young.

356
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,074
Oh, me?

357
00:22:50,398 --> 00:22:51,842
I...

358
00:22:54,983 --> 00:22:57,234
Hey! Why are we talking about me?

359
00:22:57,234 --> 00:23:00,634
Think about the person you like!

360
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,525
Hey.

361
00:23:03,525 --> 00:23:05,175
You've never dated, right?

362
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:19,608
What an embarrassment.

363
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:21,365
Firstly!

364
00:23:21,365 --> 00:23:23,724
Find out what she likes.

365
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,143
I'm going to go then.

366
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,399
This is good.

367
00:23:35,399 --> 00:23:37,925
What a jerk.

368

I mean...

447
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:06,097
I have something to do,
so I have to get home early.

448
00:28:06,097 --> 00:28:09,181

457
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:58,361
A Junior in my department.

458
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,887
Why'd he reject you?

459
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:03,057
He said I was overbearing.

460
00:29:14,006 --> 00:29:15,361

461
00:29:16,476 --> 00:29:21,388
The guys you confessed to
must feel good about it.

462
00:29:21,388 --> 00:29:24,555
I received something like
a confession too, so I know.

463
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:27,623
Just the fact that someone likes me...

464
00:29:27,623 --> 00:29:31,377

471
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,462
You listened to Summer before.

472
00:30:18,181 --> 00:30:20,801
You're acting like a stalker right now.

473
00:30:21,682 --> 00:30:25,931
She's the same age as us, Summer.
Don't you think she's a genius?

474
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,692
She's no genius.

475
00:30:29,692 --> 00:30:32,593
- And Summer...
- Alright, let's begin.

476
00:30:39,472 --> 00:30:41,597

477
00:30:41,597 --> 00:30:43,539

481
00:31:02,055 --> 00:31:04,289
And everything collapses.

482
00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:08,668
There won't be an earthquake.

483
00:31:09,889 --> 00:31:11,805

00:31:11,805 --> 00:31:14,847

something weird.

Hey, it was you, you fraud.

486
00:31:17,555 --> 00:31:20,455
You said when a supermoon appears,
there's an earthquake.

487
00:31:21,305 --> 00:31:22,749
I did?

<i>It doesn't cause an earthquake,</i>

492

<i>but it does make
sea levels rise higher than usual.</i>

493
00:31:51,139 --> 00:31:53,705
<i>And 71% of the Earth is water.</i>

494

<i>Come to think of it,</i>

495
00:31:56,638 --> 00:32:00,372
<i>that circle in the distance
is powerful enough to shake Earth.</i>

496

<i>Just like how feelings for someone

497

548
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,318
<i>It's nothing.</i>

549
00:37:57,087 --> 00:37:58,696
Seung Won!

550
00:38:11,143 --> 00:38:12,543
What are you doing?

551
00:38:13,154 --> 00:38:14,554
Me?

552
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,152
Nothing, really...

553
00:38:19,004 --> 00:38:20,572
Seung Won.

554
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,703
Should I find you a girlfriend?

555
00:38:30,073 --> 00:38:34,723
<i>Even if Chan Young's feelings wavered,
it doesn't matter.</i>

556
00:38:35,374 --> 00:38:38,150
<i>Because I've decided
to become a supermoon this time.</i>
