Just in case, a change of clothes.

181
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,196
Anyway, I can't go.

[Ji Yu: Wanna go to the terminal together?]

183
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:14,898
Did you sleep well?

184
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,508
He even sounds good
when he asks if I slept well.

185
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,861
He's coming to pick me up.
He's coming to pick me up!

186
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:33,665
Oh, hold on.

187
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,352

188
00:15:37,352 --> 00:15:40,166
Come right on time for the bus.

189
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,417
Don't come too early.

190
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,088
What is it?

191
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,032
Oh, nothing.

192
00:15:52,032 --> 00:15:54,885
Ji Yu said to buy pork belly.

193
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,395
- Let's go over there.
- Okay.

194
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,859
What's all this?

195
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:56,823
Oh, it's to do the dishes after we eat.

196
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,799
What about this?

197
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:03,313
That's to charge our phones?

198
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,498
Four of us, so four ports?

199
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,329
Hey, what are you doing?

200
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,500
Why are you taking that?

201

202
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,467
What's this?
Can I carry something for you?

203
00:17:29,467 --> 00:17:31,343
No, I just thought it might get cold.

204
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:33,193
It's okay. Let's go!

205
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,233
It's okay.

Over there.

207
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:07,629
This is the first time
I'm going somewhere with friends.

208
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:09,548
Really? You've never gone before?

209
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:11,048
No.

210
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,595
You're in big trouble.

211
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:16,762
Be sure to stick with me.

212
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,931
If we get separated, you'll be lost.

213
00:18:19,931 --> 00:18:21,559
Are you kidding me?

214
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,271
Hold my hand tightly.

215
00:18:23,271 --> 00:18:24,438
If we get separated,

216
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:27,981
I'll find you, so don't cry
and just wait where you are.

217

Got it?

218
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,084
Don't follow strangers.

We won't be late, right?

220
00:18:35,765 --> 00:18:38,367
It's going to be close.

221
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,078
Ji Yu and Chan Young already arrived.

222
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,413
- Did we get everything?
- Yeah.

223
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,708
I can carry something for you.

224
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,432
No, it's okay.

225
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,986
Hee Su, we need to hurry.

226
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,889
We're screwed.

227
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,573
Why?

228
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,119
The telescope.

229
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,882
Are you okay?

230
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,804
Don't worry. It'll be there.

231
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,891
Why aren't they coming?

232
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:36,858
So, how should we sit?

233
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,802
I'll sit with you,

234
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,947
and Hee Su and Seung Won
can sit together, right?

235
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:47,065
Won't Hee Su and Seung Won
think something's up?

236
00:19:47,065 --> 00:19:49,356
Then you and Seung Won?

237
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:51,649
That might be better.

238
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,208
I don't want that.

239
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,421
So we'll come back that way too.

240
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,966
What is that...

241
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,488
You want to sit with me that badly?

242
00:20:10,488 --> 00:20:13,775
Then, sit with me.

243
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,676
Can I? What about the other guys?

244
00:20:16,676 --> 00:20:20,388
They said they have to go back
to the store, so we should go ahead.

245
00:20:20,388 --> 00:20:21,954
Really?

246

I should sleep too.

251
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:40,441
- Be careful with that.
- Okay.

252
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,135
All set?

253
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,058
Finally.

254
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,847
I'm already exhausted.

255
00:21:52,714 --> 00:21:55,581
Ji Yu isn't answering her phone.

256
00:21:55,581 --> 00:21:58,681
Neither is Chan Young.
He's ignoring my texts too.

257
00:21:59,748 --> 00:22:02,348
They're probably asleep.

258
00:22:04,714 --> 00:22:08,781
It must be awkward for them
'cause we're not there, right?

259
00:22:10,681 --> 00:22:12,314
Yeah...

260
00:22:13,683 --> 00:22:15,083
Did we forget anything else?

261
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:18,581

262
00:22:18,581 --> 00:22:21,381
- Charger's in the bag?
- Yeah.

263
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,508
Okay, go!

264
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,484
I'm sorry.

the meat in the cargo hold?

a little bit later?

don't you think they'll kill me?

Today is the day.

361
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,265
But...

362
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,433
Do I have to confess?

363
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:41,699
How long do you think
Chan Young can keep this quiet?

364
00:30:47,723 --> 00:30:50,218
What are they whispering about?

365
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,244
Did you settle things with Seung Won?

366
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,606
Settle what?

367
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:01,067
You asked whose side I'm on.

368
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,531
Is something going on with him?

369
00:31:03,531 --> 00:31:07,531
No, I just said that.
There aren't any sides.

370
00:31:07,531 --> 00:31:09,732
Just forget it.

371
00:31:14,872 --> 00:31:16,732
I'm on your side.

372
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:21,186
But that doesn't mean
I'm not on Seung Won's side.

373
00:31:21,832 --> 00:31:24,232
I'm always on your side.

374
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,465
Even if you and I fight,

375
00:31:28,465 --> 00:31:30,232
I'm on your side.

376
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:36,665
So, just tell me.
You have something to say, right?

377
00:31:36,665 --> 00:31:38,187
Yeah, how did you know?

378
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,531
Of course I know.
You're so obvious.

379
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:42,165
Hey, I'm not obvious.

380
00:31:42,165 --> 00:31:43,569
Totally obvious.

381
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:44,946
Whatever, I'm not telling.

382
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:47,029
Are you pouting?

383
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:49,031
Never mind.

384
00:31:49,031 --> 00:31:53,786
If you were dating
and you kept it from me,

385
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,762
I'd be really upset.

386
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,849
After all, I'm your best friend.

387
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:03,212
Wouldn't Hee Su feel that way?

388
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:06,231
And Chan Young will want to tell him too.

389
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:12,821
I'm giving you time
to settle things yourself.

390
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,892
Your lies.

391
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,660
And your one-sided crush.

392
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,830
Hey, wait for me.

393
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:32,757
Hurry up.

394
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,636
We're almost there.

395
00:32:45,087 --> 00:32:47,355
This is it. We're here.

396
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:15,690
Wow, awesome.

397
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,224
Where did Seung Won go?

398
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,197
He said he's going
to look around for a bit.

399
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,990
It's dark and dangerous...

400
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:46,091
Well, maybe he just needs
some alone time.

401
00:33:53,491 --> 00:33:55,524
I like you.

402
00:33:55,524 --> 00:33:57,412
What I'm saying is...

403
00:33:57,412 --> 00:34:01,891
The person I like isn't Ji Yu,
but it's actually you.

404
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,086
That's not it...

405
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:07,269
Ah, I'm sleepy!

406
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:11,748
How much longer until the shooting star?

407
00:34:12,591 --> 00:34:16,111
It's almost time!
It's going to start soon.

408
00:34:17,315 --> 00:34:20,893
Wow, the weather is good.
We'll be able to see a lot!

409
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,910
Then I'll go and find Seung Won.

410
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,991
Hey.

411
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,615
I...

412
00:34:39,785 --> 00:34:42,095
I'm going steady with Ji Yu.

413
00:34:44,915 --> 00:34:48,882
It's a secret for now,
so pretend you don't know.

414
00:35:00,472 --> 00:35:02,281
Ji Yu...

415
00:35:03,348 --> 00:35:04,935
Likes you?

416
00:35:04,935 --> 00:35:06,895
This time...

417
00:35:06,895 --> 00:35:09,289
I'm the one who confessed first.

418
00:35:31,503 --> 00:35:33,839
It's not Ji Yu.

419
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,607
It's you.

420
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,622
Now? Are you ready?

421
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,525
Should I leave with Chan Young?

422
00:35:53,525 --> 00:35:55,043
Yeah.

423
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:02,592
You shouldn't have told me.

424
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:09,641
You didn't have to tell me.

425
00:36:12,127 --> 00:36:14,520
You should've kept it a secret.

426
00:36:22,953 --> 00:36:24,539
Hee Su...

427
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:33,023
<i>Waiting for the moment</i>

428
00:36:33,023 --> 00:36:36,694
<i>for something that wanders through space
to disappear to make a wish.</i>

429
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:40,172
<i>Who do people think will fulfill that wish?</i>

430
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,288
<i>The wishes we make...</i>

431
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,514
<i>Where do they all go?</i>

432
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,552
Don't follow me.

433
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,820
Don't follow me, Chan Young.

434
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,642
Slow down a bit.

435
00:37:08,642 --> 00:37:10,994
You're walking in the dark without a light.

436
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:14,607
Are you going to the bathroom?
You in a hurry?

437
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:18,277
Yeah.

438
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,629
Still, slow down a bit.

439
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:30,122
By any chance, Ji Yu and Chan Young...

440
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,015
Huh? What about them?

441
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:34,541
Never mind.

442
00:37:35,377 --> 00:37:37,908
Why did you come down here?

443
00:37:37,908 --> 00:37:39,641
Same, bathroom.

444
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:09,594
I never saw a shooting star before.

445
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,772
Look, there was another one!
Did you see it?

446
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:30,599
<i>Actually...</i>

447
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,936
<i>Just like dust vanishing in space,</i>

448
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:37,372
<i>we might be wishing
that our wishes vanish too.</i>

449
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:42,669
<i>Because wishing for something
and hoping for it,</i>

450
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:45,714
<i>is just too hard.</i>
