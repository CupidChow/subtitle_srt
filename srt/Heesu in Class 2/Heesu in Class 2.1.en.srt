girls would stop taking number tickets.

184
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,393
<i>This is the bad thing about Chan Young.</i>

185
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,036
Really.

186
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:48,524
You two should go out.

187
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:50,399
You're always together anyway.

188
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,610
<i>He stirs up people's feelings
with meaningless jokes.</i>

189
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,295
Hey, don't.

190
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:56,989
Look at his face.

191
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,909
Is that face really necessary?

192
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,809
Hey, I'm sorry! Okay?

193
00:11:01,842 --> 00:11:05,076
Well, you might have dated a lot.

194
00:11:05,076 --> 00:11:07,124
But Hee Su's never dated before.

195
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:10,127
<i>Moments like this shake my universe.</i>

196
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,143
Look who's talking!

197
00:11:12,143 --> 00:11:13,506
Go out with him!

198
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,608
Hey, I have standards.

199
00:11:19,876 --> 00:11:21,821
Knock it off.

200
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:30,272
Did you pick a club yet?

201
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,732
You didn't, right?

202
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,150
Let's do futsal!

203
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,942
I'm doing video production.

204
00:11:34,942 --> 00:11:36,570
Not tennis?

205
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,676
Hee Su, you'll do video too?

206
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:41,200
I'm not sure.

207
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,909
You'll just follow Ju Chan
like you always do.

208
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:48,609
What will you do?
Let's do the same thing.

209
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,477
Well...

210
00:11:52,669 --> 00:11:54,421
There's something I want to do.

211
00:11:54,421 --> 00:11:56,942
No, find something else.

212
00:11:56,942 --> 00:11:59,552
Forget about an astronomy club.

213
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,842
Why?

214
00:12:01,842 --> 00:12:04,724
The rooftop access is one thing,

215
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,310
but activities from 10 p.m. to midnight?
That's crazy.

216
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,229
You can supervise.

217
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,065
And my work-life balance?
I have a family.

218
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,809
It's only once a week.

219
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:16,986
Hee Su, my kid is three now.

220
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,009
He's adorable.
Wanna see a picture?

221
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:20,742
Never mind, I'll show you a video.

222
00:12:20,742 --> 00:12:23,843
- He talks so well.
- Hmph.

223
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,542
Hmph?

224
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,081
I won't watch it.

225
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,250
Why? He's cute.

226
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,768
Not interested.

227
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,136
See? I kicked it.

228
00:12:40,136 --> 00:12:42,719
Hey, even I could do that.

229
00:12:42,719 --> 00:12:44,709
I thought you said
you were like Pogba.

230
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:45,973
It's more like Pog-bad!

231
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,183
How can you fall on your face like that?

232
00:12:48,183 --> 00:12:49,909
- I know, look.
- You...

233
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:52,842
- You look even uglier.
- Come on!

234
00:12:52,842 --> 00:12:54,876
- Why are you so ugly?
- What about you!

235
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:57,500
Hey, I'm way better looking than you.

236
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:01,609
Hey, who's better looking?

237
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,841
Same, same.

238
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,909
Hee Su.

239
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:10,476
The bell rang. Clean up your desk.

240
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,097
Did you do something wrong
to Seung Won?

241
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,725
No.

242
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:31,310
I don't know what his problem is.

243
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,876
He must not like you.

244
00:13:32,876 --> 00:13:37,107
He normally doesn't care
about anything other than college.

245
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,026
He lives in my place.

246
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,542
What? You live with Seung Won?

247
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:43,530
No, he lives next door to me.

248
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,309
Where Chan Young lived.

249
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,534
Hee Su.

250
00:13:47,534 --> 00:13:50,203
Do you still sing with your window open?

251
00:13:50,203 --> 00:13:53,081
Then he might not like you.

252
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:54,251
I know from experience.

253
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,434
I didn't do that.

254
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,910
I've quit.

255
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,951
Hee Su!

256
00:14:56,561 --> 00:14:58,772
Hey, weren't you on cleaning duty?

257
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,399
I skipped it!

258
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,400
Internet cafe?

259
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,875
Yeah!

260
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,025
[Heat this and eat it]

261
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:58,483
You scared me!

262
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:04,254
This is so annoying.

263
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,506
Why are you lying there?

264
00:16:06,506 --> 00:16:08,717
Go to your room or something.

265
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,027
You go.

266
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:16,099
I'm making ramyeon.
You're not eating, right?

267
00:16:16,099 --> 00:16:18,226
You better not ask for a bite.

268
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:21,819
I haven't eaten all day.

269
00:16:21,819 --> 00:16:24,630
I'm starving.

270
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,570
Should I cook three instead?

271
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,156
Tell me now.
Don't ask for any later.

272
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:36,203
I can't eat anything.
It won't go down.

273
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,537
Bull.

274
00:16:37,537 --> 00:16:39,664
Hey.

275
00:16:39,664 --> 00:16:41,917
Do you know the pain of heartbreak?

276
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,628
<i>I heard there is this saying.</i>

277
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:47,814
<i>The third daughter is married off
without even being seen.</i>

278
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:50,917
<i>But boy...</i>

279
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:52,918
<i>That would be a disaster.</i>

280
00:16:56,984 --> 00:16:58,433
You startled me!

281
00:16:58,433 --> 00:17:00,885
That shrimp-head fool!
How dare he!

282
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,384
Geez.

283
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:06,691
<i>Anger management issues.</i>

284
00:17:06,691 --> 00:17:08,318
Looks like she got dumped again.

285
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,851
You're home early.

286
00:17:09,851 --> 00:17:11,296
You're back?

287
00:17:12,739 --> 00:17:14,173
Sis...

288
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:17,551
I don't think I can date guys anymore.

289
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:21,222
Should I join a convent?

290
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,726
<i>Chronic nonsense.</i>

291
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,503
I'm home.

292
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,062
Hey.

293
00:17:30,131 --> 00:17:32,107
She's pretty quiet today.

294
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,907
<i>Can't tell if she's human or beast.</i>

295
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,495
I almost won...

296
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:53,154
No!

297
00:17:53,154 --> 00:17:54,683
Lie down!

298
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,818
No!

299
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,018
Why are you tying your hair?

300
00:18:00,018 --> 00:18:01,413
Hi!

301
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,290
Yes! Ramyeon!

302
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,726
That's ours! Make your own!

303
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:15,568
What's with her?

304
00:18:16,817 --> 00:18:18,863
You didn't shower, did you?

305
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,434
Whatever! What's the point of a shower?

306
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,951
Hee Sin.

307
00:18:23,951 --> 00:18:25,562
Know what your problem is?

308
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,917
Don't.

309
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:28,356
Listen closely.

310
00:18:28,356 --> 00:18:31,292
The beginning of a relationship
isn't a confession.

311
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,488
It's the build-up.

312
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,699
You have to build-up properly
and then confess.

313
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:41,745
You can't keep confessing
like getting stamps for coffee.

314
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,722
Do you get at least a cup of coffee
after ten confessions?

315
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,292
A confession...

316
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,228
should always come from him. Not you.

317
00:18:52,018 --> 00:18:53,590
Whatever.

318
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,718
What does she do
when she likes someone?

319
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,511
She goes and confesses.

320
00:18:58,511 --> 00:18:59,512
Right?

321
00:18:59,512 --> 00:19:01,306
That's the problem.

322
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,117
If you like someone...

323
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:09,397
You chase him to the ends of the Earth

324
00:19:09,397 --> 00:19:13,485
and make him confess to you.

325
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,919
That's it.

326
00:19:15,817 --> 00:19:17,084
How?

327
00:19:17,084 --> 00:19:18,490
Win him over.

328
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,617
How exactly?

329
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,410
Well...

330
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:25,718
That takes know-how and skill.

331
00:19:27,184 --> 00:19:29,618
- How!
- How!

332
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,128
Okay.

333
00:19:32,128 --> 00:19:33,817
That's...

334
00:19:33,817 --> 00:19:37,884
Something I can't tell you
over some ramyeon, children!

335
00:19:37,884 --> 00:19:39,568
Go ahead and eat.

336
00:19:40,851 --> 00:19:42,718
She ate all of it.

337
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,718
How frustrating.

338
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:51,289
Hey.

339
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:54,057
Lend me your camera.

340
00:19:54,057 --> 00:19:56,319
That's low.

341
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:58,921
I could add some rice
and give it to you.

342
00:20:03,951 --> 00:20:05,618
Check my desk drawer.

343
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,375
Okay, eat.

344
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,451
Hey, what about the rice?!

345
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,478
This is...

346
00:20:30,478 --> 00:20:32,205
You like that.

347
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:40,905
Is that it?

348
00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:43,048
Yeah, my sister's.

349
00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:46,135
No need to take my picture.

350
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,818
Are you okay?

351
00:21:19,884 --> 00:21:21,921
Did you see how quick I was?

352
00:21:23,406 --> 00:21:25,451
Oh boy.

353
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,426
It hurts so much.

354
00:21:28,077 --> 00:21:29,996
Get up.

355
00:21:29,996 --> 00:21:32,451
- Are you okay?
- It hurts so much.

356
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,378
Isn't that Cha So Hee of class 4?

357
00:21:37,378 --> 00:21:38,812
Yeah.

358
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,733
She wanted to watch me skateboard.

359
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,429
Is it her now?

360
00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:48,723
You just broke up.

361
00:21:48,723 --> 00:21:51,559
It's not like that.
She doesn't like me.

362
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:54,495
I said we were hanging,
and she wanted to come.

363
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,784
<i>She likes him for sure.</i>

364
00:22:00,884 --> 00:22:04,614
<i>There are three types of people
who approach me</i>

365
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,716
<i>to get close to Chan Young.</i>

366
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,051
- Oppa.
- Huh?

367
00:22:10,051 --> 00:22:11,584
This...

368
00:22:13,851 --> 00:22:14,852
For me?

369
00:22:14,852 --> 00:22:17,335
No, give it to Chan Young, please.

370
00:22:17,335 --> 00:22:21,355
<i>Type 1, the 'delegators',
who blatantly ask me to confess for them.</i>

371
00:22:22,298 --> 00:22:25,118
What about her?
She's really pretty.

372
00:22:25,118 --> 00:22:27,387
I'll help you hook up with her.

373
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,351
Help me get acquainted with Chan Young.

374
00:22:29,351 --> 00:22:32,308
<i>Type 2, the 'traders',
with a clear quid pro quo approach.</i>

375
00:22:32,308 --> 00:22:34,884
What are you doing tonight?

376
00:22:34,884 --> 00:22:36,229
Me?

377
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:38,817
Wanna go to the coin karaoke with us?

378
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:40,541
Let's meet out front.

379
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,989
Bring Chan Young.
You're always together.

380
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:50,951
<i>Type 3, the 'criminals', who hold me
hostage to approach Chan Young.</i>

381
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,336
Hee Su.

382
00:23:00,336 --> 00:23:01,504
Huh?

383
00:23:01,504 --> 00:23:03,256
Do you have a girlfriend?

384
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,884
Anyone you like?

385
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,175
Why?

386
00:23:06,175 --> 00:23:07,468
Just wondering.

387
00:23:07,468 --> 00:23:10,488
Why you or Chan Young don't date.

388
00:23:11,931 --> 00:23:14,142
What are you talking about?

389
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,602
He always has a girlfriend.

390
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:18,884
Hey, that's not real dating.

391
00:23:18,884 --> 00:23:22,442
He doesn't want to bother
rejecting them, so he lets them be.

392
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,817
You think?

393
00:23:23,817 --> 00:23:27,018
Either he was badly burned before

394
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,593
or is in love with someone
for a long time.

395
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,931
<i>- What type is she?</i>
- Why don't you date?

396
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:40,685
<i>An 'intellect' who seeks
the cause of a problem?</i>

397
00:23:42,086 --> 00:23:44,105
Or do you prefer guys?

398
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:46,222
Huh?

399
00:23:46,222 --> 00:23:48,855
I guess that's possible, right?

400
00:23:48,855 --> 00:23:50,930
No guy ever confessed to you, right?

401
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,397
Hey.

402
00:23:53,122 --> 00:23:54,489
How can you say that?

403
00:23:54,489 --> 00:23:56,155
What? It's possible.

404
00:23:56,155 --> 00:23:58,056
No, it's not.

405
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,622
Don't say things
without knowing the facts.

406
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,401
Chan Young!

407
00:24:05,401 --> 00:24:06,922
Let's go!

408
00:24:12,122 --> 00:24:14,786
<i>Maybe everyone can see</i>

409
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,790
<i>what I'm trying so hard to hide.</i>

410
00:24:30,426 --> 00:24:31,944
What's this?

411
00:24:36,015 --> 00:24:37,555
Was it you?

412
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:40,522
I hate carrot juice.

413
00:24:41,255 --> 00:24:42,439
It really wasn't you?

414
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:45,622
Why would I give that to him?

415
00:24:46,489 --> 00:24:48,503
Forget it.

416
00:24:51,955 --> 00:24:53,033
What's wrong?

417
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:57,356
My phone's been acting up since yesterday.

418
00:24:57,356 --> 00:25:00,332
<i>I waited outside the academy yesterday
to see Seol Hee.</i>

419
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,417
What?

420
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:06,590
<i>My texts wouldn't go through.
Is it just me? Is it an app error?</i>

421
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:11,887
It's working.

422
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:12,845
Are you a stalker?

423
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,322
What's the deal?

424
00:25:14,322 --> 00:25:17,140
What about Seol Hee?
Where's Seol Hee?

425
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,558
You got blocked.

426
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,289
So...

427
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:23,037
That's what this is?

428
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:26,189
Come on!

429
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:30,356
Hey stalker, consider yourself lucky
she didn't report you.

430
00:25:30,356 --> 00:25:32,949
Congrats on making it to school
instead of jail.

431
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:34,324
The ends of the Earth, huh?

432
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,453
Gee.

433
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:40,580
Naturally, not creepy like that.

434
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,348
Naturally?

435
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,122
Hee Su.

436
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:58,189
Huh?

437
00:25:58,189 --> 00:25:59,474
Did you decide on a club?

438
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,222
Yeah, video production.

439
00:26:01,222 --> 00:26:04,255
Did you apply? It's full.

440
00:26:04,255 --> 00:26:05,396
Really?

441
00:26:05,396 --> 00:26:08,389
The class list is due tomorrow.
You're the only one left.

442
00:26:08,389 --> 00:26:11,544
I'm sorry, I'll let you know by tomorrow.

443
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,094
Hey.

444
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,289
Counseling club would suit you.

445
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:25,389
You're great at listening.

446
00:26:25,389 --> 00:26:26,855
Huh?

447
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:47,755
Sorry.

448
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:58,324
Okay, let's start.

449
00:26:58,324 --> 00:27:02,662
Page two of the handouts
I gave out last time.

450
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:05,665
We'll start with question 18.

451
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,041
Number 18.

452
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:10,211
Which best describes
the purpose of the passage?

453
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:13,522
As I told you last time,
the purpose...

454
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:23,516
<i>When I don't really like anything,</i>

455
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:26,644
<i>and I don't really have
anything I want to do,</i>

456
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:28,746
<i>I just follow Chan Young.</i>

457
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:32,222
<i>At least, by doing that,</i>

458
00:27:32,222 --> 00:27:34,751
<i>I can do one thing I like.</i>

459
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,798
<i>Be with Chan Young.</i>

460
00:27:50,255 --> 00:27:55,522
<i>How do people open up
their hearts so easily?</i>

461
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:00,660
<i>I can't seem to bring out
these long-held feelings at all.</i>

462
00:28:11,955 --> 00:28:13,233
Hey.

463
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,089
<i>Did you finish editing?</i>

464
00:28:15,089 --> 00:28:17,155
No, that club is already full.

465
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:18,356
<i>Really?</i>

466
00:28:18,356 --> 00:28:19,888
<i>What then?</i>

467
00:28:19,888 --> 00:28:21,289
<i>What will you do?</i>

468
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:22,925
<i>Should I change mine?</i>

469
00:28:27,422 --> 00:28:29,931
<i>Careless words that make you hope.</i>

470
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,252
<i>Hello? Are you listening?</i>

471
00:28:33,252 --> 00:28:35,687
<i>Should we just do futsal with Ho Sik?</i>

472
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,341
No, it's okay.

473
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:39,383
You like that club.

474
00:28:39,383 --> 00:28:41,652
<i>But it's no fun without you.</i>

475
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:45,723
<i>Words that make my heart flutter.</i>

476
00:28:45,723 --> 00:28:47,255
<i>Hey, Hee Su.</i>

477
00:28:47,255 --> 00:28:50,019
It's fine, I'll find something else.

478
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,722
Let's talk tomorrow.

479
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,489
Hey...

480
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:12,089
Do I give this to you?

481
00:29:31,922 --> 00:29:33,536
You can have this.

482
00:29:35,222 --> 00:29:37,208
- Why?
- I don't drink that.

483
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:42,655
Nobody drinks carrot juice.
Why do they keep serving it?

484
00:29:43,356 --> 00:29:45,132
Have mine too.

485
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,289
Did you get the club result?

486
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:50,705
Not yet.

487
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,748
I'll do futsal if they don't accept me.

488
00:29:52,748 --> 00:29:55,322
With who? I'm not doing futsal.

489
00:29:55,322 --> 00:29:56,669
Then what?

490
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,228
Knitting.

491
00:29:59,888 --> 00:30:03,122
You said to chase her naturally.

492
00:30:03,122 --> 00:30:07,222
Seol Hee is in the knitting club.

493
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,348
Wow.

494
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:11,055
I'm the only guy there.
It's awesome!

495
00:30:11,055 --> 00:30:12,056
Want to join?

496
00:30:12,056 --> 00:30:14,103
Ju Chan.

497
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:17,522
Not you. Good looking guys are banned.

498
00:30:18,482 --> 00:30:20,584
- Snack bar after lunch?
- Yeah!

499
00:30:21,189 --> 00:30:23,389
- Go ahead.
- Why?

500
00:30:23,389 --> 00:30:24,855
Interview.

501
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,007
Are you here for an interview?

502
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,755
Yes, hello.

503
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,137
- Lee Hee Su?
- Yes.

504
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:50,739
You're really famous these days.

505
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,517
I wouldn't say that.

506
00:30:53,517 --> 00:30:56,729
I heard dating advice from you
always leads to success.

507
00:30:56,729 --> 00:31:00,566
You don't even need an interview.
You get a free pass.

508
00:31:00,566 --> 00:31:03,126
You're in the same class as Seung Won?

509
00:31:03,819 --> 00:31:05,446
Yes.

510
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:08,356
Tell Hee Su about our message board first.

511
00:31:08,356 --> 00:31:09,822
Okay.

512
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,661
We hold study sessions and seminars,

513
00:31:12,661 --> 00:31:15,456
but the main thing
is the anonymous message board.

514
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,875
You know, for counseling.

515
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:20,586
Seung Won will tell you all about it.

516
00:31:20,586 --> 00:31:22,022
Okay.

517
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,720
You're in the counseling club?

518
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,239
Yeah, I'm going to study psychology.

519
00:31:35,356 --> 00:31:37,955
You can log in as an admin here.

520
00:31:37,955 --> 00:31:40,922
I'll text you the username and password.

521
00:31:41,988 --> 00:31:44,652
You can't post comments at will.

522
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:47,957
Since I'm the club president,
run them by me first.

523
00:31:50,389 --> 00:31:52,855
Okay, got it.

524
00:32:00,622 --> 00:32:03,255
[Dating advice: They say keep giving what they like]

525
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:04,956
<i>Secret crush?</i>

526
00:32:10,589 --> 00:32:12,389

<i>Confess?</i>

This is...

530
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:24,855
You can have this.

531
00:32:26,652 --> 00:32:28,211
Chan Young?

532
00:32:30,089 --> 00:32:33,389
[OT is over in 30 minutes. Wait a bit!]

533
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,001
No.

534
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,603
Chan Young would never.

535
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,392
You're here.

536
00:32:58,392 --> 00:33:00,189
I'm glad I caught you.

537
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,255
Hey.

538
00:33:03,255 --> 00:33:04,922
I got rejected.

539
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:07,820
- Really?
- Yeah.

540
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,695
You know what's crazy?

541
00:33:09,695 --> 00:33:12,156
Yeong Ju has a girlfriend.

542
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,241
- Girlfriend?
- Yeah.

543
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:16,994
I somehow had a feeling.

544
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:20,922
I was going to confess and quit
track and field, but that's ruined now.

545
00:33:20,922 --> 00:33:22,500
I gotta run again.

546
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,086
You just said she has a girlfriend.

547
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,880
They're not going to last forever.

548
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,841
I'll keep running by her side
and then bam.

549
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:32,359
Steal her.

550
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:38,389
Anyway, I just came to say
thanks for everything.

551
00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:40,022
I'll get going then.

552
00:33:44,396 --> 00:33:46,322
You should confess too.

553
00:33:46,322 --> 00:33:47,859
I told you, there's no one.

554
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,735
Sure there is.

555
00:33:49,735 --> 00:33:52,722
Stop agonizing and just confess already.

556
00:33:53,697 --> 00:33:55,340
See you.

557
00:34:11,288 --> 00:34:12,489
Hee Su!

558
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:14,255
You startled me.

559
00:34:14,255 --> 00:34:16,972
- I came super fast, didn't I?
- Yeah, you did.

560
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,222
I raced over as soon as we finished.

561
00:34:19,222 --> 00:34:21,255
How about tteokbokki?

562
00:34:21,255 --> 00:34:23,389
Was orientation fun?

563
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:27,222
What fun would it be without you?

564
00:34:28,122 --> 00:34:30,250
Stop being so dramatic.

565
00:34:31,968 --> 00:34:33,947
Let's go for tteokbokki.

566
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,023
No.

567
00:34:35,023 --> 00:34:36,574
Fried chicken too?

568
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,452
Just write a book on confessions.
Be proactive about it.

569
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:42,043
- It would be a bestseller.
- Give it a shot.

570
00:34:42,043 --> 00:34:45,155
- Would you buy it?
- She'll sign it.

571
00:34:45,155 --> 00:34:46,808
Sis.

572
00:34:47,422 --> 00:34:51,355
This girl told me
she liked this other girl.

573
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,356
Why would she tell you?

574
00:34:55,356 --> 00:34:56,635
He's easy to talk to.

575
00:34:56,635 --> 00:34:57,678
He's not that bad at heart.

576
00:34:57,678 --> 00:35:00,189
That's not why.

577
00:35:02,808 --> 00:35:05,410
She confessed and got rejected.

578
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:09,389
That's just how it is.
You confess, you get rejected.

579
00:35:09,389 --> 00:35:10,608
Whatever.

580
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,090
The girl who she confessed to

581
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,754
already had a girlfriend.

582
00:35:18,824 --> 00:35:21,910
Hey, there's still a chance then.

583
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:26,457
See? You have to confess to find out.
If you don't, you'll never know.

584
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,044
Even the person being confessed to.

585
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:32,356
Without a confession, they won't know
if someone likes them.

586
00:35:32,356 --> 00:35:36,255
Just anyone isn't the same
as someone who likes you.

587
00:35:36,255 --> 00:35:39,261
It makes you special
even if you're rejected.

588
00:35:39,261 --> 00:35:41,263
You're special, very special.

589
00:35:41,263 --> 00:35:42,306
Right?

590
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:45,726
When there's another guy
who runs from me all the time...

591
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,222
Special?

592
00:35:47,222 --> 00:35:48,988
Hee Su.

593
00:35:48,988 --> 00:35:50,857
Want to go out with me?

594
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,322
You two should go out.

595
00:35:52,322 --> 00:35:55,878
What fun would it be without you?

596
00:35:57,757 --> 00:36:00,364
- This is...
- You can have this.

597
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:15,547
<i>If parallel universes exist,</i>

598
00:36:15,547 --> 00:36:18,255
<i>in another universe somewhere,</i>

599
00:36:18,255 --> 00:36:20,694
<i>I might have already confessed.</i>

600
00:36:22,522 --> 00:36:25,455
<i>In one universe, I might have failed,</i>

601
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:29,190
<i>and in another, I might have given up.</i>

602
00:36:35,155 --> 00:36:37,389
<i>But there's no rule saying</i>

603
00:36:37,389 --> 00:36:40,622
<i>there isn't a universe somewhere
where my confession is accepted.</i>

604
00:36:40,622 --> 00:36:42,456
<i>So what if...</i>

605
00:36:42,456 --> 00:36:44,755
<i>that universe is here?</i>

606
00:36:45,489 --> 00:36:50,089
<i>It is a miracle for the person I like
to like me back.</i>

607
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,089
<i>What if that miracle
could happen in this universe?</i>

608
00:36:56,755 --> 00:36:59,591
<i>There's only a slim chance.</i>

609
00:36:59,591 --> 00:37:01,822
<i>But it's still possible.</i>

610
00:37:03,356 --> 00:37:05,656
<i>I should muster up the courage.</i>

611
00:37:11,228 --> 00:37:12,789
<i>Chan Young.</i>

612
00:37:15,232 --> 00:37:17,125
<i>I like you.</i>

613
00:37:19,422 --> 00:37:21,530
What's up?

614
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,922
That carrot juice...

615
00:37:24,616 --> 00:37:28,537
You know I like carrot juice.
No, that's not it.

616
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:31,097
What I'm saying is...

617
00:37:33,289 --> 00:37:35,455
- I...
- Hee Su!

618
00:37:40,022 --> 00:37:41,555
Hee Su!
