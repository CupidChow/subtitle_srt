If not, it ends.

Do you only think about yourself?

188
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:30,115
If you just say what you want,
what am I supposed to do?

189
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:32,366
- Do you think it was easy for me?
- Probably not.

190
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,348
So isn't it natural
that it's hard for me too?

191
00:16:34,348 --> 00:16:37,704
Am I supposed to go
'Oh, okay!' as soon as you tell me?

192
00:16:37,704 --> 00:16:40,415
And act like nothing happened?

193
00:16:40,415 --> 00:16:42,875
You know I can't do that.

194
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,093
I'm sorry.

195
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,480
If you did as much as I did,
I wouldn't have reacted that way.

196
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,776
If you at least put me on a court,

197
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,987
and threw me a racket,

198
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:13,156
it wouldn't have been so awkward.

199
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,621
I could have done
so much better than that.

200
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,708
If you had given me
just a bit of time to prepare,

201
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,581
I wouldn't have rushed out like a fool.

202
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:35,180
I was like that
because you took me by surprise.

203
00:17:46,547 --> 00:17:49,985
You know the penalty is harsher
if an athlete hits someone, right?

204
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,779
Do they have surveillance cameras here?

205
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,281
I should report it to the police.

206
00:17:57,047 --> 00:17:58,869
Whatever!

207
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,815
Go ahead and report it!

208
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:07,842
If I ruin this competition because of you,
I'll really be kicked out of my house.

209
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,505
You have to be responsible!

210
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,539
I'll let you sleep in my room.

211
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:25,019
Or set up a tent on the rooftop.

212
00:18:33,653 --> 00:18:35,605
It's Seung Won, right?

213
00:18:41,272 --> 00:18:45,039
The person you like is Seung Won.

214
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,585
How did you know?

215
00:18:49,305 --> 00:18:51,005
Hey.

216
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:54,716
Besides me and Ho Sik,
there's only Seung Won.

217
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,388
Did you tell him?

218
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:07,538
No...

219
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:12,484
If he rejects me,
we won't even be able to be friends.

220
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:19,409
Just tell him.

221
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:22,451
If you don't tell him,
he'll never know.

222
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,542
Even if he rejects you,
you have me as your friend.

223
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:33,921
Honestly, I'm your only friend anyway,
so wouldn't it be okay?

224
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:37,439
I have friends!

225
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:39,805
Yeah? Show me.

226
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,142
I have friends.

227
00:19:46,142 --> 00:19:50,004
[Chungil Festival - Our Blue and Happy Days]

228
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,408
Make sure they don't
bump into each other.

229
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:01,991
- And bring a flashlight.
- Okay.

230
00:20:01,991 --> 00:20:04,954
Seung Won and I will count
how many go in.

231
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,496
- So they don't all go in at once.
- Okay.

232
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,305
No, I can't do this.

233
00:20:49,305 --> 00:20:52,042
Why did Chan Young say I'd do this?!

234
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,752
Where are you going?

235
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,128
Running away?

236
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,871
This isn't running away.

237
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:00,927
- Then what?
- It's just leaving.

238
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,539
You can't leave.
You even brought your guitar.

239
00:21:02,539 --> 00:21:04,889
- Let go! Let go, let go!
- Okay, okay!

240
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:08,005
Wait! Where are you going?
Come on.

241
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:10,978
You said you never sung
in front of people before.

242
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,406
What stage is easier
than a school festival?

243
00:21:16,272 --> 00:21:18,405
It's a fact that you're good at it.

244
00:21:18,405 --> 00:21:22,404
Even if you weren't, you'd still do it.
So why run away, huh?

245
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,073
Are you mocking me?

246
00:21:29,072 --> 00:21:31,587
I'm cheering for you.

247
00:21:31,587 --> 00:21:34,464
I know you'll do well anyway.

248
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:40,039
Smile, smile.

249
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,472
Oh, gross!

250
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:49,405
Why tell me about taking a crap?

251
00:21:50,138 --> 00:21:52,038
That's disgusting.
Maybe I shouldn't go in.

252
00:21:52,038 --> 00:21:53,938
Really. That's not a secret.

253
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,138
No, Lee Gyu Won said it's fun.

254
00:21:56,138 --> 00:21:57,272
It's a preference.

255
00:21:57,272 --> 00:21:59,484
Let's try it just once.

256
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,673
Just once? Only once.

257
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,742
Hey.

258
00:22:07,742 --> 00:22:10,905
Aren't you ready?
It's almost time.

259
00:22:10,905 --> 00:22:12,287
I'm not ready.

260
00:22:13,272 --> 00:22:15,371
We have three minutes until we start.

261
00:22:16,905 --> 00:22:18,920
She's ready.

262
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,172
Stand over there?

263
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,506
Yeah, she has to go now.

264
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,341
Okay, got it!

265
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,506
Should I just forget
about the whole audition thing?

266
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,312
First, give this a shot.
If it doesn't work, you can quit.

267
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,438
Oh, whatever!

268
00:22:45,446 --> 00:22:46,947

There's no one inside.
I'm going to the bathroom.

295
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,305
Let's clean up.

296
00:25:48,305 --> 00:25:49,381

300
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,541
Hold on a second.

301
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,906
You asked me.

302
00:26:40,305 --> 00:26:41,932
How to end a crush.

303
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,105
Well, that's...

304
00:26:44,105 --> 00:26:45,936
I was told you just need to confess.

305
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,773
If you tell them you like them,

306
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:52,606
whether they accept it or not,

307
00:26:53,505 --> 00:26:55,438
somehow it will end.

308
00:27:00,838 --> 00:27:02,772
But I don't agree.

309
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,624
If you could end it by saying it,
it would be easy.

310
00:27:09,372 --> 00:27:11,039
I...

311
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:15,040
I think it ends when you
use up all your feelings.

312
00:27:15,716 --> 00:27:18,427
Follow them as much
as you want to see them.

313
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,681
Think about them as much
as you miss them.

314
00:27:23,005 --> 00:27:25,505
Like them as much as you want to.

315
00:27:27,186 --> 00:27:28,972
Then one day...

316
00:27:33,205 --> 00:27:35,072
You realize it's over.

317
00:27:36,205 --> 00:27:40,033
Your heart doesn't race or feel as heavy

318
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,906
as it did before.

319
00:27:43,272 --> 00:27:45,203
You just realize that.

320
00:27:50,751 --> 00:27:53,505
But it's so hard
to use up all your feelings.

321
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:58,539
Every word the person says
makes your heart drop to your toes

322
00:27:58,539 --> 00:28:00,672
and spring up to your head.

323
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,432
That's so hard.

324
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,186
So...

325
00:28:11,105 --> 00:28:13,398
This time, I'll just try to say it.

326
00:28:24,305 --> 00:28:25,905
I...

327
00:28:32,501 --> 00:28:34,072
I like you.

328
00:28:47,205 --> 00:28:48,559
I'm just saying.

329
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,520
I know you don't feel the same way.
I'm not suggesting anything.

330
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,564
- It's not that.
- Hey, it's fine!

331
00:28:53,564 --> 00:28:56,905
Hey, forget you heard that.
Pretend this never happened.

332
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:14,168
Meat this early in the morning?

333
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:18,047
She's trying to forget the pain
of heartbreak with meat.

334
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,344
What's with you?

335
00:29:25,304 --> 00:29:28,683
I was planning on hearing a confession
and this is what she does.

336
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,811
I'm going to reek of meat.

337
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,396
Are you going to meet him?

338
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:37,440
What can I do? I like him.
You know I can't hold back.

339
00:29:40,938 --> 00:29:42,071
I'm going to school.

340
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,530
See you.

341
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,505
Why do you have so much stuff?

342
00:29:50,505 --> 00:29:54,305
Just this and that.
I need to send some stuff by ship first.

343
00:29:54,305 --> 00:29:55,543
What about breakfast?

344
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,378
I'm not eating.

345
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,837
I'm leaving.

346
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,573
Have a nice day.

347
00:30:18,941 --> 00:30:21,305
Don't they feed you at home?

348
00:30:21,305 --> 00:30:23,195
No, they don't.

349
00:30:23,195 --> 00:30:25,238
I'm not eating like this
because I want to.

350
00:30:25,238 --> 00:30:29,971
I can't help it
if the lunch ladies love me.

351
00:30:29,971 --> 00:30:32,997
This is all full of their love.

352
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,405
Am I supposed to leave this?

353
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:38,105
You're a pig.

354
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:41,638
You know.

355
00:30:42,238 --> 00:30:45,939
That's life. It's not fair.

356
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:00,775
- Ow!
- Hey, hey.

357
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,638
You're so childish.

358
00:31:05,138 --> 00:31:07,990
Hey, don't cross the line!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

359
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,305
Why is he laughing so much?

360
00:31:11,305 --> 00:31:12,745
What are you looking at?

361
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:15,005
Look, I took a picture
with Hee Won yesterday.

362
00:31:15,005 --> 00:31:17,208
Isn't she so pretty?

363
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,210
- I hate this.
- She's so adorable.

364
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,588
What will we do with him?

365
00:31:23,238 --> 00:31:26,592
Look at this!
She's super cute.

366
00:31:26,592 --> 00:31:27,804
Isn't she really cute?

367
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:29,013
- Hey.
- Look.

368
00:31:29,013 --> 00:31:31,038
You showed us earlier.
Stop it.

369
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:33,138
Stop looking at it!

370
00:31:33,138 --> 00:31:36,686
Hey, go straight home.
Don't wander around elsewhere!

371
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:39,538
He's worried we'll have fun without him!

372
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:44,068
I'm not hanging out with him.
I'm picky about my friends.

373
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:48,239
I'm the one who's not hanging with you.
I have to meet my girlfriend.

374
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,491
Oh, get lost!

375
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:53,372
- I'm going home.
- Bye, see you tomorrow.

376
00:32:25,192 --> 00:32:27,069
I...

377
00:32:27,069 --> 00:32:28,737
I like you.

378
00:32:29,613 --> 00:32:32,533
Forget you heard that.
Pretend this never happened.

379
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:35,496
I know you don't feel the same way.
I'm not suggesting anything.

380
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:37,037
It's nothing.

381
00:32:46,629 --> 00:32:48,497
Were you home?

382
00:32:48,497 --> 00:32:50,383
I have to go out again.

383
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:52,845
Can I come in?

384
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,063
Yes.

385
00:32:59,597 --> 00:33:01,979
I was called for a parent-teacher meeting.

386
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:04,597
Did you do something wrong?

387
00:33:04,597 --> 00:33:07,404
Every parent is called.

388
00:33:07,404 --> 00:33:10,779
You just have to go and sit there.

389
00:33:10,779 --> 00:33:14,825
How can I do that?
They'll ask about stuff.

390
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,397
What should I do?

391
00:33:20,397 --> 00:33:22,363
About what?

392
00:33:22,363 --> 00:33:24,463
Our family.

393
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:26,130
How far should I go?

394
00:33:27,764 --> 00:33:30,430
I'll do what you want.

395
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:33,463
I can pretend we live with Dad.

396
00:33:33,463 --> 00:33:36,180
Or I can say it's just the two of us.

397
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:39,725
Just say it as it is.

398
00:33:41,101 --> 00:33:43,603
Two women and a boy?

399
00:33:45,463 --> 00:33:49,068
You'll get unnecessary attention.
It will be a pain.

400
00:33:49,818 --> 00:33:51,797
I'll just lie.

401
00:33:51,797 --> 00:33:53,822
I'm good at it.

402
00:33:53,822 --> 00:33:57,159
Forget it. Lying is more of a pain.

403
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,530
<i>How long are you going to lie?</i>

404
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:05,230
If I were Hee Su, I'd be pissed.

405
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,046
Really...

406
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,467
What? What is it?

407
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,518
I honestly don't care.

408
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:27,313
If you start lying,
I'll have to keep lying.

409
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:31,068
Fixing that...

410
00:34:32,319 --> 00:34:34,029
It's really hard.

411
00:34:36,907 --> 00:34:38,909
We're okay, right?

412
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:40,703
I'm okay.

413
00:34:43,296 --> 00:34:45,363
You're right.

414
00:34:45,363 --> 00:34:47,250
We're okay.

415
00:35:06,228 --> 00:35:07,771
It's heavy!

416
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:11,694
Hee Sin thinks day 1 for her
is more important.

417
00:35:11,694 --> 00:35:13,236
She said to wait.
She'll visit during vacation.

418
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,987
I didn't expect her to come.

419
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:17,156
Watch your head.

420
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,688
Should I go with you to the airport?

421
00:35:18,688 --> 00:35:20,222
It's okay, you don't have to.

422
00:35:20,222 --> 00:35:21,788
You'll come during break, right?

423
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:24,256
You have a lot of luggage.
It will be hard when you check in.

424
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:25,331
I'll come with.

425
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,668
Our youngest grew up so well.
He's helping with luggage.

426
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:29,126
Oh, wait, wait.

427
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:32,755
- Oh, do you have your passport?
- Yeah.

428
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:33,965
I won't need a lot of money, right?

429
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,677
[I want to end it somehow too.
Whether they accept it or reject it.]

430
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:38,610
A crush...

431
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,430
How do you end it?

432
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,222
I've got everything.

433
00:35:43,222 --> 00:35:46,189
- If you forgot anything...
- Hey sis...

434
00:35:46,189 --> 00:35:48,156
I have to go somewhere.

435
00:35:48,156 --> 00:35:49,647
Suddenly?

436
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,551
Yeah, I have to go.
I'm sorry.

437
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:54,717
- Hey, Hee Su!
- Hee Su!

438
00:36:03,952 --> 00:36:07,664
You know I'm always on your side
no matter what you do, right?

439
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,503
I know.

440
00:36:10,503 --> 00:36:14,004
Go on. I'll call you when I get there.

441
00:36:14,004 --> 00:36:16,757
Okay, I'm going to go.

442
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:19,176
Sorry, I'll keep in touch!

443
00:36:19,176 --> 00:36:20,656
Bye.

444
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:24,756
It's no use raising these kids!

445
00:36:38,987 --> 00:36:40,780
Hey, Seung Won!

446
00:36:41,865 --> 00:36:43,409
Seung Won!

447
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,035
Seung Won!

448
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,584
Seung Won!

449
00:36:53,585 --> 00:36:55,128
I'm sorry.

450
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,797
For lying.

451
00:37:09,351 --> 00:37:12,455
I was going to tell you everything
when we met.

452
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,566
But you said you weren't going.

453
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,156
The carrot wants to meet me.

454
00:37:18,156 --> 00:37:19,656
Are you going to go?

455
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,489
No.

456
00:37:36,298 --> 00:37:38,007
Was it fun?

457
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:43,051
When I was making
a big deal about the carrot.

458
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,255
Was it fun?

459
00:37:47,089 --> 00:37:48,156
What are you...

460
00:37:48,156 --> 00:37:50,225
What about when I told you I liked you?

461
00:37:50,225 --> 00:37:51,726
No.

462
00:37:53,156 --> 00:37:55,556
When I didn't know anything...

463
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:59,317
When I really didn't know shit

464
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:03,822
and bragged about finding you a girlfriend.

465
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,455
Was that fun too?

466
00:38:08,256 --> 00:38:11,496
- Hee Su...
- Do you know how much...

467
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:19,421
How much I struggled by myself?

468
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:34,230
Let go! I told you
to pretend it never happened!

469
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,022
You might have had fun, but I!

470
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,941
How can I do that when I like you?

471
00:38:42,444 --> 00:38:47,116
Sorry for lying.
I'm really sorry about that.

472
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:50,535
I like you.
I like you too!

473
00:38:54,289 --> 00:38:58,002
So how can I pretend
it never happened?

474
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,128
Can feelings like that...

475
00:39:01,046 --> 00:39:03,214
just go away at will?

476
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,512
You said you have to use up
all your feelings.

477
00:39:06,512 --> 00:39:07,979
I...

478
00:39:10,156 --> 00:39:12,265
still have...

479
00:39:13,189 --> 00:39:15,435
too many feelings to use up.

480
00:39:19,022 --> 00:39:21,315
So I can't pretend it never happened.

481
00:39:58,395 --> 00:40:01,064
<i>The universe is vast and mysterious.</i>

482
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,821
<i>This small dot that we live on</i>

483
00:40:04,821 --> 00:40:08,489
<i>is insignificant compared
to endless space.</i>

484
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,782
<i>We who live in it</i>

485
00:40:10,782 --> 00:40:13,755
<i>are mere cosmic dust.</i>

486
00:40:17,022 --> 00:40:19,917
<i>Such insignificant tiny beings like us</i>

487
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:24,955
<i>manage to find each other
amidst countless specks of dust.</i>

488
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:27,756
<i>How great of a miracle is that?</i>

489
00:40:36,224 --> 00:40:38,226
Want to do it together?

490
00:40:39,227 --> 00:40:41,289
<i>So perhaps...</i>

491
00:40:41,289 --> 00:40:43,231
<i>we being cosmic dust...</i>

492
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,656
<i>have nothing else to do but love.</i>

493
00:40:59,456 --> 00:41:02,000
Did you turn off the lights?

494
00:41:03,256 --> 00:41:04,878
Yeah.

495
00:41:04,878 --> 00:41:07,797
I wanted to show you the stars.

496
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:11,653
<i>Hee Su! Did you take a crap again?
Open the window, will you!</i>

497
00:42:11,653 --> 00:42:14,045
It wasn't me!

498
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:18,910
Let's go.

499
00:42:33,334 --> 00:42:36,086
You should've opened the window.

500
00:42:39,514 --> 00:42:41,433
It wasn't me!

501
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:43,268
I'm telling you, it really wasn't me!

502
00:42:43,268 --> 00:42:47,563
Seriously, it wasn't me!

503
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:56,469
<i>This moment we're walking together,
hand in hand,</i>

504
00:42:56,469 --> 00:42:59,367
<i>how miraculous could this moment be?</i>

505
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,470
Hey!

506
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,571
Aren't you guys being way too obvious?

507
00:43:12,547 --> 00:43:16,459
- Ignore her.
- Hey, you can't treat me like this!

508
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:19,809
- I'll carry your bag.
- That's what being obvious looks like.

509
00:43:25,602 --> 00:43:27,603
- Still mad?
- Yup.

510
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,148
Come on, tell me.

511
00:43:30,148 --> 00:43:34,235
<i>We won't understand this universe
even by the time we die anyway.</i>

512
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:41,937
If anyone upsets you,
make sure to tell me.

513
00:43:41,937 --> 00:43:44,403
<i>So no matter what happens,</i>

514
00:43:44,403 --> 00:43:48,333
<i>don't panic, don't be disappointed,</i>

515
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:50,502
<i>don't hesitate,</i>

516
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:53,170
<i>and reach out to one another.</i>

517
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,495
<i>The time given to us...</i>

518
00:43:56,495 --> 00:43:57,552
Hey...

519
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:00,070
<i>Is nothing more than a fleeting moment.</i>

520
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,603
They'll just think we're really close.

521
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:09,003
<i>Because that's...</i>

522
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:12,136
<i>just how the universe is.</i>
