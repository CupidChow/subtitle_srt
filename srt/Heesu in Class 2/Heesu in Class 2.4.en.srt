181
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,837
They'll just have a fit.

182
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,031
Got it.

183
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,284
I'm not getting back together with Hyo Seok.

184
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,218
Do whatever you want.

185
00:13:51,328 --> 00:13:52,962
I mean...

186
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,518
It's alright to do what you want.

187
00:13:59,662 --> 00:14:01,548
I'm going to bed.

188
00:14:01,548 --> 00:14:03,024
Yeah.

189
00:14:25,395 --> 00:14:26,407
Hey, what?

190
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,259
Will you go with me to meet
a secondhand dealer later?

191
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,030
No.

192
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,362
<i>Can't you come with me?
I'm scared.</i>

193
00:14:33,362 --> 00:14:34,873
You're scarier.

194
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:36,808
<i>Come on, go with me!</i>

195
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:49,160
[What are you doing tonight? Around 9?]

196
00:14:58,962 --> 00:15:00,596
So Hee!

197
00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:08,157
Is it...

198
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,675
You?

199
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,843
What?

200
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,013
The one sending me messages.

201
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,226
What messages?

202
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,644
You really don't know?

203
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,631
Yeah.

204
00:15:24,631 --> 00:15:26,858
I really don't know.

205
00:15:29,636 --> 00:15:31,237
Fine.

206
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,016
Hee Su.

207
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,209
What messages?

208
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,797
Is it someone confessing to you?

209
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:51,742
Listen.

210
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:55,120
Things like that
should be said face-to-face.

211
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,747
You should stop too.

212
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,499
If you have something to say, say it directly.

213
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:02,269
Isn't it cowardly
to do it secretly like that??

214
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,662
See? I told you.
I'm a hundred percent sure.

215
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,525
Should I call her? Right now?

216
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,071
No, what would you even say?

217
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:30,656
Sis, are you meeting your ex?
Is that what you'll say?

218
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,649
Who goes to the office
dressed up like that, huh?

219
00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:36,453
I don't know.
I've never been to an office...

220
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:39,165
Trust me, nobody does.

221
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,669
It's definitely a date with an ex.

222
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:43,545
Hee Jeong is going to act all crazy again.

223
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:46,211
- Stop it!
- Jeez, you scared me.

224
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:50,801
Why do you keep doubting her
when she said it's not?

225
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,763
If she says it's not,
just take her word for it.

226
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:56,364
If she says she's working late,
just believe it. Can't you do that?

227
00:16:56,364 --> 00:16:58,216
Hey.

228
00:16:58,216 --> 00:17:00,035
Do you like Hyo Seok?

229
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,722
I knew it. Just because he gave you
allowance a few times.

230
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,899
You're a traitor.

231
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,901
Where are you going?!

232
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,586
What's up with him?

233
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,282
This is it, right?

234
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,080
Yeah.

235
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,416
- Let's go!
- Wait, wait, wait!

236
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,167
What?

237
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:26,715
Well...

238
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,983
What if it's a suspicious person?

239
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,640
Should I just go and get it?

240
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,892
No, I need to see it first.

241
00:17:40,892 --> 00:17:44,897
Then let's hurry up and go.

242
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,233
Wait...

243
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:50,279
Hey! Haven't you heard
about human trafficking, huh?

244
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,905
Or organ trafficking?

245
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:57,350
They take your kidneys and liver.
Are you sure?

246
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,802
Wait...

247
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,606
Can I try playing it?

248
00:18:21,116 --> 00:18:22,868
Thank you.

249
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,490
Okay, then...

250
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,535
You're leaving like that?

251
00:18:37,535 --> 00:18:39,968
Yes. What?

252
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,832
Well, you're kids and you came all this way.

253
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,625
It feels wrong to just let you go.

254
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,416
What are you saying...

255
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,089
It's already late, so...

256
00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:51,646
Run!

257
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:35,316
Chan Young, stop running now.

258
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,929
Hey, didn't you say you weren't scared?

259
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,990
You said it was organ trafficking.

260
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,197
Come on.

261
00:20:00,197 --> 00:20:02,164
I'll buy you ice cream.

262
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:07,222
We almost got our kidneys sold,
and you're brushing it off with ice cream?

263
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:12,393
If I win the audition prize,
I'll buy you something better.

264
00:20:14,308 --> 00:20:16,230
So you're doing it?

265
00:20:16,974 --> 00:20:19,801
Yeah, for now.

266
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,819
Sounds fun.

267
00:20:23,012 --> 00:20:24,806
You're going to be famous now.

268
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,824
I wouldn't go that far.

269
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:29,618
Didn't you say you were competing too?

270
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:34,774
I have to make the cut first.

271
00:20:34,774 --> 00:20:37,042
I've been out of practice for too long.

272
00:20:39,374 --> 00:20:41,422
I'll come cheer you on.

273
00:20:43,174 --> 00:20:46,219
That would settle everything
for tonight, right?

274
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:09,208
You punk! How many times
have I told you not to scare the kids?

275
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:14,022
Look, they were kids and it was late.

276
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,441
I thought I should give them a ride.

277
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:20,322
If the cops come again, you should explain.

278
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:23,041
- Jeez...
- Just quit selling used items directly, man.

279
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,450
Fine, I'll switch to a used-goods platform.

280
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,245
My back hurts as it is.

281
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:29,012
Baldie, you do it.

282
00:22:10,036 --> 00:22:12,138
No, this way!

283
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:19,020
Hey. You should've come earlier.

284
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,024
What's up with him?

285
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:31,175
Apparently, he was out training
by himself since dawn.

286
00:22:31,175 --> 00:22:34,309
It's not like you're trying out
for the Olympics or the national team.

287
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:39,607
You know how kids
who get bad grades suddenly overdo it?

288
00:22:39,607 --> 00:22:42,476
They pull all-nighters, then sleep
through class the next day.

289
00:22:42,476 --> 00:22:43,842
Shut up.

290
00:22:43,842 --> 00:22:47,742
That's totally you right now.
How long can you keep this up?

291
00:22:53,442 --> 00:22:55,056
Jeez!

292
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:59,018
What's the problem?
Why is he acting like this?

293
00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:12,390
<i>If someone tells him I like him...</i>

294
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,609
<i>Would Chan Young believe them?</i>

295
00:23:24,527 --> 00:23:27,155
Hurry. We're playing soccer
with class 4, remember?

296
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,616
All done, all done.

297
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,410
I don't want to play.

298
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,454
You have to play.
We have the exact number of players.

299
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:37,175
Hey, bailing last minute is bad manners.

300
00:23:37,175 --> 00:23:38,909
I won't play.

301
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:41,795
You can't do that!

302
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,809
Find someone else.

303
00:23:44,842 --> 00:23:47,050
You didn't even ask me.
I never said I'd play.

304
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,637
- That's 'cause you're Chan Young's shadow.
- Don't say that.

305
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,405
Just cut it out.

306
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,994
Did I say something wrong?

307
00:24:00,808 --> 00:24:05,376
<i>Even if someone tells him,
it's okay if Chan Young doesn't believe it.</i>

308
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:08,323
<i>As long as he believes...</i>

309
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:11,422
<i>that I don't like him like that.</i>

310
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,497
Why is he sulking?

311
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,376
I don't know.

312
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:21,009
Let's go.

313
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,588
We lost because we didn't have our ace player.

314
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:27,548
We can't win without Hee Su, right?

315
00:24:27,548 --> 00:24:30,902
Totally, that's right.

316
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,556

It's his treat.

319
00:24:41,437 --> 00:24:43,075
I have plans after school.

320
00:24:43,075 --> 00:24:44,749
Where are you going?

321
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:48,486
I have a blind date today.

322

00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:51,280

325
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,042
Nobody set it up.

326
00:24:54,042 --> 00:24:55,702
Don't lie, man.

327
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,512
It's true.

00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,854
Traitor.

331
00:25:08,464 --> 00:25:12,427
Did you set it up and put on
this whole show to hide it from me?

332
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,428
No.

333
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:17,073
He doesn't have any friends besides you. You...

334
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,675
If you really did, I'd be really upset.

335
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:26,609

I heard you earlier.

348

Uh, it got canceled.
She's not feeling well.

349
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:55,209
So?

350
00:26:55,209 --> 00:26:57,490

00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,142
Three laps and then you're dismissed!

361
00:27:45,142 --> 00:27:47,014
Yes, coach!

362
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,544
- Left, left...
- Come on, come on.

363
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,629
- Yeah!
- Left, left.

364
00:27:53,629 --> 00:27:55,314
Hurry up!

365
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:57,842
<i>What about dinner?</i>

366
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,215
I've eaten.

367
00:27:59,215 --> 00:28:01,326
All right.

368
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:35,896
This is wrong. What do I expect
to gain by going in there?

369
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:39,357
No.

370
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:46,185
I can just see who it is
from a distance.

371
00:28:46,185 --> 00:28:48,671
Just see who it is, that's all.

372
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:53,831
What if he thinks I'm weird?
What then? Gee...

373
00:28:54,815 --> 00:28:58,942
Well, I'll just say I was
on my way to the academy.

374
00:28:58,942 --> 00:28:59,943
What are you doing here?

375
00:28:59,943 --> 00:29:03,090
I was passing by and saw you.

376
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,709
I'm back.

377
00:29:13,709 --> 00:29:15,603
Where were you?

378
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,588
At school.

379
00:29:17,588 --> 00:29:19,590
What were you doing there?

380
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,468
- Studying...
- Ju Chan Young.

381
00:29:22,468 --> 00:29:26,071
I won't say it again.
You're not playing tennis.

382
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:47,244
[Ji Yu]

383
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,058
What the heck...

384
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,942
<i>Ji Yu, Seung Won is here.</i>

385
00:29:57,942 --> 00:29:59,896
Oh, come on in.

386
00:30:07,513 --> 00:30:08,875
I'll leave it on your desk.

387
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:11,241
Oh, you brought it?

388
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,808
If you need something,
come and borrow it.

389
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,857
Don't make me bring it over.

390
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:21,193
Yeah, yeah, says the guy
who brought it over.

391
00:30:21,193 --> 00:30:24,046
You hate wasting time. What's up?

392
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:30,079
- Delete the photo.
- Why?

393
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:33,289
Are you a perv?
To take secret photos like that?

394
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,009
I'm leaving.

395
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,060
You hate going to cafes.

396
00:30:45,808 --> 00:30:49,655
You think sitting in a cafe is the worst,
such a waste of time.

397
00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:52,783
So?

398
00:31:00,274 --> 00:31:04,211
And yet here you are,
sitting in a cafe with Hee Su.

399
00:31:04,808 --> 00:31:06,672
Isn't that weird?

400
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:12,161
A waffle and cake...

401
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:15,942
A bunch of stuff you don't even like.

402
00:31:15,942 --> 00:31:20,727
What... Did you go on a dessert hunt with Hee Su?

403
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,204
- You eat it.
- Thanks.

404
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,982
Did you eat dinner?

405
00:31:41,982 --> 00:31:43,908
Yeah, I did.

406
00:31:43,908 --> 00:31:46,295
- You're home early.
- Really!

407
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:50,215
Why are you home so early?

408
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:51,951
Is that a problem?

409
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,742
No, not at all.

410
00:31:55,454 --> 00:31:58,290
We're just happy, that's all.

411
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:02,019
So... are you done working late?

412
00:32:08,942 --> 00:32:11,679
Hyo Seok went back to New York.

413
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,723
He came briefly for a conference.

414
00:32:14,723 --> 00:32:16,851
He hasn't finished his degree yet.

415
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:20,412
It hasn't been decided yet
if he'll come back to Korea or not.

416
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,908
Or if we'll get back together.

417
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,408
Happy?

418
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,499
It's my decision.

419
00:32:40,499 --> 00:32:42,585
I'll do what I want.

420
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,228
Don't worry about it.

421
00:32:54,096 --> 00:32:56,240
What's your point?

422
00:32:58,329 --> 00:33:00,229
At first...

423
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:04,789
I took a picture because I couldn't
believe you were sitting in a cafe.

424
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,294
But after looking at it,
that wasn't the main thing.

425
00:33:09,987 --> 00:33:12,196
This look in your eyes!

426
00:33:12,196 --> 00:33:14,062
This look.

427
00:33:14,062 --> 00:33:17,177
It's not the look of my friend
Seung Won as I know him.

428
00:33:19,396 --> 00:33:20,915
Who are you?

429
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,196
What did you do to my friend, huh?

430
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:28,022
I like him.

431
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:31,062
Isn't that what you were going to say?

432
00:33:31,062 --> 00:33:33,110
I like Hee Su.

433
00:33:36,229 --> 00:33:38,265
Yeah, you're right.

434
00:33:38,265 --> 00:33:41,493
But you didn't have to admit it
right away like that.

435
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,329
Anything else you want to ask?

436
00:33:46,329 --> 00:33:47,524
No.

437
00:33:47,524 --> 00:33:49,196
Then I'm leaving.

438
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,545
Wait.

439
00:33:53,113 --> 00:33:54,698
Is that why?

440
00:33:54,698 --> 00:33:58,469
You know, cleaning instead of me
and coming to the academy?

441
00:34:01,162 --> 00:34:02,629
Yeah.

442
00:34:03,415 --> 00:34:06,877
Hee Su thinks I like you.

443
00:34:06,877 --> 00:34:08,395
Why?

444
00:34:10,062 --> 00:34:12,983
Because I'm getting dating advice from him.

445
00:34:16,553 --> 00:34:20,239
- Unbelievable, hilarious!
- Return it yourself. I won't come.

446
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,296
Oh, that's so funny.

447
00:34:25,315 --> 00:34:28,751
[Who did you go with?]

448
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,796
[- Traitor... I want a blind date too!
- That place has amazing macarons.]

449
00:34:40,494 --> 00:34:42,712
[LOL, nice try.
Did you go on a date with Chan Young?]

450
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:48,168
<i>The reason we can only see
the near side of the moon from Earth</i>

451
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:51,938
<i>is because the moon and Earth
have the same rotational period.</i>

452
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:56,429
<i>Unless the moon suddenly stops rotating,</i>

453
00:34:56,429 --> 00:35:00,196
<i>we can never see the far side from Earth.</i>

454
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:08,330
<i>I like Hee Su.</i>

455
00:35:12,776 --> 00:35:15,396
<i>How much I show,</i>

456
00:35:15,396 --> 00:35:16,429
<i>is my decision.</i>

457
00:35:16,429 --> 00:35:17,657
[Let's meet after school tomorrow.]

458
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,825
<i>And I...</i>

459
00:35:19,825 --> 00:35:22,096
<i>have no intention of stopping
my rotation yet.</i>

460
00:35:22,096 --> 00:35:25,013
Whether I confess or not,
that's my decision.
