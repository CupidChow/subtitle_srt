1
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:22,288
(Gokou) I thought so at first

2
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:46,179
That's the most pleasant isn't it?

3
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:52,519
(Akari) Women's sex industry Paradise

4
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:56,689
I'm Fujisaki Akari, who works in-house there.

5
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:01,061
In addition to requests from users, the shop also includes

6
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:03,396
There are a variety of jobs available

7
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:06,166
I'm coming

8
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,234
(Miho Yagira) Come

9
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:15,175
(Akari) Movies, dramas, and online media.

10
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,410
Various interview requests

11
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:24,217
Not just the store manager or therapist, but I sometimes talk about it.

12
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:27,887
There are also users who will help with the interview.

13
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,327
(Door opening and closing sound)

14
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:35,862
(Door opening and closing sound) (Shop clerk) Welcome

15
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,197
(Door opening and closing sound)

16
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,300
Ah

17
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,402
- (Rabbit) Ah- (Akari) Rabbit...?

18
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:44,471
- (Rabbit) Akari-san? - (Akari) It's Akari

19
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,573
- (Rabbit) Nice to meet you- (Akari) Nice to meet you

20
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:47,507
Sorry for keeping you waiting

21
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:51,010
No no thank you for your cooperation

22
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,378
Oh, it's Tanabe

23
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,279
(Rabbit) Ah

24
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:54,314
(Tanabe) Thank you very much

25
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,448
please

26
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,317
This is Tanabe, a writer

27
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:58,885
It's Rabbit

28
00:01:58,952 --> 00:01:59,352
Thank you for your cooperation today

29
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:00,520
(Rabbit) Please, please today, please

30
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:01,454
please

31
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,923
(Rabbit) Excuse me

32
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,392
(Akari Tanabe) Thank you

33
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,861
(Shop staff) Thank you for visiting us

34
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:10,196
(Rabbit) Ah, then please hot tea

35
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,865
(Shop clerk) I'm in a good mood

36
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:14,334
(Akari Rabbit) Ahhh... hahaha...

37
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,204
Basically, it's not OK, so please ask anything.

38
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,006
(Akari Tanabe) Thank you

39
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:24,310
Now let me get started

40
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,214
Right away, but first

41
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,316
What made me want to use Jofuu?

42
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:31,417
What was it?

43
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:38,258
I've been completely sexless with my husband for 10 years, from the age of 35.

44
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:42,595
So I asked my husband about how to use it

45
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,532
Did your husband say okay?

46
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,433
- (Rabbit) Reluctantly- (Tanabe) Ah...

47
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,736
My husband is a lawyer

48
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:53,840
I understand that sexlessness is disadvantageous in divorce lawsuits

49
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,409
Didn't you think it was better than being taken?

50
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,678
-(Rabbit)Hehehe... -(Tanabe) Ah, I see

51
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:03,983
I think it was great to meet the first therapist

52
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:08,488
I wonder if he was still around 25 at the time?

53
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:09,556
that…

54
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:14,360
I'm a newcomer, but I'll do my best, please

55
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:16,429
Ahaha

56
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,534
I'm relieved, I'm a new guy too

57
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,572
(2 people) Hehehe...

58
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,340
yes

59
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:48,461
(Rabbit) Feel the temperature of a man for the first time in 10 years

60
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,763
It's strange though

61
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,567
I remembered that I also had a temperature

62
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,185
(Rabbit) I was worried that I might not be a woman anymore

63
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,722
But I knew that day

64
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,392
I'm still a woman

65
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,462
Anyway, that was nice

66
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,632
Thank you

67
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,835
Thank you very much

68
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,839
I want to know more about Rabbit

69
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,042
The Rabbit's pleasantness

70
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,646
What Rabbit wants to do What Rabbit doesn't want

71
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,415
I want to know anything

72
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,584
Hmm...

73
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,920
So can I extend it?

74
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,390
- (Goku) Aha- (Rabbit)

75
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,357
Of course

76
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:52,425
Hehe...

77
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,396
(Two laughter)

78
00:04:56,462 --> 00:05:00,066
The day from when you make a reservation at Rabbit to meeting

79
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,302
It's just so fulfilling

80
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:06,305
Go to beauty salons and nail salons

81
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:09,142
I'm excited and working hard on maintenance

82
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:13,379
So, from then on, have you been the same therapist?

83
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,249
Maybe about a year

84
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:18,885
Ah, have you stopped nominating?

85
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:20,053
Hmm...

86
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:24,724
I fell in love with him

87
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,629
It was completely swampy at the time

88
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,731
But in chat

89
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:35,968
I saw a woman of my generation getting stuck in therapy

90
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,970
I'll write about things that don't happen at all

91
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:41,207
Do whatever you want, slander therapist or slander

92
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,509
That's terrible

93
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,451
(Rabbit) Then suddenly I was swollen and saw myself.

94
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,119
I've made the distance

95
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,989
From there, he felt like he was the sex consultant.

96
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:57,924
(Tanabe) Ah

97
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,160
(Mobile phone vibrator sound) How long does it take to say the period?

98
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:03,796
Sorry, I'm a bit excuse

99
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,969
What's wrong? Manager

100
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:14,140
picture? Rio cancels at the last minute!?

101
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,876
♪～

102
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,270
～♪

103
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,472
(Yagaraku) Dashing to another child ~

104
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,674
I think you absolutely love it, right?

105
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:25,878
(Miho) Yutaka, please

106
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,447
(Yutaka) I'll have Rio switch over to you

107
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:28,514
(Miho) Yes

108
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,083
Take care

109
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,888
What should I do? Maybe it's my fault...

110
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:39,425
(Ami) Akari-san

111
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:40,860
(Akari) Huh?

112
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,829
(Ami) What will you do with this?

113
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:45,264
(Akari) Umm, this is... (vibrator sound on your mobile phone)

114
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,600
Sorry Amy wait a minute

115
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:50,336
It's Rio

116
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,538
hello

117
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:55,074
Yeah

118
00:07:56,342 --> 00:08:00,546
Understood, make sure you have that time at the beauty salon.

119
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:01,614
yeah?

120
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:05,151
Ah thank you

121
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,587
Of course I'll do my best too

122
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,288
Hehe...

123
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,594
Two new customers

124
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,230
Good tone

125
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:19,866
Akari-chan

126
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:20,766
yes

127
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,536
Once the match is over, will the meeting minutes be fine?

128
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,938
Yes I'll do it soon

129
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,840
Akari-chan sorry

130
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:31,477
Can you buy me some sweets for your customers?

131
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:32,445
A clever guy

132
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,946
Yes!

133
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:42,655
(Vibration sound on mobile phone)

134
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,056
Rio...

135
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:45,858
Lots of phone calls

136
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,061
Yes yes

137
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:50,963
Yes, finished?

138
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,698
Thank you for your hard work

139
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,534
Do you want to sleep in the office?

140
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:58,337
I see, it's next night

141
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,373
Eat meals

142
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,009
It's a lot at the end of the month, but let's get through it

143
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,844
Ha... yes

144
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,881
No way...

145
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:15,922
(Vibration sound on mobile phone)

146
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,960
(Akari) Rio?

147
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,529
Today is the 15th time...

148
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,065
Ah... hm

149
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:32,972
what up?

150
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,207
(Rio) Acalin

151
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:40,880
I would like to pick out date spots for reservations for next month.

152
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:44,817
Ah... That Rio?

153
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:49,422
It's already night, I'm home

154
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,591
If you don't have to hurry, please send me an email.

155
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:55,161
It's completely compatible

156
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:58,197
(Rio) Haa, what?

157
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,766
I said I'd try hard...

158
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,302
It's fine

159
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:06,372
(No sound) (Akari) Ah...

160
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,273
picture?

161
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,175
Hey... Huh?

162
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:17,750
(Ringtone)

163
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,555
(Ringtone)

164
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:25,291
Are you sniffing from yesterday?

165
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,200
Sorry, I'm sorry

166
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,234
trouble?

167
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,037
It's okay, please continue

168
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,172
And

169
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,140
yes

170
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:45,378
I want to know more about my sex too

171
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,480
I've started to enjoy traveling

172
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:51,751
Ah, wandering around means trying out a variety of people, right?

173
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,653
What if you meet a good person?

174
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,155
If you're about to fall apart, leave a distance

175
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,324
I control myself

176
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:03,362
Because I'm not using it to fall in love

177
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:07,967
I'm paying to experience sexual pleasure, hehe

178
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:09,435
It looks like something is fun

179
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,404
(Rabbit) Hahaha, it's fun

180
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:17,176
So I would recommend traveling to keep it going too far

181
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,145
(Tanabe) I see

182
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:20,780
- (Rabbit) Ah, write it yes- (Tanabe) Yes

183
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:21,714
It's a voyage

184
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,249
So look forward to it

185
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,818
Yes Yes Yes Yes

186
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:27,286
(Cancel sound)

187
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,422
I was a friend of the manager and was saved

188
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,290
For now, I think something has been done

189
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,758
Contact Akari

190
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:33,993
yes

191
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:37,830
Ah, the rest is Rio

192
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:42,568
Rio: Sometimes I get into a weak mental state.

193
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,739
(Tanabe) Oh, Rabbit is

194
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:50,109
What was the best thing about using Jofuu?

195
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:56,549
Maybe something you didn't know about your body

196
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:58,350
What does it mean?

197
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,587
Being teased

198
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:05,291
I didn't know it felt so good

199
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:08,060
I also had my ears cum

200
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:11,230
Nipple orgasms belly orgasms

201
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,566
Ah, my brain is cumming

202
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:17,203
"Huh? The sexuality of a woman's body"

203
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,740
"Is it so wide and so deep?"

204
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:25,511
Ah, a series of surprises and discoveries

205
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:30,483
The most important thing in female sexuality

206
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:31,517
It's the heart

207
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:45,698
...It may happen

208
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,539
I'm more pure...

209
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,613
I believe that...

210
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:04,316
(Rabbit) He should never be able to come out

211
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:08,687
I love all the women I met in my private life.

212
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,856
Treat with respect

213
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:14,093
I tried to make it as comfortable as I wanted

214
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:18,230
He was a master therapist

215
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:22,067
I changed the way I live

216
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,237
It's a bit dangerous

217
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,472
That's right

218
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,774
Trying to become a therapist

219
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:31,777
I realized something more important haha

220
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,015
Yeah ha

221
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,350
(Rabbit) Isn't he the most interesting person?

222
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:42,021
(Akari) It's great, but sometimes it's not funny

223
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,089
Come back without getting any money

224
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:48,661
They say happily that they have "released sexually again today."

225
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,763
It's so funny Ahahaha

226
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,132
It's not funny, Rabbit

227
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,501
I've gone to get it a few times

228
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,404
There is no boundary between work and personal life

229
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,605
(Rabbit) Ha, that's right

230
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,875
It's the type who has private life just for work.

231
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:05,010
What is that terrible thought circuit

232
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:06,212
It's absolutely impossible

233
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,813
Haha...

234
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,651
So, can I ask the two of you at the end?

235
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,753
(Akari) Is it me too?

236
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,821
Yeah

237
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:20,092
Do women need sex industry?

238
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,429
picture…

239
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:30,669
(Ringtone)

240
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:34,206
(Not pronunciation)

241
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,307
(Miho) Haario doesn't come out after all

242
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:36,442
(The sound of the door closing) (Miho) Haario It's not coming out after all

243
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:37,743
(Yagaraku) Haa...

244
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,712
(Akari) Thank you for your hard work

245
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,480
(Miho) Thank you for your hard work

246
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,682
Rabbit was the best

247
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:44,917
That person is a good customer

248
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:50,055
That's about Rio...

249
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:54,293
Maybe I've got a little cold

250
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,529
(Miho) You've got a demon phone anyway, right?

251
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,365
Akari isn't bad either

252
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,567
yes…

253
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,705
Please tell me exactly what you're doing this time.

254
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:12,611
I'm not trying to spoil him, but I guess he's my best friend

255
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,051
I'm also feeling bad for quitting at this time

256
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,588
(Yagara Akari) What?

257
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,191
picture? No, you told the manager, right?

258
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,092
it was

259
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,728
Please wait a minute! Miho-san, are you going to quit?

260
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:33,132
- (Miho) Yes- (Akari) It's not possible

261
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:34,099
picture?

262
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,902
Did you think I was working here until I became an old man?

263
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,070
(Akari) Yes

264
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,540
I'm pregnant so I'm getting married and moving

265
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,542
There's a lot of information

266
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,711
I'll order a lot

267
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,713
Miho...

268
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,850
congratulations

269
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:53,719
thank you

270
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:00,993
(Akari) Please come once in a while, right?

271
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,494
I don't think it's coming

272
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,564
Haa

273
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,699
Maybe I'll quit too

274
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,201
What do you say!

275
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,670
Miho-chan quit and Ace has not heard from her.

276
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:14,173
It could be Paradiso's biggest crisis!

277
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,661
that…

278
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:43,302
If you ask me, "Does a woman need sex industry?"

279
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:45,938
What would you answer?

280
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:47,639
What is it? Suddenly

281
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:50,776
I was asked by the writer during the interview

282
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,613
Miho, what do you think?

283
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:56,682
picture…

284
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,918
Can I say it honestly?

285
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:01,220
please

286
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:05,257
I…

287
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,395
I've never thought about that

288
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,463
It's refreshing and looks like Miho

289
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,334
If it's not decided that it's necessary, there's no work.

290
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,906
If you want to give an answer

291
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,708
Why don't Akari-chan try using Jofuu too?

292
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:27,212
(Gokou) Women don't need sex industry.

293
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:31,650
Hey, what are you talking about?

294
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,285
Why is it not necessary?

295
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:38,557
I am working with the goal of acquiring citizenship for Jofu.

296
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,026
And the men in the world

297
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,930
I want you to deepen your knowledge of women's sexuality

298
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:48,300
If all men could become like therapists

299
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:53,005
Inevitably, women's sex industry will no longer be necessary

300
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:56,208
Hmm, no, wait

301
00:17:56,275 --> 00:18:00,979
This may be when Jofu, who is at a higher level than he is now, will explode...

302
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,083
And as for Gokou-san

303
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:06,585
Is it necessary? Isn't it necessary?

304
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,287
Things I don't understand about that on "Gokou Channel"

305
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:09,455
You shouldn't say it, right?

306
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:12,057
(Door opening and closing sound) Hmm...

307
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:12,124
(Door opening and closing sound)

308
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,325
(The sound of the door opening and closing) I definitely should say it

309
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:15,327
I'm definitely going to say it

310
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,631
(Taro) Gokou-san grins while grinning

311
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:20,833
I was saying something loud

312
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,901
(Yagaraku) It's fine, that guy, leave him alone

313
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:26,305
Taro - It seems like he's doing well recently

314
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:27,306
Please

315
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:28,607
(Taro) Thank you

316
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,542
Starting today, I'm going for a 3 night, 4 days

317
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,377
It's the first long

318
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:36,181
As per the rules, do you get a proper break or something?

319
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:37,216
I'm coming

320
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,551
(Yagaraku) Come on, make money!

321
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,720
Leave it to me! Hehehehe

322
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:47,392
(Door opening and closing sound)

323
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:52,231
(Akari) So I'll be getting up soon too

324
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,765
Tired

325
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,334
(Miho) Take a good rest

326
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,835
(Akari) Yes

327
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,103
Thank you for your hard work

328
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,838
- (Yagaraku) Ui- (Miho) Thank you for your hard work

329
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,244
Right now

330
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,885
(Hiroki) Welcome home

331
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,990
(Akari) Haa...

332
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,295
(Hiroki) He's dead

333
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:29,034
The therapist is pounding after cancelling at the 1st time

334
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:33,772
Maybe he's sick, so I have to listen to him

335
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,942
(Hiroki) Why is Akari so far?

336
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,378
You should also have them take counseling.

337
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:41,580
No, just in case

338
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:46,118
Maybe it's my fault, and listening to the story is also my job at home.

339
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:48,754
Hmm

340
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,024
I like it, I'm dependent on you

341
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,360
picture…

342
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:58,964
Don't like it?

343
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,434
Because the same thing happened at my previous workplace.

344
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:05,604
It feels good that Akari is not needed

345
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,113
sorry

346
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:20,452
Shall we have sex?

347
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,023
- (Hiroki) Where are you going? -(Akari) It's fine

348
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,658
(Hiroki) Wait a minute

349
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,366
Let's quit my job and marry me

350
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:37,135
picture?

351
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,206
Please marry me

352
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:47,179
picture? In this flow?

353
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,182
You know, don't you? What's the reply?

354
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,484
I can't think about it now

355
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,052
on second thoughts…

356
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,787
I guess I'm going to go through all the trouble with the guy at the store anyway

357
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:57,789
teeth? Because it's impossible

358
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,658
So you should marry me

359
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,793
So I can't think about it now

360
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,995
Why?

361
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,430
I'm a full-time employee at a proper company.

362
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:07,933
That's a sex shop clerk

363
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,701
I don't think I'm going to get a lucky marriage like this

364
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,171
What is the way to say it

365
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:14,206
no…

366
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:16,942
Maybe Akari's last chance in life?

367
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,378
You can even quit sex industry, so isn't it okay?

368
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:26,918
It's fine

369
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:29,855
break up

370
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:31,990
teeth?

371
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:35,127
Slowly... Wait a minute!

372
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,628
no…

373
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,199
If so, give me my proposal back!

374
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,334
It was my first time

375
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,169
My proposal: Where did you go?

376
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:46,972
Isn't it falling around that?

377
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:54,246
(Door opening and closing sound) ♪~

378
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,748
♪～

379
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:13,732
Wow, it's Moeko's first time at home

380
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,401
It's beautiful

381
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:17,469
(Moeko) Hehe...

382
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:19,604
So Taro-chan

383
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,606
Let's live together here now

384
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:23,809
picture?

385
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,061
Ah

386
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:46,598
I came out despite my own home with great force

387
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:48,834
What should I do...

388
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,170
If you want to give an answer...

389
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:53,105
Akari-chan also

390
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:54,139
Why not try it?

391
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,375
What? Now?

392
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:02,914
(The sound of birds flapping wings)

393
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,851
(Akari) I work in-house at Jofuu

394
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:08,220
I want to be kind to the explosion!

395
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:10,522
(Moeko) Let's live together here from now on

396
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:11,757
I can't breathe

397
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:15,060
(Yagaraku) Is it necessary for women to have sex?

398
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:15,961
Do you understand?
