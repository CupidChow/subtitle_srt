1
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:08,041
(Akari) When you feel dissatisfied with something

2
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:13,079
Where does that dissatisfaction come from?

3
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:16,850
Apparently there are quite a few things that even the person himself doesn't know

4
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:22,989
Even if a demand appears urgent at first glance, if you understand its essence

5
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:27,694
There's no need to respond in the first place

6
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,832
(Akari) I've been busy lately

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,468
(Hiroki) Ahhh, ok

8
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,905
That's a new job, isn't it fun?

9
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,707
Is that so?

10
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:44,811
Well, I'm getting the money right

11
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,847
Of course, I'm working

12
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,018
Right

13
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:55,388
What if it's about time to calm down?

14
00:00:56,756 --> 00:01:01,227
I don't care either way, but the way people around me don't see it well

15
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:02,562
It's almost 30

16
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,066
oh dear…

17
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:09,269
(Door opening and closing sound)

18
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,037
(Door opening and closing sound)

19
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,037
(Shop clerk) Welcome one person

20
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:12,806
(Shop clerk) Welcome one person

21
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:15,642
(Satsuki) Huh?

22
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,210
- (Satsuki) Your hard work - (Akari) Oh

23
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,045
- (Satsuki) Ah, were we two drinking? - (Akari) Yes

24
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,146
Thank you

25
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,681
Thank you

26
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,083
Oh, that's right

27
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:25,051
I gave an A rating to Cosmo.

28
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,020
Finally, I was able to get a proper sexual sensation

29
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,755
- (Akari) Hey! Hey, Satsuki...! -(Hiroki) What's the story?

30
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:29,823
(Satsuki) Huh?

31
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,128
I'm the monitor for Jofu at Akari's workplace...

32
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:38,531
Huh? Maybe it's still...

33
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,067
Ah...

34
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:43,369
picture!?

35
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:50,043
(Shell)

36
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:56,015
So Akari's current job is a female sex industry clerk?

37
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:57,250
yes

38
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,386
Is it okay?

39
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,189
What's okay?

40
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,558
Those kinds of dangerous people are in the bag.

41
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,427
Because we're different

42
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:12,699
Also, that kind of thing is used by women who have strong sexual desires, right?

43
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,168
- (Hiroki) Something, there's a lot... - (Satsuki) What...

44
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,637
Do you think women don't have sex?

45
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,907
That's not what it is, but...

46
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,209
I thought it was a strange job

47
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:30,550
All the therapists are trying hard

48
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,952
It's a tough industry

49
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:38,157
What is therapist and a culinary affair?

50
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:40,260
That's right

51
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,863
Women are therapists because their hearts are important.

52
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,500
Now the mystery has finally been solved

53
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,570
Surrounded by young men, it must be fun

54
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,240
How to say that...

55
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,910
From number one to newcomers

56
00:02:56,976 --> 00:03:00,480
Seriously, there are all the good guys of all kinds.

57
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:03,516
Akari is kind and cute, so maybe she's super popular

58
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,051
(Akari) Hey...

59
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,119
Go home

60
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,729
(Door opening and closing sound)

61
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,166
Something's annoying

62
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,634
Sorry Akari

63
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:25,138
Ugh thank you

64
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,539
(2 people) Hehe...

65
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,344
Well, he's not paying for it!?

66
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:35,515
♪～

67
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,908
～♪

68
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,212
Good morning...

69
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,847
- (Marni) Good morning - (Taro) Good morning

70
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,482
Something's not fine?

71
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,184
oh dear…

72
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,456
It seems Taro-chan hasn't been appointed yet

73
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:53,693
Ah, that's the case too

74
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,531
The monitor rating is S, so the technical aspects are fine...

75
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:04,504
What I'm a little curious about is Miho, who said the other day...

76
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,307
(Miho) It's no point being a man just there.

77
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:10,543
What does that mean?

78
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,481
Jofu is not an industry where newcomers are pleased, right?

79
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,419
If you can touch Akarin too

80
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,588
Isn't it better to definitely be better than newcomers?

81
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,025
Uh... Certainly

82
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,796
What you need for therapy is self-promotion

83
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,532
Differentiate yourself from others

84
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:37,136
I think we need to have the motivation to get a nomination...

85
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:40,406
What do you think is Taro-chan's strengths?

86
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:48,681
kind

87
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,249
Hahaha

88
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,453
It is standard equipment

89
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,620
Young and handsome

90
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:58,024
It's an industry where people are all tall and tall.

91
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,226
You have to find strengths that can beat it.

92
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,464
Taro's strengths...

93
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,200
-(Marni)Yes-(Ren)Hoi

94
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,636
Hoi Hoi~

95
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,038
Ha!

96
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,575
So everyone

97
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:18,878
Please mess with Taro-chan as usual

98
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:19,979
- (Ren) Yes- (Marni) OK

99
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,681
That's it, I'll go

100
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,218
Good...

101
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:26,285
(Operating sound)

102
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:28,888
It's Marni!

103
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:29,889
(Len) It's Len

104
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:33,659
(Taro) Tata... It's Taro, so please!

105
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,228
I'm so nervous

106
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:37,530
Haha, that's a cute guy

107
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,065
-(Ren) Mmm--(Taro) No, hey...

108
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,200
-(Taro) Please stop it -(Marni) So cute now

109
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:43,669
Cute

110
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,506
-(Taro) It's so patting -(Ren) That's fine

111
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,040
-(Marni) Cute-(Ren) It's nice

112
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,642
It's worn out and gone

113
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,244
- (Marni) It won't go away - (Ren) There's nothing

114
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,114
(typing sound)

115
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:59,485
Feeling of security and friendliness

116
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:03,990
Emphasizing the erotic throatiness of sexual sensation...

117
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,361
Is this the same thing...

118
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:10,997
Taro-chan

119
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:14,233
I've also created an account on SNS so please post it

120
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,902
Yes

121
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,544
Marni

122
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,312
Please look at this

123
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:29,916
There are lots of comments saying "Taro-chan is so cute."

124
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:32,051
Really, that's good

125
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,920
Thanks to Marni!

126
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,892
that…

127
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,793
(Marni) Huh?

128
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:44,797
Can you also have consultations that are completely unrelated?

129
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,967
Yes, if you can answer

130
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,504
That's right...

131
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,507
The moment might be very important

132
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,978
If he was important

133
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,280
Why not share Akari-chan with you honestly?

134
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:06,686
Something... normal advice

135
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:08,488
That's right

136
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,790
Everyone can't do normal things

137
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:16,662
And maybe it's only effective now?

138
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:19,832
I'll try to contact you a little

139
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:20,900
Yeah

140
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,502
Eh...

141
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:28,641
About work

142
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,811
Sorry I'm hiding it

143
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:36,382
You were worried

144
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,186
What's so scary

145
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,889
Because there's nothing

146
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,358
(Send sound)

147
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,295
(Vibrator sound)

148
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:52,598
Ah

149
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,737
"I'm sorry I wasn't very popular"

150
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:01,340
"Can I go home tonight?"

151
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:04,277
Something seems to be solved completely

152
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:06,012
Marni is amazing

153
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:09,115
He's important to Akari too

154
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,117
Is that so?

155
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:12,685
That's right

156
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,720
I've been careless up until now

157
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:17,957
I feel a sense of crisis that Akari will be someone else's first belonging to Akari.

158
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,558
I'm being attacked

159
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:23,562
So Akari-chan should be kind to him too

160
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,299
thank you

161
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:27,633
Hehe...

162
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,970
Words are free, so you have to use them well

163
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:35,808
The persuasiveness of professional strings is incredible

164
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,377
I'll talk to you, it's terrible

165
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,112
- (Akari) Haha... - (Maruni) Hehehe...

166
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,013
Please take a look

167
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,482
How should I return this?

168
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,482
(Email reception sound)

169
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:46,752
(Marni) Just say "it's fine."

170
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,924
(Akari) If it's a two-hour course

171
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:56,963
You mean serving with your mouth for the whole two hours, right?

172
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,265
They've written their requests so clearly

173
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,700
Thank you though

174
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,336
I'm not confident yet

175
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:05,705
(Yutaka) I'd have experience for about an hour though

176
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,573
That's amazing too

177
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,009
(Cosmo) I can go for about 5 hours

178
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,645
I've slept on a woman's legs in countless numbers

179
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,947
That's a problem though

180
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,184
And who is the right person?

181
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,987
Yes, I can go!

182
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:23,656
It's really tough for one movie

183
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:26,058
Yes, I can go for one "Titanic"!

184
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,328
If so, how should I respond to this request...

185
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,664
Huh? Has I died?

186
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,532
No one will make eye contact

187
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,335
Cosmo hasn't gotten the results of the reexamination yet.

188
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,571
Thank you, I'm glad I'm alive!

189
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,643
Hmm...

190
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:46,645
What I can trust with peace of mind...

191
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,548
Maybe it's Rio

192
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:51,484
(Rio) Are you calling me?

193
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,186
(Miho) Ah, Rio, did you come?

194
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:55,521
(Rio) Is this a case for me?

195
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:58,724
Rio... Can you go?

196
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,259
Rio Can you go?

197
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,728
What is that

198
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,298
It's a reward for me

199
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:11,437
I'm sure you'll be the number one therapist

200
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,407
It's so erotic and reliable!

201
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,008
(Akari Yutaka) Ah!

202
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,013
(Saki) I'm here

203
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,181
(Husband) Welcome home

204
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,116
Was he still awake?

205
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,017
(Husband) Yes

206
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,186
I had a home izakaya

207
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,754
(Saki) Hey

208
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:31,924
Can you have sex today?

209
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:32,992
(Husband) Huh?

210
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,129
Hmm...

211
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:41,200
I'm tired this week so I want to sleep comfortably

212
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,502
Yes

213
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,204
sorry

214
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,411
Oh well

215
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:54,947
It was the day before yesterday

216
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,620
(Saki) Women have sex drive

217
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:04,490
Have you all forgotten about that?

218
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,761
(Friend) I really understand

219
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,297
It was the day before yesterday so I don't do it today

220
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:13,065
There's no such system

221
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,266
No, that's right

222
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,035
Men are already in the same way

223
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,871
There are many ways to resolve it, so it's fine

224
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,807
It's impossible for women to have to be in the right time

225
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,242
(friend)

226
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,077
Ah

227
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:30,082
But it seems that there are more and more female sex industry recently.

228
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,685
Is that so?

229
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:33,919
(Friend) Are you interested?

230
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:38,057
No... I guess I'll use it at the store...

231
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,892
(Friend) Well

232
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,497
Ah, I'm about to leave, but what about Saki?

233
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,298
I'll take it a little more relaxed

234
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,971
So, this is mine

235
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:53,038
(Saki) Yes

236
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,678
- (friend) See you next time- (Saki) Yes, again

237
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:05,351
(Door opening and closing sound)

238
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,026
(Saki) Women's sex industry...

239
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,163
To be honest, I was only interested

240
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:22,601
I'm talking to a lot of people at Saki.

241
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,537
If you do it twice a week, it's not a rep.

242
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:26,305
I also have friends who say that

243
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,206
(Rio) Yes

244
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,509
But I want to do more

245
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,179
Is this strange?

246
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,080
not at all

247
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,582
That's not the case

248
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,851
That's right!

249
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:42,688
In the end, if it's off the mark, it's quite sexless...

250
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,124
Ah...

251
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:49,662
Sorry, I've been so embarrassed

252
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,732
Rio-san, I was so cool that I came to my senses

253
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,335
Are you embarrassed?

254
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:07,513
I think it's really good to love naughty things

255
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,250
Is that so?

256
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,857
I love my husband so I don't want to bother him about this.

257
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,694
I don't like being dissatisfied with him either.

258
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,933
I want you to empty your current sexual desire

259
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,676
(Rio) Take care of your feet

260
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:30,863
ah…

261
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,832
I want you to touch it quickly

262
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:42,341
Still not good

263
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,185
(Saki) Ah...

264
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,920
Haa...

265
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:58,824
Haa...

266
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:01,660
Haa

267
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,351
Ah...

268
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:32,725
ah…

269
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:42,101
Ah... Wait, wait...

270
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,504
Maybe it's dangerous again

271
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,173
Also?

272
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:52,211
It's fine as many times as you like

273
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,114
Ah...

274
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:00,419
ah…

275
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,455
Ah!

276
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:08,193
Ah... ha ha ha...

277
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,806
cute

278
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,878
Can you still go?

279
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,382
You still have a lot of sexual desire, right?

280
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:34,219
yes

281
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:40,559
ah…

282
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,201
Hmm...

283
00:17:56,708 --> 00:18:00,012
(Akari) Check if there's something missing here too

284
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:01,079
(Taro) Yes

285
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:06,285
(The sound of the door opening)

286
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:08,954
I'm home

287
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,089
Ah, Rio is back!

288
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:12,291
What?

289
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:15,394
Did you really spend two hours? You definitely got your tongue stuck, right?

290
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,530
It's not easy and I won't do that much

291
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,799
Time isn't important

292
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:25,037
(Akari) But that was what the customer wanted...

293
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:30,409
I want it for two hours and that's not important...?

294
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:35,114
Ah, maybe that? Are you talking about philosophy?

295
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,916
"I want you to have two hours of oral service."

296
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,319
The essence of that word

297
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,588
(Taro) Wow, it's really philosophical

298
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:47,359
So you want them to feel good physically?

299
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,162
Maybe it's a little different

300
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:54,967
Two hours is merely an example

301
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,705
By making it concrete words

302
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:02,541
Can you come with the feeling that you can make it come true?

303
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,243
Some women are worried

304
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:09,615
But my true hope is just as satisfying

305
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:15,721
To fill your body, you need to start with the heart

306
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:18,991
Communication is important

307
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:22,227
Make normal things normal

308
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,296
After all, this is the basics

309
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,933
It's more philosophy than I thought

310
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,004
I thought I'd say it casually too...

What what what what?

338
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,775
What's the celebrity I've been married to?

339
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,946
First nomination has been received

340
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:52,517
at last…

341
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:56,088
It's Cosmo

342
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,324
It's here!

343
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:00,926
Did you see it, did you see it, did you see it?!

344
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,195
This is the beginning of the legend!

345
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:04,329
What's the reason?

346
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:07,032
It says that older people are better

347
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,767
So I'm nominated for Cosmo.

348
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,470
I feel something is dangerous though

349
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,338
Well, let's make it good

350
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:16,241
Power is engulfing all over my body

351
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:20,812
Is this the power of the first nomination?

352
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:24,182
(Akari) Taro-chan... Are you okay?

353
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,754
Cosmo was overtaken in an instant...

354
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,089
Even if I say I've been overtaken, there's only one

355
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,158
I can pull it back soon

356
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:36,061
And if you're older then anyone is fine

357
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,096
Depending on how you perceive it, it can be bad

358
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:39,064
terrible!

359
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,499
I'm getting carried away

360
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,367
Please don't give us a different angle of perspective!

361
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:46,038
I think I'll quit being a therapist...

362
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,111
If this happens, it's a last resort

363
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:55,247
what?

364
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,183
To the Jofu user who watched Taro-chan's video

365
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,453
DM on SNS from anywhere

366
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,357
You can only solve the problem by using the probability theory, where you can hit a few shots!

367
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,061
No... I'm not very good at that kind of thing

368
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:10,629
I mean it's embarrassing

369
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:13,098
No no, it's not selling well

370
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,434
It's embarrassing to be shy

371
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:21,673
In fact, I didn't have a nomination for the first two months.

372
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,542
I was DMing a lot

373
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,245
Is Marni, also known as the slut of all humanity?

374
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:32,451
Well, that's the easiest way to get people to know about it.

375
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:34,519
And I

376
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:39,024
I want everyone to know how cute Taro is

377
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,126
So I hope you do your best

378
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:43,729
Oh no! I'll do my best!

379
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:46,164
Okay! To Taro-chan, who is trying so hard

380
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:48,333
There's one good story

381
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,501
(Taro) What is it?

382
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:54,806
My customer is interested in being a double therapist.

383
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:57,075
I've recommended Taro-chan

384
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,679
(Cosmo Taro Akari) Double therapist?

385
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,150
(Marni) They say they'll make a reservation with double

386
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,685
(Yagira) Why am I?

387
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:08,854
(Marni) Even if things aren't going well

388
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,989
Let's go "the face that's going well"?

389
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,157
(Taro) What were you going to do after this?

390
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,494
The right is the left and the oil is me...

391
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,496
(Akari) It's so uneasy!
