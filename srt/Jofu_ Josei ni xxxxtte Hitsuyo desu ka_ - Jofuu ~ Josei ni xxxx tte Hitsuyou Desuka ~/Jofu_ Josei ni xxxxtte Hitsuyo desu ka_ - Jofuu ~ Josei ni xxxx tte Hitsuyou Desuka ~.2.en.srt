1
00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:06,006
(Cosmos' strength)

2
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:08,375
(Akari) No matter what world is sweet

3
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:14,848
A serious battle where determination brings heat and sweat

4
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:18,885
It's up to you to do it or get it done

5
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:30,630
(Akari) My name is Fujisaki Akari

6
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:31,898
By chance

7
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,967
I work at the women's sex industry paradiso

8
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:35,135
I work at the women's sex industry paradiso

9
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:35,135
(The sound of the door opening)

10
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:35,969
I work at the women's sex industry paradiso

11
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,771
(Yagira) Good morning

12
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:39,472
(Akari) Good morning

13
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,373
Ah Manager

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,243
I went to another store's date course

15
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:44,544
(Yagaraku) Yes, what was it?

16
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:46,079
I learned a lot

17
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,313
(Yagaraku) Looks like you enjoyed it

18
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,214
yes!

19
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:49,682
That's more than anything

20
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:53,186
So please also hire and manage therapists.

21
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:54,254
(Akari) What?

22
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:57,323
Ah, no...

23
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,594
It's my first time in this industry, but it's really heavy

24
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:04,330
Let's go to the therapist's interview

25
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:07,600
I don't want to let you go to lunch!

26
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:10,036
(Yagaraku) Wait a minute, kora!

27
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:16,643
Did you take the date course as an expense?

28
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,115
(Subaru) Please

29
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,752
I'm currently a second year university student

30
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:26,786
The reason for applying is

31
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:29,556
Because I'm confident in my techniques

32
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:31,591
Confident and wonderful

33
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,293
Without confidence you can't sell

34
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,795
I'm a woman, I'm good at it

35
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:39,732
good at…

36
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:44,971
(Taro) Ta... Please use Taro

37
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:46,906
picture? Taro?

38
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:50,510
yes…

39
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:54,514
Um, what is your motivation?

40
00:01:57,383 --> 00:02:01,087
I'm currently poor and applied to spending my time at home

41
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:06,192
(Akari) Manager: I'm scared and only look at me...

42
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:07,627
Haa...

43
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,562
So do you like naughty things?

44
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:11,965
I agree

45
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:16,035
However, I don't have a lot of experiences

46
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:19,172
I'd like to know if I tried out a lot with my ex-girlfriend as a job.

47
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,577
(Yagaraku's sigh)

48
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,778
(Cosmo) in Japan ⸺

49
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:28,815
Legend who experienced the Genesis of Jofu

50
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,284
If this cosmo is added

51
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:36,256
Become the number one therapist and liven up your shop

52
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,161
As long as it's reliable

53
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:43,263
Was it a ranked car at the previous store?

54
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,931
(Cosmo) Of course (the sound of fingers snapping)

55
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:48,868
By the way, I'm talking about the sales back rate.

56
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,436
It's too early to talk about money

57
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,172
That's right

58
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:55,341
So, first of all, this cosmo

59
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:58,311
Please do get it

60
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:05,051
(Sound of saliva)

61
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:07,787
♪～

62
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:08,181
～♪

63
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:11,184
(Miho) As far as I can hear the story

64
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,820
It would be fine if all three were rejected.

65
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:14,988
(Akari) Is that so?

66
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,356
(Yagaraku) Hmm...

67
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,458
What do you think of Akari?

68
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,329
I…

69
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,568
I thought all three had their own good points.

70
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,837
And of the many Jofus

71
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:35,208
He wanted to work at Paradiso.

72
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:37,777
I feel like he'll do his best

73
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,279
(Yagaraku) Yes

74
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:44,017
So, for now, all three of us will be training.

75
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,585
Please contact me

76
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:46,653
(Akari) Yes

77
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,922
(Shoko) What should I contact you!

78
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,232
(Sigh of fright)

79
00:04:59,298 --> 00:05:01,000
Ah...

80
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,106
(Shoko) Oh, is this child a new home worker?

81
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,376
Hmm... This is Fujisaki Akari

82
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,347
(Miho) Fukada Shoko, who is our instructor

83
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:15,248
Please

84
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:16,716
thank you!

85
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:18,217
(Yagaraku) Umm...

86
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:22,355
(Shoko) The nominations of the current students are still still there

87
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:25,958
But then, they're trying to hire a new person

88
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:30,163
First, let's train therapists you currently have.

89
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,665
You're probably saying it should be thorough!

90
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,033
(Yagaraku) Sorry!

91
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:37,670
It's the first time I've seen an adult get seriously angry with an adult

92
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:41,407
Recruitment and development: We need to balance both wheels

93
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,576
The manager is totally bad so you don't have to worry about it.

94
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:44,477
yes

95
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:48,881
Well, let's do it this time

96
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:51,684
(Yagaraku) Thank you Shoko

97
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,286
Akari-chan should also study!

98
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,220
yes!

99
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:59,926
If I'm going to do it anyway, I'll go in a good mood

100
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,794
Ah!?

101
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,531
(Akari) I'm not in good spirits at all

102
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:08,234
Do it all as if it were real

103
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,536
What? How to take off those clothes!

104
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:11,537
Ah, I guess it's still not started...

105
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,439
Don't talk without your permission!

106
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:18,377
The customer is watching every move therapist

107
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:21,514
Please don't treat anything roughly.

108
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,752
Is it touched by a rough guy?

109
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,221
You'll be irresistible to be worried!

110
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:30,256
Fix it quickly!

111
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:31,457
(3 people) Yes!

112
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:35,428
Hey, take your accessories off quickly

113
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,764
yes! Sorry

114
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,798
Five seconds left

115
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,299
(Cosmos' panicking voices)

116
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:43,002
(Shoko) 5 4 3...

117
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,005
(Taro) Hmm, hmm...

118
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:46,906
Hmm

119
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,476
Excuse me

120
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,313
I'll touch it

121
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,351
(Female) Ugh

122
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,520
My hands are shaking

123
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,754
(Shoko) What?

124
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,992
Scrub now

125
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,326
(Subaru) Yes

126
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,962
(Taro's heavy breath)

127
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,664
So let's try Taro

128
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:12,899
(Taro) Yes

129
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,101
(Shoko) Bring oil and a whip

130
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,002
(Subaru's tongue tapping)

131
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,103
(Taro) Yes

132
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,505
(Akari) I clicked my tongue

133
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,240
Are you a child?

134
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,947
I'll touch it

135
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:41,260
Keep it tightly so that it can be smoothly applied to the sexual sensation.

136
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:44,564
Shall I slowly develop my erogenous zones?

137
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,865
yes

138
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,081
I'll hit my own well too!

139
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,216
yes

140
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,121
How about strength?

141
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:11,357
It's completely weak

142
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:19,599
It's strong

143
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:23,402
(Shoko) Hey, do it well

144
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:24,670
Sorry

145
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,707
(Akari) I'm serious

146
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,209
I'm serious

147
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,878
(Cosmos' strength)

148
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,954
(Female) Hmm...

149
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:42,989
It's strong

150
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,258
(Shoko) Subaru

151
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:48,728
Put pressure on faster, tease me

152
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:50,596
Yes

153
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,232
Before you practice, communicate properly.

154
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,567
Why can't you talk?

155
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,369
Sorry

156
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,274
Okay

157
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,778
(Akari) Practical training...

158
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,613
Something is not stable

159
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,984
(Shoko) How did you live?

160
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:16,188
Eat hard things every day and train your mouth

161
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:17,523
-(Subaru) Yes... -(Shoko) Okay!

162
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,724
- (Shoko) Go! - (Subaru) Yes!

163
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:19,659
Okay, come on!

164
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,629
(Akari) Not erotic at all

165
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,765
It's almost club activities

166
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,733
(Cosmo) A little bit

167
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,437
Ahhh, ah, ah, ah...

168
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,339
(Shoko) Then, next time, finger

169
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,309
I'll check this

170
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:42,848
From Cosmo

171
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:48,888
(Hard breath)

172
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,289
Excuse me

173
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:55,795
Huh?

174
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:57,763
Cosmo

175
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,434
Do you know what changes are happening now?

176
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:03,569
It's moved

177
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:04,470
What is this

178
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,606
It's just before orgasm

179
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,010
Remember the feeling now

180
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,746
If you get this far...

181
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,415
-(Shoko) Ko-(Cosmos) Ahhhh!

182
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:17,917
and…

183
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,986
-(Shoko) Ko-(Cosmos) Ahhhh!

184
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,088
moreover…

185
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:23,889
-(Shoko) Ko-(Cosmos) Ahhhh!

186
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:29,795
picture? Teacher: Are you manipulating it freely?

187
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,798
(Shoko) It's a festival! Come on!

188
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:35,835
(Akari) It's already an illusion!

189
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:39,505
How was the lesson?

190
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,008
It was hard

191
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:45,444
Shoko's illusion was spectacular!

192
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,147
yeah? What is Shoko Illusion?

193
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,118
(Miho) Subaru contacted me to quit.

194
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,452
Early

195
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,056
Well, I guess he didn't think he would get mad like that

196
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,424
Hey, what is Shoko Illusion?

197
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,392
It's sync

198
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,428
I hope Taro-chan and Cosmo do their best.

199
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:04,997
I've also received an email from Cosmo.

200
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,165
picture?

201
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,769
You can earn money here and pay the course fees immediately.

202
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,306
Yes, I'll ignore that

203
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:17,109
Anyway, get ready to look for the monitor next time.

204
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,577
(Miho Akari) Yes

205
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,251
What is Shoko Illusion?

206
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,657
Shoko Illusion...

207
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,127
(Miho) Manager

208
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,429
(Yagaraku) Huh?

209
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,333
(Miho) Manager

210
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:43,702
Please take a look at this

211
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:44,804
(Yagaraku) Huh?

212
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,674
Oh oh

213
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:52,445
It was a no-return business there.

214
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,580
It's a problem isn't it

215
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:58,617
I don't want the industry to be trusted

216
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,822
please! There's no one else to order...

217
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,092
(Satsuki) Is it a monitor?

218
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,429
Of course I'll do it!

219
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,064
Rather I want to do it!

220
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:13,699
teeth?

221
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:17,803
After all, isn't this an even better opportunity to cover manga?

222
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,872
- (Akari) Yes... - (Satsuki) Hmm

223
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,474
- (Akari) Thank you - (Satsuki) Ufu

224
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,209
I'll contact you saying it's found

225
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,982
It's my first time watching a monitor...

226
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:34,520
I'm nervous when someone like this comes

227
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,789
Yeah? I'm embarrassed

228
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:43,262
Umm, I'll make a bath

229
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,330
yes

230
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,104
Oh, it's already too cute

231
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:02,148
Well... Let's get started now

232
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,049
Yes

233
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:21,667
neck! My neck is choked!

234
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,236
(Satsuki's heavy breathing) (Taro) Sorry!

235
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,704
OK?

236
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,875
What, why are you trying to drop it all of a sudden?

237
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,044
I'm going to have a back hug...

238
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,879
sorry…

239
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,221
Can I kiss you?

240
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,658
Yeah

241
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,041
Did you surprise me?

242
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,266
(Satsuki) Haa It's warm...

243
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:32,638
Haa feels good

244
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:37,910
(Taro) What did you think?

245
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:49,255
It was the best service I had in my 30 years of my life with my mouth and hands.

246
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:50,289
Really?

247
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:51,390
(Satsuki) Yes

248
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,727
Thank you so much, so happy

249
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:55,794
Ha

250
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:01,767
(Akari) Taro: What was it?

251
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,471
That's good

252
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,940
So, in light of the checklist I sent yesterday

253
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,908
Please give me a rating

254
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:10,976
Yeah

255
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,511
I'll listen to them all together after they're finished

256
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:13,445
I'll listen to them all together after they're finished

257
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:13,445
(The sound of the door opening)

258
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:15,214
(Hiroki) What? Are you going home?

259
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,116
Yes, see you soon

260
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,350
(The sound of the door closing)

261
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:21,921
(Hiroki)

262
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,923
Hiroki, what's wrong? Suddenly

263
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:26,558
(Hiroki) Maybe it's going to be night shifts now?

264
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,794
My new workplace is completely black

265
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,430
I told you before...

266
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:32,831
(Hiroki) Eh

267
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:35,000
Don't take a break

268
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:38,237
(Akari) Everyone is doing their best and I have to try too hard too.

269
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:40,306
So...

270
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,574
Shall we have a light sex?

271
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:43,542
yes

272
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:52,384
- (Akari) I'm coming- (Hiroki) Hey!

273
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:56,956
(Door opening and closing sound)

274
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:59,091
because of!

275
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,262
Ugh!

276
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,466
Haa

277
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,303
(Marni) Akari-chan?

278
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,472
Ha... Yes!

279
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,145
(Marni) Hello

280
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,381
Here... Hello

281
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:25,250
(Akari) Marni is said to be a professional string

282
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:28,153
It's my first time talking properly

283
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:33,258
Who is the store manager?

284
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:37,029
I told him I'd come and get my salary

285
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:41,934
Ah...it's going to take some time to come back

286
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,143
So...

287
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:55,381
I'll take it with me so can you please be there just in case?

288
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:59,651
Ah... yes

289
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,188
Today for Cosmo

290
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:07,493
It's the anniversary of meeting the most beautiful person in my life

291
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,695
Maybe that...

292
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,230
(Cosmo) Off course

293
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,332
That's Satsuki

294
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:14,833
(Cosmo) It's exactly... (the sound of snapping your fingers)

295
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:16,769
Cosmo Anniversary

296
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,504
Ahahaha

297
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,206
Eh, it's so popular

298
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,942
This is a monitor, right?

299
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:28,347
Now, let me wash your whole body in the bath.

300
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:31,383
Eh, maybe something

301
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,618
oh

302
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,319
Lies

303
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:38,190
Tonight, let's show you the Cosmo of Love

304
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,296
(Miho) Manager: What's up?

305
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,266
(Yagaraku) Rent There is no envelope

306
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:48,467
(Miho) What?

307
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:53,272
No, it's here

308
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,507
- (Yagaraku) That's Maruni's salary- (Miho) What!

309
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,677
Damn rent stolen

310
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,112
What's wrong?

311
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,513
(Miho) I heard there's no envelope in my rent

312
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,414
picture!?

313
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,951
It's a cosmo

314
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:09,721
He asked me about money

315
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,324
Akari-chan Cosmo Are you at the office today?

316
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:15,928
Yes Check the manual here and go to the monitor

317
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,663
I'll be back soon

318
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,631
It's certain, damn it

319
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:22,401
He won't come back anymore, yeah!

320
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,937
Where was that?

321
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:25,838
(Miho) Inside this!

322
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,146
thank you

323
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,380
Ha!

324
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:39,084
(Cosmo) Cosmo is back now

325
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,055
I'm tired

326
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:43,956
(The sound of tongue squealing)

327
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,192
This snug!

328
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,227
(Miho) Manager!

329
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,864
What are you doing? What am I doing?

330
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,799
I'm sure I stole the money from the office!

331
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:54,800
What is that?

332
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:58,003
(Miho) Manager, please calm down!

333
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,607
Cosmo has returned to here himself!

334
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:06,545
That's it!

335
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:09,281
that…

336
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,182
(Marni) It's me

337
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,622
Miss it for your salary

338
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,593
I came back because I realized it

339
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,429
(Miho) Did you take it on your own?

340
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,532
No, I didn't have time

341
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:32,371
Oh, so I'll force Akari to take a look...

342
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:36,141
Something... sorry!

343
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,478
Haa...

344
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:45,350
Well, I'm sorry I wasn't there on time

345
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:48,020
There's no such thing in the future

346
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,522
(Marni) Yes

347
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:58,797
(Cosmo)

348
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:03,168
Of course, this isn't there

349
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:08,173
Can I go to the police?

350
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,177
Wow, this is well...

351
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,246
So, is it okay to have official recruitment?

352
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:17,883
That's a different story, it depends on the evaluation

353
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,689
Rating from Satsuki It's coming, would you like to take a look?

354
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,457
It's where I want

355
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:29,161
Taro-chan...

356
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,164
Ｓ

357
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,399
Yes!

358
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,035
Cosmo...

359
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,371
It's already a big response

360
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,773
I doubted me like that and hit me

361
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,774
Ｅ

362
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:44,142
Ｅ

363
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,748
What is E? Does that mean it's okay? Does that mean good?

364
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:51,650
E is the lowest rating

365
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,251
Not adopted

366
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,560
Twitch

367
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,829
What do you think?

368
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:10,369
I'm really being hit, is it okay to be rejected?

369
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,704
Hmm... not adopted

370
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,773
...not...

371
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:17,442
How about a re-examination?

372
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,481
Haa I understand

373
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,983
I won't go to the police

374
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:26,852
(Marni) That's good. That's good. This is the solution.

375
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:29,888
(Marni) That's good. That's good. This is the solution.

376
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:29,888
♪～

377
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,958
When it comes to Marni's origins, it's your fault.

378
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:36,361
So let's all go out drinking with my treat!

379
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,664
(Cosmo) Oh! You know what it's like, brother

380
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,169
Sorry Cosmo

381
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:46,605
picture? The lady isn't bad, isn't it?

382
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,540
I have my fault too, too

383
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:50,809
Uh no side

384
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:53,745
And I'm the only thing I steal is my heart

385
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,314
(Lily) That's something plagiarism, right?

386
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,020
I'm sorry Marni too

387
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:05,657
No, it's my fault for slugging

388
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,159
Sorry for causing trouble, on the other hand

389
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,196
Everyone is too kind

390
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:14,099
There are a lot of things happening though

391
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,801
I hope you'll continue to look forward to Akari-chan too

392
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:19,971
I'll do my best for Paradiso

393
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:21,039
(Yagaraku) Yes

394
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,408
Hehehe Yes

395
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:30,782
Yes! What does that mean?

396
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,684
Cosmo

397
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:35,854
This really does make a hand

398
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,658
(Cosmo) You're a good woman

399
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,496
Okay, shall we go drinking?

400
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:45,831
(Marni) Let's go Let's go

401
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:50,769
～♪

402
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:51,870
(Miho) Come

403
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,271
(Akari) I'm coming

404
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,650
(Female) Isn't it strange for business?

405
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,552
(Miho) It's no point being a man just there.

406
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,354
(Gokou) Request for a couple

407
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:11,923
One treatment can help two people

408
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,991
(Marni) in the guest room

409
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,726
It looks like I've been locked up

410
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:15,794
Can't you help me?

411
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:17,929
Oh!?
