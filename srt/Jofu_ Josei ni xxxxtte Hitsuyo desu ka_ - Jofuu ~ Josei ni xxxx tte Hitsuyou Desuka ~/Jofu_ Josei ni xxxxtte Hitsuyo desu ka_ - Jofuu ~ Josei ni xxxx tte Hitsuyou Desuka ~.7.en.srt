1
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:06,172
(Kei) Thank you again today

2
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:08,174
I'll nominate again soon

3
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:10,210
(Rio) Until then, I'll improve my man again

4
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:13,747
No more, so it's not possible

5
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:21,721
(Kanon and Cosmo talk)

6
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,656
Cosmo?

7
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:27,827
(Cosmo) Now I'll take you to Hime Station.

8
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:29,396
(Kannon) Thank you

9
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:30,930
- (Cosmo) Let's go- (Kanon) Yes

10
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:36,469
- (Yutaka) I'm off - (Yagira) Yutaka Turn it!

11
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,038
Slowly Slowly!

12
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:40,407
- (Yagaraku) Do you have any legs? Do you have legs? - (Yutaka) Ah, I have legs!

13
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:41,975
I have legs! Squeeze it!

14
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,743
- (Yagaraku) Squeeze it! - (Miho) It's noisy!!

15
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,680
Don't get in the way, don't get in the way!

16
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:52,886
(Yagaraku, Yutaka, Lily) Sorry...

17
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:55,321
(Akari) Please be careful, the store manager.

18
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,057
It's bloody fuss about Trump

19
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:58,792
I miss Macau

20
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:00,026
(The sound of the door closing) Come on, clean up quickly, hurry up!

21
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:00,960
Come on, quickly clean up, hurry up!

22
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:02,562
-(Rio)Thank you for your hard work-(Yagaraku)

23
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,330
-(Akari)Thank you for your hard work-(Miho)Rio

24
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,369
I'd like this

25
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:12,272
(Miho) Ah, thank you

26
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,609
Is Cosmo running today?

27
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:22,515
Cosmo is about to work and will not be working this far.

28
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,017
(Rio) Hmm... (The sound of the door opening)

29
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:29,022
Yes, you're tired

30
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,491
(Rio) Does Cosmo have a girlfriend?

31
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:34,894
Women from all over the world are potential girlfriends

32
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:36,296
(Rio) Do you have a daughter?

33
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,601
We haven't seen you for a while

34
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:42,902
(Rio) Oh well

35
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:46,573
(Cosmo) Cosmo toilet

36
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:49,476
(Door opening and closing sound)

37
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:52,078
A bit ok?

38
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:58,318
Maybe I'm meeting a customer at Cosmo's Dama

39
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:01,087
What... is it a back-punch?

40
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,989
If it's Miho, then you're fired

41
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:06,493
I just saw him holding hands with a young girl

42
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:09,028
Usually she's...

43
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:10,263
Not

44
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,732
Manager, try packing it up

45
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,667
I was suspicious once

46
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:17,737
I can't move unless there's certain evidence

47
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:21,374
(Miho) If that's the case, would you buy a confession pill?

48
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,510
Miho doesn't look stylish so please stop

49
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,447
I don't think Cosmo does that.

50
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:30,049
Akari-chan holds you very well

51
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:36,589
Cosmos are a bit of a joke and sloppy

52
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,058
Sometimes I lie

53
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,226
It's a mess

54
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:44,764
But I think he's a person who doesn't do anything unfair

55
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,099
perhaps

56
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:52,906
The better the person, the more suspicious it is

57
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,179
♪～

58
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,572
～♪

59
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,174
(Cosmo) Ah, don't cry, don't cry

60
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,475
hey? Because it's okay

61
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,345
It's okay, it's okay, isn't it?

62
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,981
Ha... thank you

63
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:10,116
My daughter is crying so hard

64
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,919
(Shop clerk) Haha... Please take your time

65
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,590
(Kannon) Sorry, cry again

66
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:20,560
Ah Moman Tie Moman Tie, isn't it?

67
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:23,396
- (Cosmo) Ah, please come - (Kanon)

68
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,300
Ah, sorry, sorry...

69
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,069
Oh, let's make the temperature gentler

70
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,441
Cosmo?

71
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,812
Ah, Cosmo

72
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,447
I often go here too...

73
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:46,686
Ah sorry

74
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:47,920
(Cosmo) Ah Akari-chan

75
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:51,157
Um... it's my daughter

76
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,993
Sorry to talk to you

77
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,428
Sorry

78
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:02,902
(Cosmo) Haa...

79
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:06,439
What's wrong?

80
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,976
You didn't meet your daughter, did you?

81
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,811
It's not working today

82
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:20,186
Ats!

83
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:24,357
(Akari) That person has appointed Cosmo for the first time

84
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:27,327
I know it's Kanon

85
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:35,301
I want to be a source of help for Cosmo.

86
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:47,814
My boyfriend kicked me out at night, but it was one-sided

87
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,417
Poor thing but

88
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:55,555
This may be common if a couple is living together

89
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,858
(Cosmo) It's her house

90
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:00,560
picture?

91
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:02,562
And...

92
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,203
sorry

93
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:14,440
If I laugh too much, I feel relieved that it's so funny

94
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,797
Cosmos are so kind

95
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,035
I…

96
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:50,510
My boyfriend is domesticated...

97
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:53,379
Cosmo

98
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:55,481
yes!

99
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,652
I'm getting annoyed too

100
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:01,754
That's right

101
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,022
I thought I'd get mad

102
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:07,960
That's not good to meet customers outside of work.

103
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,395
As you said

104
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:14,333
But I want to break up with my boyfriend somehow

105
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,303
Does Kanon want that?

106
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,538
of course!

107
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,874
But if I talk about breaking up

108
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,077
He gets angry and gets even more violent...

109
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:26,479
That's not good

110
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:30,850
I'll look into how to break up with my domestic boyfriend

111
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:32,652
Akari-chan...

112
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,926
And why not talk to everyone about this?

113
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:40,993
(Cosmo) What?

114
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:47,834
If it's good for Kanon

115
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:57,743
(Akari) "We will never talk about breaking up together."

116
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,878
Ha...

117
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,214
"Because I'll be hit"

118
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,648
Haa

119
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,819
(Hiroki) Do you work until you get back?

120
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:12,592
Search for a solution to a little bit of a problem, rather than a job

121
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,862
(Hiroki) There seem to be a lot of trouble with sex industry

122
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,497
(Akari) What is that way to say...

123
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:22,935
So, I'll make pasta too

124
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:24,737
picture?

125
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:26,138
(The sound of the door opening)

126
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,206
picture!?

127
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,476
thank you

128
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:35,281
(Rio) Is that what it is after all

129
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:39,552
(Cosmo) Damn, is this a nation ruled in law?

130
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,520
- (Yagiraku) Oirya- (Cosmo) Ah, what...?

131
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:44,023
Scary scary scary scary... Scary scary scary scary scary scary scary

132
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,626
Manager... Isn't it too much?

133
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,462
It's not permitted to meet in the store without permission.

134
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,131
This is reasonable

135
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,699
Anyway, to that woman

136
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,969
He was told, "Cosmos are so kind."

137
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,071
I'm worried

138
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:02,542
You're saying things like, "I'll blow it away," right?

139
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,043
Baba... Idiot guy!

140
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,279
I'm saying it's completely right

141
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:07,813
Akari-chan, don't betray you

142
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,848
Cosmo

143
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,884
I think Cosmo is my peer

144
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,552
I'm not going to betray you

145
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:16,222
Is it necessary to share in detail?

146
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,325
I'd rather not be grateful to Akari-chan

147
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,127
yes

148
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:25,131
I'm crying to think that this old man is a peer

149
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,268
(Rio) If you have any arguments

150
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,403
Let's say it early

151
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,237
(Cosmo) Ah! Let's say it early

152
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,539
Wait a minute!

153
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:34,473
(Cosmo) Scary Scary Scary Scary Scary

154
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,208
Me and Cosmo

155
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:39,845
I just wanted to talk to both of you about what to do.

156
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,214
Why is it like an investigation?

157
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,950
It's an interrogation?

158
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,485
Akari-chan thank you for the secret message

159
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:47,954
I'm thinking that...

160
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,189
Akari-chan is fine now

161
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,328
At this shop

162
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:59,165
She was the first person to nominate me.

163
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,602
Kanon was laughing, so cute

164
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:08,040
Even though it was tough, he laughed until I shed tears

165
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:14,213
After that, every time we meet, we went karaoke rather than sexually.

166
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,850
I had more time to talk normally

167
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:23,022
It's getting harder to get money

168
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,759
What would you do if you broke up with your boyfriend?

169
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,965
Change your smartphone number

170
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,968
I'm moving

171
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,805
OK, let's switch all the cakes

172
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,276
that's why

173
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,880
I think I'll stop using Jofuu too.

174
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,419
That's definitely good

175
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:58,190
(Rio) I see

176
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,126
You won't be like that

177
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:05,031
(Yagaraku) There's no reason to meet without going through the store.

178
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:06,932
Cosmo

179
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,468
Have you fallen in love with Kanon?

180
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,470
I'm worried

181
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:15,074
He's the same age as his daughter who has divorced and hasn't met.

182
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,576
I can no longer think of someone else

183
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,549
I don't think so, but I guess they haven't lent money or anything, right?

184
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,292
That's no good this person

185
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,193
Let's tie it down

186
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,561
Wait, wait!

187
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:36,762
Why don't you understand?

188
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,064
Simply put,

189
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,466
Don't talk to customers' private life

190
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,301
I don't want to say anything, I want to help you!

191
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,703
The woman hasn't told me to "help me"?

192
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:49,809
If you can get in touch with Kanon about SOS

193
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,477
Go and blow that guy anytime

194
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,378
I'll let you part!

195
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,113
Don't save

196
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,183
What we can do is get paid

197
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:59,685
It's about making people forget something unfairly

198
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:01,087
different!

199
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,690
I'm not talking about work, I'm talking about people!

200
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:10,429
You, if someone is injured in front of you, you'll help me, right?

201
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,631
Simply put, that's all!

202
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,502
This is Paradiso

203
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,872
The old man belongs to Paradiso

204
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:23,008
I met that girl through Paradiso.

205
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,411
The most priority is

206
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:28,881
It's not about humanity, it's about following Paradiso rules.

207
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:30,750
That's...

208
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:34,153
I'm talking about work, not people's

209
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,925
I can't divide

210
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,528
Isn't that a robot?

211
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,804
Haa

212
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:53,339
Haa...

213
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,711
Woo... Woo

214
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,717
Haa...

215
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,589
Woo

216
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,396
Haa... We've all protected this shop together.

217
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,266
I just can't rely on

218
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:21,700
To Miho

219
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:24,570
I'm making you play a useless role

220
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:28,474
Shoko always has passion

221
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:32,044
He trains therapists

222
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,013
And Akari too

223
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,150
The therapists are doing their best too

224
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,855
This is the money that everyone earned.

225
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,861
Pay rent with this money and pay taxes

226
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:52,331
And then I'll pay back to everyone

227
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:56,635
Every time I count my money, I feel more attentive

228
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:02,241
There are no robots in this business.

229
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,144
They're all human

230
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,450
Sorry

231
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,090
That's right

232
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,894
Everyone is human

233
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:25,731
Of course, money itself is also berry love.

234
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:26,999
(Sniffing sound)

235
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:31,370
I don't think I know what's really

236
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:42,281
(Cell phone notification sound)

237
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,196
What should I do...

238
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,734
(Akari) What's wrong? Rio-san

239
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:05,004
(Rio) Why did you get so excited?

240
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,040
I really regret it

241
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:12,411
Youth is also good sometimes

242
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,180

00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,021

244
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,391
What's wrong?

245
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:31,096
(Cosmo) Kanon Apparently my boyfriend found out he was meeting me

246
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:33,932
I'm furious and I'll help you because I'm coming

247
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,734
Tell the police

248
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:39,004
Even if we say it, it won't move, so it's not in time

249
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,606
Where are you going?

250
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:44,843
I'm sure I'll go and help

251
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,681
So we'll meet for work

252
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,250
Have you got the money properly?

253
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,392
Cosmo, please go

254
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,562
I don't think you need any money

255
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,331
Akari-chan, what are you talking about?

256
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:09,501
I think I understand what you're saying

257
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:12,071
So I'll say it

258
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:14,940

260
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:19,378
Go and help now

261
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:23,716
If that were the case, it would be fine for the store manager and Rio, right?

262
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:27,119
It's not that there's no problem though

263
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:28,687
Old man

264
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,958
That's a good idea to quit because you're strict

265
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:39,264
If that conversation were to go around that year, I wouldn't be able to work in the industry anymore.

266
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,435
Is it true? Manager

267
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,739
It's a small industry

330
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,167

338
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,492
Rio will not cause any trouble to the store from now on.

No, there's nothing I can do about it now

00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:05,057
And I've borrowed a lot of money

358
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:10,562
Ah, if anything like that comes up, I'll have no choice but to give up

359
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,066

(Akari) Make you smile

366
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,752
There are plenty of good things to live!

367
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,120
(Chihiro) Do you know me?

368
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:09,955
(Marni) I'm nervous

369
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:12,591
(Lily) Have you ever dealt with celebrities?

00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:14,893
Jof Uber? That kind of place...

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,929
Don't fight for me
