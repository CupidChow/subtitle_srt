1
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:14,914
(Akari) I want someone to talk to me

2
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:19,085
I wonder if I'll try it

3
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:28,962
I broke up with my boyfriend and it's just a sex industry right away...

4
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,165
No, but leave it to this momentum

5
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,139
Hmm, but...

6
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,876
No, isn't it now after all?

7
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:44,044
Because now...

8
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:47,213
(Ringtone) I want to be kind to the explosion!

9
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,481
(Ringtone)

10
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,217
♪～

11
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:51,611
～♪

12
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,183
(knock)

13
00:01:58,585 --> 00:01:59,586
(Akari) Yes

14
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,492
(Kai) It's Kai~ I'm waiting

15
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:07,927
(Akari) Ah...

16
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,232
Maybe the atmosphere isn't that big...

17
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,566
What... please

18
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:19,239
(Kai) Can I borrow a hanger?

19
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,573
(Akari) Ah yes

20
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,875
(Kai) Thank you

21
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:26,646
(Akari) But it's not the type that's so nervous.

22
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,181
Maybe it's just right

23
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,354
Actually, I work in Jofuu.

24
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,156
What? Are you a fellow worker?

25
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:37,223
(Akari) Yes

26
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:41,628
My favorite senior at home worker will quit.

27
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:43,663
Ranker therapists don't communicate.

28
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,298
I'm going to break up with my boyfriend

29
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,667
Isn't it too much of a traffic jam?

30
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:52,672
So I want someone to talk to me

31
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:57,677
I'll listen to everything, and it's so relaxing I want to make you forget everything

32
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,579
A therapist!

33
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,115
But I don't feel sexual today

34
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,984
Of course, we are very welcome to talk about it alone.

35
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,220
thank you

36
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:13,359
Um, it's really tough being a therapist, right?

37
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:14,928
Illness or something

38
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,530
Ah, I'm sick

39
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,199
I'm also the first year, so I'm really sick

40
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,401
Is it common to therapists?

41
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,269
It's an industry that's prone to fires up

42
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,171
Well, but I'm sick

43
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:28,007
I wonder if it's okay to do this kind of work

44
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:29,709
(Akari) Why?

45
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:33,079
No, this job is symptomatic treatment

46
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:36,549
Just smile for 90 minutes and get paid

47
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,252
I really think I can't do anything

48
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,656
That's not the case

49
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:47,627
There are many helpful users

50
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:48,628
Really?

51
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:49,696
Really!

52
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:53,533
I'm an office worker who is interacting with users, so I'm definitely saying this.

53
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,568
thank you

54
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,570
Something I've been comforted

55
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,340
(2 people) Hahaha...

56
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:03,743
Do you really need sexual feelings?

57
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,311
I don't need it

58
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:06,679
Really really?

59
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,281
Oh, it's really

60
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:09,983
What's true?

61
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:15,555
Uh... Uhh...

62
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:20,059
(Moeko) Let's live together here from now on

63
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,128
(Taro) What?

64
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:23,997
Three nights and four days...

65
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:27,667
That's right, living together for 4 days (dosei)

66
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:28,835
What is that?

67
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:29,836
(Moeko) Yes

68
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,571
Let's go to the bath together right away

69
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:32,639
(Taro) Yes

70
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:37,944
What? Is it on top?

71
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,179
-(Moeko) That's right-(Taro) Amazing

72
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,819
(Lily) Yes

73
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:48,988
(Akari) Huh?

74
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:55,061
(Lily) Miho is quitting, and there's also Rio

75
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:57,864
Akarin Thank you for your hard work

76
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:01,434
Why are you all so kind?

77
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,237
I think it's normal

78
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:06,873
It's not normal

79
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:07,573
(The sound of the door opening and closing) Not normal

80
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:08,975
(Door opening and closing sound)

81
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,209
(Door opening and closing sound) (Yagira) Akari-chan

82
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:13,146
So let's go to Rio's house

83
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:14,213
yes

84
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,516
Have you been contacted?

85
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:17,817
I can't get it but

86
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:20,286
When something similar happened before

87
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,522
Because the key was handed over

88
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,027
please

89
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,530
We all admire Rio

90
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,900
(Akari) Yes I know

91
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,508
(Yagaraku)

92
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,210
Are you alive?

93
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:47,280
I'll be in the way

94
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:53,920
- (Yagaraku) Ah! -(Akari) No!

95
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:56,956
(Yagaraku) There's no one there!

96
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,727
Rio, are you okay?

97
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,164
Why didn't you go to work?

98
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,637
I managed to manage because the other person was an acquaintance of mine

99
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,741
Everyone was worried?

100
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,510
It's good that it wasn't an accident

101
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,050
(Rio's sob)

102
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:27,353
picture! what happened? Are you okay?

103
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,491
(Rio) Everyone hates me...

104
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:37,563
It's probably impossible to be number one if you're hated

105
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,798
It's meaningless...

106
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:43,569
Only children can be forgiven for crying...

107
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,138
That's not the case!

108
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:53,146
Even if there are strange posts on the internet, or there are rumors of lies circulating

109
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:57,617
Me and everyone at Paradiso

110
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:02,522
I love you and respect you

111
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,027
Really?

112
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:12,899
(Akari) And

113
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,502
I

114
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,440
An email from a user who said that Rio helped me

115
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:23,242
I've seen a lot

116
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,680
Rio saw it too

117
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,986
From customers who know the real Rio

118
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,589
I received a request today too

119
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,860
Still can't believe it?

120
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,201
believe

121
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,441
(Yagaraku) Okay, then let's go to the office for now.

122
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,312
yes

123
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:10,990
I'll try my best again, but Is there anything I need to do before that? Rio

124
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,363
Sorry for the inconvenience...

125
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,835
Sorry

126
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:29,742
(Rio)

127
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,046
-(Lily) What tastes? - (Rio) Caramel

128
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,048
Isn't it too fast to recover?

129
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:38,684
Rather, let's take it as reliable

130
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,353
I see, I can't take it

131
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,221
Rio-kun

132
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:45,124
I got a request but haven't responded yet

133
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,692
I'm determined to go

134
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,593
Let me go

135
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,630
Please, my number 2 (two)

136
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:55,701
picture? Are you demoted already? Isn't it a lie?

137
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,171
That's right

138
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:02,808
Taro: Have you received a long call from us for the first time?

139
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,211
I haven't come in particular but

140
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,779
Isn't it okay?

141
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:10,182
When I heard that, I started to worry

142
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,687
(Moeko) Last night was fun

143
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:15,855
(Taro) Me too

144
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,692
(Moeko) Then I'll go to work

145
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,894
I'm going to work already

146
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,896
Take care

147
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,465
(Sound of doors closing) (Taro) Welcome back

148
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:27,433
(Moeko) What?

149
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,735
(Taro) Huh? What is it?

150
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,305
-(Moeko) It's scary-(Taro) Hehe... It's not scary

151
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,340
still? still?

152
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,708
- (Taro) Here - (Moeko) Yes

153
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:38,978
3 2 1 Jean

154
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:42,782
(Moeko) Did you cook Taro-chan's meal?

155
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:44,884
I actually love cooking

156
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:47,153
I had the time so I made lots

157
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,255
Can I eat it all?

158
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:52,959
(Moeko) Hmm... I'm happy

159
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,094
so?

160
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,730
I'll do this much, what's better tomorrow?

161
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,799
(Moeko) Why am I happy?

162
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:06,639
(2 people)

163
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,217
(Moeko) Ah...

164
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:24,156
Haa haa haa...

165
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,336
The best thing to have a therapist at home

166
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,571
Isn't that right?

167
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:49,482
I'm coming

168
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:50,883
Take care

169
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:12,471
Haa...

170
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,216
(Moeko Taro)

171
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,328
It's already the last day

172
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,100
Can't you extend it?

173
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,138
Um... another day?

174
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,373
Yeah

175
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:51,177
It's not impossible, but

176
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,979
I might be late for my home because I have plans

177
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,249
So cooking and sexuality can be difficult

178
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,918
That's good

179
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,586
That's fine if you come back

180
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,023
Yeah

181
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,092
If Moeko is fine, it's fine

182
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,326
I did it

183
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,261
I'll contact the office then

184
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:10,329
Yeah

185
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,636
- (Akari) Manager- (Yagaraku) Huh?

186
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:22,475
Recently, I've received a request from a male user from Gokou.

187
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,943
Watch YouTube

188
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:27,146
It seems like he wants to learn about women's bodies from Gokou-san.

189
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:31,951
I see, is there any demand for that?

190
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:33,219
That's interesting

191
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:34,487
(The sound of the door closing)

192
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:36,455
(Marni) Aloha

193
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:39,625
I see, Marni was a long trip.

194
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,027
Hawaii 6 days was fun

195
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,830
It's burned and the impression is different from the photo

196
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:48,167
I'll be a dark-skinned character for a while

197
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,369
Don't say anything you like...

198
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,405
(Sound of door closing) (Ren) Agnohaseyo

199
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,808
Korean souvenirs now

200
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,977
Thank you for your long hard work Ren-kun

201
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,311
Long overseas

202
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:03,582
There are money in people who have money, right?

203
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,586
Have you felt something different to you, Ren?

204
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:10,322
It's really boring to have five days

205
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:12,825
I've done a lot with the customers

206
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,928
Shouldn't Ren also take another photo of his promotional material?

207
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,866
- (Ren) Yes- (Yagaraku) Yes

208
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:21,767
(The sound of the door closing)

209
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:29,241
Rio? what happened!?

210
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,877
(Shoko) was almost falling outside

211
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:35,014
I tried too hard I don't like it anymore

212
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,852
(Akari) I told you to tell me when it was impossible

213
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:46,759
Overcoming a crisis

214
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:51,030
Paradiso is finally reaching its heyday!

215
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:55,401
What is the heyday of your life?

216
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:56,535
Ahh

217
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,504
Miho also quit

218
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,106
If things continue like this, Akari will collapse, right?

219
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,041
(Yagaraku) What?

220
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:05,211
Please hire a new office worker as soon as possible.

221
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:06,278
yes

222
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:10,883
Akari must properly tell you

223
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,985
Shoko-san...

224
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,691
I couldn't say it...

225
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:20,326
Okay

226
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:23,429
Ah, I'd go to another store's Jofu for expenses.

227
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:24,630
What if you relieve stress?

228
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,732
Please use the expenses

229
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:42,481
Ah, have you used it already?

230
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,818
Akarin said he wouldn't use it because he has a boyfriend

231
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:47,620
Because I broke up

232
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,121
how was it? Jofu

233
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:54,393
Umm, it's like a counseling session?

234
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:56,528
(Marni) Ugh?

235
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:57,997
Really?

236
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,671
Oh, I hope you find a good office worker.

237
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,905
Right!

238
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:11,710
Ahahaha...

239
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:16,916
Ah, I'm busy today too, huh

240
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:22,021
(Hiroki) I was so moved, or rather surprised, watching "Gokou Channel"

241
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,856
(Goku) Thank you

242
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,859
(Hiroki) I had a girlfriend

243
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,296
But I realized that I didn't know anything...

244
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,299
(Goku) It's no use

245
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:37,002
And it's never too late to know

246
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,940
Something I want to hear

247
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:43,842
Actually, there are so many things I want to talk about.

248
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,283
He often spoke to someone like me

249
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:54,186
What I can say is

250
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:57,589
She is just

251
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,592
I was desperate to follow the work

252
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,599
I was desperate for work...

253
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:14,239
But I'm just denial...

254
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,742
(cry)

255
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,481
Those tears

256
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,550
Wake up

257
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,251
It's tears of...

258
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,688
Come on, Hiroki

259
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:35,294
Let's start Hiroki's true life

260
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:37,963
(Hiroki) Gokou-san!

261
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:43,836
Yes, it releases confidence

262
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:44,737
(Hiroki) Gokou...!

263
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,105
Extended today

264
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:47,973
Yeah

265
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,911
It's painful, I can't breathe

266
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,680
Are you okay?

267
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,849
If you request an extension again

268
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:59,318
Don't you say you have a reservation for overnight stays and refuse?

269
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,353
Is it okay?

270
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,855
(Akari) Taro is in Taro

271
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:06,392
It's okay to do it the most effortless way

272
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,193
I'll follow you if something happens

273
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,266
(Taro) Moeko

274
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,935
I'll go home today

275
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:22,074
The daytime workers are getting pretty busy too

276
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,376
Next time, in perfect condition

277
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:27,346
I'll build up my strength so that I can serve Moeko!

278
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,222
I had an affair until last year for three years

279
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,957
Umm...

280
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,896
When I woke up in the morning there was someone next to me

281
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,900
Eat breakfast together like this

282
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:54,673
I've always wanted something like that so I can't let go of something

283
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,708
Sorry, hold it down for days

284
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,215
Hehehe

285
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,918
No, but it's really tough

286
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,886
I'm about to become one

287
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:10,122
I feel like I want to dig my nose and fart

288
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,093
picture? Moeko doesn't seem to pick her nose

289
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:16,695
No, I'll dig it up

290
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,663
What a human being

291
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,833
A week was really fun

292
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:22,601
Thank you

293
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:23,936
Yeah

294
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,641
My breasts are flapping

295
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:34,746
I'll fill it up so I don't fill it too much, so please call me anytime.

296
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,290
(Akari) Thank you for your hard work

297
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:47,960
Finally got a good night's sleep at my house?

298
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:51,130
There's a lot to learn, but it's not easy

299
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,698
I'll just short for a while

300
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:54,032
(Akari) Ah

301
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:59,271
This is the sales of Taro this time.

302
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:00,506
I'm jealous

303
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,877
Amazing

304
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:06,645
My fatigue has been wiped out!

305
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:09,081
Akari-san, please make a long reservation

306
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:10,482
OK

307
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,684
So I'll drink today

308
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,586
Of course I'll drink today too

309
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,889
(Akari) Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe

310
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,727
Today's day is also good

311
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,631
The first time I met Miho

312
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,534
It's like pouring milk tea into the night sky⸺

313
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,570
It was Higashikoenji in the middle of summer

314
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,305
I took a three-point shot...

315
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:34,773
Uuuh...

316
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,674
It's dripping

317
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,710
Thank you for your hard work Miho-chan, Paradiso!

(Miho) Ami Good luck

324
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,794
Yes, I'll become a ranker and make money!

325

Good luck with Taro too

326
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,897
- (Taro) Yes I'll do my best! - (Yutaka) Okay

327
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,199
Miho

328

Thank you so much for your help

(Miho) Lily Thank you

330
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:10,509
I can't believe there will be a day when I can't drink at a farewell party

331
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,844
Because it's for the baby in the stomach

332
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,149
It's not strict with children

333
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:19,518
(Miho) What does that mean?

334
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,520
Number 2

335
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,655
Is it really demoted?

336
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,257
I'm kidding

337
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:28,393
I'll soon be number one in terms of ability

338
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,596
cheers

339
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:32,264
Thank you for your hard work

340
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,367
Everyone, is there a good one?

341
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,136
(Yagaraku) Let's take a picture

342
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:39,838
So, since we're going to take a photo here

343
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,106
Let's take a picture right now, right?

344
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,741
Everyone come over here

345
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:46,445
- (Marni) Manager- (Yagiraku) Ahhhh...

346
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:48,981
Yes yes OK OK

347
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,215
So everyone should come

348
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,317
- (Manager) Yes, let's go? - (Akari and others) Yes

349
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:55,087
- (Manager) Yes- (Everyone)

350
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:56,388
(Shutter sound)

351
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:58,890
(Yagaraku) That's good

352
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,127
Hey, I want to get in too

353
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,030
(Akari and others) Oh

354
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,233
Yes... the store isn't long though

355
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,435
Well... the store isn't long though

356
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:11,737
Is that okay?

357
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,605
(Shoko) Hehehe...

358
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,875
(Akari) Thank you so much, Miho

359
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,811
I'm the one who helped me the most

360
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:20,979
Ugh

361
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:24,116
Akari-chan is here so I can quit with peace of mind

362
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:25,017
thank you

363
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:28,920
(Shoko) Paradiso is still getting bigger

364
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:32,024
How was it when you tried working at Jofu?

365
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:37,429
Hmm... there are a lot of people with habits

366
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,131
Everyone is kind

367
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:43,168
Have you found out if women need sex?

368
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:45,103
