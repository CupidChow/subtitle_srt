1
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:08,074
(Akari) Everyone has a more or less secret

2
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:09,609
- (Chihiro) Please - (Staff) Thank you

3
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,378
-(Staff) I'm so busy-(Chihiro) Thank you very much

4
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:13,413
- (Staff) Great work- (Staff) Thank you for your hard work

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,485
(Women's fuss)

6
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:24,357
(Staff) Let's go down Let's go down Let's go down...

7
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,360
It goes down and goes down and it's no good...

8
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:43,143
(Akari) Even if you keep holding it and get crushed by its weight

9
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,945
Continue walking with a casual look

10
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:50,617
If you stop, you will notice the pain

11
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:53,787
Because I can't move

12
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:58,558
Even if it's just a moment, reveal everything

13
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:05,665
Can I admit the pain and heal the wound a little?

14
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,069
♪～

15
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,462
～♪

16
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:12,699
(Yagira) Sales indicators were analyzed through the process

17
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:14,267
I hope it's here...

18
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,335
(Sound of a bamboo sword thrust)

19
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,738
(Shoko) So I wonder if this person is in charge

20
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,641
Hmm? What does it mean? Shoko-chan

21
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,710
I, the store manager, will be in charge...

22
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:24,978
(Shoko)

23
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:29,182
Is the store manager the person who acted insanely and ended up getting into police?

24
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:32,752
It's been a while, but it's safe. The misunderstanding has cleared up and gonyo gonyo...

25
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,053
(Shoko) Miho-chan, please

26
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,121
(Miho) Yes

27
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,928
As you can see, my paradiso is

28
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,964
The current situation is that it is based on ranker sales.

29
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:47,200
(Shoko) It's an industry where a lot of people quit

30
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,968
I want to hit my hands early

31
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:50,870
Is it okay to say something?

32
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:56,543
-(Miho) I'll allow it -(Yagaraku) Oh... uh...

33
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,412
I'm continuing to promote double therapists

34
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,313
Isn't that possible?

35
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,148
- (Akari) Yes- (Miho) Yes

36
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:04,751
(Akari) Couple courses for couples and couples

37
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:08,421
I think it would be better if the more lighter the image of the image increases.

38
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:09,355
ah

39
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:14,627
Both treatments are done by three people, so please proceed with the dedicated training as soon as possible.

40
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:19,432
How about a seminar where men explain women's bodies?

41
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,935
I'm sure Goko-san will be a hot topic.

42
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:26,139
Activities other than treatment by therapist

43
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,340
It's not a talent agency

44
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,909
There are many things that need to be decided, etc.

45
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,844
Maybe it's good to put it in perspective

46
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,681
(Akari) And that's the fundamental thing

47
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:38,785
How a therapist who is less nominated will get a more nomination

48
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,520
Isn't it anything other than the internet?

49
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,355
There is

50
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:43,389
Ah, there is

51
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,061
(Boy) Please come today

52
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:48,962
thank you

53
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,029
We will show you your seat

54
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:51,197
(Female) Hello

55
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,668
What is this...

56
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:06,879
Here we have a therapist who actually works at the Jofu store.

57
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:08,114
Enjoy chatting

58
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,783
Call me people Jofuuver

59
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,320
Jo... Jofuuba? That kind of place...

60
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:17,190
I'll talk to the owner so please check it out

61
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,259
Hey, the store manager! Don't leave me alone...!

62
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:20,860
- (Akari)... Ugh (Yagara)

63
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,396
Manager...

64
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:24,631
(MATSU) Customer

65
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,802
Hello, this is MATSU from Smart.

66
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,371
Ah

67
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,007
(Ayato) This is Ayato from Dolce.

68
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,074
Ah

69
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,145
Two people all at once...

70
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:42,081
Both of you are in different stores

71
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:46,386
There are therapists from various stores working here.

72
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:49,188
please

73
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:50,256
Ah

74
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,428
(MATSU) Are you nervous?

75
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,897
A bit sigh...

76
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,902
We don't show our faces because we have our main job.

77
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,471
Come here and look beyond the mosaic

78
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,006
I hope you like it

79
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:10,276
(Ayato) Once you meet, you can make a reservation with peace of mind

80
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:14,881
Certainly, it's very helpful for a user.

81
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:20,987
Is that the concept so quiet?

82
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:23,856
Ah

83
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,830
Before I knew it, I was toasting

84
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,804
And if there's a therapist you like

85
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,605
You can meet up and go on a date after this

86
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,709
"Would you like to get out of Jofuuba?"

87
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,746
Well... that's sexy

88
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,047
(Ayato) It's sexy, isn't it?

89
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,615
It's rare though

90
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,551
Wow

91
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,453
(Boy) Hey... aaaah

92
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,488
(Musashi) Do you like strong men?

93
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:59,192
Hello, this is Musashi from STEGORO, a macho specialty store.

94
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,461
(Boy) Ah... Customer Is that okay?

95
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:03,496
Ah... Ah...

96
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,365
please

97
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:09,102
Ah... yes

98
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:17,677
Ah...

99
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,011
Oh, a bit...

100
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:20,113
Hahahaha...

101
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:24,117
Muscle merry-go-round!

102
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,853
- (Musashi) Hahahaha... - (Akari) Hahaha...

103
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:29,522
customer

104
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,360
Please use this

105
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,029
(Ayato) It got dirty with sweat

106
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,667
(Akari) Ah... ah yes

107
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,003
MATSU

108
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,939
Do you have any complaints about your sales method?

109
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,608
Ha ha ha

110
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:53,112
However, I wonder if Musashi always really enjoys his strengths?

111
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:56,749
I have to show off my differences with MATSU, who is just a visual.

112
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,653
-(MATSU) Huh? -(Musashi) Huh?

113
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:03,222
-(MATSU) What is it? -(Musashi) What is it?

114
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:06,793
(Akari) Don't fight for me

115
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:09,562
(Yagaraku) I'm sorry about Akari-chan's fun

116
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:10,763
yes

117
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,032
Ah no, I'm studying

118
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,201
From now on, two people will also be from Para's therapist.

119
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,104
I've been given this to Jof Uber.

120
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,072
What? Is it true?

121
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:23,342
(Musashi) Para is about Rio and Ren, right?

122
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:27,079
Those two are also famous in the industry.

123
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,681
certainly

124
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:31,818
(MATSU) If the two of us came, the store would be even more exciting

125
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:35,188
But we don't know who we'll do it yet, right?

126
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:37,824
(Ayato) What? I want to meet Rio

127
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,560
I mean, I don't know about other people

128
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:44,130
(MATSU) I don't know anything except Rio and Ren.

129
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,466
I want to meet you two and study more

130
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,034
(Ayato) Ahhh

131
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,772
I'm sure Rio and Ren both have an aura

132
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,345
(Ami) Please

133
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,214
(Miho) Yes thank you

134
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,853
Now, Ami is officially my therapist.

135
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,321
thank you

136
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:13,392
(Door opening and closing sound)

137
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:16,095
This is a sensible problem!

138
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:20,833
now! We'll hold an emergency meeting right now!

139
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,669
(Miho) What? Monster Parents?

140
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:26,205
I'm completely switched on with Jof Uber

141
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:30,610
This is the slogan I have at home from today!

142
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:37,083
(Yutaka) If all of them were aces... won't the aces go away?

143
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,885
(Akari) Don't sniff!

144
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,388
Don't you feel frustrated when you're left scorned?!

145
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:47,226
No, I mean, I was just scorned, or just not known.

146
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,228
(Lily) Follow me, you're not good

147
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:52,031
For the future of Paradiso

148
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:55,368
Decide who's best to appear in Jofuuba!

149
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:58,971
(Miho) Hmm... Does that mean you're going anywhere other than Rio and Ren?

150
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,573
Is that okay over there?

151
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,074
Wow...

152
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:06,045
We will make a promise with the bar with two people from our house.

153
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:09,315
What is expected is the ability to attract customers

154
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:13,619
It's no problem as long as you can attract customers other than ranked cars!

155
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:16,055
(Yagaraku)... Amazing pressure...

156
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,691
I just became a therapist and don't want to be chosen...

157
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,494
NO MORE Weak hips!

158
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,235
it's okay

159
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,805
I'll backup it

160
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:39,545
I'll take on One For All For One!

161
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:49,655
(Telephone ringtone)

162
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,425
yes! Make you smile

163
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:54,226
There are plenty of good things to live!

164
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,028
yeah? What shop?

165
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:01,000
Ah yes yes tomorrow 5pm yes

166
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,002
The location is... yes

167
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,438
Can you leave the therapist to me?

168
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:06,505
yes

169
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,610
Password...?

170
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:14,580
Ah... I'm insane

171
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:18,818
Yes Yes I'm sorry

172
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,120
(Cancel sound)

173
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:27,159
He was the manager of an entertainment agency!

174
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:30,262
(Miho) Ahhh, I see

175
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:34,166
(Akari) What? picture? What? Is there quite a lot of things?

176
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,602
If the manager is calling,

177
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:37,670
Is it about an idol?

178
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,205
(Akari) Is that what the trend has become?

179
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:40,740
If you're a big actor or something

180
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,275
I'll even send direct telephones from great people to me.

181
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,144
Wow

182
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,847
(Miho) Well, it's not unusual

183
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,448
It's too secretive

184
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:52,385
The downside is that it's difficult to predict what type you like.

185
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:55,287
The entertainment industry is filled with word of mouth quickly

186
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:59,025
This is what I have to carefully select the therapist.

187
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:00,126
(Miho) Yes

188
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,331
I see

189
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,399
(Yagaraku) Huh?

190
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,036
Ha

191
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,775
What do you think?

192
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:21,714
I'm gonna do it

193
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:22,715
(Taro) It's bad

194
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,284
Akari has turned Russian roulette!

195
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,521
Akari-chan That's not right!

196
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,289
- (Yutaka) Taro! - (Taro) Yutaka! (Akari) Is it Taro?

197
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,158
- (Yutaka) Taro! - (Taro) Yutaka! Is it Taro?

198
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,460
Is it Yutaka?

199
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:37,730
Amy?

200
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,498
-(Ami) No no no no... -(Akari) Ami?

201
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:40,933
Lily?

202
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,702
(Lily) Uuuh...

203
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,822
(Marni) Three rice cookers for delivery

204
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,558
I'll put it here

205
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,193
(footsteps)

206
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:11,263
(Lock-free sound)

207
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,671
Even if it's arranging the office, it's amazing...

208
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,409
I'll be in the way

209
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:04,550
Nice to meet you, this is Marni

210
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:07,920
(Chihiro) Do you know me?

211
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:10,256
of course

212
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:13,826
Are you happy to meet?

213
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:19,165
Yes, I'm very nervous

214
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:23,469
Oh

215
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:24,703
Please do it normally

216
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,306
Understood

217
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,281
(footsteps)

218
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,217
(The sound of the door opening) (Miyamoto) Chihiro Keeps you waiting

219
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:40,519
Good

220
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:41,420
here you are

221
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,322
(Chihiro) Ah thank you

222
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,124
(Miyamoto) So you can head straight ahead, right?

223
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,559
(Chihiro) Yes

224
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,793
(Miyamoto) That's right

225
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,694
Next site

226
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:52,364
The producer's daughter is a huge fan of Chihiro.

227
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:55,234
He said he cast it at the very least.

228
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,402
Wow

229
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,703
This is

230
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,373
It's because Chihiro is loved

231
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,509
Hehehehe...

232
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,344
Something's making me happy too

233
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:06,846
I'm happy

234
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:07,913
(Miyamoto) Right!

235
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,784
What's up? Something happened?

236
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,354
picture? There's nothing

237
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:16,922
- (Miyamoto) Is it okay? - (Chihiro) Yes hahaha

238
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,057
(Miyamoto) is fine

239
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,124
So I'll go

240
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,359
(Chihiro) Yes please

241
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,096
(Chihiro) Since when has it been?

242
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:28,634
What made me feel a bit reluctant to be told that I love him...

243
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,070
Someday, me too

244
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:36,342
There was a time when I was hoping to be someone else's dream

245
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:40,779
That's why I've probably tried harder than I could have done.

246
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:45,951
Then gradually more people around me will support me

247
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:48,187
I wish my dream together

248
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,856
More and more people are supporting me with all my might...

249
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,460
That's why... I can't say

250
00:14:55,494 --> 00:15:01,066
That love and warmth somehow became incredibly annoying

251
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:06,105
Honestly I'm tired of being loved

252
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:10,042
I can't say that...

253
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:16,348
Have you ever dealt with celebrities?

254
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,583
Yeah

255
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:18,918
perhaps?

256
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:20,352
perhaps?

257
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:25,090
I didn't make any mistakes so I didn't know at first.

258
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,260
But after meeting several times

259
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:31,730
I finally realized that I might have seen it on TV

260
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:36,502
Well, I haven't checked the answers then

261
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:37,836
perhaps

262
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,205
I see

263
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:45,511
Maybe everyone is asking for things they can't do on a daily basis

264
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:50,582
(Akari) Things I can't do on a daily basis...

265
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,198
cute

266
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:09,134
I don't need that kind of thing

267
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:11,570
picture?

268
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,540
Don't praise me like any other child

269
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,012
So...

270
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,280
Don't listen

271
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:23,515
picture?

272
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:40,499
A bit what are you doing?

273
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,027
Feel silent

274
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,368
(The sound of kissing)

275
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:19,938
I've never done something like this

276
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,077
Haa...

277
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:33,218
(Marni) Look at the more unscrupulous appearance

278
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,021
(Chihiro) Yes

279
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,692
Haa...

280
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:55,707
Taro-san

281
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,777
Honestly, I don't know anything...

282
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:02,514
I've learned what I received so I'll do my best

283
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:04,316
yes

284
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,955
(Taro) I've had everyone help me so far

285
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:13,625
I've become a senior now, so I have to work hard

286
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,129
(Boy) Taro-san, Ami-san please

287
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,297
(Ami Taro) Yes!

288
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,601
Just to entertain the customers

289
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:23,769
Let's think about it

290
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,037
Ha... Yes

291
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:27,639
(Boy) Here

292
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,342
Excuse me

293
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,778
It's the Taro of Paradiso

294
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,147
It's also Ami

295
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,118
(Moeko) Is Taro a natural person?

296
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:43,155
I don't know myself

297
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:45,591
Isn't it dangerous to call yourself a natural person?

298
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,326
(Moeko) Huh... that's true

299
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:48,994
(Taro Moeko) Hahaha...

300
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:52,498
Ah, actually, I've just just joined my ami.

301
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:56,368
Yes, I just became a therapist a few days ago.

302
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:57,903
That's probably...

303
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,606
It might be a

304
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,407
No one has done it yet

305
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,476
Yes

306
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:07,079
(Ami) Why am I drinking here?

307
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:10,749
Ahhaha, it's so funny haha

308
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:15,287
So I think I'll get it for the first time

309
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:18,457
What? Is it okay?

310
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:21,693
Maybe it's not possible

311
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,962
If you're going to pay anyway, it's better to have someone who's used to it.

312
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,399
Ah, right...

313
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,800
That's good

314
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:31,436
Because I'm the best for Ami's first time

315
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:33,272
I don't understand

316
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,610
- (Chihiro) Hey - (Marni) Huh?

317
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:41,380
I want more

318
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:43,982
(Marni) Is it okay?

319
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,152
Doesn't your manager say anything?

320
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,855
You rented a room, right?

321
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,157
Not being told not being told not being told not being told not being told not being told

322
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:56,662
(Marni) So... should I extend it?

323
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,264
do

324
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:04,336
♪～

325
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,973
It looks like it's going to get really swampy, ha ha

326
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,416
Yay, it's your first nomination!

327
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:18,684
For Ami too

328
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,985
If you think you don't try hard

329
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,587
Speak smoothly

330
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,889
Taro was too reliable

331
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,958
I'm really happy

332
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:27,859
Tired

333
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,161
(Akari) Thank you for your hard work

334
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,762
Oh, who was it?

335
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:32,264
(Marni) There's no way I'd say it

336
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:33,565
That's right

337
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:36,268
But does that face feel good?

338
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,238
Thank you for assigning me

339
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:40,205
Acalin

340
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,274
(Akari) Marni is amazing

341
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,642
Taro and Ami

342
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,944
Jof Uber is doing his best

343
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,913
Taro-chan has been nominated

344
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,281
Paradiso looks good

345
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:50,949
I'm happy!

346
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:54,219
(Marni) I see

347
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,723
Did the two do their best too?

348
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,192
～♪

349
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,027
I hope I catch up with me soon

350
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:03,862
(2 people) Yes!

351
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:06,832
Hmm...

352
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,035
(Telephone ringtone)

353
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:12,771
Yes, it's Paradiso

354
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,439
Ah, manager

355
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,842
Thank you for using

356
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,912
is that so

357
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:23,548
I hope you're satisfied

358
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,884
yes

359
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:29,488
Oh, now, let's go to work at Marni...

360
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,157
Ahh...

361
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:37,062
It's the order of anything other than Marni...

362
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,699
Of course!

363
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:45,504
That's because we have a lot of therapists who will satisfy our customers.

364
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,538
yes!

365
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:49,808
Yes, I'm looking forward to your email

366
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:54,112
