1
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:09,175
(Akari) Since it is a job that deals with human sexuality

2
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:12,545
This job is always on the sidelines of problems

3
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:17,884
Mostly it's a depressing problem

4
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:21,588
It seems like it's been rewarded once in a while⸺

5
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:24,724
There are days when you can feel that way

6
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,694
(Rio) I know that Taro is S

7
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:31,398
Why did Cosmo rating E?

8
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:34,334
(Akari) That's what Satsuki says...

9
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:39,172
(Satsuki) It was so much fun Ahahaha

10
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,607
I just laughed too much

11
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:43,343
I couldn't feel that way

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,646
Results: I didn't know how to evaluate it, so I was in E.

13
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,415
Apparently

14
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:51,851
(Cosmo) In a sense, this is an S rating

15
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:54,187
In a sense, E is E

16
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:56,990
No way

17
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:01,027
I'll make you cum for today's re-examination with less odd jokes

18
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:01,995
(The sound of tongue squealing)

19
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:04,597
In fact, it's fine without any blur!

20
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:07,834
(Door opening and closing sound) (Akari) Haa

21
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:11,237
The problem is Taro-chan...

22
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,041
Is that so? It's been a while since I came out

23
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:18,144
(Taro) I haven't got a nomination at all...

24
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:22,649
Cool photos too

25
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:24,818
I had it taken...

26
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:27,587
(Miho) It's only natural that no nominations will be made.

27
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:29,989
It's no point being a man who's just there

28
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:34,027
What does that mean?

29
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:36,930
I've got an email

30
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:38,431
Sorry

31
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:39,666
Ah, sorry

32
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,569
Why are you saying that...

33
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:46,539
(Akari) What...

34
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,775
This is a request from a couple.

35
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:53,279
"Can I have three people, a therapist and a couple?"

36
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:54,814
Is this a possibility?

37
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:58,251
It's a big deal, it's their own wishes.

38
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:59,652
Couple course available

39
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:03,823
But what kind of person would be the right person to do in this case?

40
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,891
ah…

41
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,294
I have a reservation

42
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:10,196
Taro is...

43
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:14,667
Of course, it's still too heavy...

44
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:15,935
(Telephone ringtone)

45
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,337
Ah, it's coming out

46
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:22,008
Thank you for the call, it's Paradiso

47
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,511
(Kasumi) Well, I'm tired today

48
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:27,547
Are you in the hotel and the middle of the course? I fell asleep in

49
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,949
Then I woke up two hours ago

50
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:31,551
Haa...

51
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,653
I'll give you a hundred steps, but that's fine

52
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,623
Is it okay if the therapist is sleeping with him too?

53
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,958
I mean, I was told to pay normally.

54
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,393
No, um...

55
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,997
This is a strange business idea that you can pay for it.

56
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:46,132
Ah, uh...

57
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,769
I will contact you inquire with the person above and return!

58
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:54,707
That Miho, some sort of therapist, was in the middle of the treatment.

59
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:57,076
I fell asleep with the customer...

60
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:59,078
Ah... I understand

61
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:01,047
I'll decide on the deal with the manager, so wait a moment

62
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,815
Sorry please

63
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:04,617
(Vibration sound on mobile phone)

64
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,152
(Akari) What's next?

65
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,057
Yes, what's wrong? Marni

66
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,792
(Marni) That Akari-chan?

67
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:14,827
Can't you help me?

68
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:16,963
Something me...

69
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,967
It looks like I've been locked up in a customer's room

70
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,208
What should I do...

71
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,009
Hmm...

72
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:32,045
Sorry

73
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,547
Oh!?

74
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:38,084
♪～

75
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:38,478
～♪

76
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:42,482
Hey... I'll talk a little about it so please just wait

77
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,717
If anything happens, contact me immediately

78
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:49,989
What is it? Today, one after another...

79
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:57,964
Wow, I was surprised!

80
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,733
Don't be surprised, Gokou-san!

81
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,002
(Gokou) Request for a couple

82
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,305
(Akari) I was having trouble because I didn't know who was the right person.

83
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:09,842
(Gokou) Can I take this?

84
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:10,877
(Akari) What?

85
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:13,513
(Gokou) Two people can be saved in one treatment

86
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:17,884
What's more, it may be possible to release women's sexuality forever

87
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,819
Hmm! Hahaha

88
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,422
There's no such luck

89
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,725
I don't know what the words mean

90
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,594
But I'm extremely grateful!

91
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,866
(Riku's cry) (Sayuri) So, what's wrong?

92
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,168
Hmm

93
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:36,502
what up?

94
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,271
(Shinichi) I'm here

95
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,540
- (Shinichi) Oh... - (Sayuri) Welcome home

96
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,508
It's going to be a big deal

97
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:46,479
-(Sayuri) Riku Dad is back~ -(Shinichi) Riku Now haha

98
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:47,714
What about the rice?

99
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,449
Sorry, it's not ready yet

100
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,118
Seriously, it's okay, it's okay, leave it to me

101
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,353
(Sayuri) Come on

102
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,355
Hoi, aiii...

103
00:05:55,421 --> 00:06:00,093
(Shinichi's voice) (Riku's cry)

104
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,763
(Sayuri) A husband who understands raising children

105
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,467
Life isn't hard either

106
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:10,970
I'm sure that from someone else's perspective, I

107
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,406
You'll look happy

108
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:17,377
I'm actually happy

109
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:20,646
That's not a problem though

110
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,750
With my husband...

111
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,986
That's the relationship at night

112
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:30,923
sorry

113
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,231
Doesn't it seem impossible after all?

114
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,236
It's fine to slow down

115
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:47,540
Maybe I'm a little lonely...

116
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,078
sorry

117
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:11,030
It's about an acquaintance

118
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,066
There are a lot

119
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:17,770
I can't have sex with my husband very often

120
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:20,807
It looks similar to ours

121
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:24,544
So that acquaintance

122
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:29,215
Women's sex industry? You used

123
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:39,091
(Shinichi) No, does that mean Sayuri wants to go to a sex industry too?

124
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:41,794
Listen until the end

125
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:42,862
please

126
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,132
what?

127
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,468
In the end I used it

128
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,638
He just talked and didn't do anything

129
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:56,342
And to the therapist at that time

130
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,811
Recommended for couples to use it

131
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:02,348
Eh, does that mean I'll be with you too?

132
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,450
In short... 3P?

133
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,152
That's not what it is

134
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,521
Like before

135
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:13,025
Is it like rehabilitation to be able to do it normally?

136
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,995
My acquaintances got it right

137
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,133
a…

138
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,043
Isn't it okay for each other?

139
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:32,578
Yeah

140
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,254
Ah, it's dangerous, I'm getting nervous

141
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:43,723
(Shinichi) Ah... (Email reception sound)

142
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:52,932
(Akari) Manager!

143
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,234
(Yagira)

144
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:59,238
(Door chime)

145
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,042
(Door chime)

146
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,714
(Maya) Yes

147
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:12,285
My name is Yagiraku, and I am the manager of Paradiso.

148
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:13,886
Inside, my therapist

149
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,923
I got a message saying I was trapped

150
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,326
(Maya) It's not

151
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,929
I told you they'd stay with me forever

152
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,130
I'm going back

153
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:26,632
If this continues, I will have to call the police

154
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,267
That's going to be a problem for you too, right?

155
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,376
(Lock-free sound)

156
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,482
- (Yagaraku) Akari-chan, I'm going - (Maya) A little...

157
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:46,218
- (Akari) Yes! - (Maya) Hey, please stop

158
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,054
- (Akari) I'm coming! - (Maya) Hey, hey!

159
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,792
(Yagaraku) Ahhhhhhh

160
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:54,927
(Maya) Ah... Ah, no

161
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:58,931
Ou

162
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,499
a…

163
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,438
It was helpful...

164
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,673
sorry

165
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:11,711
sorry…

166
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,680
I…

167
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,585
I just wanted to be with Marni.

168
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,690
sorry…

169
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:30,229
I can't believe there are customers locking me up...

170
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,265
I almost leaked it in a little while

171
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,568
- (Yagaraku) Marni- (Marni) Yes

172
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:37,937
Words that make customers' hearts hang out in sales emails

173
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,572
You probably haven't used it?

174
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,143
I was so angry at Yagira-san when I was a newcomer.

175
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,979
Well, just check it out

176
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:49,915
Ah this

177
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,253
"I want to keep watching you like that."

178
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:59,525
Certainly there is a gap that makes me misunderstand it

179
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,061
Is this no good?

180
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:05,765
Well, a therapist would say this much

181
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,403
But I'll be careful

182
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:16,809
Riku Was it okay?

183
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:19,412
Yes I'm sleeping now

184
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:20,579
(Shinichi) I see

185
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,985
(Door chime)

186
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:30,756
My name is Gokou, my therapist.

187
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:31,891
thank you

188
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:32,925
(Sayuri) Ah...

189
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:35,761
- (Shinichi) Thank you - (Sayuri) Thank you

190
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:42,668
(Goku) Time is limited so I'll listen straightforwardly

191
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:46,772
Both of you are willing to have sex

192
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,708
What do you think is the reason why it's not possible?

193
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:57,716
The reason is... me

194
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:05,091
I have one child

195
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:09,795
I got hurt during the birth

196
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,232
That's the trigger

197
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:16,936
I've started to feel fear

198
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:19,271
So I'll go

199
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:27,513
(Sayuri) Hmm... sorry

200
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,754
The wound itself has already healed

201
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:39,525
The doctors have told me that there's nothing wrong with sex...

202
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:43,229
I know it's a matter of feelings

203
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,767
I also want to respond to my husband's feelings

204
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,969
I want a second person too

205
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,573
I understand the situation

206
00:12:56,041 --> 00:13:00,279
Let's do it slowly in order

207
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,050
(Goku) Is it okay?

208
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:09,121
I'm an adult toy

209
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,957
You can think of it like that

210
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:15,761
You can also consider them to be trainers for both of you.

211
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:19,498
Anyway, we communicate with words

212
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,400
Let's do it casually

213
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:24,170
So first

214
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:27,740
Try doing it like you're alone with two people

215
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,908
picture…

216
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,388
(Gokukou)

217
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,223
That's right

218
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:48,093
The attitude towards your goal is amazing

219
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,764
However, that doesn't mean the density of actions is enough.

220
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,133
The density of actions?

221
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,003
Time before he can remove his wife's clothes

222
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,339
Try to be conscious of taking care of it

223
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,842
A woman's body is delicate

224
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:08,647
Today's wife will actually touch on her to see how she is doing.

225
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:14,119
The way you feel the difference between the left and right ears depending on the day

226
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,556
Don't overlook such a small reaction

227
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:19,992
Understood

228
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,060
yes

229
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:06,138
I'm sorry this time

230
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,539
(Akari) Sorry

231
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:13,445
(Yagaraku) Akari-chan

232
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,614
(Akari) Let's go over there for a moment

233
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:16,682
(Lily) Yes

234
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,052
To prevent recurrence

235
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,321
Can I hear more about it?

236
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:25,057
Haa... I told the receptionist earlier

237
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:25,958
(Yagaraku) Yes

238
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,337
(Akari) Lily

239
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:48,841
Check the facts now

240
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:51,443
I'll match you with the customer

241
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,613
There's no lie

242
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:57,649
(Lily) Yes

243
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:00,519
According to the customer's story

244
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,989
I started sleeping from the middle of the treatment

245
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:08,427
From there, it's a story of how I spent my whole life sleeping.

246
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,697
Is that really true?

247
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,700
The customer is sleeping

248
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,237
I feel reluctant to wake you up

249
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:21,073
I was treated gently but

250
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:26,111
Before I knew it, it was true that I was asleep too...

251
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:31,784
Understood

252
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:35,788
If the same situation occurs in the future

253
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:40,592
Instead of asking customers for regular fees directly

254
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:44,129
Please talk to the management before responding.

255
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,434
Understood

256
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,003
Sorry

257
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:54,473
Of course, I won't be able to pay today's worth

258
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,343
We will give you a free coupon

259
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,713
Well, if you say you'll get it, I'll get it

260
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:12,624
Hey, who can I nominate this free coupon?

261
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:14,293
Of course

262
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:17,963
I'm really sorry this time

263
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:22,835
I'm really sorry

264
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,638
I hope you understand

265
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,712
So next time I'll nominate

266
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,616
picture?

267
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:40,919
(Akari) What?

268
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:41,987
picture!?

269
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:46,391
Huh?

270
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:00,038
I love Sayuri

271
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,574
Shinichi

272
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,077
me too

273
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,935
♪～

274
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:39,077
This time I've only explained it once

275
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:41,680
Based on this teaching

276
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:47,019
If your husband is more polite and lovey-dovey

277
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:52,724
This one time will free your wife forever

278
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,695
Forever...

279
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:01,166
But if you have any doubts

280
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,936
Please feel free to contact us

281
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:05,837
thank you

282
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:08,140
I really learned a lot

283
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,842
thank you

284
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,879
Only one problem has been solved

285
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:17,215
I never thought my heart would be so lighter

286
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,266
tired…

287
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,635
Oh, you're so tired

288
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,238
(Akari) It's true, already...

289
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,508
Ah, what did you think of Cosmo's re-examination?

290
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,178
(Cosmo) It's already perfect

291
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:48,580
Haven't you already received the results email?

292
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,084
Ah, it's really coming

293
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,151
Oh

294
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:56,688
The judgment is...

295
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,560
-(Akari) B -(Cosmo) Why?

296
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:06,398
Well, it's better than E

297
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,299
That's good

298
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:10,269
(Akari) If you're a B, you won't be able to serve customers.

299
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,404
But why the hell?

300
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:14,506
...I looked at the reason

301
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,708
You're really stupid again

302
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,644
"It was fun but I didn't really understand"

303
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,012
There's nothing I can do about it

304
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:20,912
Cute girl

305
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:22,681
I want to make you laugh, in terms of personality

306
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:25,250
I don't know

307
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:27,252
Already today

308
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,720
There have been so many problems

309
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,522
Because there's no end

310
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:33,358
a…

311
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:35,861
I might not be able to do it anymore

312
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:37,929
(Email reception sound)

313
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:45,170
Ah, I asked Goko-san ⸺

314
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:46,605
It's a couple's customer

315
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:51,343
(Sayuri) I had a wonderful experience this time

316
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:55,280
By deepening your understanding of the activities of love

317
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:58,216
Both the couple are feeling lighter

318
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,318
I'm only grateful

319
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:03,488
That's amazing, Gokou-san...

320
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:07,059
Is this the release of sexuality?

321
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,728
～♪

322
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:10,962
(Goku) Something?

323
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,732
What happened to me?

324
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:17,469
I received a thank you email from a couple.

325
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,806
I was impressed

326
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:22,474
yes

327
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,609
That's good

328
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:29,948
Ah, please submit the treatment fee for Gokou.

329
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:34,186
Gokou-san?

330
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,890
The couple looks really happy

331
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:40,625
I'm somehow happy

332
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,595
I couldn't receive the money

333
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:54,539
Reply to my excitement!

334
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:04,983
(Lily) Wow, it's so silly

335
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,085
(Akari) There are many different requests

336
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:10,188
(Kanzaki) It's hard to dislike it any more...

337
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:12,057
(Ren) Are you nervous? Can I give you a hug?

338
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:13,759
(Akari) Don't you think it's good?

339
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:17,929
If you can take a light finish and get even a little heavy load
