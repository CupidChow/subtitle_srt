1
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:10,043
(Akari) People sometimes have gaps that cannot be fulfilled by themselves.

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,878
I'll hold it in my heart

3
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:17,650
This is the story of people who work to fill such gaps

4
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,919
Maybe...

5
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:22,322
(Akari Satsuki) Kanpai!

6
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:27,927
Aaaah

7
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:30,096
(Satsuki) Fujisaki Akari quit her job for a month

8
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:31,965
How do you feel now?

9
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:33,867
(Akari) I have financial concerns, but

10
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:36,536
Quitting my life was the best choice!

11
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:37,570
(Satsuki) Congratulations!

12
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,773
thank you!

13
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:49,949
(Women's cry)

14
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:53,420
Sorry...

15
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:03,963
is…

16
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:07,300
OK?

17
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:11,204
(Satsuki) Was it late?

18
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:15,041
There was a girl crying and I heard about it

19
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,743
It's a rare case

20
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,547
It's exactly the same environment as my previous workplace

21
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:22,982
I could only listen to it

22
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:26,953
Akarisa won't you work at a women's sex shop?

23
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,354
What kind of flow?

24
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:31,458
The Jofu store we interviewed was looking for an office worker.

25
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:33,793
I don't understand the meaning

26
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,464
In the sex industry, people are run by scary people, right?

27
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,133
That's not what I went to

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,801
(Notification sound) (Satsuki)

29
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:43,536
The representative said "I'd love to see you"

30
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,339
Don't proceed at a different speed

31
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:52,779
People who don't have money want me to work because I feel uncomfortable asking

32
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,555
♪～

33
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:02,949
～♪

34
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,313
Okay

35
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,203
(Yagira) Excellent

36
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:00,139
Sorry

37
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:06,913
Is Paradiso suitable here?

38
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,919
I've been waiting for Fujisaki Akari-chan

39
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,721
I asked about an interview...

40
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:17,757
It said that you can use Excel

41
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:18,658
use

42
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:19,993
Something I want to hear from here...

43
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,861
Yes, sit here

44
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,396
Yes, this is

45
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,633
Yes, here

46
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,902
Yes, this is

47
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,971
- (Akari) Yes- (Yagaraku) Yes

48
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:37,510
This is Miho-chan, an in-house senior

49
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:40,580
And it's Akari-chan, a newcomer

50
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,821
(Miho) It was helpful

51
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,291
Thank you Akari-chan!

52
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:54,427
(Akari) Thank you very much...

53
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,330
Okay, again

54
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:01,868
Welcome to Paradiso, "Heaven" in Italian

55
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:18,217
There's a therapist there

56
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:19,719
therapist?

57
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,955
Yes yes yes therapist

58
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:34,000
(Lily) Hello, a new office worker?

59
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,869
Here... Hello

60
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,777
A man who goes to the customer and provides services

61
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,979
That's therapist

62
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:51,584
You may also be appointing a specific therapist.

63
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,519
Please consult or request

64
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:54,854
The inside of the office worker

65
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:58,057
Sometimes we can decide which therapist will suit your clients

66
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,493
That's all for a rough explanation

67
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,394
Do you have a question?

68
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:02,795
I only have a question

69
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,597
(Miho) So no questions

70
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,599
Seeing is a must

71
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,303
The actual email from customers looks like this

72
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:15,508
What!

73
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:18,578
(Miho) There are quite a few extremes, right?

74
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:23,750
I wonder if my friends use it just because I didn't know about it?

75
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:28,488
Would you like to try it on expenses? That's easier to understand

76
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,856
-(Akari) Is it okay? - (Miho) Yes

77
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:34,427
But no matter how much work I do, I have a boyfriend

78
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,897
Sex with other people is definitely bad...

79
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,932
-(Miho) I won't have sex-(Akari) What?

80
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:44,003
Because it's not possible, the actual event is against the law

81
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,972
What you do is erotic beauty salons

82
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,709
Sensual beauty salon...

83
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,351
(Co-worker) Hey hey hey hey

84
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,986
The person on the matching app I mentioned the other day

85
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:00,953
how was it?

86
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,256
(Nana) Oh I met him, but something was wrong

87
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,191
(co-worker) Is there?

88
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,860
No, the man I met the other day...

89
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,130
(Nana) It's a lie to meet you

90
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,499
It's true that we made an arrangement to meet

91
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:17,603
The exchange stopped on the day and I gave up quickly and blocked it.

92
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,504
(Co-worker) Nana?

93
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:20,640
Nana Have you heard it?

94
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:22,241
(Nana) Huh?

95
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,477
(Co-worker) Hahahaha Hey, where are you from?

96
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:25,378
Nagano

97
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:26,646
(Co-worker) Oh, isn't it?

98
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,247
Something that man

99
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:31,451
It seems that many girls in Nagano are serious and sturdy.

100
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,252
It was popular because it was strong prejudice

101
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,822
Nagano is often called an educational prefecture

102
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,123
-(Co-worker) Oh, is that so? - (Nana) Hehe...

103
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,458
To (colleague)

104
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,662
(Nana) The apartment I live in is

105
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:46,499
I chose it because I thought about what would happen if someone came to my house.

106
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,100
Seven years have passed

107
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:55,074
I'm 30 years old soon

108
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,543
I'm not young or I can't afford it

109
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:09,455
I want someone to ask me for my current body

110
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,761
Thank you for your hard work today

111
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,335
Kaaaa

112
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:32,712
I've known about it for a long time

113
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:36,549
It's been a month since I started watching the site

114
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:49,362
Ha

115
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:53,933
What is the women in Nagano so serious and hard?

116
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,904
I don't know

117
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,306
Who is that guy?

118
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,542
You don't have to go out of your way to tell me!

119
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:06,312
Take it for sure!

120
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,815
If it's the case, I'll go back to Nagano!

121
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,117
Idiot guy!

122
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,958
(The sound of the door opening)

123
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:22,995
(Yutaka) Thank you for your hard work

124
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,330
(Akari Miho) Thank you for your hard work

125
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,566
(Yutaka) Huh? A new person?

126
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:30,503
My name is Fujisaki Akari, who started working as an office worker.

127
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,372
Nice to meet you, this is Yutaka

128
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,573
thank you

129
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,875
(Yutaka) Please

130
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:43,349
(Akari) Ah, Miho has made a reservation

131
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:48,454
Nana, 29 years old, first time user

132
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:49,388
(Miho) When do you want it?

133
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:52,825
Um, tomorrow is 3pm on Saturday

134
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:56,062
Ah, can you go to Yutaka?

135
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:56,963
(Yutaka) Of course

136
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:00,366
Apparently this guy has no experience with this guy

137
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,500
OK?

138
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:04,704
(Miho) So you're saying it's not the real thing?

139
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,673
That's right but...

140
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:12,878
(Nana) I'm drunk and have made a reservation

141
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,047
It's embarrassing, apologise when you come

142
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,549
(Yutaka) Is it Nana?

143
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,085
(Nana) Yes

144
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,254
Nice to meet you, this is Yutaka

145
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,624
I was surprised because she's so cute

146
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,360
(Nana) A kind person

147
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:30,730
Which is better, honorific or tasty?

148
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:35,701
Umm... either way

149
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,136
So Tame

150
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,539
I want to get along well with Nana soon

151
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:41,474
Is that okay?

152
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:44,410
yes

153
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,579
That honorific language

154
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,049
So let's go

155
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:53,853
(Nana) Yes

156
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:00,092
There was no time to refuse

157
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,663
Haa

158
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,000
Nana, are you happy?

159
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,703
It's okay if it's Yutaka

160
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,771
What is that?

161
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,140
There are many different types of therapists.

162
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:18,077
Yutaka is silk

163
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,211
(Akari) What?

164
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:20,346
silk

165
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:21,947
-(Akari) Silk... -(Yagara) Silk

166
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,884
I want to be kindly wrapped by Yutaka-san too

167
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,521
(Rio) So what about me?

168
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,756
(Lily) Rio!

169
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,525
(Rio) I came to get paid

170
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:37,563
rainwear

171
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:40,599
(Rio) Yes

172
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,869
I did my best this month too

173
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:46,205
It's an old way, but I'll hand it over at home

174
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,340
This guy will all do his best

175
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,843
Ah Akari-chan, don't worry

176
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,778
In-house work is a transfer

177
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:53,779
That's good

178
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,448
I'm called Akari-chan

179
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:56,348
Please

180
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,784
thank you

181
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:00,786
yeah?

182
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,756
Rio is...

183
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:07,493
(Yagaraku) Yes

184
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,696
Paradiso's number one therapist

185
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:11,630
(Lily) Looks and insides

186
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:14,233
Perfect handsome guy with a scouter destruction level

187
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,536
Wow, Rio is amazing

188
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,305
Yes, it's amazing

189
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:20,506
Listen to anything

190
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,541
From now on, we'll be friends from the same workplace

191
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,512
Ah, um...

192
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,182
What does Jofu actually do?

193
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,254
(The sound of the door opening)

194
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:37,990
(Akari) What!

195
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,126
Do you even care about where you take your shoes off?

196
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,293
yes

197
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,197
What if a man enters first and takes off in the middle?

198
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:48,234
I'll put it next to it

199
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,571
Don't you feel like you're not thinking about yourself as you take off your shoes later?

200
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,241
Maybe I'll do it

201
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,210
It's time to sit next

202
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,213
(Akari) What...

203
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,731
What is now...

204
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,833
amazing!

205
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,067
Do you understand?

206
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,171
My hands were touching until I was completely seated

207
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:26,338
yes

208
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:31,210
I will tell you through my actions that I will take care of you until the end

209
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:34,079
Already too extraordinary

210
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,215
And listen to the story

211
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:41,587
I wonder where you found out about our store?

212
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:43,722
Online

213
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:44,790
(Yutaka) Yes

214
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:51,163
Can you tell me why you used it today?

215
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,233
(Rio) What kind of treatment does the other person want?

216
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,569
What kind of heart does it come from?

217
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,404
We want to see

218
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:03,275
Since it's work, money and repetition are important

219
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,678
I really want you to have fun

220
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:11,917
To do this, it is essential to communicate and get to know the other person.

221
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:16,055
Thank you so much for your hard work

222
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:21,193
If I were Nana's workplace

223
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:25,097
It's so hard I'll probably retire soon

224
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,400
I've been about to break many times too

225
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,803
But it's also rewarding

226
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:36,075
I respect Nana-chan, who seems to be like that,

227
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:39,278
thank you

228
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,583
I told you earlier

229
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,552
Is it okay to use a standard course today?

230
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:49,989
Yeah

231
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,860
I couldn't say it earlier

232
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,199
Actually...

233
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:06,438
I want someone to enjoy my body

234
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,790
(Rio) From there a shower or bath

235
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:28,394
Basically, it's exactly what the customers want.

236
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,928
If they were separate

237
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,531
I'll create a room when the other side is taking a shower

238
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:34,566
Do you want to create a room?

239
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:35,768
(Shower sound)

240
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:36,902
(Rio) First of all, lighting

241
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,273
Not too bright nor too dark

242
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:45,177
Add aroma to the room

243
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:49,782
The type and size of music and temperature control are also important.

244
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:54,553
Then finally we'll start treatment

245
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,147
Let's get started

246
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,196
Nana-chan

247
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,466
My body is really beautiful

248
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:16,628
a…

249
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:19,898
Haa...

250
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:23,902
Ah...

251
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,415
I thought something about the reaction

252
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,518
Have you ever had sex?

253
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:46,792
Only once with my boyfriend from my third year of high school

254
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,762
But we broke up soon

255
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:56,034
Something... I don't know if it's okay to say that it's my first time

256
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:05,277
So, today's treatment is all about it

257
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:10,782
What about the first person who Nana is hugged next?

258
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:13,886
Me

259
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,923
I have the power to make such things go crazy

260
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,098
Thank you Yutaka-san

261
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:30,235
Well then

262
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:33,772
Make it a flirt

263
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:36,975
I got it.

264
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:56,728
(Akari) I see

265
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:59,164
It's a series of surprises

266
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,070
(Goku) Humanity is

267
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:09,741
Why did they turn a blind eye to the pleasures of women's sexuality?

268
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:13,145
He would normally talk a lot about sexual pleasure.

269
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:16,848
We should exchange opinions and face them

270
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,784
It's shining

271
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:24,456
I haven't received any explanation yet, but that person is shining

272
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:27,926
Yes everyone calls me Gokou-san

273
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,328
Gross?

274
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:33,165
(Miho) I'm currently working as a therapist and also working as a lecturer.

275
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:34,866
They are working hard to develop young people

276
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:46,011
(Akari) Meeting with Gokou will make my life brighter later

277
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:49,014
...That wasn't the case

278
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,391
It felt good

279
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,328
Me too

280
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:09,034
Is there any room available this time?

281
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,503
(Yutaka) Ah, I want to go

282
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,704
I'll make it beautiful

283
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:13,772
Yeah

284
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,809
(Nana) Thank you

285
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,077
(Yutaka)Thank you

286
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:26,785
♪～

287
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,854
(PC notification sound)

288
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:57,282
(Nana) Ah

289
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,185
It might be the first time in Tokyo that the wind feels good

290
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:04,756
(Satsuki Akari) Kanpai!

291
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:09,528
(Akari) Aaaaah

292
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:12,764
I'll try a little more

293
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,267
(Satsuki) Oh, surprisingly, forward-looking

294
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,270
Something... more than I thought

295
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:20,238
I guess it's not a bad job

296
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,609
Please let me know if there's any interesting stuff

297
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,446
In that case, I'll get some money from Satsuki too.

298
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,380
Well, is that so?

299
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:29,614
(Akari)

300
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,349
And my boyfriend

301
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,051
Is this job okay?

302
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:37,889
oh?

303
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:40,325
Oh oh oh

304
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,861
Aaaah

305
00:22:54,873 --> 00:23:00,212
The fragrant smells like this

306
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:07,352
(Miho) Fukada Shoko, who is our instructor

307
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,721
(Yagiraku) Is it okay to go to an interview with a therapist?

308
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,289
(Akari) Not erotic at all

309
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:13,091
It's almost club activities

310
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,226
(Yagaraku) This is so sniff!

311
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,427
(Miho) Manager!

312
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,929
(Akari) Whether it's done or it's done
