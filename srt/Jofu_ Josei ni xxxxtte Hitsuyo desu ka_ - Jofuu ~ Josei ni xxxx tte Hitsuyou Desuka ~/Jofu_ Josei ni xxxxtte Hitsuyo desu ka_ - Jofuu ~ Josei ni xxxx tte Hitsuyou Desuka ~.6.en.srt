1
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:07,607
(Akari) Whatever it is

2
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:12,045
There's no choice but to be worried about what you're doing for the first time

3
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:15,715
But if you surpass that first time

4
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:19,719
I'm sure a new world is expanding again

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,389
Maybe...

6
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,093
(Taro) Ugh! I'll do my best!

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,496
(Marni) Okay! To Taro-chan, who is trying so hard

8
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:30,797
There's one good story

9
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:32,599
(Taro) What is it?

10
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:34,200
(Marni) My customer

11
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,870
Saying you're interested in double therapists

12
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:39,672
I've recommended Taro-chan

13
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,208
(Cosmo Taro Akari) Double therapist?

14
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,847
I just got a reply

15
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,451
See

16
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:54,554
They'll make a reservation with a double

17
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:59,292
(Akari) Oh! Taro-chan is scheduled to go to work for the first time

18
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,927
thank you!

19
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,462
(Cosmo) I was caught up in an instant

20
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,230
You'll soon lose sight of your back

21
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,800
Please dream a little

22
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:07,700
(Akari)

23
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:08,768
Taro-chan

24
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:13,973
Is it double for the first time at work? Is that okay?

25
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:22,015
It's so uneasy!

26
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,685
♪～

27
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:26,079
～♪

28
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,949
While I was taking a bath with the customer

29
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,718
Taro-chan has a room

30
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:33,186
Yes

31
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:34,854
So the treatment...

32
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:37,090
Ah, wait a minute

33
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,860
Isn't the opposite better? Bath

34
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,228
(Marni) What?

35
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:46,132
The customer this time was Marni's Honshi, right?

36
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,734
If so, then I'll take a distance between Taro-chan.

37
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,104
I think I should reduce it as much as possible

38
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,040
(Marni) Certainly

39
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,876
I think it depends on the customer though

40
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:59,879
I want to talk a lot before the treatment too.

41
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,383
(Marni) So let's do that, right?

42
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,151
Akarin thanks

43
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:09,322
Hehehehe...

44
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,723
- (Marni) Let's go- (Taro) Yes

45
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,133
(Yagira) Why am I?

46
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,469
(Miho) I think it's different

47
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,072
I look at the objective advice

48
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,942
That's what I'd like to ask you, Yanagiraku

49
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,677
Is this because of Paradiso?

50
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:33,079
I'll do it all because I'll do it!

51
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,747
thank you!

52
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:35,748
I'm going!

53
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:38,618
First, a skinshop at an oil salon

54
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,853
Taro-chan is in charge of the upper body.

55
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:42,956
I

56
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:45,058
From the tips of your toes

57
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,896
Calf

58
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:53,866
and

59
00:03:55,068 --> 00:04:00,707
Increase your sexual sensation slightly with your thighs

60
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,554
(Yagaraku) Ah

61
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:19,926
It might be nice to feel like you're being teased

62
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:24,197
Oh

63
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,199
(Marni) Next, the second formation

64
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,435
Her back is her erogenous zone

65
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:33,006
Start with a gentle kiss and gradually get hard

66
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:42,181
(Making female voices) Ah, ah, ah, ah

67
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:43,883
Maybe that's good

68
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,051
Ah...

69
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:46,819
(Marni) What's so delicious

70
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:50,590
Is it easy to do or difficult to do, so it's paralyzing...

71
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,962
Ah, can you just go down Taro?

72
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,704
Gently touch and settle your body

73
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,725
(Using female voices) Ah, it's just right!

74
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,261
Overall, it's evenly!

75
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:35,168
(Miho) If this is successful, it might be possible to make it a manual.

76
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:39,205
Would you like to ask Shoko to create a double training program?

77
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,306
(Miho) Yes

78
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:44,077
I think new kids should be the same as veterans.

79
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:45,178
It's like a partner

80
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,947
You say something like a detective drama

81
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,717
If you have a double including newcomers,

82
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:53,419
How about making the price a little cheaper?

83
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:54,587
Yes

84
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:57,857
But the set of newcomers and veterans is pretty exciting.

85
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:01,394
So then, why not start with a simple price?

86
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:04,964
They'll look at the situation and increase the number if there's demand

87
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,766
Ah, how about this?

88
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,469
Combine that person and that person to receive a discount!

89
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,337
Wouldn't it be popular if they ran a campaign like this?

90
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:14,707
The combination of Wind God and Thunder God is now 20% off!

91
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:15,875
-Is it like (Akari)? - (Miho) That's right

92
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:19,112
If that combination, I'll actually raise the price

93
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:22,448
But actually, double therapists also increase their utilization rate.

94
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:24,150
Profit ratio seems good

95
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,119
(Marni) Um...

96
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,054
In front of the people

97
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,189
I don't want you to talk too much about money

98
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,391
- (Akari) Sorry- (Miho Yagiraku) Sorry

99
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,695
Well, I was able to share the image so it's fine

100
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:39,365
The two were pretty good

101
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,702
My man's body is getting tinkered with

102
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,974
Thank you for your cooperation, Yagiraku!

103
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:52,979
(Marni) Okay!

104
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,447
Let's review and discuss the reflection

105
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:55,348
yes!

106
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,285
I'll be participating too

107
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:06,192
Okay, then please!

108
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,027
(Akari) So let's all sit over there

109
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,730
- (Taro Marni) Yes! -(Miho) Yes yes

110
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,432
What should I do?

111
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:15,101
(Taro) When it comes to double, is it basically just two people?

112
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:15,735
(Yagaraku) What? (Taro) When it comes to double, is it basically just two people?

113
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:15,802
(Yagaraku) What?

114
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:16,636
(Yagaraku) What? (Miho) Yes

115
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,616
(Cosmo) Good evening

116
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:31,684
(The sound of tongue squealing)

117
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,059
What? Is Cosmo right?

118
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,762
(Kanon) Please

119
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,797
(Cosmo) Ah... haa... that's good

120
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,032
- (Kannon) Hahaha... - (Cosmo) Haha...

121
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,401
(Cosmo) No, but I was surprised

122
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,170
I thought it would be a nomination from more adults.

123
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:53,973
I'm an adult

124
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,876
That's right, sorry

125
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,645
But is it really okay for me?

126
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:01,547
that…

127
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,451
I have to be older

128
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,221
Ah... Is that so?

129
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:13,459
Okay! So I think I'll do my best to meet your requests

130
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,329
Okay!

131
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,265
Marni

132
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,034
Finally, why not have one more meeting?

133
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:25,137
It's okay, I did that well

134
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,974
If I go to that

135
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,078
Maybe they'll be told to do it together.

136
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,647
No, I don't want to look that way either

137
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:39,318
Well, there's one thing I can say...

138
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:43,322
No matter what, keep a cool face

139
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,226
If you're stuck on it, women will get cold in a flash

140
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:51,631
Even if things aren't going well, just make a "face that's going well"?

141
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,467
The face is going well...

142
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:55,534
(Marni) Yes

143
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,870
Yes, then give it a try

144
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:58,938
yes!

145
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,109
Bad!

146
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,077
So Marni, please do it

147
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:06,145
yes!

148
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,216
-(Taro) First is the bath-(Marni)Hey

149
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,217
-(Taro) It's a bath, right? - (Marni)

150
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,219
Communicate in the bath

151
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,887
(Shiho) So that's all for today

152
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,556
Thank you for your continued support

153
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,324
(Substitutes) Thank you

154
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,395
- (Substitutes) Thank you for your hard work- (Shiho) Thank you for your hard work

155
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:23,562
Thank you for your hard work

156
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:25,998
(Substitute) Thank you for your hard work

157
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:27,833
Section Chief

158
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:30,836
Please check the materials for next week's competition

159
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:31,737
thank you

160
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:40,012
I enjoyed working and before I knew it, I had become a manager.

161
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,015
-(Shiho) Here... -(Substitute) Yes

162
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,817
-(Shiho) And here-(Substreet) Yes

163
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,786
The image is conveyed

164
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:49,221
Specific examples and numerical data can also be used as reference.

165
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:50,289
yes

166
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,594
And then... Yes, it's okay

167
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,595
yes

168
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,263
Once it's fixed, send it with data

169
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,165
I'll try to cross it all over the place.

170
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:02,101
Yes, I understand, thank you very much

171
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,841
(Shiro) Although it has increased recently

172
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:12,845
The hassle that only female managers can do is

173
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,247
I think it's definitely there

174
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:19,118
(Substitute 1) Serizawa always speaks very hard.

175
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,252
(Substitute 2) I understand

176
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,955
If you think that person is right, he'll fill it up so much

177
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,290
(Substitute 1) Yes

178
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:27,026
Manager: What do you think?

179
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:30,363
No, honestly, I feel like the atmosphere in the department is not very good lately.

180
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:33,866
Right

181
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:35,668
Understood

182
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:39,305
I'll stab you with a nail so if something happens, say it again.

183
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,541
(Subject 1) Thank you

184
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:45,911
We are really lucky to be able to work under the section chief.

185
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:49,215
(Substitute 1) Really, Section Chief: That's not true

186
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,784
That's not the case

187
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:55,821
"To serve as an example for female employees"

188
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,991
In the midst of an unspoken atmosphere

189
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:02,928
In terms of mentality, it is important to be able to take the brunt of women as a representative of women.

190
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,231
It's quite tough

191
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:06,799
(Elevator arrival sound)

192
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:14,440
(The sound of the door opening)

193
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,309
-(Managing Director) Ah Saito-kun-(Shiho) Ah

194
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:18,711
(Managing Director) I heard it

195
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,313
Is next week's competition the person in charge?

196
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,315
Haha, you've been promoted

197
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:26,752
Thank you for your support from our executive director.

198
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:30,389
yes? So let's go out for dinner next time

199
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,324
I'll make a reservation for the hotel.

200
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:36,195
Ah, that's right

201
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,198
Please join us in that case.

202
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,133
Ahhahaha

203
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,669
So please continue to ask for your cooperation

204
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,371
- (Managing Director) Hahaha- (Suiho) Excuse me

205
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:50,076
I've also become really good at relieving sexual harassment

206
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:57,049
To efficiently carry out work as the projects are growing

207
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:00,419
It's a skill I've accidentally acquired

208
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,389
Sometimes I feel disgusted with myself like that.

209
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:04,790
(Vibration sound on mobile phone)

210
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,763
(Shiho) Today was just that day

211
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,831
Ha...

212
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,745
Marni

213
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:30,983
Shiho-san I want to meet you already

214
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:31,884
Hehe...

215
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:35,087
(Shiho) Sorry I've been busy for so long, hehe...

216
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:39,191
But it's been a while since I last saw a double therapist, and it's a bit complicated

217
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,026
Say that again

218
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:44,163
That's what I recommended, right? Woohoo

219
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,899
Is this kid Taro?

220
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:47,967
(Marni) Yes

221
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,403
yes! thank you

222
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,573
Haha... Shiho is so beautiful, I'm a little nervous

223
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,944
I was wondering what kind of girl he was, watching social media and broadcasting.

224
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:02,381
Hahaha, she was such a cute girl

225
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,083
thank you

226
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,552
I'm glad you looked at it

227
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,922
(Shiho) Ehhh, I think I'll nominate it alone next time~

228
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:10,990
(Taro) What?

229
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:14,927
(Suiho) Ahhh, so cute

230
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,196
Well, I'll follow you soon

231
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,264
(Pure saurus)

232
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:23,435
(Taro) She has amazing skin and beautiful skin

233
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:26,305
Ha... That's fine

234
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:29,275
No, it really feels great to touch

235
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:32,678
(Shiro) Hehe... Really?

236
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,246
It's true

237
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:37,616
Thank you, you're so kind

238
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,985
So, really

239
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:45,758
(The sound of the door opening)

240
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,632
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

241
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,434
I'll be taking a shower

242
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,502
(Suishan) Yes

243
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:02,841
Taro-chan

244
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:04,977
Add herbal tea to Shiho

245
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,045
yes

246
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:13,919
As expected from Marni and Shiho, he is well aware of his tastes.

247
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,996
Haa... tasty

248
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,637
(Taro) It's finally time

249
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,333
Haa...

250
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,206
Ah...

251
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:44,510
Hmm...

252
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:51,684
(Taro) So far, things are going well...?

253
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:58,057
Wow, it's quite too much! I have to go next!

254
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:01,393
Haa

255
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,440
(Taro) Um, what were you going to do after this?

256
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:15,674
What was it?

257
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:19,244
I'm on the left and the oil on the right?

258
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,081
No, not! Calm me

259
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:26,118
The right is the left and the oil is me...

260
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:36,595
Hmm...

261
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,073
(Suishan) Ah...

262
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,141
cute

263
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,476
(Suiho) Ah...

264
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,800
Shiho-san

265
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:16,835
Look at me too

266
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,153
Ah...

267
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:40,859
Hmm...

268
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:50,869
Ah

269
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:00,312
Does it feel so good to be turned into a taro?

270
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,916
Ahh... ah...

271
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,417
Turn towards me

272
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,088
(Suiho) Hmm...

273
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,097
- (Kannon) Haha, that's a lie- (Cosmo) No, really, really

274
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:20,833
- (Kannon) No, is that happening? -(Cosmo) It's really

275
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:23,068
And now I'm getting a nosebleed and it's coming out

276
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,269
Hey, that's not a red eye anymore

277
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:27,172
(Two laughter)

278
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:29,308
It's been a while since I laughed like this

279
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:32,010
(Cosmo) He'll say something nice

280
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:34,179
-(Cosmo) The next story is... -(Kannon) No, I'm fine now

281
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:35,514
Yeah?

282
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:39,218
So stop talking and it's a special course!

283
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,286
(Kanon) What? what?

284
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:42,454
picture?

285
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,723
-(Cosmo) Aaaahhh -(Kanon) Eh, wait

286
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,859
Why? Ahahaha...

287
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:48,827
copper? copper? Ahhh, does it feel good?

288
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:52,097
It's not pleasant and ticklish

289
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:53,732
- (Cosmo) Isn't it comfortable? - (Kannon) It's not good

290
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,734
-(Kannon) A strange feeling-(Cosmo) Really?

291
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,503
- (Cosmo) Does it feel strange? - (Kannon) Ahahaha...

292
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,571
Haa...

293
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:04,009
It was the best

294
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:08,547
It was so sexy and beautiful

295
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:11,016
Hehe...

296
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:13,986
Ahh

297
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:16,755
Ah, it's unfair!

298
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,324
Ahhhhh...

299
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:20,993
Hehe

300
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,862
Haa...

301
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,233
I can work hard for this

302
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,774
Ahh

303
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,553
Thank you both

304
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,588
It was so much fun

305
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:50,489
see you

306
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:51,657
(Marni) See you later

307
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,826
(Suishou) Please

308
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,215
(2 people) Hahahaha...

309
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:18,784
thank you

310
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:24,990
So, to celebrate Taro-chan's first work trip...

311
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,726
(Marni and the others) Kanpai!

312
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:33,532
-(Taro) Aaaah, it's delicious! - (Akari) Aaaaah

313
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,735
Taro-chan was really good, well done!

314
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,036
Thanks to Marni

315
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:41,406
It was really impressive, it was so erotic that I was excited!

316
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,241
What is that mysterious compliment

317
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,744
I feel like I've accomplished something

318
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,613
Like a double therapist high?

319
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,647
I understand!

320
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:51,383
Oh, of course, it's thanks to Akarin too.

321
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,918
Of course, that's definitely true!

322
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,620
It's the best to be praised!

323
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:58,557
Then again

324
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,225
each…

325
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:03,295
(Three people) Thank you for your hard work!

326
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,633
Aaaah

327
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:14,973
Actually, it's great for Taro-chan's first time at work.

328
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,308
It's definitely going to sell

329
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,809
I'm jealous

330
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,244
No, but...

331
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:20,812
Haa...

332
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:25,484
I can work hard for this

333
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:26,952
♪～

334
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,420
♪~ You can laugh like that

335
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:28,487
♪～

336
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,288
♪~ I'm so happy!

337
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,126
So, isn't Taro-chan a person in the service industry?

338
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:37,129
What? All therapists do, right?

339
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:39,665
This isn't everyone

340
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,901
Well, Akarin too

341
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,170
If you continue this job, you will understand

342
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:49,341
(Taro) Speaking of which

343
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,343
Is Shiho?

344
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,179
Even though he's so beautiful and working hard

345
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:57,349
He was a humble person, not confident.

346
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,517
(Akari) Hmm

347
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,553
I think there are a lot of people who are not confident

348
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,355
A woman

349
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,691
That's right

350
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:06,725
"Noisy" "Stay"

351
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:09,528
You have to convey your affection to the point where you think you're

352
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:11,496
You better think you don't understand

353
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:12,564
Yes

354
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:15,867
What love we convey

355
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:18,003
I'm sure it's on their hearts

356
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,838
It's just slipping

357
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:22,974
Haa...

358
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,477
Sorry, can you please say it?

359
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,013
I definitely don't!

360
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,382
-(Taro) What? Umm... - (Akari) Umm...

361
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:34,753
"It's just slipping over their hearts."

362
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,021
"It's just slipping over their hearts" (Marni) No...

363
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,622
~♪ - (Taro) What? - (Marni)

364
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,692
(Akari) I didn't know at the time

365
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:47,165
While there are therapists who have overcome the obstacle of working for the first time

366
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:52,838
I'm sure there's a therapist who's hitting the wall right now...

367
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,183
Is this a nation ruled in law?

368
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,086
(Rio) Maybe he's meeting customers at Cosmo's Dama

369
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,020
Is it a back pull?

370
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:10,188
(Rio) For the private life of the customer

371
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:11,189
Don't say no to say anything

372
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:14,493
I'm not talking about work, I'm talking about people!

373
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,929
(Akari) I hope it's resolved safely.
