1
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:09,075
(Akari) There are as many sexual forms as there are people

2
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:13,246
The shape also changes slightly from day to day

3
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:19,019
That's why people sometimes want to be who they are

4
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:22,222
(typing sound)

5
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:24,391
(Akari exhale)

6
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:25,625
(Inhale sound)

7
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:29,963
(The sound of exhaling and inhaling)

8
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:32,432
(Lily) What...

9
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:34,801
The latest breathing techniques?

10
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,537
No, I sigh, I'll give you a breath

11
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:39,806
Because happiness runs away

12
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,941
(Lily) What is it?

13
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:45,045
(Yutaka) What Akari-chan is worried about?

14
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:46,079
Do you drink herbal tea?

15
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:51,151
Ahh... this is it

16
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:55,255
A gentle awareness, caring and compassion

17
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:57,557
With everyone who is trained every day

18
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:01,928
The normal ones up until now are no longer normal...

19
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:07,200
(Sigh)

20
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:08,368
(Sucking sound)

21
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:11,638
♪～

22
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:12,031
～♪

23
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:17,370
(Akari) Actually

24
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,772
Start a new job

25
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,208
guess what?

26
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,676
(Hiroki) What?

27
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,712
Clerical, or rather human resources...

28
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:26,546
Clerical, or rather human resources...

29
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:26,546
(Vibration sound on mobile phone)

30
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,082
(Hiroki) Oh! After all, major update after maintenance

31
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,050
It's a sudden event

32
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,024
(Sigh)

33
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:38,958
(Lily)

34
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,394
Akari-chan had a boyfriend

35
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:45,331
And I still can't tell him about this job.

36
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:49,202
That's not all

37
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:56,910
Ah sorry

38
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:57,810
(Shop clerk) Yes

39
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,946
-(Hiroki) That's a replacement - (store clerk) Yes

40
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,849
Also, it's more than grilled yamaimo and deep fried karaage

41
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:03,950
(Shop clerk) Yes, it's okay

42
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,451
-(Akari) Eh... Ah, sorry-(Shop clerk) Yes

43
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,753
(Akari) Please give me some plum sour too

44
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,421
(Shop clerk) Yes, it's okay

45
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,225
Wow

46
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,360
I'll receive cash on delivery tomorrow afternoon

47
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:15,261
Akari Is it impossible?

48
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:18,298
No, work

49
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,433
(Hiroki) It's a bit of a break

50
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,202
Isn't it just a normal office work?

51
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:25,071
Well, that's true but...

52
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,206
Well, that's fine

53
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:30,143
Ah I really wanted to use the headset

54
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,380
(Sigh)

55
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,984
what? Are you full?

56
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:38,885
It's fine

57
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:39,953
Ah...

58
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,959
I wanted to eat boiled eggs

59
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,561
There?

60
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,229
Shall I buy it?

61
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:52,031
Don't be kind

62
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,867
(Email reception sound)

63
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:55,835
(Akari) Huh?

64
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:00,673
Hmm?

65
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,577
Miho, please take a look at this

66
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:07,380
(Lily) Wow

67
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:09,315
It's pretty

68
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,317
(Miho) I see

69
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:16,189
It's rare to have such a detailed and large number of orders.

70
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:19,525
(Taro) I understand what this person wants

71
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,593
(Miho) What?

72
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,299
(Akari) What... What's wrong? Taro-chan

73
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,835
This customer has one true desire

74
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:31,804
The main character of the popular manga "Kotaro's Magic Circle"

75
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,475
It's definitely Kotaro XIV.

76
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,311
(Yutaka) Oh

77
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,346
Who is that?

78
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,718
(Taro) The well-known "Kotamaho" is

79
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,554
Manga artist Nameko Minoru's first serialised and representative work

80
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,890
Kotaro 14th, a lecturer at a magic school that has been going on for generations

81
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,826
Childhood friend Hansel on his journey to collect seven clay figurines

82
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,895
A dark fantasy that stands at the crisis of abolishing the world

83
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,298
It's a masterpiece

84
00:04:58,364 --> 00:04:59,198
I was well told

85
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:00,800
(Akari) The character in this manga

86
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,736
Do you mean your ideal type?

87
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,039
- (Miho) Yes - (Taro) The world is beautiful

88
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,741
(Lily) It's incredible

89
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,177
-(Taro) isn't it-(Lily)

90
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,813
I'll audition tomorrow in a costume that looks like that

91
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,314
Everyone prepare

92
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,483
- (Taro) Yes- (Lily Yutaka) Yes

93
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,851
(Akari) Hmm

94
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,621
There are various requests

95
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:22,622
(Miho) Yes

96
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,490
Everyone is different

97
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:29,696
But the problem is emails from customers below

98
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:30,763
(Akari) What?

99
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,966
This guy hardly orders

100
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,436
"I want someone who feels clean"

101
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,838
Isn't this pretty easy?

102
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,908
My therapist is basically all clean

103
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,343
Akari-chan is

104
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:46,112
What is the only requirement for someone you want to be your boyfriend?

105
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,715
Umm...

106
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:53,619
Health I work without moral harassment I don't take debt

107
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,421
-(Akari) The water supply has stopped... -(Miho) The hurdle is low!

108
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,091
Sorry

109
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:04,063
This customer is a first-time customer and has only one request

110
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,900
It's not bright or gentle, but not physically

111
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,869
Cleanliness…

112
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,807
I'm sure he's a bit clever and...

113
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,275
what?

114
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,513
There's only Ren

115
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,116
Ren...?

116
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:27,887
come

117
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,323
(Ren)Thank you for your hard work

118
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:32,458
(Lily) Ren! Ahh

119
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,227
(Ren) It's been a while

120
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,728
-(Lily) Are you doing well? - (Ren) Yes

121
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:38,731
This guy is Ren...

122
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,933
He's a rare character who rarely comes to the agency.

123
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,202
But his ability is S rank

124
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,204
Paradise Number 2 (Two) Therapist

125
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:46,372
(Akari)

126
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,042
Ren is my dream

127
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,513
(Akari) Become so attached

128
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,680
(Miho)

129
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,616
Ren: I'll take a look at this right away

130
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:57,850
yes

131
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,759
I see

132
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:10,363
So, can I show you the abilities of Number 2?

133
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,938
Why is Ren suitable?

134
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,308
Of course Ren likes women.

135
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:26,078
You can quickly close your distance with anyone with your natural talent

136
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,253
(Miho) At the root of that talent is

137
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,756
Ren's lack of bias against anyone

138
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,192
(old man) What should I do?

139
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,627
(Ren) Is it okay?

140
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,362
-(old man) It's a baggage but eat it-(ren) Is it okay?

141
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:44,297
-(old man) It's fine-(ren) Thank you

142
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,299
-(old man) Well then, thank you very much-(Ren) Take care

143
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,067
- (Ren) See you next time - (old man)

144
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,569
Byeba

145
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:54,106
(Miho) I love people from the bottom of my heart

146
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,708
Looks tasty

147
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:02,181
(Employee 1) What? You mean you did it!?

148
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,183
(Employee 2) Idiot! You have a big voice

149
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,485
Complain Complain

150
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:06,853
(Employee 1) It's okay

151
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,254
(Employee 2) It's not okay

152
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,255
Now

153
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,058
(Employee 1) I'm trying to get rid of the conversation like that

154
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,362
(Kanzaki) I hate the nerves of eating curry in the office

155
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,599
I also hate being loud and unfair

156
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,367
(Employee 1) No, I don't get an erection, maybe

157
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,335
(Employee 2)

158
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,470
(Employee 1) Even if you are brought along for entertainment.

159
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:29,075
(Employee 2) No, no, I can't do it because I'm dating.

160
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:31,911
(Employee 1) So cool

161
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,584
(Lock-free sound)

162
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:42,488
(Kosuke) Ah

163
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,290
(Sound of stopping the vacuum cleaner)

164
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,290
No, I'm seriously tired

165
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,124
No, I'm seriously tired

166
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,525
(Kanzaki) Thank you for your hard work (lock sound)

167
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,663
And I'll be on a business trip starting tomorrow

168
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,299
Seriously I don't want to go

169
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:56,869
Good

170
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:03,543
So, did you think about living together?

171
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:06,212
Ah... I don't think about anything

172
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,414
Well, if you're going to get married, that's a must

173
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,216
I kept saying it, my parents

174
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,617
(Kanzaki) Yes

175
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:19,492
You might be careful at first, but you know what you're saying

176
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:21,294
If there's something wrong, you should just say it a bunch of things

177
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,731
That's not going to happen so I feel like I'm holding back...

178
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,567
No, hold on is no good

179
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:30,136
Because it's not good for your health

180
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:36,309
It's okay, I'll follow you properly

181
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,276
What?

182
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,478
Yes thank you

183
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:42,214
Hmm

184
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:49,956
Well, it's hard to do if you want a grandchild but live with me

185
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,528
(Miho) Yes (Clap your hands)

186
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,431
(Miho) Have you all changed clothes? Are you ready for the audition?

187
00:09:58,497 --> 00:09:59,899
(Yutaka) It's OK

188
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,334
(Music on hold on phone) (Akari) It's not OK

189
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:02,768
picture?

190
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:07,239
I just wanted to cancel the customer who sent Ren to me.

191
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,542
What! Why?

192
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:11,877
I'll ask

193
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,283
Kanzaki-sama Sorry for keeping you waiting

194
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,352
That if you're okay

195
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:23,689
Could you please tell me why I want to cancel this time?

196
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,891
(Kanzaki) What... Why?

197
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,226
yes

198
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:36,035
I have a boyfriend...

199
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,940
I'm getting married, but this is what happens...

200
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,210
I guess it's not allowed after all

201
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,280
I mean guilt...

202
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,417
Guilt...

203
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:57,657
It's not like my boyfriend has done anything particularly bad...

204
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:02,294
It's not that kind, and I can't lie

205
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,530
yes

206
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:11,137
Something... Sometimes it's a bit

207
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:20,146
So I'm really sorry just before this...

208
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:27,286
So why did you make a reservation this time?

209
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:29,722
picture?

210
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:33,726
The reason why Kanzaki-sama booked us

211
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,294
What was it?

212
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,268
already…

213
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,442
It's hard to dislike it any more...

214
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,550
I want to take off my armor

215
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:03,722
It's just like I want to be a little naked ⸺

216
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,459
With a light finish

217
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:11,564
Don't you think it's good?

218
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:16,402
Lightweight and heavy luggage

219
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,704
If you want to go down a little

220
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,641
(Door chime)

221
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:32,751
(Len) Hello

222
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:35,421
Do you like oranges?

223
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:41,961
I'll be in the way

224
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:48,300
Wow, a beautiful room

225
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:51,904
It smells nice

226
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:53,706
It's juniper berry

227
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:55,374
I understand well

228
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,144
I love aroma too

229
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,980
Juniper berries also have a refreshing effect.

230
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,015
It also calms down

231
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,518
Ah, should I talk after washing my hands?

232
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,520
yes

233
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:12,691
(The sound of the door closing)

234
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,863
Hand soap is also super nice scent

235
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,199
I already love it all these

236
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:24,036
Ha... I'm so happy that it was the first time I said it

237
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:25,905
Really?

238
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:31,544
No, I can't say it much, but there are some people in the rough room.

239
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,481
Well, at times like that, we'll clean together and have fun.

240
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,683
Huh... that's good

241
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,084
Highest

242
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,152
(Ren) Isn't it?

243
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:44,890
Hey, are you nervous?

244
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,062
Can I give you a hug?

245
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:53,265
(Kanzaki) Yes

246
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,170
yes

247
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,143
Haa... calm down

248
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,180
Ren's too

249
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,934
(Ren) These nails look great too

250
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:32,004
Ha... Ren's suits you

251
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,607
Huh? That's what it is...

252
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:36,909
Maybe there

253
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,811
- (Kanzaki) Hahahaha... - (Ren) Hehe...

254
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,021
lend me

255
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,597
Look, it's so cute

256
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:01,300
Really hehe...

257
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:11,744
Also... can I say one more thing I want to do?

258
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,579
yeah?

259
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:18,550
(Miho) Number 1 entry (One) Lily, the 14th generation who tickles motherly!

260
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:22,955
(Cheers)

261
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,660
(Akari and the others) Cute! That's cute!

262
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:55,087
Entry number 2: Taro, the 14th generation of knowledge!

263
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:58,891
(Cheers)

264
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,764
(Kanzaki) Oh?

265
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:08,434
-(Ren) Jaan Hahaha... -(Kanzaki) Jaan Ah, so cute!

266
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,136
That's good, that's good, it's cute!

267
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,473
Jaan hahahaha...

268
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,441
Jaan

269
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:19,778
Entry number 3 (Three): Cosmo, the 14th generation with broken wings!

270
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,947
(Akari and the others) What? oh?

271
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:25,117
Hey

272
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:28,620
(Comment)

273
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,024
Wow

274
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,833
(Ren) Hono-chan also came

275
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:45,838
(Kanzaki) Hahaha... Let's go again?

276
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:50,342
-(Kanzaki) Mmm, grandma, hahaha... -(Ren) Grandma!

277
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,212
(Kanzaki) Hahaha, uhhhh...

278
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,383
- (Kanzaki) Ahahaha... Haha... - (Ren) Hehe...

279
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:30,482
Wow, underwear is cute

280
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,153
Ha... so cute

281
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,087
(Ren) Yes

282
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,689
This design and not too sweet colors

283
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,792
Nice

284
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:40,726
I'm also a type

285
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,761
Hehe...

286
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:51,403
I want to make men cute

287
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,506
It's probably not that I have that kind of desire.

288
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,308
Is that so?

289
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,010
(Kanzaki) Yes

290
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,380
But what do you mean...

291
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:06,318
Those glaring eyes that deserve people

292
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:10,189
Like fangs suddenly smirked vulgarly

293
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,425
A foot that easily crushes something

294
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,561
I really hate that kind of thing

295
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:20,299
I'm sad that I have no choice but to hold back or run away...

296
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:25,337
I don't want to be that

297
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,874
Ha... I'm not going to be Renren

298
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,045
He's been a man since he was born

299
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,281
I don't want to be, but I'll become an old man

300
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,383
Become an old man

301
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,551
Hehe...

302
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:43,856
I want to be a harmless old man

303
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:49,394
me too

304
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,899
I want to be a harmless aunt and grandmother

305
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:56,902
- (Kanzaki) Haha- (Ren) Hehehehe

306
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:01,974
♪～

307
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:57,362
～♪

308
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:00,899
(Kanzaki) As a person, as a woman

309
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:05,470
I will be enveloped as I am, indistinguishable

310
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:13,478
(knock)

311
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,821
(Woman)? It's impossible but

312
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:27,893
Ah...Did you not like something?

313
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,662
Ha... sorry

314
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,498
(Female) I can't believe someone who looks exactly like I imagined will come

315
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,934
It's really impossible!

316
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:38,437
I'm overflowing with gratitude

317
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:42,007
(Female) That voice: That phrase is impossible to imagine

318
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,809
Please give up a moment

319
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:48,747
I know this planet that I still don't get used to

320
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,484
How to draw a magic circle and

321
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:56,655
It's just the cuteness of your smile

322
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,658
(Women) Have you been to a training school? Isn't it okay?

323
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,594
-(Yutaka) Ah...! - (Female) Ha!

324
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:08,767
- (Yutaka) Off-shoulder use! - (Female) Kyaa The best!

325
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:15,140
Ah, I've received two new thank you emails

326
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:20,245
"In time with your youthful lover, Kotaro"

327
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:21,947
“Max Voltage!”

328
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:24,349
"Thank you for the laughter and tears!"

329
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,250
Ha...

330
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:28,120
It's just a letter to the original author.

331
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:29,955
Hmm...

332
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:35,894
Huh? The other one is a Ren customer?

333
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,066
(Akari) "Thanks to you, I haven't held back too much since then."

334
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,268
"I decided to say what I'm saying."

335
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:44,169
“But the best”

336
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:46,505
"No matter what I do, I am the way I am."

337
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:48,473
"To be unchanging"

338
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,943
“Thank you for telling me, Renren”

339
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,712
Akari-chan was also a nice assist

340
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:54,613
I heard that

341
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,514
Thank you

342
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,151
I'm a connection or a conflict

343
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,355
Sometimes there are people who need that

344
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:06,124
I see

345
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:09,027
The very creature called a man

346
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:11,563
Some people are tired

347
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:16,034
(Cosmo) Off-shoulder use Off-shoulder use!

348
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,470
What are you doing? That person

349
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:19,604
Apparently special training

350
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,274
More to speak out from that belly, from your stomach!

351
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,510
yes! Oh... Off-shoulder use!

352
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:27,145
Ha ha ha

353
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:30,549
That's right, why didn't Taro go?

354
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:36,955
Height and physique, facial bone structure and voice quality

355
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,325
All of them were Kotaro than me.

356
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,195
(cry)

357
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,430
Cosmos should practice!

358
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:46,932
Off-shoulder use

359
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:49,367
Off-shoulder use

360
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:50,268
Haa...

361
00:22:55,874 --> 00:23:00,879
(Vibrator sound)

362
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,518
(Marni) What you need for therapy is self-promotion

363
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,386
What is therapist and a culinary affair?

364
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:10,555
(Saki) But I want to do more

365
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:12,224
Is this strange?

366
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,693
