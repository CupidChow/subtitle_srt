It's kinda odd he'd drown.

00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,413
Unfortunately, flying's off the table.
There's too much risk.

167
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,165
Well, we can't let it get worse.

168
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,709
[Byeongseok sighs] At his age,

169
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,337
there aren't many options available.

170
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,590
[sighs] He needs to get back to work.

171
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:53,384
[sighs]

172
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,762
Speaking of work,

173
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,932
I heard you carried out
a major restructuring.

174
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,309
Yes, we had personnel changes.

175
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,394
Are you stepping in and overseeing things?

176
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:04,813
No. What do I know?

177
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,482
I do simple things.
Only on my husband's behalf.

178
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,067
Oh.

179
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,486
But if it came down to it,

180
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,906
you would take over the company
in his stead, wouldn't you?

181
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,491
[♪ mischievous music plays]
[scoffs]

182
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,744
Why not? If I can do the job well,
I should.

183
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,872
[Byeongseok] Seems like you're not very
hopeful about the chairman's condition.

184
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,875
I don't know.
Things haven't been looking good.

185
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,002
[Byeongseok] No, you're right.

186
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,382
The next three weeks
will be very critical for him.

187
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,259
He'll be recovered in three weeks?

188
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:38,138
[Byeongseok] Not quite. That time frame
will tell us if he'll be able to make it.

189
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,431
Is that really it?

190
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,686
Hmm. Are you saying that he won't?

191
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:48,690
[Byeongseok] I'm saying if that's
what you want, it could be possible.

192
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,191
[chuckles] Wait a second.

193
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,443
Why would I ever want that? Hmm?

194
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:55,029
Of course. Who could ever consider it?

195
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:59,200
But maybe, there's a chance that
the chairman's condition is too far gone.

196
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,707
[Byeongseok] Well, I believe I remember
the chairman saying,

197
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,126
he wanted to add a medical school
to his university.

198
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,335
I bet.

199
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,629
A medical wing is quite essential.
[chuckles]

200
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:12,922
For any university.

201
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,176
Of course.

202
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,095
I look forward to working
with you, Chairwoman.

203
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,597
[chuckles] Likewise.

204
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,224
Looking forward to it.

Is food the only thing there is, huh?

212
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,991
I've had it up to here with this!

213
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,785
Food, food, food, all day with you.

214

[sighs] Can't we just take them by boat?

222
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,349
Nah, there's a salt farm over that way,

223
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,975
so a boat won't work.

224
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,936
Mokpo, let's take a truck there.

00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,063

[Taesan] Honggi. We found a gold mine.

[Honggi] Hey, guess you're not afraid of
the police cracking down on you.

233
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,668
Looks like you turned
this whole operation into a party.

All these folks are getting paid.
No one's forcing 'em into this.

Look at 'em out there. It's a win-win.

Oh. [clears throat]

238

Actually, we haven't seen him
in quite a while.

00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,642
What are you talking about?
He was with you.

240
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,352
He didn't stick around for long.

241
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,520
Why?

242
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:54,357
[Gwanseok] Well, I shouldn't say this,
but you know how he is.

Yeah, Honggi,

That's enough talking about this here.
You're all coming with me to the station.

once we investigate,

it would've been that kid.

if anything went sideways.

Uh, hmm.

00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,096

00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:12,466
-What? Where'd everything go?
-Man, you wanna just settle down already?

338
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,219
-[Honggi] Let go. Let go of me. Shit.
-[sighs]

339
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,848
Fine, go do whatever you want.

340
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,017
Piss yourself for all I care,
'cause I don't give a shit.

341
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,728
[panting] Hey, guys from
the government are coming.

342
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,187
You're gonna need me.

343
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,856
Why are they coming?

344
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,191
It's obvious.
They wanna start digging too.

345
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,944
They're digging here too? Like when?

346
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:38,701
Oh, man.

347
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,038
Careful! Get some more straw. Put it here.

348
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,874
Man, I don't know how well
these pieces will survive the ride.

349
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,667
[Seokbae] Oh, shit.

-[chattering]

351
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:51,839
You were gonna sell me out earlier.

352
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,633
[Pilman] The hell are you saying?

353
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:57,845
I saw how Honggi was trying to work you.
You were about to spill the beans.

354
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,430
No, we weren't.

355
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,057
You got no loyalty.

356
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,644
Can't blame me for not being able
to trust you sons of bitches.

357
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,937
[chuckles] Funny to hear that from you.

358
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,524
You really think you have any right
to say that to the both of us?

359
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:11,776
What the fuck?

360
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,195
-Hey, hey, hey. Knock it off.
-[muttering]

361
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,446
Hey.

362
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,531
[Dohun] Shit!

363
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,408
[groans] Is that all of it?

364
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,160
-[Yeongsu] Yeah, we're all set.
-Yeah.

365
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,995
-[Gwanseok] Okay.
-[Yeongsu] Dang, that was rough.

366
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,664
-You can say that again.
-[grunts]

367
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,957
All right, then, shall we head out now?

368
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,376
[Heedong] I'll ride back here.

369
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,586
[Yeongsu] You'll bust your back though.
It's an hour away.

370
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,505
[Heedong] I'll survive. Let's just go.

371
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,966
-Being young sure is nice.
-[Gwanseok] All right, we're off now.

372
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,135
-I'll see you all on Jeungdo.
-[Seokbae] Okay. Safe trip.

373
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,804
[Yeongsu] Yeah, yeah.

374
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,722
-See you later.
-Yeah.

375
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,432
[sighs] All right.

376
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:46,435
[both grunting]

377
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,230
-Get in there. We gotta squeeze in.
-Come on.

378
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,900
-[Yeongsu grunts] Ah, dang, I'm fried.
-Here.

379
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,736
Hey, go easy on the speed, all right?
Slow and steady.

380
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,155
Relax, grandpa.
I'll have us crawling there.

381
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:59,824
Anything breaks, it's your share.

382
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,660
Damn, you don't have to be
such a tight-ass.

THE CHOHAN BANK

386
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,974
Go ahead and put it in 83.

387
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,892
Right.

-[secretary] Hello?
-Hi. Is the assemblyman in now?

392
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,201
He's not here right now.

393
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,454
I see.
Well, I'm the Heungbaek Chairman's wife.

394
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,164
Would you be able to give him
a message for me?

395
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,248
-Of course.
-[chuckles]

396
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,125
-Just that the coffers are full.
-Coffers?

397
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,127
He'll understand what it means right away.

398
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,671
-[secretary] All right.
-All right, thank you very much.

399
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:56,756

00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,801
[sighs]

401
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,930
Hello, nice to meet you.
I'm the branch manager.

402
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,015
Oh, hi. [chuckles]

403
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,184
It's nice to finally meet you.
How do you do?

404
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,603
I realize I should've come in much sooner
to meet with you.

405
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,979
-I do apologize.
-[chuckles]

406
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:16,066
And by the way, I'm sorry to hear that
the chairman has been very ill as of late.

407
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,527
[sighs] Yes. It's been difficult.

408
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,030
Thank you for your concern.
I appreciate it.

409
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,948
[manager]
If you have a moment, please have a seat.

410
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,743
There's something we have to discuss.

411
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,038
If you would. Thank you.

412
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:36,170
[sighs] Sorry for the need to speak with
you, especially during a time like this.

413
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,589
Heungbaek has taken out
quite a substantial loan.

414
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,884
[chuckles] I'm not sure
I'm following here.

415
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,429
[manager] Hypothetically speaking,
in a situation where the chairman passes,

416
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,015
I'm afraid we'd have no choice
but to collect the full amount.

417
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,267
-Right away?
-Yes.

418
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,186
The loan was meant for him,
not anyone else.

419
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,687
[chuckles]

420
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:55,898
Even if that's the case, I mean
we're talking about a corporate--

421
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,192
The only reason we extended
the loan to the chairman

422
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,194
was because he was a VIP client of ours.

423
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,322
That's why if he were to suddenly pass,
we would have no other option.

424
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,740
[scoffs]

425
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,326
So you walk away
when there's nothing left to gain?

426
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:08,953
Look, ma'am,

427
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,289
you're aware that Heungbaek is
struggling financially, right?

428
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:13,582
[♪ ominous music plays]

429
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,543
-What?
-Honestly, the only reason

430
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:18,045
we haven't called in the loan is
because we knew the chairman.

431
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,386
-[both sigh]
-We've been in deficit every year.

432
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,972
That's why we've had to borrow so much.

433
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,224
And what of his Yeouido project?

434
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,726
When things got tough,
he wanted to branch out a little.

435
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,353
The loan he took out was massive.

436
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:35,938
[sighs]

437
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,024
Get me all the loan records you have.

438
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,236
[door opens]
[sighs]

439
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:45,614
[Kang] It wasn't just the banks.
He borrowed from private lenders too.

440
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,741
Interest rates were good
during the August 3rd debt freeze,

441
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:50,995
but they've been spiking since last year.
We've been struggling to keep up.

442
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,205
What the hell was he thinking?

443
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,374
Who are these private lenders?

444
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,042
Well, they're loan sharks.

445
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,587
They ended up giving him a hefty sum
in Myeong-dong.

446
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,339
[sighs] We have to pay that as well?

447
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:05,342
As long as the chairman pulls through
in the end, it won't be an issue.

448
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,095
They still have interest
coming in every month.

449
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,597
They shouldn't call it in.

450
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,686
If the chairman dies, then what?

451
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,856
They'll have to call it in because
you're not the borrower on the account.

452
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:21,483
What if I make them more money?

453
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,527
They trusted the chairman's way
of doing things.

454
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:26,071
-To them, you're a risk.
-So how'd he do it?

455
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,574
Entertainment, mostly.
Lots of booze and hostesses.

456
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,577
-I can throw parties.
-Are you willing to degrade yourself?

457
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,287
Absolutely. Why not?

458
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,206
So bribery, even sex?

-They weren't menstrual cramps at all.

-They were implantation cramps.

These tend to start

and is attaching itself
to the lining of your uterus.

All very normal.

You have to be careful

The next time you come in,
can you bring the father along with you?

they would rather keep him from suffering.

-Yeah.

-[Taesan] Damn right.
-[Yeongsu] Yeah, of course.

Come on, then. Let's get this on.

Ma'am, a six-month delay
will put us in a really tight spot.

[Byeongseok] Ma'am,
these are his new medications.

549
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,966
He should have them three times a day
after a meal.

00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,467
You said new medication?

551
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:59,636
Yes, it's three-weeks' worth.

I made sure there would be
no medical complications.

-Can you save him instead?
-What do you mean?

554
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,768
Well, because, if he dies,

when it really comes down to it.

-Okay, I'll see what I can do.
-He should be able to eat.

558
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,113
But I don't want to give him
the ability to speak.

559
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,657
He should see me but not remember me.

560

He can hear, but he can't judge me.

00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,913
I understand.

562
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,166
I'll do what needs to be done.

00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,404
-Help yourself.
-[Daesik] Thanks.

665
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:54,824
[Gitaek] Gwanseok.

666
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,035
Yeah.

667
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:01,873
I brought them over.
The 300 pieces that I farmed.

668
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:05,210
-How'd you get them here?
-I used a truck, of course.

669
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,420
I was a truck driver
in the army, you know?

670
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:09,464
And the cash?

671
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,383
[sighs]

672
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,428
At first when the rich folk
heard "Sinan pottery,"

673
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:17,222
they seemed very interested.

674
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:20,267
But they wouldn't pay until they saw it
with their own eyes.

675
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:23,436
Look at you…
All that talk and you didn't bring shit.

676
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,272
-[sighs]
-[sighs]

677
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:27,649
Hey, what about the money you got
from the chairman's wife?

678
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,401
That ran out a long time ago.

679
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,610
We've got a ton of expenses.

680
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:33,196
I mean, we had to get a barge
and everything.

681
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,031
We're bleeding cash left and right.

682
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,575
-[clicks tongue]
-[Taesan] Hey, Seokbae.

683
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,536
What're you doing back so early?

684
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:40,662
[sighs]

685
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,248
[Seokbae] The mood is awful out there.

686
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,084
They're pissed that you're not
paying them anything.

687
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,711
They're all gonna quit
if something doesn't change.

688
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:51,172
They need something. You gotta start
paying 'em what you promised.

689
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:53,383
Okay, still, you shouldn't be
coming back before dark!

690
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,468
Then you talk to them
and figure this shit out.

691
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:57,762
I'm telling you,
they're about to blow out there.

692
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,556
You saw it, Bokgeun.

693
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:04,477
Fucking idiot,
what're you staying quiet for?

694
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:07,397
-[Pilman] Just grill the meat.
-[Dohun] Yeah, I know.

695
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:09,899
So, how much you got?

696
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:11,443
-[Gwanseok grunts]
-[grunts]

697
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:14,362
Look, you've got to
pay the divers something.

698
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:15,655
Things'll get ugly.

699
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:18,283
[sighs]

700
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,578
Hey, can we talk?

701
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,288
Why?

702
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,666
Hang this to dry.

703
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,252
-[Heedong] Daesik, come here.
-[Seokbae] Ugh, shit.

704
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,757
The hell's wrong with you, man?

705
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:37,886
[Gwanseok] What's going on?

706
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,563
-[Heedong] Hey.
-[Honggi sighs]

707
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,398
When's the government
starting the salvage?

708
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,525
[scoffs] Next week.

709
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:54,611
For fuck's sake. Shit.

710
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,821
Look, just let me outta here
and I can try and…

711
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:59,282
I'll see what I can do
about buying some time for you.

712
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:00,617
How's that?

713
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,994
The station will be
the first place they hit.

714
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:04,537
I'll take them out for a few drinks

715
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,665
and some nice ladies
they can fool around with.

716
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:09,501
-That'll hold them off for a day or two.
-How can we trust you?

717
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,835
Fuck it, whatever then.

718
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:13,421
I know they're gonna come looking
for me either way.

719
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:17,550
[chuckles] Man, if the whole squad were to
show up and find you here,

720
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:18,885
you guys would be screwed.

721
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,595
-[Gwanseok sighs]
-[Heedong sighs]

722
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:29,854
Cut him loose.

723
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:31,523
No way, he'll turn us in.

724
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,733
We have to trust that he won't.
They're coming in a week.

725
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:35,735
You think he's just gonna
forget all this shit?

726
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:37,696
-[Gwanseok sighs]
-[Taesan] What's going on?

727
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:45,995
The government's sending a team
next week, to do salvage. [clicks tongue]

728
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,582
Honggi, no bullshit?

729
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:50,667
I'm telling you.

730
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,377
I got a notice. Do you wanna see it?

731
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,630
[Gwanseok]
Hey, before things get any worse,

732
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,007
-go and cut him loose.
-I can't do that.

733
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:00,051
We're keeping him here
until the job is done.

734
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:01,428
Then what?

735
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:03,596
Because the crew's gonna quit
if they don't get paid

736
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,640
and we're out of cash. It's now or never.

737
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:08,059
What do you want to do?
You wanna walk away?

738
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:10,103
[clicks tongue, sighs]

739
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:13,398
Look, Heedong.
You and I should go to Seoul.

740
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,608
We'll get the money
from the Chairman's wife.

741
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:17,569
We gotta act fast. Okay?

742
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,280
Everyday we're not diving,
we're leaving money on the table.

743
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,574
Then let's just get the money.
Come on, Uncle. Why let him go?

744
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,702
-Do you really trust him?
-Oh, come on, come on, come on!

745
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:26,828
Just believe me!

746
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,748
Look, things are gonna get complicated
if I end up dead, all right?

747
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,708
I'm a cop, remember?

748
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,169
And I took your money.
I'm not clean here either.

-[sighs]
-[Honggi chuckles]

750
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:40,633
I'm one of you now, so I gotta do
what's best for all of us. [chuckles]

751
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:41,718
[Gwanseok sighs, clicks tongue]

752
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,929
Come on, let's go! I'll help you all.

753
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:48,475
Look, I'll say it again.
I'm in it to the end.

[♪ intriguing music plays]

755
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:51,227
[Gwanseok] Well?

756
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,918
[Heedong] Let's go. Now or never.

757
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,294
-Yeah.
-We'll be stuck here

758
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,630

-I heard you.

Chairman Cheon.

763
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:51,246
Welcome back, sir.
I'm so glad you're okay.

764
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,122
[Director Park] Good to see you, sir.

765
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:54,499
We missed you very much.

How are you doing?

770
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,930
Things aren't great here, sir.

771
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,974
The two of us were just waiting
for you to come back.

772
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,351
-We needed your leadership.
-[Hwangsik chuckles]

773
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,603
Chairman, is it true?
Are you really back then, sir?

774
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:18,189
Why? Were you wishing I'd be out longer?

775
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:21,192
No, uh, we're just glad
that you're doing well.

776
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,485
You're glad?

777
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:25,488
[Director Park] Sir, honestly,
we're in a bad position now.

778
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:28,700
Shortly after you collapsed,
many of us were let go.

779
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,703
It was for no apparent reason. And--

780
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,621
[shouting] Think it's unfair, do you?

781
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,416

You bunch of rat bastards.

00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,377
[gasps] Oh, sweetie, no.

784
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,963
Calm down now. Calm down.
Can you give him something?

785
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,172
I know your angle here.

786
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:46,885
You thought all of this would be
yours for the taking when I died.

787
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:49,637
That's why you got me
drinking like that all night, isn't it?

788
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,556
Oh, I bet you were happy I fell.

789
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,975
[stammering] No, chairman…
you've misunderstood…

790
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:57,520
[Hwangsik] Quiet! I already know
what you traitors were plotting all along.

No!

Get out of my sight!

[sighs] I don't think I've ever seen
something like this.

801
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,847
At least the fire has been put out.

802

I guess it's better this way.

Looks like he's doing fine.
The worst is behind us.

As it stands, that's how it looks.

Oh, and ma'am.

This is the estimate I mentioned.
The one for the CT scanner.

Wait a minute.

811
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,548
Those drugs you gave me. You said
they were medically safe, right?

What do you…

813
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:13,763
Oh, please. Do you need me
to spell it out for you?

814
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:15,848
Ah.

815
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:19,686
Right. There won't be any problems.

816
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,397
Let's just say
the authorities take a look.

817
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,065
They won't find anything strange?

818
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,777
No. I mean, the medication is standard.

819
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,821
It's just bad for him specifically.

and the banks started coming after me.

832
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:21,164
-I had to get cash right away.
-Don't tell me.

833
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,709
You withdrew that money?

834
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:26,586
Yes.

835
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:30,673
I still have it, of course. [chuckles]
It's somewhere safe.

836
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:33,134
You will return all of it.

837
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:34,802
Yes, but…

838
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,931
This Sinan undertaking of ours
is costing quite a lot.

839
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:41,100
I really think we'll get
a good return though.

840
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:42,435

we got no hard feelings, right?

I'm good, don't worry about it.

854
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,895
If you can, keep us aware.

I can't make it obvious,

856
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,399
but when they come,
I'll call you right away.

by the phone to be safe.

-Stay out of it, I got this.
-Oh, you got this?

She lied to you to get to Seoul,
