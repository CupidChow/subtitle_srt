00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,200
Episode 16

2
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,650
She arrived at the hospital.

3
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:44,100
She's okay.
Let's stop by afterwards.

4
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,460
Is grandmother in the hospital?

5
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,660
Don't worry, mom.

6
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:56,150
Groom and bride,
please bow to the audience.

7
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,720
Mom, can you get me some juice?

8
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,960
Why juice in the middle of the night?

9
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:36,170
I'll get the deposit on this house,
so hurry and get married.

10
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,560
What's this about marriage?
And about the deposit?

11
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,110
If I don't get the deposit, are you
going to go to your wedding naked?

12
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,680
After I get you married off, Eun Sae and I
are going to live in a one-room apartment.

13
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,210
It's tiring, trying to clean this big place.

14
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,480
Even if you give me a big
house, I don't want it.

15
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,840
When did I say I was going to get married?

16
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:58,440
I said I wasn't going to get
married, so why are you doing this?

17
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,070
Go get some rest.

18
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,900
I'll stay here.

19
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,900
Where's your dad?

20
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,370
He's with uncle.

21
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,850
When her face turned
white and she collapsed,

22
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,690
my heart just went thump.

23
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:33,100
I tell myself I should prepare,
but it's hard for me to do it.

24
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,470
Grandmother said she's going
to see me get married.

25
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,250
She always keeps her promise.

26
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,290
So should I get married late?

27
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,680
You say things you don't mean.

28
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,300
Eun Chan looked pretty, earlier.

29
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,690
Pretty? She's not pretty.
I hate her so much.

30
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,540
Why do you hate her?
Did you guys fight?

31
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,250
No, why would we fight?

32
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,800
Just...

33
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,640
Yoo Ju!

34
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,180
Wife!

35
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,530
Honey!

36
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,690
Honey!

37
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,070
Honey!

38
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,280
Honey!

39
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,750
Your honey is here.

40
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,910
Stop it. The whole neighborhood
is going to come running here.

41
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,510
I like egg casserole
better than rolled eggs.

42
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,900
And the dried seaweed toasted in oil.

43
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,450
Ah, you toasted it. And
the soup not too salty.

44
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,490
I made the soup not too
salty, and the rice is sticky.

45
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,040
Your favorite, kimchi stew.

46
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,560
After you finish eating,
do the dishes.

47
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,470
You're not eating with me?

48
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,660
I usually don't eat breakfast.

49
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,030
You want me to eat this feast alone?

50
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:14,870
I was invited to the UNICEF charity
exhibition as the representative for Asia.

51
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,910
Today's the first meeting.

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,910
Wow, really? Starting when?

53
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,930
Middle of September.

54
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,400
On the weekend, the first
meeting will be in Hong Kong, China.

55
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,730
When the exhibition opens,

56
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,620
they said I have to stay in
Hong Kong, China for about 15 days.

57
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,880
Let's go together.

58
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,660
About you flying on an airplane...

59
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,320
The doctor said to be
careful on your first trimester.

60
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,120
It's because of grandmother, too...

61
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,910
but we postponed our honeymoon
because of you as well.

62
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,190
I'll take care of myself.

63
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,700
I'll call you later.

64
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,110
It looks good. Eat a lot.

65
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,080
Have a good time.

66
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,010
Call me.

67
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,730
Why didn't you call me?

68
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,030
Did you see my text message?

69
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:16,130
I sent you about 5 text messages
saying to call me when you have time.

70
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:22,510
In the last message I said I missed you.

71
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,860
Let's talk.

72
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,550
I only thought of myself, right?

73
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,070
What are you going to do?

74
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,400
I'm sorry, but I can't get married.

75
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:00,640
I thought carefully about why
you want to postpone our marriage.

76
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,080
If it's because of
financial issues, I'll help.

77
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,120
I think I thought of
that problem too lightly.

78
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,020
Its not just because of money.

79
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,010
I can do everything myself.

80
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,700
I just don't want to become a burden.

81
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,340
Why is that a burden?

82
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:16,170
Don't you remember when I had a hard time,
I told you everything and you comforted me?

83
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,220
When you were there for me and
comforted me, was that a burden?

84
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,540
That is different from this.

85
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,500
What is different?

86
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,140
You gave me your heart,
but I'm giving you money?

87
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,030
I promised my dad.

88
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,120
I didn't really promise, but I want to
take care of Eun Sae and my mom myself.

89
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,650
I want to do something on my own.

90
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,580
When my dad was here,
I depended on him,

91
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,910
and when I get a boyfriend,
I start depending on him.

92
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,480
I don't want to live my life just
depending on other people,

93
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,580
without doing anything on my own.

94
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:47,030
It's not depending on me.
I'm saying let's help each other.

95
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,300
That means the same thing.

96
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,950
You really don't like
receiving my help, do you?

97
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,560
Then do I just have to promise
not to give you money?

98
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,990
You can send Eun Sae to college and
give allowance with your money.

99
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,200
Do whatever you want.

100
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,300
Then will you marry me?

101
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,810
Just answer me.

102
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,470
Why can't you wait for me?

103
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,300
Can't you be more understanding?

104
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:09,240
Why do you always decide everything
and push things on your own?

105
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,180
On my own? What is?

106
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,250
Is me wanting to marry you one-sided?

107
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,700
Do you not want to marry me?

108
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,930
What's so noisy here?

109
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,730
Aren't you so great?

110
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,340
Are you guys getting married?

111
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,780
Did something happen between them?

112
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:53,580
I think Han Kyul hyung asked
her to marry him, one-sidedly.

113
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,980
I mean, what's the rush?
I don't understand.

114
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,340
After you get to know each other more,

115
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,040
when you can communicate
harmoniously in mind and body,

116
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,010
then you can get married...

117
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,340
What do you know?

118
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,420
They love each other so much, they
want to live together as soon as possible.

119
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,150
If you don't understand that,
what do you understand?

120
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,790
If you love each other,
you can just live together.

121
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,650
Why get married? Why?

122
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,170
By looking at the atmosphere, it seems
Eun Chan doesn't want to get married.

123
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,630
When a good-looking guy like Han Kyul asks
her to marry him, she should be happy.

124
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,160
Why doesn't she like
it? Is she a rock-head?

125
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:29,950
Rock-head? You're the
one who is a rock-head.

126
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,680
Why are you so interested
in other people's business?

127
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:35,100
It's so fun being interested
in other people's business.

128
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,040
It's more fun than seeing the fire.

129
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,960
The newspaper is there
for you to read! To read!

130
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,980
They still like each other,
even if it's hard on them.

131
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,010
How can they fight every day?

132
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,980
You don't like me enough
to marry me, right?

133
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,190
It's okay, so tell me the truth.

134
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,250
Is grandmother not doing well?

135
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,530
Is that why you are rushing it?

136
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,850
I want to live with you.

137
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,780
I want to eat with you, talk with you,
sleep with you and be with you forever.

138
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,130
Do you need another reason besides that?

139
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,140
I'm not saying I won't.

140
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,640
Let's get married in 5 years.

141
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,680
You're so selfish.

142
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,030
I mean, I gave up everything I wanted to do...

143
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,040
and even got permission...

144
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,260
Can't you just give up a little bit of pride?

145
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,730
How could you do this?

146
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,780
Are you not going to marry me
even when I say let's break up?

147
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,890
Are you not going to marry me
even when I say we are breaking up?

148
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,560
Oh, seriously.

149
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,840
Why aren't you sleeping?

150
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,210
I think I got bitten by a mosquito. There
must be a mosquito in the mosquito net.

151
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,660
Why are you like that?

152
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,500
Its because of your boss, right?

153
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,480
How can he only think of himself?

154
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,730
I really don't like him.

155
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,360
If he says let's break up,
does he think we will be scared?

156
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,190
Why are you getting mad?

157
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,200
Go to sleep.

158
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,990
How can I sleep?

159
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,880
Why he is like that?

160
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,810
I mean, he's the one who liked
you when he thought you were a guy.

161
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,800
And he says to break up
because of small things.

162
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,920
That's like when they say
the heart that goes in the bathroom

163
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,890
is different from the one that comes out.

164
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,920
He's not thinking of our situation.

165
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,100
Stop it.

166
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,160
What do you mean, stop it?

167
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,270
He asks you to marry him
without any warning.

168
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,670
Does he think everything
is solved with money?

169
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,140
I really don't like him.

170
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,720
When you get married, he's going to
treat me and you badly. I'm pretty sure.

171
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,320
Yes, this is Choi Han Kyul.

172
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,660
This is Go Eun Sae.

173
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,410
Go Eun Chan's sister.

174
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:14,740
Ah, Hwang Min Yeop's angel,
Go Eun Sae.

175
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,270
I have something to tell you.
Can we meet?

176
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,070
Now?

177
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:21,030
How can we meet now? It's late.

178
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,550
Then do you want to meet tomorrow night?

179
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,260
Do you want to come to my cafe?

180
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,700
Not the cafe, because my sister will be there.

181
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,280
I guess it's a secret to your sister.

182
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,420
Your sister will be at a barista school
tomorrow, so she won't be there.

183
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,990
All right.

184
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,530
Two iced cafe lattes.

185
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,790
Do you have something
against me these days?

186
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,820
If you stare at me like that,
only your eyes will hurt.

187
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,640
You're narrow-minded and don't even talk.

188
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,020
Nothing goes right for me because of you!

189
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,680
What did I do?

190
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,940
You should have taken coaching
from someone with skills.

191
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,380
What are you saying?

192
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,410
Listen well.

193
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,330
The boss has Eun Chan.

194
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,730
Manager Hong has Mi Sook who left him.

195
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,220
And I have Yuko.

196
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,380
He has no one.

197
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:29,000
He has nothing better than you, so
why did you take coaching from him?

198
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,610
It's not that I have no one
next to me. I have a lot.

199
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,620
Pay me back!

200
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:39,810
What are you doing?

201
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:43,960
I lost Eun Sae because of
your coaching! So pay me back!

202
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,900
He's funny. He's trying so hard.

203
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,460
This is a lie.

204
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,920
This is a lie.

205
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:24,110
I think it's the best for the both of us.

206
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,550
Thank you for everything.

207
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,860
When did you get here?

208
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,980
Just now.

209
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,560
This is why I told you not to go to work.

210
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,090
Why don't you listen to me? And
you collapse in the bathroom.

211
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,400
I'm going crazy because of you.

212
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,280
I'm going to my own company,
so why are you complaining so much?

213
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:30,040
If you stay in control for too long,
those below you won't like it.

214
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,530
Why are you alone?

215
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:42,440
You know, the girl that is always
with you... why are you alone?

216
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,040
You don't like her.

217
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,440
Bring her over once.

218
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:50,800
Since your mom and Manager
Hong say she is a good girl,

219
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,200
so I'll see how good she is.

220
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,910
Later. There's no hurry. It's not urgent.

221
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,100
Did you guys fight?

222
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:07,220
I told you first, because I was in a hurry.

223
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,950
But I didn't get to tell Eun Chan.
She's the head of her family.

224
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:15,910
Her mom and sister will be left
alone after she gets married,

225
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,210
so I think she feels bad about that.

226
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,910
I told you before,
she's very independent.

227
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,180
She tries to do everything on her own.

228
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,990
I mean, it's praiseworthy.

229
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,820
It could be a burden for a
girl to depend on a guy so much.

230
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:33,030
Is that girl totally evil?

231
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,300
Grandmother, what are you saying?

232
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:40,040
She hit on you and caused
you to have a hard time.

233
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,490
Why doesn't she want to get married?

234
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,060
She's doing this because
I opposed her, right?

235
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,710
She's coming between you
and your family, isn't she?

236
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,000
Grandmother...

237
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,100
She's not like that.

238
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,180
Her family is in a difficult situation.

239
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,300
But she wants to do everything on her own.

240
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,150
I said I would help, but she said she
doesn't want to depend on a guy.

241
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,930
When her dad was alive,
she depended on her dad.

242
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:09,060
But after he passed away, she realized
she couldn't do anything on her own.

243
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:12,560
So she doesn't want to depend on anyone.

244
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,750
She wants to be a barista.

245
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,610
Not a regular barista, but one of the best.

246
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:23,310
Grandmother, I respect you a lot.

247
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,560
What are you trying to say?

248
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:29,770
If she's like you said, and
is concerned about money,

249
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:34,790
and says she wants to make it on
her own, without depending on others,

250
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,530
shouldn't you be satisfied, and
say she's fine and promising?

251
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,800
Can't you think of her like that?

252
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,700
Why do you always think
badly of everything?

253
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,090
I'm leaving.

254
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,320
Why are you leaving? Stay for dinner.

255
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,290
What's wrong with Han Kyul?

256
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:09,550
I guess Han Kyul isn't the type of guy
to lose his head over one hopeless girl.

257
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,940
If you brought food,
hurry and give it to me.

258
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,130
I'm hungry after all that yelling.

259
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,850
I brought porridge.

260
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,840
Give me real food. I need
to get my strength back.

261
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,000
I'll need to step in, because nothing'll
help if I leave those two alone.

262
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,160
Why are you getting shocked?

263
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,650
Are you late? Why are you running?

264
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,260
I was going to practice.

265
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,360
Did you eat?

266
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,870
I ate some bread a while ago.

267
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,730
I want udon. Let's go eat udon.

268
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,190
Don't mind me, just eat.

269
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,540
I'm done.

270
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,980
Are you not mad anymore?

271
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,740
I don't know.

272
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,220
I was gonna go see grandmother,

273
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:10,060
but I thought she might get worse
after seeing me, so I didn't go.

274
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:15,940
I don't know why I make myself
suffer, liking a girl like you.

275
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,830
That makes me feel bad.

276
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,400
It sounds like you're regretting it.

277
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,440
Don't take what grandmother says to heart.

278
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,230
She is just jealous of our relationship.

279
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:32,300
When I think of grandmother, I think
it's right that we should get married fast.

280
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,920
And I think maybe I'm
only thinking of myself.

281
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,500
Let's go. You're going
to be late for school.

282
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,980
I have to go to the cafe, too.

283
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,120
Are you going to go on a blind date?

284
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,330
Depends on how you act.

285
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,770
Don't do it.

286
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,420
Whatever.

287
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,110
You won't even marry me.

288
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,270
Is the owner here?

289
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,970
Sorry, the shop is closed.

290
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,790
Eun Sae.

291
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,380
Ah, the spoiled brat.

292
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,170
Go Eun Chan's sister, Go Eun Sae.

293
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,580
Where is the owner?

294
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,660
Go upstairs.

295
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,640
Look at how her hair is parted.
It's like the Chosun era.

296
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,810
- What are you saying?
- Man, let's clean your eyes.

297
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,050
I wonder what Go Eun Sae is going to say.

298
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,170
I'm getting nervous.

299
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,540
Are you really going to
break up with my sister?

300
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:45,550
I really didn't want to say anything bad,

301
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,790
but I couldn't hold it in, so I came.

302
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,560
How can you be like that?

303
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,780
If you love her,
can't you be understanding?

304
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:58,930
Mom says she can get the deposit on the house
for her wedding and rent a place for us,

305
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,590
but how can we do monthly rent
when my mom and I don't work?

306
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,930
What do you mean, monthly rent?

307
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:08,800
I have a favor to ask. Can you
postpone the wedding for a year?

308
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,420
I don't have to go to college. I'm
not good at studying anyway.

309
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,190
I'm going to get a job as soon
as I graduate, so wait until then.

310
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,030
My sister is a really good
girl. She's the perfect wife.

311
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,580
She's strong, good at housework...

312
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,840
she couldn't study because she was
working since she was little,

313
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:29,500
so she wasn't dumb from the beginning.

314
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,360
You like my sister a lot, don't you?

315
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,800
Right?

316
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,470
I don't have any intentions
of breaking up with Eun Chan.

317
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,750
But she was having a hard time at home,

318
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,720
saying you will break up with
her if she doesn't marry you...

319
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,410
I knew it.

320
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,870
It was a joke, right?

321
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,160
Idiot. She didn't even know it was a joke.

322
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,150
I heard you don't like me?

323
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,290
Who said that?

324
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:00,380
No one said it. The rumor was spread
throughout the whole neighborhood.

325
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,670
I've thought you were kind of a pain,

326
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,990
but I never really hated
you, brother-in-law.

327
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,540
Huh? Brother-in-law?

328
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,470
You are going to marry my sister?

329
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:14,400
Yeah. I like hearing
that. Brother-in-law.

330
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,920
Is Min Yeop giving you a hard time?

331
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,260
If he gives you a hard time,
tell me. I'll scold him for you.

332
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,650
I can scold him myself just fine.

333
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,200
Hey, Eun Sae...

334
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
I'm sorry.

335
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,800
I made a mistake... Forgive me.

336
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,640
I thought we broke up.

337
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,030
So what's there to forgive?

338
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,510
You really hate me?

339
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,200
I like you even though you're mean to me,

340
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,250
and you're cute when you get mad.

341
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,370
I really like you a lot.

342
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:54,670
But if you really don't like me,

343
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,720
if you really don't like me...

344
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,430
I won't contact you any
more, and I'll let you go.

345
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,200
Answer me. Do you really hate me?

346
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,670
Yes. I don't like you.

347
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,610
Really?

348
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,840
Yes.

349
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,850
My heart hurts so much now...

350
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,550
But, okay.

351
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,580
Thank you for everything.

352
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,480
Take care of yourself.

353
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:40,030
Hey, you jerk!

354
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,200
Look at you, pretending to be cool.

355
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,040
Since when were you cool?

356
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:49,570
Since when did you just say okay and leave
when I said I don't like you? Since when?

357
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,280
Well you said you hated me a lot, so...

358
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,900
Then what should I do?

359
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,350
You say I'm the only girl for
you, but you see another girl.

360
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,350
You acted innocent to me, then turned on me.

361
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:03,950
You're worse than all those
other playboys, do you know that?

362
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,400
Raise your head!

363
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,860
Raise your head!

364
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,490
Did you kiss that girl?

365
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,710
Of course I didn't.

366
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,390
How can I do that with someone
else when I have you?

367
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,010
I really didn't do it.

368
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,320
That girl did ask me,
but I never did it.

369
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:27,100
I'm telling the truth. Believe me.

370
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,060
How about hugging?

371
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,030
I didn't do that either.

372
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,250
You're dead if you are lying.

373
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,730
Okay.

374
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:37,370
If you are confident that you will
only love me starting now, follow me.

375
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,570
If not, go.

376
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,250
Eun Sae...

377
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:52,120
I'm following you.

378
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,980
I just wanted you to know.

379
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:03,230
So I'm telling you, just
in case you didn't know.

380
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:13,700
Can I follow you?

381
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:20,190
Put your hand on my shoulder.

382
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,110
I'm gonna raise the bed.

383
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,420
It's fine. Leave it alone. Stop it.

384
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:49,680
Aigoo, you can't even
drink the coffee you like.

385
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:52,050
I feel bad for you.

386
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:54,960
Laughing like a loon.

387
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,850
Is Eun Chan's family situation that bad?

388
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,770
Why?

389
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,250
If they are in a bad situation,
are you going to buy them a house?

390
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,840
Do you think she would want that?

391
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,920
She's at the age where
she should be having fun.

392
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,590
But she's suffered a lot, trying
to make a living for her family.

393
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,610
She never showed that she was tired
or anything, and worked really hard.

394
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,600
She's a good girl.

395
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,890
I heard she wants to be a barista?

396
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,290
Is that true?

397
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:30,880
If we teach her well, she
will be better than me.

398
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,900
I want her to forget about getting married,

399
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
and go study abroad in Italy.

400
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:41,510
What? Forget the marriage?

401
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,900
You know that I really don't like marriage.

402
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,500
I don't know why people are
so hung up on getting married.

403
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,070
They're just weakened by dependence.

404
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:59,030
She should enjoy life while
doing her own thing.

405
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,090
Yes, like you?

406
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,130
You live with a woman
and get dumped by her.

407
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:04,960
Like that?

408
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,510
I don't regret it.

409
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,860
There is nothing to regret.

410
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,620
It must have been hard
for you to wear that today.

411
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,530
This is cheap.

412
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,980
Would you have anything else?

413
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,040
Don't they give coffee?

414
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,680
You're here?

415
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,470
What are you doing?

416
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,790
These are the exhibition team members,
they didn't come to the wedding.

417
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:04,220
They came to congratulate me,
and they got excited.

418
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:06,240
Did you drink alcohol?

419
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,660
You worked all night and drank alcohol.

420
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,640
I'm sorry. I'm exhausted, so I was
about to finish up and go home.

421
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:17,280
I've gotten used to the fact
that you put your work first,

422
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:19,800
but shouldn't the baby
come first, then your work?

423
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:22,160
Am I asking for the impossible?

424
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,490
Both are important and precious
to me. Neither comes first to me.

425
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,740
I want to do both well and protect them.

426
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,600
Can't you understand and help me?

427
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,010
What more do I have to understand?

428
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:36,420
Do I just stand and watch you work
all night and drink alcohol?

429
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,310
Is that marriage?

430
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:55,530
What if I postponed the marriage
due to my stubbornness,

431
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,860
and something happens to grandmother?

432
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,710
Our manager is going to be very sad.

433
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:04,110
He'll really hate me.

434
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,350
My head is going crazy right now.

435
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:08,110
What do you think?

436
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,750
Do you think I'm being stubborn?

437
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,550
Yuko left.

438
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,240
The baby's mother?

439
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:17,120
I told her just let me stay by her side,

440
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:20,020
just let me see her, but she still left.

441
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,010
It was her husband.

442
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:25,120
I thought I was taking care
of her and being considerate,

443
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,060
but that's just what I thought.

444
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,010
I went after her on my own

445
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,520
and was being stubborn asking
her to let me stay by her side.

446
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,880
I was being stubborn, right?

447
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,220
So what are you going to do?

448
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,250
I'm going to wait.

449
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,530
I don't care if that's being stubborn.

450
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,690
I can't think of anything else.

451
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:53,830
Hello?

452
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:56,300
Can I see you?

453
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,920
Hello.

454
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,660
I told you not to work.

455
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:04,720
I have to organize this.

456
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:08,160
You half-witted fool.

457
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,130
You can't even get a girl's
heart and get dragged around?

458
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,060
Who?

459
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:19,490
She's the one who has to see
me every day or she can't go on.

460
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:32,730
Why are you standing there?

461
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,330
Come sit down.

462
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,180
Hello.

463
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:42,860
She said she'll get married after
she gets her independence.

464
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:45,520
It's good for her,
since she can study coffee,

465
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,860
and it's good for me,
since I can watch you two.

466
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:51,560
It's good for you, since we
shortened it from 5 to 2 years.

467
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,520
Everything is good, so why
are you acting like this?

468
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:58,530
If a man only sticks close to the girl he likes,

469
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:03,620
that's a mistake lots of men make.

470
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:08,160
But still, grandmother. Why the
overseas study program, suddenly?

471
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,680
Why are you putting her in a
study program that's only for employees?

472
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:14,210
I also helped Hong Gae Sik study overseas.

473
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:19,270
I helped half of my employees
pursue their studies.

474
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,670
What are you going to do?

475
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,530
Are you going to do it?

476
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:25,010
I'm not an employee of Dong Yi Foods,

477
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:28,110
and if it's a practice program, isn't
it better to send an employee?

478
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:29,360
Hey!

479
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,530
You talked back to me and said that
you won't accept not even one cent from me,

480
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:33,890
but now that grandmother's going
to send you study abroad,

481
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,150
is your heart shifting the other way?

482
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,080
Grandmother,
she's not going overseas.

483
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,530
She can't stay apart from her sister and
her mother, so how can she study abroad?

484
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,310
And she really hates greasy stuff.

485
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:42,830
She has no friends there and
she can't even communicate,

486
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,070
so studying abroad is outrageous.

487
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,140
You answer me.
Are you going to go?

488
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,230
I asked if you are going to go!

489
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:48,680
Why are you getting all angry?

490
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,810
Did I ever say that I was going?

491
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:52,450
You heard, didn't you?

492
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:53,350
You heard that she's not going, didn't you?

493
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,440
Did she ever say that she's not going?

494
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:58,180
She said that she never
said that she was going.

495
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,650
You just stay still.

496
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,150
I lost my parents at 12 years old,

497
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,630
and I did everything myself and succeeded.

498
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:12,060
Now that I listen to your
situation, I understand it completely.

499
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,260
But it's not something that can be solved
by working by yourself one or two years,

500
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:20,380
and your family can't rely on
you for so long, don't you agree?

501
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:24,660
If parents are not going to live with their
children forever, they have to go independent.

502
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,950
But my mother has never
worked in her entire life.

503
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,700
They say that you could live
with gums if you didn't have teeth.

504
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:34,130
If you go study, it won't be much,
but living expenses will be provided.

505
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,420
You could learn while you work,

506
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,860
and give your living
expenses to your mother.

507
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,290
What are you guys talking about?

508
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:44,690
You're doing this on purpose
to split us two up, aren't you?

509
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:48,950
Are you two in the relationship
to split when I want you to split?

510
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,890
If that's so, I'm happy.

511
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,550
Choose.

512
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:58,200
When you come back from studying abroad
in two years, and you still like each other,

513
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:00,230
then I could change my heart a bit...

514
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,190
Don't be like that, grandmother.

515
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,610
Your body's ill, so it'd be nice to
see some grandchildren quickly.

516
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,860
Don't pretend to be weak
because of me, you rascal.

517
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,440
You're the one who can't suppress it.

518
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,970
The doctor even said that I don't
have to worry about my body.

519
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,630
And my white blood cell
count is the greatest.

520
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,340
You know that?

521
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,060
You said that you couldn't marry

522
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,630
because of your family's condition
when I asked you to marry me,

523
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,220
but you want to go study abroad?

524
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,420
Think what you want.

525
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,610
Hey! Answer me!
Are you really going to go?

526
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,720
I'm not going. I'm not going.

527
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,260
Why would I study abroad
when I'm in this condition?

528
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:45,060
If I go, I'm going to go
by my own strength. Happy?

529
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,740
It's hard enough not seeing her one day,

530
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,680
so how can I wait two years?

531
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:13,790
- You came?
- Did everyone leave?

532
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,410
Yeah, look at the time.

533
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,080
What is that?

534
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:21,420
I heard that you were working late
today, so I brought you some food.

535
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:25,180
Wow. Mom, I made this. Drink it.

536
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:28,250
Wow. It's pretty. You made this?

537
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,350
Yeah, "I love you. "

538
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:39,770
You honestly want to go
study abroad, don't you?

539
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,690
Honestly?

540
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:47,220
I kind of wanted to a little when
grandmother first told me about it.

541
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,840
A little or a lot?

542
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,940
I honestly wavered a lot.

543
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,110
But my heart changed quickly.

544
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,940
I'd have to stay apart from
you and Eun Sae, then.

545
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,860
Am I holding you by your ankles?

546
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,170
Don't do that, if it's because of me.

547
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:15,070
I haven't lived a hard life till
now because I didn't have to.

548
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,900
I have a tough side, too.

549
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,370
What are you talking about?
You're nice.

550
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,070
You're just too nice.

551
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,740
Don't say things you don't know.

552
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,330
You're just saying that...

553
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,740
because you don't know the inside story
of how single moms raise their kids.

554
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,640
Hey, if I want to, I can live well.

555
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:38,110
If it's alright with Manager Choi, go.

556
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,210
I'm not going to study abroad.

557
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:43,210
And if I do, I'm going to
marry you off and then go.

558
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,890
What are you talking about?

559
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,150
Mr. Ku.

560
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:47,480
What are you talking about?

561
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:50,330
That person's just a neighbor, ridiculous.

562
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,990
Then why is your face turning all red?

563
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,200
- What is?
- Here, here.

564
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:57,330
This girl's teasing her mom.

565
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,850
You said that you should pretend
to give in when a guy asks to do it.

566
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,520
If he asks you to
marry him, just do it.

567
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,120
It's time for you to live your own life.

568
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,790
Stop worrying about me and Eun Sae.

569
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:15,280
Even if it's just this once,

570
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,180
do what you want and really live freely...

571
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:26,080
Seeing you live as you wish...
is what I really want.

572
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:32,450
I'll get you some water.

573
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:50,590
What's your dream, Go Eun Chan?

574
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:56,640
I think my dream is just to live well
and eat well with Eun Sae and Mom.

575
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,710
Right now, I want to become a barista.

576
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:04,770
I have a dream I want to make come
true, so I want to do it all the way.

577
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,950
My heart was disappointed, suddenly.

578
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,430
When I asked for her to marry me,

579
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,490
she flipped my heart all over, when she
said that she won't accept a coin from me.

580
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:35,430
And then grandmother mentions sending her to
study abroad, it seems like her heart's wavering.

581
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,660
Hey, Eun Chan's still young,

582
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,900
and she'll have a lot of
things she wants to do.

583
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,590
She probably gave up on a lot
of things when she chose you.

584
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,220
Then did I not give up anything?

585
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:49,860
I gave up on going to New York and
even endured my parents' opposition.

586
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:52,850
I'm wondering why I'm like this.

587
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,700
What did you give up?

588
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:59,500
You honestly say that you gave up
going to New York because of Go Eun Chan?

589
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,060
You didn't go because
you liked the work here?

590
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,220
Don't be angry.

591
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,230
I have no place to be
telling you stuff like this.

592
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,530
Why?

593
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:16,240
I drink alcohol all night, and she's
up all night working on her projects.

594
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,660
Seeing Han Yoo Ju stay at work all night,

595
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:22,650
the words telling her to stop working
are right on the tip of my tongue.

596
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,680
Maybe that's why women don't want to marry?

597
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,450
Do you remember what you told me recently?

598
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,530
That it's hard for me since I'm
trying to make Yoo Ju suit me.

599
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:32,470
Yeah.

600
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,480
But I think all guys are
like that. Myself included.

601
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:38,430
The moment that woman becomes yours,

602
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,530
you want that woman to
live by your guidelines.

603
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:46,590
But can you just make her do whatever
you want because you chose her?

604
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,780
I really want to do whatever I want.

605
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,600
You too?

606
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:54,450
Me too.

607
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:59,620
Why doesn't it work out
the way I want it to?

608
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,600
Shanghai, Shanghai...

609
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,910
Clearing out the forest...

610
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:08,270
Crazy jerk.

611
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,030
What's the next line?

612
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,970
Repeat. My bad, repeat.

613
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,180
I loved all my life...

614
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,570
- Shanghai, Shanghai...
- Good morning!

615
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:20,590
Manager.
Isn't the weather great today?

616
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:22,900
Just sing.

617
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,130
Shanghai, Shanghai...

618
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,350
You have to emphasize the "Shang"

619
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,690
SHANGhai, SHANGhai...

620
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,310
I'm here.

621
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,890
- You came?
- Mmm-hm.

622
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,420
Why is your face like this?

623
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:45,070
It's all black. Did you get blackheads?

624
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:47,760
She pulled an all-nighter.

625
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,690
Didn't she say that she drank
about 200 cups of coffee?

626
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:53,910
Coffee's like dating.

627
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:58,470
Why did you stay up all night?

628
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,960
You're doing this on purpose
so I can see, aren't you?

629
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,460
Are you going to stab
me in the back like this?

630
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,210
What are you talking about?

631
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,170
You're putting on a show because
you want to go study overseas.

632
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:13,500
Am I a circus, to put on a show?

633
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,450
I just studied.

634
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,320
So quick-tempered.

635
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,150
Quick-tempered?

636
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,940
Stubborn.

637
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,740
What is this?

638
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,410
I missed you.

639
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,600
I don't know whether
she's stupid or innocent.

640
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:38,780
My face was like, 30 cm away from her face,

641
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,400
and she says, "Oppa, let's be friends. "

642
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:47,420
She said that she shouldn't fall for me
because I seemed like a playboy or something.

643
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,020
I guess she doesn't like you.

644
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:49,990
Hey.

645
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,000
How come a girl doesn't
know a girl's heart at all?

646
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,650
She doesn't hate me,
but she likes me a lot.

647
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,390
I'm filled up inside her bell-sized eyes.

648
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,930
She's just planting that signal,

649
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:05,170
"Oppa, I like you the
best," inside my heart.

650
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,650
Two times on the left,
and two times on the right.

651
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,420
Is her shoulder your armrest?

652
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,170
Come here.

653
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,820
I'm not going to study abroad.

654
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,380
I don't want to.

655
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,350
I was about to call grandmother
and let her know, anyway.

656
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,690
Why don't you want to?

657
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:29,000
There could be 100 reasons
why I don't want to.

658
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:34,100
I don't think those 100 reasons could
beat that one reason you want to go.

659
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,300
Am I right?

660
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:41,880
I don't want to send you, either.

661
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:45,120
When I think about a cafe without
you, I don't want to come here,

662
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:47,040
and I don't want to work.

663
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,470
I don't want to even
think about not seeing you.

664
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,830
When I said that I was going to New York,

665
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:56,810
there were some reasons why I said I
wouldn't go, because you caught my eye.

666
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:59,240
Do you think I would
want to send you away?

667
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:02,760
I want to show you a larger world.

668
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:08,240
If you go, then you'll be able
to study hard and excitedly.

669
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,430
I don't want to be separated from you.

670
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,100
If I go, I can't see you.

671
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:14,800
Why can't I see you?

672
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,290
Are you going to the moon?

673
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,100
I can go and see you.

674
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:28,150
I don't want you to give up
something because you love me.

675
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:34,200
I hope that I can be of strength to
you, and you'll be able to advance.

676
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:38,580
Do you really wish me to go?

677
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:45,450
Look at me.

678
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,150
I'm not going to look.

679
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,660
Why should I look when
you're going to go anyway?

680
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:52,930
You must really want to send me away.

681
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:55,870
Does he not even want to see my face?

682
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,920
I realize that I can't take
responsibility over your life.

683
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,550
But I can still watch you by your side,

684
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:05,300
so I'm thinking that's enough.

685
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,030
We may be separated now,

686
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,160
but later, later on,

687
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:13,160
when you first pickle radish,

688
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:15,950
when you first hold your first child,

689
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:19,040
when you become a student's parent,

690
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,860
when you marry off your kids.

691
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:30,750
Wow, proposing is so embarrassing.

692
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:36,550
Just call mother-in-law and
tell her to take off some time.

693
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:41,640
We have to at least give
her a proper greeting.

694
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:45,170
And if your eyes wander off to
someone, then I'm going to kill you.

695
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:01,020
I won't let my eyes wander.

696
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:43,740
Han Sung.

697
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:46,670
Where are you? The studio?

698
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,240
No, home.

699
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:49,860
Are you done with work?

700
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:53,010
Yeah. Do you still have a lot to get done?

701
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:55,750
Are you asking me to come home early?

702
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:58,160
I'm saying that would be nice.

703
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:00,890
Should we call it a wife's nagging?

704
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,740
Come out. Let's eat dinner.

705
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:05,260
I made dinner, so come home early.

706
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:06,420
Really?

707
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,490
You set up dinner?

708
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:14,500
Okay. I'll come home early.

709
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:16,040
Yeah.

710
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,220
I'm home.

711
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,600
You're home now?

712
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,350
What is this?

713
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,560
Why are you so surprised?

714
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:31,350
You thought I couldn't
do this kind of thing?

715
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:35,320
So this is what it feels like.

716
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,760
You seem like a real wife
when you're like this.

717
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:39,110
Yes.

718
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,290
So if my hands smell like spices, I'm your
wife, but not when my hands smell like paint?

719
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,620
Yeah, not wife, but girlfriend.

720
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,680
But this is all there is for
dinner? There's nothing else?

721
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,270
What are you talking
about? I already made dinner.

722
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:53,990
Today's dinner is just-made rice,
and just-made radish kimchee.

723
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:55,790
Try it.

724
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:00,560
How is it?

725
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:04,940
It's delicious, but it's kind of unique.

726
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:08,060
It feels like something's missing.

727
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:11,230
Now that I think about it, I think
there are a couple of things missing.

728
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,380
You're right. What's missing?

729
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,150
But the color's great.

730
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,960
Right?

731
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:29,450
If it's made by an artist's
hands, would it taste good?

732
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,380
Brother-in-law's so cool.

733
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,940
Brother-in-law's grandmother,
mom, and dad did all of this...

734
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:39,730
Your life's completely straightened out.

735
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:41,170
You should stop.

736
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:43,420
You really made a good decision.

737
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:48,130
It's really unexpected,
but you get to study.

738
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:52,150
And not just study, but
study in a foreign land.

739
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,020
I'm so thankful that I
can't even say thank you.

740
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,600
It's nothing.

741
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:06,820
Studying abroad in your life.
You must be really happy.

742
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,820
Brother-in-law is great. I admit that.

743
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:11,980
Thanks, sis-in-law.

744
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,360
What are you two?
Brother-in-law, sister-in-law.

745
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:15,850
Are you two acting a play?

746
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:19,870
Why? Are you jealous because we're close?

747
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:24,780
Then when are you going to marry?

748
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:28,330
We're going to marry as
soon as she comes back...

749
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,830
Mother, it may be late,

750
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:39,770
but I want to ask for
Eun Chan's hand in marriage.

751
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:41,490
Please allow us.

752
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:46,720
I'm not asking that you
do anything for me, but...

753
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,810
I think they did everything
that there is to do.

754
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,250
What kind of permission
are they asking for now?

755
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:53,500
What are you saying that we did
everything that there is to do?

756
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,890
Sister-in-law, do you need allowance money?

757
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:58,640
I'll give you some.

758
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:00,650
So this is why brother-in-laws are good.

759
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:02,150
Who are you...

760
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,800
But... they must have really done
everything that there is to do.

761
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:10,270
She's a peculiar one. She's
different from Eun Chan.

762
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:18,050
You're pretty good to say mother- and sister-
in-law after meeting for such a short time.

763
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:23,090
- Here.
- Yes.

764
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:29,320
This is your room?

765
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,000
It's really small.

766
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,510
What's small?

767
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,200
I'm not going to play soccer in here.

768
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,930
Sit down.

769
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:39,490
Where do you sleep?

770
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:42,900
There are times I sleep here and there.

771
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:53,570
Here. All the toys that you gave me.

772
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,430
The first one that you gave me.

773
00:47:56,630 --> 00:47:58,450
So this guy was here.

774
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:00,940
I hold him tightly every
single night when I sleep.

775
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:02,260
Really?

776
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:03,880
How?

777
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:08,750
Like this.

778
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:12,770
You must be happy.

779
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:19,970
Just let it slide by when Italian
guys say that you're pretty or sexy,

780
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,810
because it doesn't mean anything, okay?

781
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:26,960
I miss you already.

782
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:30,650
How did I become like this?

783
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,990
Call me every day.

784
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,730
Alright.

785
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,680
Thank you.

786
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,880
What are you doing? Why is
your hand going in there?

787
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,920
Why? I can't?

788
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,590
No, it's not like that.

789
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,620
My hand must've slipped off your shoulder.

790
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,110
Lie.

791
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,350
Then do we always just kiss?

792
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,930
- Mom will hear.
- Really, where are you touching?

793
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:29,680
Don't touch my body in the future.

794
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:31,400
You're so cheap.

795
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:33,160
Why are you the one getting mad?

796
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:37,160
Who's the one who
slipped his hand in here?

797
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:40,290
My hand, just...

798
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,150
I'm sorry. I know it's busy.

799
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,100
Why did she want to see you?

800
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:58,100
She wanted me to sign a contract in case
I'd run off after working just a short while.

801
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,500
I signed it and came over.

802
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:05,210
Learn and come back.
Teach me something, too.

803
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:08,220
My Chan, My Chan, My Chan!

804
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:10,790
I met Byul yesterday.

805
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:12,590
I guess it's going pretty well.

806
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:15,660
It's just that Byul likes me so much.

807
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:19,280
If she looks at me, she'll probably
believe it if I said the moon is a star.

808
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:24,650
See, yesterday, I played around
with her cell phone a bit.

809
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:30,610
I said that if you hold the phone like
this up to the sun, then it'll charge.

810
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:34,340
I said that it was the kind of phone
that used the sun's rays to power itself.

811
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,320
Isn't it so obvious that it's a lie?

812
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:40,110
But really, she's like standing there
for an hour like this facing the sun.

813
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:42,300
Isn't it so cute?

814
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:43,810
Isn't she a little strange?

815
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,420
Well, it's fun for me.

816
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:50,930
Should I slowly start to pull some strings?

817
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:54,270
No, I'd rather call Min Ji.

818
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:56,170
Are you coming now?

819
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:57,640
Yeah.

820
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:02,710
Why are you so busy?
You don't show your face.

821
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:05,750
You're right. Why should I be busy
when I'm sending you to study abroad?

822
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:08,850
- Look at that sweat.
- Really. Don't touch me.

823
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:12,520
Look at you, all tightened up because
I made you feel ashamed just one time.

824
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:16,450
Once? Because of that one time,
my heart got covered with bruises.

825
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:18,450
You thought I became an animal.

826
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:19,490
Don't get close to me.

827
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,820
What if I get close?

828
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:21,710
It's not a joke.

829
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:23,360
How cute.
I'm gonna take advantage of you.

830
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,340
If you just come one
step closer, I'm going...

831
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:26,190
to just kiss you.

832
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,160
Kiss?

833
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,470
They say that Italy's greeting is a kiss.

834
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:33,710
I should practice a lot and greet
a lot, so it'd be good manners.

835
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:35,230
You're poking me to
make me mad, aren't you?

836
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:36,990
How'd you know?

837
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,260
Yes, it's me.

838
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,040
Oppa's going to be finished with work soon,

839
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:52,920
so let's meet at that convenience
store we met at last time.

840
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,430
Wait and stand there in the front.

841
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:58,520
I don't think I'll be
able to meet you today.

842
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:00,960
Huh? Really?

843
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:05,730
I do have an appointment, but why?

844
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:06,820
Is there something wrong?

845
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:09,560
No, that's not it.

846
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:12,620
Some school seniors invited
me to drink with them.

847
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:14,340
Seniors?

848
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:16,500
Are there male seniors there too?

849
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,040
Yes. Three?

850
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:20,710
You're lying aren't you?

851
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:23,720
I do think that I'm in that area...

852
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:25,590
Are you near the school?

853
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,340
I'm out of battery.

854
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,970
- Hello? Hello?
- I'll call you later.

855
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:32,510
- Hey! Hey!
- Sorry.

856
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:35,300
What convenience store? Like a baby.

857
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,740
Hey, you have battery.

858
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:41,210
Did you change boyfriends again?

859
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:46,640
Really... she hangs up during my call.

860
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,250
She won't do.

861
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:49,820
Why are you like that?

862
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:53,260
Girls like this always flip your insides out.

863
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:55,070
I haven't even kissed her yet.

864
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:56,820
You do it right too, rascal.

865
00:52:56,970 --> 00:52:58,470
Don't worry over it.

866
00:52:58,650 --> 00:52:59,690
What did I do?

867
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:03,550
Smiling and hanging around
hyung itself is torture for him.

868
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,650
Just looking at you will
probably make him flip.

869
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:09,880
You didn't give him anything
else other than your lips, right?

870
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:12,130
I find Choi Han Kyul amazing.

871
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,330
Han Kyul's body will turn into Buddha's relics.

872
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:16,970
He'll become a Buddhist saint!

873
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,540
I was about to advance forward, but
she goes and drinks with other guys?

874
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,280
Does something hurt somewhere?

875
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,100
Am I torturing you when I'm like this?

876
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:36,420
- Don't come! Don't come!
- How should I touch you?

877
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:39,470
I'll touch something new today.

878
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:42,150
Don't come!

879
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,580
Alright, I won't touch you!

880
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:51,270
I won't touch you!

881
00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:00,510
Have a glass, Ji Young.
I poured one for you.

882
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:03,810
Let's. I want to have
one on a day like this.

883
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,920
Is it because of Eun Chan?

884
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:07,880
Don't worry about it too much.

885
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:10,400
Nowadays, there are phones that let you
see the person's face while you talk.

886
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:13,710
And two years goes by in the blink of an eye.

887
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,680
I'm just saying it because
she's never left home before.

888
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:18,900
You need to be independent as well.

889
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,530
Don't lean on your kids too much.

890
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:23,980
Those words come out of your
mouth because you don't have kids.

891
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:27,930
You have me, Ji Young.

892
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,610
You can just depend on me.

893
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,090
Yearning...

894
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:40,330
The night blooms like a flower...

895
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:45,510
By the light of the butcher's shop...

896
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:47,480
Mr. Ku must be happy.

897
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:49,130
Why are you like that...

898
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:53,340
Ji Young must be happy, too...

899
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:58,630
What's good is good...

900
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:03,850
Is there anywhere you want to go?

901
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:07,880
Why wouldn't there be?

902
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:11,980
I even made a list because
I was deprived of dates.

903
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:16,140
Amusement park, baseball field,
movie theater, amusement hall.

904
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:18,330
They're all noisy and crowded places.

905
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:20,540
- Isn't there somewhere where it's quiet?
- Somewhere quiet?

906
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:21,880
Places like the Nam San Tower,

907
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:25,140
63 Building, ferry on
the Han River, like that?

908
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:26,180
That's so tacky.

909
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:28,470
Are you going to tour
Seoul? And are those places quiet?

910
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,920
Then you pick them yourself.

911
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:32,130
Then the Octagon Pavilion, Kyung
Bok Palace, cultural folk village...

912
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:33,500
They're all around your age group.

913
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,600
Is there a need to poke fun?

914
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:36,800
Then go to the cafe.

915
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:39,480
Yeah, let's. Why would
I want to date with you?

916
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:42,130
Let's just go to the cafe.

917
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,660
Aren't there any good kids around?

918
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:48,450
Byul! Byul! Byul's perfect.

919
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:50,930
Is this place where you go and date?

920
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:52,240
What about angel?

921
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:54,110
Our angel's really pretty and nice.

922
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:55,630
We're here.

923
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,790
What is this? You guys took
a day off to date and you...

924
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,250
The cafe's more comfortable.

925
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,930
I guess you guys fought again.

926
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:07,040
Why do you guys keep fighting when there
isn't a lot of time before she leaves?

927
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:09,750
They're a couple that got
together while fighting.

928
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:11,070
Why are you guys hanging around like this?

929
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:14,360
Eun Chan's out and you're
busy with the franchising work.

930
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:15,760
We have to find a person.

931
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:18,050
You figure it all out.

932
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:22,370
They're not even dating properly.

933
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:30,200
Coffee... Prince...

934
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,800
As... I... leave...

935
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:55,680
Let's... see each other... after two years.

936
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:38,860
Sleeping?

937
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:45,380
I'm not sleeping.

938
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:54,050
What are you doing?

939
00:57:55,450 --> 00:58:00,490
I... want... to... see...

940
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,580
I want to see you.

941
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:22,990
Let's meet each other in our dreams.

942
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:32,100
I'm not digesting very well,

943
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:34,210
so I'll run around the neighborhood
once and come back.

944
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:36,040
You can't digest? You?

945
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:38,410
- I can't, I can't.
- Who will believe that?

946
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:43,580
Hey! That... that... smells fishy.

947
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,870
Manager!

948
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:36,430
Manager!

949
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,180
Manager!

950
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:44,920
Manager!

951
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:48,900
What are you doing?

952
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:51,190
I ran here because I wanted to see you.

953
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:54,050
You come to a guy's house at this hour...

954
00:59:54,270 --> 00:59:56,260
Do you have no fear, or
do you have no thoughts?

955
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:58,200
Am I that negligible?

956
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:00,640
Wait here. I'll go get my car keys.

957
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:02,560
Where are you going?

958
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:08,210
Let's have a glass of wine.

959
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,760
What wine?

960
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,270
Where are you going?

961
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:25,910
How many glasses of wine are you drinking?

962
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,140
Do you know how many you drank?

963
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:29,410
I'm going, I'm going. I'll just
drink this last one and leave.

964
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:30,840
Aren't you a bit much?

965
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,010
You chase someone out right away
when they come to see you.

966
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:33,910
Right away?

967
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:35,910
It's already been an hour since you came.

968
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:39,230
You're really too much. You
even measured the time.

969
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:41,220
Alright. Just give me one more glass.

970
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:42,650
Really.

971
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,470
I'll drink and leave.

972
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:46,450
You're just drinking this one and leaving.

973
01:00:46,530 --> 01:00:49,520
I'll leave even if you
tell me not to leave.

974
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,420
Just a little...

975
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:01,580
- Is this fun?
- I already saw those and they aren't fun.

976
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:04,250
Why are you being so scary?

977
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:13,220
- That doesn't work.
- Hello? Hello?

978
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:16,580
- What are you saying right now?
- Maybe this doesn't work?

979
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:19,830
Where are you going?

980
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,540
Wow, it's cool.

981
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:26,160
Isn't it cool?

982
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:28,600
It's going to break. Don't do that!

983
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:33,290
Basketball!

984
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:35,380
Don't bounce it, don't bounce it!

985
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,120
Don't!

986
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:39,980
Do you not like me being here?

987
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,230
It's not you I don't like, but me.

988
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:45,200
Don't move around so much,
it makes my head spin.

989
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:49,070
Want to listen to music?

990
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,310
I don't want to! No! I don't want to!

991
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:01,320
Why are you trying to read at this hour?

992
01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:03,110
What book are you reading?

993
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:06,630
Does it hurt to talk?

994
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:07,960
Are you still making blocks these days?

995
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:11,920
You should make me one
before I go to Milano.

996
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:14,740
Make me one. Make me one.

997
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,090
Stop and go home!

998
01:02:18,310 --> 01:02:19,420
One minute.

999
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,430
Why doesn't this girl
listen to what a person says?

1000
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:22,910
I'll stay for a minute. Just a minute.

1001
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:24,530
Get up quickly!

1002
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:27,080
I don't want to. I'm
not going, I'm not going!

1003
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:29,120
I don't want to go!

1004
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:32,010
No!

1005
01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:33,980
I don't want to go!

1006
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:36,240
Go home! Go!

1007
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:39,480
Wait a second! Wait a
second! Just a minute!

1008
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:46,610
My shoes are in there and
there's still some wine left!

1009
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:48,330
Shut up and just leave quickly!

1010
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:49,590
Open the door!

1011
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:52,260
Wow, I'm not like a
beggar who came to stay!

1012
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:55,000
How can you just leave your
girlfriend outside the door?

1013
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:58,170
That girl's going to kill me.

1014
01:02:58,450 --> 01:03:00,920
How can she have no idea how I feel?

1015
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:03,890
Hey! From now on, entering
into this house is forbidden!

1016
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:06,550
If you're going to come, bring
someone like Ha Rim! Got it?

1017
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:08,020
I'm going to cheat!

1018
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:09,240
What?

1019
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:12,540
They say that there are a
lot of hot guys in Italy.

1020
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:14,110
I'm telling you that
I'm going to cheat on you

1021
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:17,850
with someone who's taller, handsomer,
cooler, and smarter than you.

1022
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,460
My life's too good to be
wasted on waiting for you.

1023
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:24,830
My passing youth is the bigger waste, kid.

1024
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,050
Open the door!

1025
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:28,080
Aren't you going to open the door?

1026
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:30,620
if you don't open the door,
I'm just going to go all out!

1027
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:32,240
Open the door!

1028
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,330
Hey! Are you still in your adolescence?

1029
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:43,000
I'll drop you off,
so just wait a second.

1030
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,960
Hey, where are you going?

1031
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:48,920
Take your foot out!

1032
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:52,150
Hey.

1033
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:54,330
If you come in,
I'm not sending you home.

1034
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:56,580
I warned you!
