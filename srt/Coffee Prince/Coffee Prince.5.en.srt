1
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,690
Hey, what are you guys doing?

2
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,590
You guys were blowing air at each other's faces,
which is what only couples do.

3
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,690
- We didn't do anything.
- Continue.

4
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,110
I said we didn't do anything...

5
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,810
Ah... look at him joke...

6
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,680
It's a birthday present. It expires in
three hours so hurry up and drink it!

7
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,250
If I get a stomachache after drinking this,

8
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,670
I'm going to take the medicine
price from your salary.

9
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,750
Don't drink it!

10
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:51,650
But, are you guys going out,
by any chance?

11
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,250
What are you talking about...
I was just delivering milk.

12
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,480
But why are you coming down
from the second floor?

13
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,340
Seriously, why are you here?

14
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,050
I don't know.

15
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,050
Hey.

16
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,640
Han Sung, I'm nervous.

17
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,040
If you're uncomfortable,
do you want to meet some other time?

18
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,740
If they ask why I'm meeting
you again after ditching you,

19
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,920
what should I say?

20
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,570
No, I'll just say that I'm sorry,

21
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,730
and that things just turned out like this.

22
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,350
You don't have to be so nervous.
They're busy too.

23
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,480
Choose my clothes for me.

24
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,930
The phone is ringing.

25
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,440
Yoo Ju, this is your mom.

26
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,590
Are you busy because of your exhibit?

27
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,090
- Why didn't you call me?
- Should I pick it up?

28
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,800
You don't have to come to my wedding,
so please at least call, okay?

29
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,580
Is your mother getting married?

30
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,520
Please don't ask me.

31
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,050
How about this?

32
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,370
Calm mode, rebellious mode.

33
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:58,650
- Both are pretty.
- Whatever, I'll just decide.

34
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,360
Han Yoo Ju, a popular postmodernist.

35
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,270
No to marriage! Creative activities
are more entertaining than love.

36
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,780
Fifth Cup

37
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:19,110
Beef rib soup.
Hyung, these are too simple.

38
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,560
It's not like there are only on
or two people I have to feed.

39
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,140
But why were you forced to leave
your house at your age?

40
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,830
How dare they tell me to grab the knife
due to the family line?

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,070
Oh, no!

42
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,150
I hate blood.

43
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,500
Knife? Blood?

44
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,140
Are your parents butchers?

45
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,510
Butchers?

46
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,420
But you can't sleep at the store.

47
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,140
If you're that desperate,
then sleep at my house for the time being.

48
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,990
I can't live with you, hyung.

49
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,710
You're going to tell me to eat in the morning,

50
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,810
sleep early at night, fold the laundry well,

51
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,890
talk on the phone for only a little bit,
keep the room clean,

52
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,840
and you're going to be jealous
of me when I meet girls.

53
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,170
I don't think I'm young enough
to listen to your scolding anymore.

54
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,020
I don't think I can live with that kind of guy either.

55
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,720
You're a very picky person.

56
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,370
Hurry up and eat your food.

57
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,590
I'll find a room as quickly as possible.

58
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,600
Just let me stay at the store till then.

59
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,250
There is an empty room in
Manager Hong's house.

60
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,340
Can you talk to him for me?

61
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,900
And, you shouldn't live your life like that.

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,940
You don't even have a
magnificent life yourself.

63
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,770
Isn't telling others to do this
and that kind of wrong?

64
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:15,420
Why are you ignoring half of my words!
Am I your friend or something?

65
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,780
There's a popular type of speech
called Eun Chan's speech,

66
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,540
where you ignore and talk informally to people,
don't you know about it?

67
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,430
You can't stand watching others eating.
Here you go.

68
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,820
Something with meat.

69
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,370
Are you satisfied?

70
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,230
Meat!

71
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,860
But, you two seem to be getting attached.

72
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:53,250
My Chan, do you know that your cheek
is blushing right now?

73
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,310
My Chan, your style of guys is really unique.

74
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,800
Why do you keep accusing people
without any proof like that!

75
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,470
My Chan, what are you...

76
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:04,560
And stop calling me My Chan.
It's really cheesy!

77
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,420
My Chan, My Chan,
that's irritating me.

78
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,530
Eat slowly.

79
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:18,790
Foreigners go through this
kind of situation really well,

80
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,860
but I don't know what to say.

81
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,700
There are a lot of couples
who get back together after they divorce.

82
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,300
What's wrong with going out
after breaking up?

83
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,930
Yes, couples who go out again
after breaking up usually live better.

84
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,060
Thanks.

85
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,710
How do you feel now that
you decided to marry?

86
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,600
It's good.

87
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,350
But when are you two going to?

88
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:47,480
You, Han Sung,
are kind so you'll be good to your wife.

89
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,700
- That is...
- She's determined not to marry.

90
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:58,000
Wow, that's awesome!
If you do that, you're in trouble.

91
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,020
Here.

92
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,910
Boss, where do you keep going?

93
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,350
You came here a while ago already, dog hole.

94
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,330
Until when?

95
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,540
I didn't tell you?

96
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,950
I'm exercising.

97
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,650
Oh yeah, if you don't like the way I live,
just...

98
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:25,720
No, I absolutely love the way you live.

99
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,130
You even like to exercise at night.

100
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,450
I really respect you.

101
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,710
Where to now?

102
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,870
You know that I'm accepting you
just because Eun Chan requested, right?

103
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,170
Of course.

104
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,000
And you know that you need
to pay room rent, right?

105
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,750
Of course.

106
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,240
If I pay about $300...

107
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:05,020
Just pay $200, including the food fee.

108
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,230
Manager, you're going to be lucky some day!

109
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,230
You're really really going
to be lucky some day.

110
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,680
I know.

111
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,440
What are you doing?

112
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,550
I was looking for a place too.
Eun Chan told me to come.

113
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,920
I'll give you $300.

114
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:28,550
One or two people don't make a difference.
Door's open, come in.

115
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,470
Why didn't you go inside?

116
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,770
See for yourself, if there's anywhere to sit.

117
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,330
Do I take my shoes in?

118
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:55,580
Of course you have to take your shoes off.
What are you talking about?

119
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,380
Take off?

120
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,430
What's wrong with the house?!

121
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,730
I'll use this side.

122
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,470
Do whatever you want.

123
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,060
Or you can use it with me.

124
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:12,950
Are you kidding me?

125
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,720
Wow, it's Coffee Prince Shop.

126
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,570
Drink this.

127
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,490
It looks like he cooked those three years ago.

128
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,610
Is it all dried?

129
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,940
I guess I need to wash it again.

130
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,740
What is that.

131
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,930
I guess he just dries and then wears them,
instead of washing them.

132
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,820
Why aren't you drinking?

133
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,410
Enjoy your drink.

134
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,490
What's with him?

135
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,200
The average of the first week after opening,
27 coffees, 10 waffles.

136
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,510
Average of the second week,
19 coffees, 9 waffles.

137
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,850
Monday, Tuesday,
and Wednesday of the third week.

138
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,110
Total, 52 coffees and 24 waffles.
The average dropped.

139
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,100
Why do you think we're doing bad?

140
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,160
Don't you know?
It's because of you.

141
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,780
It's because we're trying to sell coffee to kids.

142
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,610
How many times do I have to tell you
that kids don't know how good my coffee is?

143
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,800
Sun Ki?

144
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,970
I sold 200 a day when I was working
in front of the women's college.

145
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,490
What I'm sure of is that
my waffles are delicious.

146
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,530
Why is Hwang Min Yeop absent for three days?

147
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,880
We're going to do take outs
starting from next week.

148
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,610
First of all, this asterisk mark
indicates the time slot of

149
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,710
when the floating population
near our store starts moving.

150
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,430
From 7AM to 9AM...

151
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,200
- When did he research all that?
- Who would work that early?

152
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,790
Those two hours are the peak.

153
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,680
Even if they don't know the real coffee taste,

154
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,300
how can we give them
coffee in paper cups?

155
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,340
You need to put the effort in for coffee.

156
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,700
You need to give them
coffee in a coffee cup.

157
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,950
One of the methods for advertising
international coffee stores said that

158
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:41,580
all the employees including the President
need to carry cups with the logo.

159
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,940
That was a successful case of advertising
without having to use money.

160
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,100
It's possible for us also.

161
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,210
When we start doing take outs,

162
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,650
we'll split into two teams,
to do morning and afternoon.

163
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,680
That's all.

164
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:51,960
Isn't that smart?

165
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,360
What is it?

166
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,180
Is Hwang Min Yeop not here again?

167
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,830
I fired him, don't look for him.

168
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,970
You fired Min Yeop?

169
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,150
What are you talking about?

170
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,610
What kind of circumstances?

171
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,870
What does he have to do?

172
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,620
How would I know?

173
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,420
It's kind of wrong to give him permission to quit
if you don't even know what's going on!

174
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,030
If he said he had a bad circumstance,

175
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,130
then you should have asked him what was wrong.

176
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,080
Even if something was wrong,
why would I ask him what was wrong.

177
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,050
When he just called me
and told me he was quitting?

178
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,870
He's someone who sang the national anthem.

179
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,180
Because he was so excited that
he got hired using his own abilities.

180
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,240
You should've definitely asked him,
isn't that what a good boss does!

181
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,490
It's because I'm a bad boss, okay?

182
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,670
Are you disappointed because there's no one
to mess up with you anymore?

183
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,710
He's an adult too!

184
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,480
If he has something going on,
he can do it himself.

185
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,440
Just mind your own business,
your own business.

186
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,300
Rude, rude.
So arrogant.

187
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,130
Mister!

188
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,410
Please give me hard bones and a soju.

189
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,690
Okay. Hey. You?

190
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,920
You're crazy.

191
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,920
If you couldn't work anymore,
you should've called me.

192
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,410
Why didn't you call me?
Are your fingers broken?

193
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,180
How did you come here?

194
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,830
Clean these kinds of stuff so
that customers could sit!

195
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,500
You're not going to do
well if you keep doing that.

196
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,330
Why are you here, interfering?

197
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,130
Are you in your right mind to be absent
without notice for several days?

198
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,360
I heard that this is your senior's stall.
He's not your brother or anything.

199
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,380
Why did you say you were
going to run his store?

200
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,060
How did you know?
You investigated me secretly, didn't you?

201
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:34,760
I went to your house, what about it?

202
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,480
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

203
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,940
I dropped it in the fish cake soup, what!

204
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,040
Did you come here because
you were worried about me?

205
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,770
Are you crazy?

206
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,550
Anyways, what kind of senior is he,
making you quit your job and do this?

207
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,250
It's my senior from the wrestling team.

208
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,610
He fed and gave me a place to sleep
whenever I was having difficulties.

209
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,430
- It was the senior I liked the most.
- Ahjussi, give me chicken feet here!

210
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,130
Oh, okay!

211
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,530
What are you doing?
Aren't you going to make chicken feet?

212
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,340
I'm going to.

213
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,970
Ew, what kind of smell is this?

214
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,960
Wow, that looks really delicious.

215
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,730
Eun Sae loves chicken feet a lot.

216
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,820
How can Eun Sae like these
disgusting chicken feet.

217
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,700
Welcome...

218
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,040
- Really?
- Hurry up.

219
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,870
What do I have to do?

220
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,330
What do you want?

221
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,580
Please give me soju.

222
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,590
Soju.

223
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:46,390
Your girlfriend is late today.

224
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,930
Hello... Mister?
Why did you call?

225
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,730
Where are you?

226
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,890
I'm in neighborhood 1. Why?

227
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:03,900
Ssulja is waiting for you.

228
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:08,560
Actually, I think I miss you even more.

229
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,310
Then I'll go to your house
after delivering all the milk!

230
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,490
Okay, I'll wait for you.

231
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,930
Okay!

232
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,330
Okay, I'll wait for you.

233
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:27,100
I'll wait.
He says he'll wait!

234
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:33,560
Mister, your sprout soup is really good.

235
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,950
You're good at cooking rice and sprout soup.

236
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,710
Wow, Miss B would love it.
I'm jealous.

237
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,710
She probably doesn't.

238
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,170
Mr. A is really narrow minded.

239
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,690
Here, dessert.

240
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,260
Let's go outside.

241
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,090
Is it that easy to accept
a girl who left him once?

242
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,010
I think Mr. A is a boyfriend with 99 points.

243
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,340
Be careful!

244
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,700
It's great.

245
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,160
- Are you having fun?
- Yeah. Giddy up!

246
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,100
You're the first guest to have gone up there.

247
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,370
Why?
It's really fun.

248
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,820
I know. Everyone just stares at it.

249
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,830
Ahjussi, come up!

250
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,760
How is work?

251
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,290
It's fun.

252
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,190
But the manager is really mean.

253
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,180
I don't know if I can insult your cousin.

254
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,840
Why? Is Mr. X harassing Miss Y?

255
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,390
No.

256
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:56,260
There's a worker who is huge
but very very sensitive.

257
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,070
He had something to do...

258
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,770
but he couldn't say that he was going
to be absent for a long time.

259
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,530
And just said he was going to quit.

260
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,100
That rude man fired him immediately.

261
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:08,360
Well, Han Kyul does that at times.

262
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:12,250
Hey, but later on, you'll probably
see that he's actually okay.

263
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:15,710
I don't know if that will happen or not.

264
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,930
Isn't it hard to pretend being a guy?

265
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,260
No... I'm good now.

266
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,630
Don't you consider me as a guy too?

267
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,690
No, I think you're a girl no
matter how I look at you.

268
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:37,660
I receive a lot of chocolates on
Valentine's Day now, from girls.

269
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,980
Of course, I don't get any on White Day.

270
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:44,670
Well, even if I was a guy,
I wouldn't like someone like me.

271
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,540
Why can't guys see this pretty lady?

272
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,190
She's pretty in my eyes.

273
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,860
Why...
are you saying that so directly...

274
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,180
I'm in a good mood now.

275
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,610
Oh yeah, if you have time next week,

276
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,020
do you want to go to a party with me?

277
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,800
It's an open party for the art exhibit.

278
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:06,830
If you're not uncomfortable with it,
I want to go with you.

279
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,800
I don't know much about art.

280
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,910
You don't need to go if you don't want to.

281
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,950
No, that's not it.
Why wouldn't I want to?

282
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,070
It's a party.

283
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,380
I would love to,
but my appearance is bad.

284
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,300
Ahjussi, you probably don't know this,

285
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,130
but girls really like those kinds of stuff.

286
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,910
A party with art exhibit...

287
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:33,020
Wow, my heart flutters just thinking about it.

288
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,250
It's really magnificent.

289
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,250
But if I go with you, you'd be embarrassed.

290
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:43,520
If you're hesitating because of that simple reason,
let's just go.

291
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,950
Are you sure you won't
be embarrassed of me?

292
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:49,000
No, you're really cool.

293
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:59,490
Okay, then I'll try my best to be pretty
so that you won't be embarrassed.

294
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,030
I promise, trust me.

295
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,820
Okay.

296
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,100
Do you know that?

297
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,630
You have the power
to make people happy.

298
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,840
Thanks.

299
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,610
Is your business going well?

300
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,030
Not really.

301
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,060
Good luck in getting more business.

302
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:33,340
Angel, I have the chicken feet you love.

303
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:34,570
Where are you?

304
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:39,690
Think where angel might be.

305
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:43,050
I'm in a place where you can't come in.

306
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,220
Where is that?

307
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,910
I'm going to find you even if it means
going to the ends of the Earth.

308
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,730
I'm in the ladies' public bath.

309
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,190
Find me.

310
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,410
I'm going to go in first.

311
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,570
Angel! Here.

312
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,570
Chicken feet and innards.

313
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,280
Hey, what are you doing here?

314
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:23,020
This is the ladies' bath.

315
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,200
And that strap...

316
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:27,970
That... that's for women... a bra.

317
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,970
The secret's out now.

318
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:30,980
You take care of it.

319
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,090
Why?

320
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,160
I don't know.

321
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,100
I don't know.

322
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,210
Angel.

323
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:41,430
What... you... your shoulder!

324
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:56,350
I saw you peeing standing up.

325
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:59,170
Take your time.

326
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,110
I even kissed you.

327
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,070
You sure did a lot.

328
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,210
Well, you even delivered
food to the men's section.

329
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,190
I was so desperate that I had to do that.

330
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,330
But why did you pretend to be a guy!

331
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,030
I wouldn't pretend to be a girl
even if I starve to death.

332
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:20,490
Would anyone even believe you if you did?

333
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,960
Mr. Hwang, you like Eun Sae, don't you?

334
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,280
See, is the fact that I'm not
Eun Sae's boyfriend that bad for you?

335
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,900
That means that you don't have
any rivals anymore.

336
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,960
In addition to that, I'm Eun Sae's older sister.

337
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,610
I liked how you were very trustworthy.

338
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,790
I saw another side of you at your shop.

339
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,260
Hey! What are you doing?

340
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:53,190
You want to keep seeing Eun Sae, don't you?

341
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,210
Yeah.

342
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,960
Not "Yeah", Yes.

343
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:58,870
Yes.

344
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,020
Now follow what I tell you to from now on.

345
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,490
Yes?

346
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,220
Yes.

347
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:16,270
What are you doing at night,
your eyes are sunken.

348
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:18,410
I went to Min Yeop's store.

349
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,710
His senior is really sick.

350
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,220
He's suffering.

351
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,560
That's good.

352
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,990
Being a owner of a snack stall is better
than being a cafe employee.

353
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,660
Are you really not curious
about Hwang Min Yeop?

354
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,060
Yeah.

355
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,610
You really don't have affections.

356
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,850
Did you find that out just now?

357
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,000
So dirty.

358
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:40,230
Manager Hong said not to flush after pooping.
The water isn't coming out.

359
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,100
They're going to cut off water supply
until the day after tomorrow.

360
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,480
Let's just close the shop.

361
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,210
It's only been a little bit since
we started this shop.

362
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,840
We'll just have to work with bottled water.

363
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,240
Wash the dishes, go to the bathroom,
and wash the dust cloth with bottle water.

364
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,920
You're so thrifty.

365
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,050
I know, hyung.

366
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,030
We don't have water, it's hot,
and there's no customers.

367
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,140
This is a chance heaven gave us.

368
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:02,250
Let's go somewhere cool.

369
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,010
A group rally!

370
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,370
Let's go to a group rally!

371
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,000
That's a good idea.

372
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:11,030
Hwang Min Yeop would love that the most.

373
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,110
Miss Han Yoo Ju.

374
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:17,810
You know how a lot of your works
have a concept using mother-of-pearl?

375
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:20,560
Where did you get that concept?

376
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,010
Well, first, about mother-of-pearl.

377
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,750
I was familiar with it ever since I was young.

378
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,940
She wasn't as pretty as
I thought she would be.

379
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,490
I heard her sponsor was DK?

380
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,190
How can she...

381
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,870
I heard they broke up.

382
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,880
Really?

383
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,020
You should've told me you were sick.

384
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,490
How many days were you like this?

385
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:55,570
It's a mustard soup.
It's good for colds.

386
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,410
How did you know I was sick?

387
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,100
When we were talking on the phone last night.

388
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,210
It didn't sound like you were okay
even though you said you were.

389
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,040
Why did you come if I said it was okay.

390
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,250
Is something going to go wrong
if you just say thank you?

391
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,000
It's warm.

392
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,310
You're going to come, right?

393
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,490
I don't think I can make it to the open party,
but I'll go the next day.

394
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,080
You have a fever.

395
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,580
Was Choi Han Kyul this handsome?

396
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,680
You smell good too.

397
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:41,520
And you even had facial hair?

398
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:45,020
It makes me uneasy, don't do that.

399
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,460
How did you make this?

400
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,220
You have a lot of talent.

401
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,030
Why isn't brother coming?

402
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,140
Shouldn't he come if you're this sick?

403
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,840
Did you fight with him?

404
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,990
Did I?

405
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,940
It seems like we did,
seeing that he didn't call me for three days.

406
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,610
You guys fought.

407
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,170
Why did you guys fight?
What's wrong again?

408
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,300
It's nothing.

409
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:10,960
Go now.

410
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,720
After a little bit.

411
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,170
It's because I'm uncomfortable
because I want to lie down.

412
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:20,110
Please. Go.

413
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,700
Are you going to eat the medicine?

414
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:27,100
Of course,
I even went to the hospital and got a shot.

415
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,410
Okay.

416
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,480
Well, you do everything well by yourself.

417
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:35,380
I want to help you,
but there's nothing to help.

418
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,370
You make me lose strength at times.

419
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,470
I'm going.

420
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:43,270
I'm not going to walk you out.

421
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,100
Han Yoo Ju is really sick.

422
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,000
Do you know that?

423
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,320
Even if she didn't say it,
it seemed as though she was waiting for you.

424
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,720
I shouldn't say this, but...

425
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:20,520
Take care of her when she's sick.

426
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,660
- Excuse me!
- Yes?

427
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,700
Please give me soju and egg rolls!

428
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,980
- Soju and egg rolls?
- Yes.

429
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:35,880
Excuse me, a soju and egg rolls.

430
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,430
Okay.

431
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,740
What are you guys doing!

432
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,460
You guys abandoned the cafe.

433
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,020
Are you guys in your right minds?

434
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,970
What do you mean
we abandoned the cafe?

435
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:47,090
You're the one who abandoned it.

436
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:50,190
You always go somewhere to meet girls.

437
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:53,420
Manager.
How did you...

438
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,320
Just tell me whether you're going
to work in the cafe or not.

439
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:00,960
I don't think I'm much help in the cafe,

440
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,520
but it's a job that I got
using my own abilities.

441
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,400
Excuse me, aren't you going to
serve us soju and egg rolls?

442
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,080
Hey, do you know how to cook egg rolls?

443
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,700
You don't?
Why don't you know anything?

444
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,950
What do you know how to do?

445
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,360
Do you know how to do it?

446
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:13,950
No.

447
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,630
How can you run a snack stall like this.

448
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,620
Where are the eggs?

449
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,980
Happy birthday to you!

450
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,480
Happy birthday to you!

451
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,460
Happy birthday dear Jo Po Ro!

452
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,190
Happy birthday to you!

453
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,660
No!

454
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,640
Are you okay?

455
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,680
Are you okay, Manager?

456
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,370
Why did you immediately run in?

457
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:11,310
- It's not like I ran in because I wanted to.
- Thank you.

458
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,670
This is for you.

459
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,820
It's okay.
Take it.

460
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,920
- Thank you.
- Bye.

461
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,850
Thank you so much.

462
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:21,450
Thanks. Bye!

463
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:27,920
Are you in your right mind?
Do you want to die?

464
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,800
You just overreacted.

465
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,960
Are you stupid?

466
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:40,620
How can you not know that you're hurt
even when you're bleeding!

467
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:44,100
Then why did you roll?

468
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:47,400
I thought we were filming
an action movie or something.

469
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:51,750
Don't worry.
This kind of injury heals in a day.

470
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:57,450
Where is a nearby hospital?

471
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,160
Drink this.

472
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,000
Were you extremely sick?

473
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,260
This much?

474
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,180
You still have a fever.

475
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,160
It went down a bit.
It was worse a while ago.

476
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,860
Then why were you drinking wine?

477
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:37,660
I just had one glass because
I wanted to go to sleep.

478
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:46,270
Anyways, why didn't you call me?

479
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,170
That is...

480
00:27:51,660 --> 00:28:00,370
I think it's still hard for me to accept
that you love work more than me.

481
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,390
I'm crappy, huh?

482
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:05,630
You are, kind of.

483
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:19,410
But, it seems like we're
really meant for each other.

484
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:22,560
I'm crappy too.

485
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:32,810
When you said that I was determined
not to marry in front of your friends,

486
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,830
it felt as though you were pushing me away

487
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:38,720
and my heart was being crushed.

488
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,160
If you don't call me,
I can just call you.

489
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:49,160
But I'm unyielding and decide
to see who wins.

490
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,110
And when you lose intentionally like this,

491
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,200
I get excited like a little kid.

492
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,130
I'm really crappy, huh?

493
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:59,970
Yeah, you're extremely crappy.

494
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:05,630
If you're not angry anymore,
you should kiss me.

495
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,860
Let's apply some ice pack.

496
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,620
You're going to sleep here, right?

497
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,630
Yeah, I'm going to.

498
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,210
You should've taken care of yourself.

499
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,400
You got hurt more than me.

500
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,060
Does it hurt?

501
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,330
No, it doesn't.

502
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:38,670
If you're hurt, just say so.

503
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:42,670
Pretend to be manly
only to your girlfriend.

504
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:45,280
It hurts.

505
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,020
When I was 8 years old,

506
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:58,820
I was playing around in the patio
and fell down from the third floor.

507
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,570
Oh, so you became weird ever since then.

508
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:11,590
At that time,
my dad caught me with his two arms.

509
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:16,260
But he fell as he caught me
so his arm was broken.

510
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:21,660
But he ran to the hospital
without realizing his pain.

511
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,440
That just came to my mind right now.

512
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,850
Manager,
you were kind of handsome today.

513
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,140
But, why are you getting
into other people's business?

514
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,830
You provided a house for Ha Rim
and worked at Min Yeop's snack stall.

515
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,350
Why do you do that?

516
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,360
I don't know if you know this,

517
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:44,100
but there's something called
loyalty in a human relationship.

518
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,120
Loyalty?

519
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:47,890
Yeah, loyalty.

520
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,860
I don't know what loyalty is.

521
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,010
Then, why did you come to Min Yeop?

522
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,960
That's because it was hard
to find another worker.

523
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,720
You have loyalty.

524
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,820
If you don't,
you wouldn't have saved me.

525
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,530
It's not like you love me or anything.

526
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,330
Sleep.

527
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,620
You look really sleepy.

528
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,320
Okay.

529
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:14,200
I set the alarm clock.

530
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,930
Sleep for at least an hour.

531
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:36,290
Wow. That sun!
That sun is really scorching me.

532
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,000
Ah! That's cold! What is this?!

533
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:43,800
The water! Wow. The water found you!

534
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:49,060
Splashing water needlessly.
But everyone that's going is a guy!

535
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,830
I told you not to worry!
I'm only going away for one night.

536
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,180
Are you going somewhere, Eun Chan?

537
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,590
I'm going to a group rally!

538
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:57,820
- I'll be back soon.
- Be careful! You'll fall!

539
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:05,300
The rice store lady said that you might
have a blind date with President Park.

540
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,960
It's not true, is it?

541
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:09,630
Mr. Ku, why must you meddle
in other people's affairs?

542
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,720
Move aside! I have to go to the market.

543
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:13,400
Wait wait! Noonim! Wait for me!

544
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:18,040
Let's go together! Wait! Stop! Hold on!

545
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:27,230
Did you make reservations for the condo?

546
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,070
I don't get it why we're having a group
bonding rally when we don't even have money.

547
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:33,140
Let's just go for the sake of going!

548
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,880
We said we would go!
You nag too much.

549
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,570
What are you looking at?
Get in the car!

550
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,650
Yeah, hyung!
Let's just go in good spirits!

551
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:43,410
Manager Hong said he would take care of everything
so let's just trust him and relieve our stress!

552
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,000
Hurry and get in the car!

553
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:48,630
Don't do anything stupid while we're there.
We have to get back early and work again.

554
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:52,470
Hey! If your house is close,
why are you so late?

555
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,620
I couldn't sleep because
I was so excited about the trip.

556
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:02,330
Okay! We're leaving!

557
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,600
But where are we going?

558
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,110
Where? We'll see.

559
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,690
How pretty! I wonder if it's organic?

560
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,700
Stop touching it!

561
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,880
Why are you getting angry?

562
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:24,150
Does it look like I wouldn't be angry?

563
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,920
You're not buying anything
and just feeling all of them!

564
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:29,750
You come to the market and
you're fussing if it's organic?

565
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:34,070
Excuse me! You really...
I won't buy it then!

566
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:39,530
Ahjumma! You have to buy
all of the fruits you touched!

567
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:42,650
Fine! How much is it?
Is 1000 won enough?

568
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,750
Do you think that a dollar is enough for this?

569
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:47,200
You touched so many of them!
And you think a dollar is enough?

570
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:50,280
Are you trying to ruin my store?

571
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:56,940
What's so good about those cherries
that you have to hit my love?

572
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,310
Are you a gangster? Gangster?

573
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:01,290
Yeah! I'm a gangster!
What are you going to do about it?

574
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,510
You good for nothing!

575
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,040
Get out of here! Now! Go! Go!

576
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:15,200
Except for you, I'm afraid of women!

577
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,570
Is that a woman that was
coming after you or an bull?

578
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:21,800
She's as strong as a beast.

579
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:25,280
Life brings many strange occurrences.

580
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:29,280
Why were you, such a refined lady,
even attempting to argue with her?

581
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,070
Don't say things that you don't mean.

582
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:36,280
No! You have such prominence
and elegance!

583
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,320
You're just like Sophia Lauren!

584
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,710
That's what my husband said.

585
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,700
I'm starting to miss him.

586
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:47,570
Becoming sensitive again?

587
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:53,830
If you're feeling down,
would you like to see a movie...

588
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,940
Shall we?

589
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:01,420
When I heard the rumors
about President Park,

590
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,420
I don't think he's right for you!

591
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:06,830
He has a lot of money
but he hasn't paid back any of his debt.

592
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:12,060
And he has these blemishes on his face
that look all stitched up.

593
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,450
Don't talk rubbish.
What man could I get, like this?

594
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,940
I think you're fine, Mom.

595
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,480
Mister! How's my mom?
Isn't she pretty?

596
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:27,470
She's beautiful!

597
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:32,180
Mom! When you find a good person,
you should date and then marry again!

598
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:36,970
You staying single is putting a dagger
in single men's hearts.

599
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:41,170
You.. Stop eating ice cream
and have some dinner!

600
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,090
- Uncle
- Huh?

601
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:48,680
I'm not going to give my mom away
to someone who has no money.

602
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:54,910
Hey... Sometimes I'm afraid of her.

603
00:35:55,070 --> 00:36:00,020
Only sometimes?
I'm always afraid of her!

604
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,080
When are we going to see the beach?

605
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:10,840
Who said we're going to the beach?

606
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:16,960
Is it the mountain?
Well, the mountain's good too.

607
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,720
Since when did you care so much
about Go Eun Chan?

608
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,170
Be quiet! He's sleeping!

609
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,900
Crazy fool.

610
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:59,400
Wow! Long time no see!

611
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,300
- How have you been?
- Welcome!

612
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,680
Why'd you bring so many people?

613
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,520
I have many followers!

614
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,430
I can't thank you enough!

615
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:11,080
Well...
I can't say that we'll be much help..

616
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,390
I'm sure you'll work
enough for meals at least!

617
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,080
Yes! Please feed us.

618
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,840
What couldn't we do for you
while you were here, Mr. Hong?

619
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,500
What is this? You persuaded us to come
because we would be relaxing...

620
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,130
I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry.

621
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,400
Is that enough?

622
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,970
You drive me crazy.

623
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,070
Manager Hong!

624
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:28,690
Yes?

625
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,830
Where are we?

626
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,860
This is my friend's farm.

627
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:36,150
The crop was so abundant this time,
he didn't have enough laborers.

628
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,240
We have to help each other out.
That's what humanity's about.

629
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,500
I should have known from the start
when Manager Hong cooperated so easily.

630
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,400
What is this?

631
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,460
There are no girls,
not even middle-aged women.

632
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,260
Let's just leave.

633
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:49,520
Working together like this builds unity, I guess.

634
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:50,900
Work hard.

635
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,810

What exactly are we supposed to be doing?

It's good that I saw you here!

I have to go to the bathroom badly...

644
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:10,230
You know where I sell apples down the street?

645
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,010
Please watch it for me for a little while!

Where do we pick them?

Mister! How much are those?

651
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,510
I'm not the owner...

652
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:46,000
Do you want some apples?
Hey Ahjussi! Can I have two apples?

653
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,380
That's 1000 won.

654

It was fun because there's so much business.

Oh, that? I sold all of it!

Excuse me?

672
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:16,310
Well, what can you do?
It was an accident.

673
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,410
You went through a lot of work
selling those apples...

674

I'll compensate for all of the apples.

What do you mean compensate?
You did those things out of kindness.

to be sold to another customer tomorrow morning.

You'll lose the customer's trust.

681
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,630
It's okay, there's nothing we can do.

682

and how did he meet the woman he loves?

No, I was just curious.

it smells.

all of them in your mouth?

Go Eun Chan, what's your dream?

784
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:28,950
I think that my dream is
for Eun Sae and my mother,

785
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:32,950
to live happily and have plenty to eat.

786
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,010
And I think when I was
still teaching Tae Kwon Do,

00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:37,210
I wanted to be an impressive master.

788

These days, i just want to brew coffee well.

789
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:45,010
I see the whole world as coffee these days.

790
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:47,070
Although, I'm sure if I had worked
at a barbecue place,

791
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,800
I would have seen the world as meat.

792
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,870
Anyways, I don't know what my dream is,

793
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:57,780
but these days,
I want to be a good coffee brewer.

00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,810
Me?

796
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:09,410
I just want to see what I want to see,
and not see what I don't want to see.

797
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:13,450
I want to enjoy a happy and fun life.

798
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:15,650
What about your habit?

799
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:21,730
You didn't look too happy when you
were with the person you liked.

800
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,550
What do you like so much about her?

801
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:26,460
Because she's pretty?

802
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:29,060
The reason?

803
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,780
I could give you a million reasons.

804
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:37,700
A million.
That's so corny it gives me goose bumps.

805
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:44,020
Actually, there aren't really
a million reasons why I like her.

806
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:46,320
I just do.

807
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:50,060
Even if I try not to like her,
I can't stop.

808
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,900
I can't do anything about it.

809
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:57,520
If time goes by, I guess it'll be okay.

810
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:03,610
It's scary when you say that
you can't do anything about it.

811
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:12,870
Don't sleep! If you sleep here,
you'll just be food for the mosquitoes!

812
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,480
Did you put something in the tea?
Why am I so sleepy?

813
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:20,240
Wake up!

814
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:26,880
And you said you couldn't
sleep in unfamiliar places.

815
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:39,310
Pure-hearted Manager. Good night to you.
Good night.

816
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:03,710
This is the cost of the apples.
Could you give this to them?

817
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,180
The cost of the apples.

818
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:06,290
Are you crazy?

819
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:09,150
Do I have to receive
money and your labor?

820
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,290
There's no need!

821
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:16,380
We had a great trip, great thanks to you.
You didn't have to give us this many apples.

822
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:18,430
Then leave some.

823
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:20,580
Why don't we just buy some?

824
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,830
Apples are great for constipation.

825
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:24,050
Stop fooling around.

826
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:27,050
An apple a day is good for your health.

827
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:31,030
How much are the apples?

828
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:35,850
Goodbye!

829
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,410
We could make a lot of
money selling apples in the morning.

830
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:42,890
You're being conniving.

831
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:44,940
A coffee shop sells coffee.

832
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:48,790
That's right, he wouldn't be Manager Hong
if he didn't resist the idea.

833
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:50,940
So how much did you say you'd buy?

834
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:53,370
We just said we'd buy a little more than others.

835
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:57,200
An apple is 50 won,
it's a little extreme.

836
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:02,740
People who farm must get so angry,
they don't even get much income.

837
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:04,800
What's this I smell?

838
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,210
The smell of humanity?

839
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,950
What are you doing?

840
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,760
Ouch! Stop! It's too crowded!

841
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:21,080
I feel a little carsick.

842
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:24,720
I thought it would be better
if I sat in the middle.

843
00:55:27,110 --> 00:55:29,420
Didn't I do well?

844
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:32,220
You smell like sweat!
Disgusting!

845
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:47,500
Who? The Music Director Ahjussi?

846
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:50,520
No, another ahjussi.

847
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:52,380
Are you an ahjussi killer?

848
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:55,690
What do you think of the phrase
"I can't help it?"

849
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,230
You're masking your words again.

850
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:00,830
How do people hear the
same words differently?

851
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,700
What's this?

852
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:08,390
Habit. You can't help it.

853
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:13,670
Habit. You can't help it.

854
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:20,480
Hello?
Ahjussi!

855
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:23,080
You didn't forget about
tomorrow's plans, right?

856
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:28,110
Yeah. I'll pick you up around two.

857
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:30,580
Are you sure I can just
wear anything tomorrow?

858
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:33,360
Of course!
Just wear what you normally do.

859
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,110
I'm going to wear what I wear everyday.

860
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:36,530
But still.

861
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:40,410
Mom, it's not going to be easy.

862
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:43,850
Well, it's worth a try.

863
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:48,390
See! I told you it was going to be hard!

864
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:51,640
It's because you're not used to it!
If you keep looking at her...

865
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:53,070
It's weirder.

866
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:56,500
In my eyes, she looks much
more feminine and pretty.

867
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:00,530
Is it really not weird?

868
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,920
Hello.

869
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:28,510
Dresses don't really suit me,
so... Is it weird?

870
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:36,680
No, no. How should I say this...
You look unique!

871
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:41,630
I borrowed my younger sister's,
and they put makeup on me...

872
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:44,780
You look so handsome!

873
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,450
You look like a movie star!

874
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:50,740
Lady, please get in.

875
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,360
I'm sorry,

876
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:31,460
I'll send it to the main office
by tomorrow afternoon.

877
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:34,830
Yes, I'm sorry.

878
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:44,840
Hold on, I'll call you back later.

879
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:55,830
Wow. Wow. Have you
by any chance seen Go Eun Chan?

880
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:58,250
Why are you acting like that?

881
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:24,230
No one recognizes you, don't worry.

882
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:26,620
What am I doing to my chest?

883
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:29,860
Prince? Don't worry,
there are many young men here.

884
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:33,430
Good work in the past month,
and I hope you enjoy working here.

885
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:36,170
Let's try hugging just once.

886
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:37,490
Hold on, Yoo Ju.

887
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:39,450
Mister! I'll change into something else.

888
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:40,910
I feel kind of strange.

889
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:42,120
Hold on.

890
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:45,400
Let's date!

891
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:49,470
Does Mr. X like Miss Y?
Why would he pester her for no reason?

892
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,820
Miss Y has fallen in love with someone.
