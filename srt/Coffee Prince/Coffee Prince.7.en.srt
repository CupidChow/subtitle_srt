1
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,120
Go Eun Chan.

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,410
Let's hug once.

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,320
I can't focus because of you.

4
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,280
Let me hug you just once.
Then I think I'll be fine.

5
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,810
Oh! That's nothing, right?

6
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,400
Thanks, let's go.

7
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,010
I must be crazy!

8
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,900
How does it feel
to go back to your ex-boyfriend?

9
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,330
Seventh Cup
Nothing special? You don't feel anything?

10
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,820
Aren't you having an art exhibition?

11
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,830
You should just say you missed me.

12
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,170
It would have been better
if you said that.

13
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,250
When are you coming?

14
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,680
I won't tell you, I'll make you anxious.

15
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,300
I was worried about how
you'd be after I left for Seoul.

16
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,670
Since you're able to joke so much,
it seems you've been well.

17
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,590
Tell me the truth, when will you be here?

18
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,370
You have something to tell me?

19
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,290
No.

20
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,050
Then why are you sneaking glances at me?

21
00:02:59,060 --> 00:02:59,900
I did no such thing.

22
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,820
Who says you didn't? You sure did.

23
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,360
When did I ever sneak glances at you?

24
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,090
Hey! Tell Go Eun Chan that I want him to follow
me so he should get changed and come out.

25
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,940
Where to?

26
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,340
Boss, where to?

27
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,710
They all bully me.

28
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,390
Eun Chan!

29
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,800
What are we doing in a
book store during working hours?

30
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,930
This is totally Nazi.

31
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:36,840
If you're buying books for yourself then just come
on your own.  Why do you have to pull me along?

32
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,730
You haven't spoken for an hour,
what's going on?

33
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,250
Am I a slave?

34
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,690
There are still many chores
for me back at the shop.

35
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,520
If you have something to tell me
privately, that I can understand.

36
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,280
But that's not it.

37
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,640
You talk too much.

38
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,030
[The Secret of Success
of the President of Dong In Foods.]

39
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,340
This might be useful to us, let's buy one.

40
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,860
I don't think it's useful.

41
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,240
Oh yes! Your grandmother
used to be the president, right?

42
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,890
Grandma is the Chairman.

43
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,500
And this is?

44
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,460
My father.

45
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,170
Father?

46
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,150
No resemblance at all.

47
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,350
Boss, you're... worse than him.

48
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,510
But isn't your family background too excellent?

49
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,980
If you're buying this many,
why didn't you shop on the internet?

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,590
You didn't drive because you said
there'll be traffic jams.

51
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,460
You should at least buy me a drink
to show some appreciation.

52
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,680
Isn't it true?

53
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,340
The weather is so hot.

54
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,000
The books are heavy too.

55
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,790
These books are all available via the internet.

56
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,790
Are you angry?

57
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,300
These books are all for you.

58
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,330
What? Mine?

59
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,240
Didn't you want to be a barista?

60
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,240
Then you should study.

61
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,240
Wow!

62
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,800
I'm so touched by my boss.

63
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,800
Wow! Great!

64
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,970
I'm just doing good to those I hate.

65
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,610
Why do you hate me?
What did I do wrong?

66
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,750
Mister!

67
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,080
Yes, it's me.

68
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,740
Yes.

69
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,390
I wrote a song, I want you to hear it.

70
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,770
Me?

71
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,150
Yes, hang on.

72
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,730
Oh. I've heard this song before.

73
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,730
Did you write it?

74
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,230
Who is it?

75
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,060
I won't tell you.

76
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,500
Is there someone with you?

77
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,670
I'm out now.

78
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,250
Then it's not convenient for
you to be on the phone.

79
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,440
Nothing like that at all. Yes.

80
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,440
Who on earth is it?

81
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,240
Han Seong.

82
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,460
Don't mind him. Other than now,
I won't have free time for calls.

83
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,160
Who says you have no time?
Time, you have a lot. What a joke!

84
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,330
Ahjussi, let me hear the song again.

85
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,760
Well, then I'll play you some more.

86
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,720
It's good.

87
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,220
You listen too.

88
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,620
I won't, take it away.

89
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,810
It's up to you.

90
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,480
Are you with Han Kyul now?

91
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,890
Yes.

92
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,890
I see.

93
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,290
Then let's talk again later.

94
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,070
I'll call you later.

95
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,530
Yes.

96
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,750
Let's go.

97
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,210
Why make me wait under the hot sun?

98
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,870
Those who are into the arts,
aren't they all so great?

99
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,710
How do they create something out of nothing?

100
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:05,510
Whenever I see those artists,
I feel that they're so mysterious.

101
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,400
Mysterious, my foot!

102
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,860
The saying "you can't make the throat weave a spider
web", not all who indulge in it can feed themselves.

103
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,520
How can you describe the arts using food?

104
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,440
Your words are too...

105
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,320
Quiet, keep quiet.

106
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,870
What's going on?

107
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,430
Wait! Wait! Wait! Push that way!

108
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,390
Oh dear!

109
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,820
It's gone. All crushed!

110
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,950
How can you leave that in your pocket?

111
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,140
It'll be easily crushed like that.

112
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,650
What to do? It's all crushed.

113
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,240
Bend your arm a little.

114
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,240
Those behind you will feel uncomfortable.

115
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,340
Is that so?

116
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,330
How can I...to a guy...?

117
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,910
And Han Seong hyung...
it's not jealousy...

118
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,090
How can I....

119
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,790
Why did he put Superman in his pocket?

120
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,030
I'm the boss, you're the employee.

121
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,750
We should end it here.

122
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,700
Yes, you're a more likable employee than the others.

123
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,420
We should really end it here. End.

124
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,710
End!

125
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,800
I'm late.

126
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,840
Is the boss here or not? Here or not?

127
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,510
He'd better not be here yet.

128
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,510
I'm here. Is the boss here yet?

129
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,790
That's....

130
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,790
These folks are so interesting.

131
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,710
Take a look in your locker.

132
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,520
I'm told it's a souvenir
for our one-month anniversary.

133
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,950
No souvenir?

134
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,900
Chin Ha Rim.

135
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,090
Hwang Min Yeop.

136
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,390
Hong Gi Shik.

137
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,270
Why didn't I get one?

138
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,150
He wants to give it to me personally later on.

139
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,850
Boss! Boss!

140
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,470
Boss, you're not giving me the toy souvenir?

141
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,780
I gave you one earlier, right?

142
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:14,720
But you should give me another one
for the one-month anniversary, right?

143
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,110
Is mine different from the rest?

144
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,180
What's different?

145
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,550
Why is it different?

146
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,310
Like there's some special significance.

147
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,150
Or...

148
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,150
Like precious or something.

149
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,150
Or could it be it's more expensive?

150
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,280
Yours is the smallest, all right?

151
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,280
Do your work.

152
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,110
He's clearly angry but
why is my heart beating so fast?

153
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:40,920
He should give it to us all at once, why must
he do it separately and let me think otherwise?

154
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,290
He's changing back and forth,
I really can't read him at all.

155
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,950
Why? He is someone bullying you?

156
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,680
Yes, there is such a person.

157
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,170
He makes my head giddy.

158
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,530
Then when I come to, he'd have run
off without a word, a complete jerk!

159
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,640
Then stop playing with such people.

160
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,960
Who on earth is it?

161
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,890
What a shock! What is it?

162
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,790
You know about it too, right?

163
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,180
What?

164
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,940
Go Eun Chan,

165
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,030
Eun Sae's sister.

166
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,570
How did you find out?

167
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:16,790
Eun Chan knows about this too?

168
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,960
Don't worry. I'm very loyal.

169
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,390
This guy!

170
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,310
Where's the boss?

171
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,930
He went to make deliveries.

172
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,620
Did you tell your mother to fry more cakes?

173
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,410
Yes.

174
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,620
What is the special occasion?

175
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,260
Welcome.

176
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,840
It's my father's death anniversary.

177
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,020
Your father's death anniversary?

178
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,180
You're back.

179
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,270
Then tonight we'll go to your house
to eat the anniversary dinner.

180
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,380
Since it's such a sad occasion, it's better
to have more people around.

181
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,380
Such a good man.

182
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,830
Brother, you're coming too, right?

183
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,980
Sun Ki, you too,
don't make any appointments tonight.

184
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,980
Come along and eat with us.

185
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,530
Seems like he's upset with me again.

186
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,490
Get off work earlier.

187
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,070
Why?

188
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,850
You're giving me special treatment
for my father's death anniversary?

189
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:25,060
So arrogant! What's wrong with
turning your face over here?

190
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,060
Do you like me?

191
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,460
Don't do that. That will only force you
to sink into quicksand and kill yourself.

192
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,160
See that narcissist!

193
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,170
What did I do wrong
that he's still coming at me?

194
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,200
Me too! Me too! Me too!

195
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,080
Eun Sae, is there anything you can't do?

196
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,080
Jilting you.

197
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,520
If that's the case,
you can't do it for the rest of your life.

198
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,530
Delicious.

199
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,130
You're eating too much.

200
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,190
Move aside.

201
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,970
He's good.

202
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:47,170
See that? See that? He did it so well.

203
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,020
The oil splattered out.

204
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,750
Why did you flip it so hard?

205
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,840
Move, I'll do it.

206
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,170
Give me your handphone number, please.

207
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,200
Do it again.

208
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,580
Look here.

209
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:26,360
Just because of a meal, you're not
going back when it's already 10 PM.

210
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,780
Growing up in shorts happened to us long ago.

211
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,170
I just don't understand for how long
you plan on sticking with us.

212
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,280
Just forget it if you don't get it.

213
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,540
I say, Manager Hong.

214
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,230
The two of us are already in the process,

215
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,420
I've already proposed formally to Ms. Ji Yang.

216
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,060
Just like two tributaries meeting to form a river.

217
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:55,870
Simply put, our relationship is one in which
we share intimate heart-to-heart talks.

218
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,560
Intimate heart-to-heart talks?

219
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,690
Yes.

220
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:03,160
Ours is one of kissing under the bridge!

221
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,080
What?

222
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,120
Ms. Ji Yang even packed her
bags intending to elope with me.

223
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,750
So many crazy ideas?

224
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,990
Always making up useless ones.

225
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,430
Is the ceremony almost over?

226
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,130
Yes.

227
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,010
You two have some of this.

228
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,900
Delivery!

229
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,790
How did he make all this?

230
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,790
It must be really tiring.

231
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,300
Putting it together piece by piece...

232
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,230
Isn't his sincerity really intense?

233
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,610
What's so great about this?

234
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,610
It can be put together in no time.

235
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,840
Let me try.

236
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,840
Don't touch that.

237
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,670
It's cheap stuff. Cheap stuff!

238
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:48,030
Fight on! Metal arm! Metal Leg!

239
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,480
The matchless one! The big moth!

240
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,210
Is this mister interested in me?

241
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,970
Why is he so nice to me?

242
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,220
A woman can still laugh on being called
Metal Arm or Metal Leg?

243
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,270
I think you must be the only one in this world.

244
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,690
Also, he has yet to find out you're a girl.

245
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,410
Don't get friendship and love all mixed up.

246
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,020
I can't sit still any longer.

247
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,330
Hello.

248
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:26,020
Manager, there are some things I'd like to know.

249
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,410
You're disturbing people again.

250
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,540
What? What are you curious about?

251
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,860
It's nothing important,

252
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:36,570
I want to know why you
sent me such a big present.

253
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:40,020
Wanting to find out your
intentions might sound a bit cruel.

254
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,130
But I feel your sincerity so...

255
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,750
To just accept it at once seems rather inappropriate....

256
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,260
You should just accept it,
there's no special intention.

257
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:52,480
I'm encouraging you to continue
with your lifestyle and live well.

258
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,440
You called me just to ask about this?

259
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:56,670
Why the impatience...?

260
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,670
- Got it. Go to sleep....
- I'm hanging up.

261
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,660
I sent it because I like you.

262
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,660
Will it kill you to speak more directly?

263
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:16,660
Of course I'm living well,
since when have I ever been lazy?

264
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,950
He sent the present then he gets angry.

265
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,360
Just one man yet he changes
his mood suddenly ten times a day.

266
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,340
I just can't figure him out.

267
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,410
You're the one I can't figure out.

268
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,550
What?

269
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,880
The other time when you got the watch.

270
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:30,750
What about?

271
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:35,200
You said he gave you a fake branded item
then he took it back so he was petty, right?

272
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:36,740
Yes.

273
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,880
Then what about that time
you got hurt at the roadside stall?

274
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:43,510
You were angry he pounced to save you even though
he was so stiff and even got you injured instead.

275
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,120
Yes.

276
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,470
What about when he hugged you?

277
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:53,160
You knew he was a man yet you scolded him
for being a pervert and a worm.

278
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,050
That was then...

279
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,050
Now it's great.

280
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,040
Study!

281
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,770
Come here.

282
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,810
Hello. Who are you?

283
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,970
What's your name?

284
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,870
Do you want to eat?

285
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,880
Take a flight.

286
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,990
Sleep.

287
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,660
Crazy. I'm crazy. I'm the one who's crazy.

288
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,570
Crazy.

289
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,330
Ugh, what's up with me!

290
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,480
Are you up?

291
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,080
Yes. Why?

292
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:13,260
You're up already? That's early.

293
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,030
You haven't eaten yet, right?

294
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,030
Why are you asking?

295
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,960
Nothing. It's just that.... it's time for eating.

296
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,060
I'm just checking... if you've eaten.

297
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:27,680
I haven't eaten too.  You ate?

298
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,180
Not yet? Hello?

299
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,180
Manager!

300
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,500
Manager!

301
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,390
Hello? Manager! You hung up?

302
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:39,430
I'm still here, I haven't eaten too.

303
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,510
I'm at your place right now, I'll be right up.

304
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,980
I'm out jogging now.

305
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,040
Jogging? Where are you?

306
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,750
So what if you knew?

307
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,750
The pavilion?

308
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,590
The path leading from the pavilion
is best for a jog.

309
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,590
Don't come over.

310
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,170
Why?

311
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,320
But if you want to, then come.

312
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,320
Got it. I'll be right over.

313
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,530
I'm crazy.

314
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,960
What the heck!

315
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,630
Han Yoo Joo, I'm Han Kyul.

316
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,790
For exercising, what's this you're wearing?

317
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,790
Let's go together.

318
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,360
Choi Han Kyul!

319
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,450
Han Yoo Joo! You're here!

320
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,450
Eun Chan's here too.

321
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:57,170
Must be heavy. Let me.

322
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,170
What did you bring?

323
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,170
What did you bring?

324
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,950
Eun Chan, come over and try this.

325
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,730
I'm fine, I've had too much to eat.

326
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:15,780
Why put on a front? You're someone
who goes all out for food.

327
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,290
This is good. Eat!

328
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,520
What's that?

329
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,520
What is it?

330
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,070
Don't move.

331
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,520
What are you doing?

332
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,150
Oh, you're so messy.

333
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,150
Disgusting.

334
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,920
Why pretend to be nice? What a joke!

335
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,120
In front of us, you're yelling at us everyday.

336
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,700
Really!

337
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,020
Eun Chan, how about some tea?

338
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,420
No, I have some my own.

339
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,210
What's that behind you?

340
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,960
Nothing.

341
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,380
I brought some leftovers from
the ceremony last night.

342
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,780
Wow! I love food from the ceremony.

343
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,060
It must be good.

344
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,470
Hey! You brought that for me?

345
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,300
You're showing concern for the manager?
You've matured.

346
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:10,130
See! Other than you, everyone likes me.

347
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,640
Seems so.

348
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,640
Don't go overboard.

349
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:16,800
It's better to feed you than the dog
so I brought the leftovers, that's all.

350
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,760
Do you know how much I hated this guy at first?

351
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,740
I even thought he was a hoodlum.

352
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,380
Who do you think will fancy you?

353
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,150
I was just thinking where did
this dry, old orange come from?

354
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,550
Then I found out later that
he's a young head of household.

355
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,370
He was working so hard in his life.

356
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,770
He had a work schedule at home,
I was so surprised.

357
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,500
Delivering milk and supper,

358
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,580
coaching kids at the taekwondo hall,
peeling chestnuts...

359
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,620
Oh, and he's sewing doll eyes too.
That was the highlight for me.

360
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,810
It's not right to make fun of
how others make a living.

361
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,220
I'm not making fun, I'm praising you.

362
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:57,710
But isn't it too much,
that manager from the toy factory.

363
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,690
Although it's only pure labor, but just
five cents per doll is really too little.

364
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,990
Your habit...

365
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,980
...is real bad.

366
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,750
Eun Chan, would you like some?

367
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:18,260
How does a person get the bad habit
of doing something he shouldn't?

368
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,560
You'd better change your bad habit.

369
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,810
Is it very difficult for you?

370
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,810
Because it's been too long?

371
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,440
Your joke is too much now.

372
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,630
You can't do anything.

373
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,430
You're just running the coffee shop
which your grandmother opened for you.

374
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,780
Yet you look down on others.

375
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:32,540
Once you're not happy,
you totally lose your cool.

376
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,970
You live life too easy.

377
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,970
Do I live life easier than you?

378
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,150
Under any circumstance,
you pretend to be cute and pitiful.

379
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:41,510
Whether with a guy or girl,
you butter up and gloss it over.

380
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,170
Don't you?

381
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,480
I'm not of the type that butters up.

382
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,430
I might take more initiative
to be outgoing but....

383
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,310
Then you take too much initiative
to be outgoing.

384
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:52,020
With no regard for the time and place,
you're always grinning.

385
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,470
I've been hinting with my eyes
that you're not needed there.

386
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,470
But you just couldn't read me.

387
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,790
Too outgoing. Too much!

388
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,150
- Really!
- Really?

389
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,470
Really!

390
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,340
I'll be off after eating this kimbap.

391
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,640
Why did he pick out all the cucumbers?

392
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,980
Oh, really!

393
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:36,400
No, no. That's why...

394
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:40,240
Just tell me whether you gave her
your number or not, just that will do.

395
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:44,000
Is silence your hobby?

396
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,270
Anyhow,
if you have any evil intention on Eun Sae....

397
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:49,760
I'll do this to your arms and legs...

398
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,560
Better be careful with what you say, dumbbell.

399
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,400
What?

400
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,410
Dumbbell?  You!

401
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,410
Yes, this is No Sun Ki.

402
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,900
I'll be right over.

403
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:01,210
Hey! Where are you going?

404
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,380
You really don't know her address?

405
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,730
No.

406
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,200
She left after giving me this.

407
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,290
Although it may not be appropriate for me to say this,

408
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:30,690
for Hee Sun, the three years she spent with you,
it was just like a dream.

409
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,910
Other than that, there's nothing....

410
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:34,010
I'm working now.

411
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:38,080
No matter how unwilling I am,
I still have to live amongst people.

412
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,740
This is what Hee Sun told me.

413
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,780
Although you were even willing
to take care of Hee Sun's baby.

414
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,190
But for a young man, that burden is too much.

415
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:47,500
So stop....

416
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,300
I... can manage.

417
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:56,670
So long as she's willing to be by my side.

418
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:01,700
If that won't do then just see me occasionally.

419
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,590
Please tell her that.

420
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,610
So you've been looking for her
for three years?

421
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:34,250
Wow! I'm so moved, brother.

422
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,540
From now on, I'll call you that.

423
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,960
Also, I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

424
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,960
I thought you went to meet Eun Sae.

425
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,850
Actually I too, gave all my passion to Eun Sae.

426
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,940
But you have surpassed a baby
and you've surpassed your age.

427
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,020
For three years, for that woman's sake,
you're here in Seoul.

428
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,660
Lower your voice.

429
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,900
And I don't remember I have a rascal
younger brother like you.

430
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:04,830
If only he didn't speak Japanese,
he'll be a great brother.

431
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,240
Hyung!

432
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,940
Hyung!

433
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,050
That's not what I meant, miss.

434
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,440
You're saying it can't be done?

435
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,340
Not that it can't but...

436
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,680
Don't waste your breath.
Just tell me whether you can do it or not.

437
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,850
I'll do it for you.

438
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,370
Can't even get the coffee right.

439
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,650
What's wrong again this time?

440
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,530
Putting the cream on top of it.

441
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,660
This is already the fourth time.

442
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,600
The first time she asked for lemon in the water.

443
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,660
Then she didn't like the coffee cup so I changed it.

444
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,940
There are no refills for latte but she insisted.

445
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:40,730
She thinks this is her house.

446
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,720
Go Eun Chan,

447
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,240
how could you treat a customer like this?

448
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,580
Whatever the customer asks for,
just serve it with a smile.

449
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,900
With a scowl like that,
is that the right behavior?

450
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,790
Do it better. I'll be watching you.

451
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,260
You get bullied yourself for once and see.

452
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,390
Follow me.

453
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:10,480
I told you to treat the customer
right and now you're unhappy?

454
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:13,110
When the customer asks for a change,
you should just say yes.

455
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,070
Is it so difficult to say something like that?

456
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,210
Your back won't hurt when
you're talking standing up.

457
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,310
Manager, you haven't been
bullied before so you won't know,

458
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,570
But the one who's being bullied
has it real tough.

459
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:23,060
It's hard taking an impossible customer's order,

460
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:26,160
it's hard delivering milk,
it's hard delivering food,

461
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,240
and it's hard sewing eyes on dolls too!

462
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,760
Why are you bringing that up?

463
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,930
You think poverty is something to be proud of?

464
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:36,410
When did I say you could tell everything
about me to other people?

465
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,950
Why tell them without asking me, why?!

466
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,810
Then what about you?

467
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,580
Bad habit or something?

468
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,960
You should be able to differentiate
what can be said and what can't.

469
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,000
How dare you say all that back then?

470
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,700
What about you?

471
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,470
That it's only a coffee shop opened by
my grandmother? That I'm arrogant?

472
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:53,300
Who was the one who said
I put on a pitiful, cute act?

473
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,850
That's humiliating, you know!

474
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:57,740
You ask why do what I do?
Because I have to earn a living!

475
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,370
How dirty, despicable.

476
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:01,250
Despicable?

477
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:01,990
Dirty?

478
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,310
Who is? I am?

479
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:03,790
To you?!

480
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,920
I'm saying that about the way you live!

481
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,660
Rascal! You're too much!

482
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,200
Brother!

483
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,300
What are you doing?

484
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,390
Let go!

485
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,660
I let him stay because he was pitiful
but he has to argue with me like this.

486
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,320
You let me stay because I was pitiful?

487
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,430
Then you shouldn't have let me!

488
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:20,420
Have you lost your memory?
You're the one who asked me to take you in!

489
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,780
Oh yeah?
Then things will be fine if I leave, then.

490
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:24,630
Are you scared to? Get out!

491
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,100
What are you doing? Hyung!

492
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,940
I don't need jerks like you around!

493
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,870
Stepping on my kind heart like that.

494
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,700
I don't need anyone like you too.

495
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,520
You always just do what you want.
This is so upsetting.

496
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,010
Eun Chan hyung!

497
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,670
Hyung! Eun Chan!

498
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,930
Hey, don't go after him!
Go back to work!

499
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,070
What's wrong?

500
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,990
You know his temper..

501
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:47,500
It's not because of that...

502
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,220
Then what happened...

503
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,980
Why did you argue with him like that...

504
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,370
Get out! Out!

505
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,590
Eun Chan hyung!

506
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,910
I'll be going.

507
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,430
Where are you going?

508
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:18,630
I'm sorry Mr. Hong, I'll call you sometime.

509
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,060
Hyung!

510
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:23,170
How could you just leave like this?

511
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,340
Talk with me.

512
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,120
Later.

513
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,520
Are you really not going to listen to me?

514
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,520
Ha Rim. Aren't you going to work?

515
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,130
Brother!

516
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,000
Eun Chan!

517
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,060
Ah~ tasty.

518
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:59,010
But how come I'm not drunk yet...

519
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,830
Mister, how much did I drink?

520
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:05,730
I was going to piggy back you home
if you got drunk. But I guess you noticed.

521
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,610
And do what?

522
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,500
Then again, I'm pretty strong so I'm useful.

523
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:17,680
Why? Is Han Kyul giving you a hard time?

524
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,680
No.

525
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,500
Do you want to go on a drive?

526
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,910
This feels great!

527
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:23,370
I feel like my head's clearing up.

528
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,690
It's hot!

529
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,030
It's so good.

530
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,020
Do you have more rice and kimchi?

531
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,580
Brother! Brother!

532
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,520
What now?

533
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,520
What are you going to do with Chan?

534
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,920
Can't you do something?

535
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,350
Why should I?

536
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,130
You told him to leave.

537
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:19,180
Why are you being so stubborn?
He's still young!

538
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:22,670
I don't need someone who comes
and goes as he wishes.

539
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,010
You didn't mind when Min Yeop did it.

540
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,720
Why are you so mean to only Chan?

541
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,720
Let's stop.

542
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,570
Hey.

543
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,570
Did Chan call?

544
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,650
I sent him twenty text messages,
but I have nothing. He ignored them all.

545
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,500
Man, I want to see Chan so much...

546
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,860
I want to see Chan SO BADLY!

547
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:05,980
Mom!

548
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,240
When are we going to eat lunch?

549
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,680
We just ate breakfast.

550
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:16,040
What are you going to do about all those
Coffee books stacked on the desk?

551
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:18,160
Are you going to sell them?

552
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,300
I'll figure it out.

553
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:24,210
Stop lying on the ground
and go out to the cafe.

554
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:27,910
How can I go back
if I came out on my own?

555
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,340
How humiliating.

556
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,520
Is this the first time?

557
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:33,510
You fought with the manager
all the time and still worked there.

558
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,190
Why is it so humiliating all of the sudden?

559
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,800
You just need to go in and
pretend that nothing happened.

560
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,850
Good-for-nothing?

561
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,240
Good for nothing?

562
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,320
Isn't that my phone? Hey!

563
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,830
Eun Chan. You did wrong, right?

564
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:55,280
Start work again.

565
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,680
Eun Chan. You did wrong, right?

566
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,320
Start work again.

567
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,170
Hey! Go Eun Chan!

568
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:08,510
You did wrong, right? Start work again!

569
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,920
If you don't start, I'll kill you!

570
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:18,120
You! I'm talking about you!

571
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:21,700
If you don't come out, I'll kill you!
I'm Choi Han Kyul!

572
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,900
[Labor Boy]

573
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,120
What?

574
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:42,050
What do you mean "what"?
You called me first.

575
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,390
Now you're lying.
You're the one who called me!

576
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:49,250
I have a missed call with your number on my phone.

577
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:50,470
Check your outgoing calls.

578
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,040
If you're lying, you're dead!

579
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,750
It's from three days ago.

580
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,750
What? No way.

581
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,530
Wait a minute.

582
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,440
Do you have anything to say?

583
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,150
Sorry! Sorry!

584
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:09,870
Hello? Hey! Hey!

585
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,310
Hey! It's from three days ago!

586
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:14,090
I didn't say it wasn't.

587
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,090
You little...

588
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:34,670
Hey squirt!

589
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,350
Can you hear me?

590
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,140
Yeah.

591
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:41,930
I'm going to play you some music, so listen
carefully to the instruments in the song.

592
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,560
Okay!

593
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:43,650
Ready?

594
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,010
Yes.

595
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,010
Here we go.

596
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,730
Drum!

597
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:57,830
Drum!

598
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,420
How is it?

599
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,910
The weird thing is,
it feels like my heart's pounding.

600
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,490
So your heart pounds like this.

601
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,820
Wait a minute!

602
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,450
Do you hear me?

603
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,070
Concentrate on it.
Do you hear anything else?

604
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,500
This, this this! The keyboard.

605
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:33,080
Keyboard!

606
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:37,410
What do you think about the keyboard?

607
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,720
Isn't it a little annoying?
Like it's stingy?

608
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:43,310
Yeah! It seems like it's dead skinny.

609
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:46,000
It only eats vegetables and is sensitive.

610
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,570
And it eats oxygen.

611
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,120
Oh there's a new one!

612
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:56,970
Guitar!

613
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,970
Okay guitar!

614
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,160
I think whoever plays guitar must go deaf.

615
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:13,910
Why?

616
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:16,050
My ears really hurt!

617
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:21,920
Vocal!

618
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,160
Vocal!

619
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:38,210
You know what the most fascinating thing is?

620
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:42,030
I haven't listened to parts
separately before like this…

621
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:45,450
and I don't know how to explain this well…

622
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,300
but it feels like they're all living.

623
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:53,210
They thump,

624
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,750
tingle, flutter.

625
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:58,120
How wonderful.

626
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,590
The war has started.

627
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,290
Open the castle gates!

628
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,410
Attack!

629
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,480
Attack Han Kyul! Bite him!

630
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,840
Attack Go Eun Chan!

631
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,790
Manager! Manager!

632
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,680
You wanna die?!

633
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:03,940
It's already two in the morning.

634
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,270
Your mom must be worried.

635
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,900
I already told her I would be late,
so she's probably sleeping.

636
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,350
But, I'm sorry for stealing so much time
when you need to compose.

637
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,710
It's okay!

638
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:22,840
But... why don't you go back into the cafe?

639
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:25,470
You like being around coffee.

640
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,470
Want me to talk to Han Kyul?

641
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,060
He already knows your situation.

642
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,980
No.

643
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:36,450
Please don't talk about me to other people.

644
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:42,320
I've found that makes me feel really awful,
and miserable.

645
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,250
My dad passed away when
I was in junior high school.

646
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,090
My family got poor.

647
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:55,150
I wasn't good at studying.
I didn't have any talent.

648
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,870
Everyone knows already.

649
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,160
Still, don't tell anyone else.

650
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:07,230
You just know for yourself, okay?

651
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:10,910
Okay.

652
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,460
Seriously.

653
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,610
Did he throw me away?

654
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,310
Eun Chan hyung!
Just text me the three words, "I am okay"

655
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,960
If you don't,
I'm going to barge into your house.

656
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,960
Why these punks...

657
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:18,960
Manager.

658
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:20,290
What?

659
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,010
When is Go Eun Chan coming?

660
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:25,790
I need to test out my new menu,
so tell him to come out soon.

661
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,440
Bring it to me! I'll test it out!

662
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,080
What? Are you going to quit
if Eun Chan doesn't come back?

663
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,410
Just quit! Just quit already!

664
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:38,680
How pitiful...

665
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:51,360
Read it, and if you contact them,
they'll come to interview you.

666
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,360
Thanks.

667
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:57,870
I feel like I'm doing something great
with you even going out of your way.

668
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:02,960
Han Seong has a new girlfriend these days.

669
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:06,710
Who? The girl from the art gallery?

670
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:09,700
Hm, I don't see Eun Chan around.

671
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,530
Oh, I fired him yesterday.

672
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:16,650
He didn't do well with public
and private affairs.

673
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:19,470
And kept talking back, so I fired him...

674
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:24,570
It feels like I need him here,
but also like I don't.

675
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:28,530
You want to meet him,
you don't want to see him.

676
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:32,750
I understand what you mean.

677
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:37,570
But you don't need any unnecessary worries.

678
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:41,880
Doesn't your dilemma mean you need him?

679
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:45,980
But I fired him, how I can call him back?

680
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,500
When I was in New York,

681
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:52,850
I argued with a curator once.

682
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:56,630
I was so mad that I didn't want to see him again.

683
00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:01,790
But a month later,
the curator called me out of the blue.

684
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:07,630
And he randomly says this,
"Is four o'clock good, or is seven better?"

685
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:10,280
I said, "What's that?"

686
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,980
And he said, "A play."

687
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:18,640
So I said, "Seven o'clock."

688
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:31,080
Disgusting.

689
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:34,920
Hey! School ended a while ago!
Why are you back now?

690
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:38,570
Hey! Your older sister is talking to you!

691
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:40,110
Don't ignore me. Where did you go?

692
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:41,880
You went to the cybercafe again huh!

693
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,820
Aish! Seriously!

694
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:47,160
I told you so many times not to go there!

695
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:49,920
If you keep that up, your finger's
going to get stuck there!

696
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:54,280
Why isn't Mom coming?
How long does it take to get a perm?

697
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,160
And you call yourself a student.

698
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:57,600
Why are you taking it out!

699
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,120
Go wash! You're disgusting!

700
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:02,120
Crabby! Go do laundry!

701
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:03,440
I already did!

702
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:05,450
You're so loud!

703
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:10,800
It's such a beautiful day outside that
the laundry's drying up so nicely!

704
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:14,230
Why did you bring it in!
I was going to do it!

705
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,970
Why don't you go out to the cafe?!

706
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:21,780
My ears hurt so much because
of you staying at home.

707
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:23,780
So much complaining and scolding...

708
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,670
I didn't hear this much
from my mother-in-law.

709
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,450
It's not even all dried yet!

710
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:30,450
It is all dried!

711
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:32,330
What? You call this a perm?

712
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:33,990
What are you doing! Leave it alone.

713
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,990
It looks the same as before!

714
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:37,610
[Good-for-nothing]

715
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:39,610
Oh my head.

716
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:41,800
Hello?

717
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,970
Let's go eat!

718
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,080
What?

719
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:49,080
Jajangmyun or soup?

720
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:50,790
What?

721
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:53,730
Jajangmyun or soup?
Hurry up and say it.

722
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:55,890
Jajangmyun.

723
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:58,570
Come to the Chinese restaurant from before.

724
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:00,570
Hello?

725
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,480
You even order the special plate
of fried pork with vegetables?

726
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:37,490
One regular plate with just
fried pork goes by too quickly.

727
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,530
For a cafe latte,
you can't put whipped cream on top.

728
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:46,610
If you want whipped cream,
then you should just order the cafe Mocha.

729
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,970
It's 500 won more expensive.

730
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,990
Are you the manager? I'm fine with it.
What's wrong with you?

731
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:08,640
Why are you laughing?

732
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,850
I'm just amazed...

733
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:14,540
How many pork pieces are you
going to shove in your mouth?

734
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,260
Pig...

735
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:20,560
Why do you keep on laughing!

736
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,170
Then why are you laughing?

737
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:27,410
Because you are… so I am too.

738
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,870
Drink up. If you don't drink now,
when are you going to?

739
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,100
You want to carry me on your back already?

740
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,100
Oh right, then I will.

741
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,480
Oh my stomach.

742
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:11,480
Do you want some?
A little bit. It's good.

743
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:33,400
You fell in love with me!

744
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:35,800
When I shined underneath the bright lighting.

745
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,890
You fell in love with me!

746
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,890
In the midst of all the
hot excitement of a Saturday night.

747
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,900
Fell in love with me!

748
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:45,990
You fell in love with me!

749
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I... You fell in love with me!

750
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,200
Hey!

751
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:47,730
Hit me once.

752
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,730
Why?

753
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:53,450
Just hit me with all your strength.

754
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:58,720
I don't just hit people.
I need a good reason to.

755
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:02,390
Okay, okay. I understand.

756
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:07,660
I've never once looked down on you.

757
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:14,610
Delivering milk and food,
peeling chestnuts, sewing doll eyes…

758
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:19,230
When I said all those, it wasn't an insult.

759
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:23,910
It was because I really think
the way you live is impressive.

760
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:29,620
Even if I die and live again,
I don't think I could ever live that...

761
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:35,840
You're crying again because I talked...

762
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:38,100
Just hit me.

763
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:44,230
Okay! I don't have to hit you,
I'm not mad now.

764
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:49,250
No, if I don't take the hit from you,
I won't feel comfortable.

765
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:51,360
Hit me.

766
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:56,580
You can't say anything later!

767
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:58,580
Okay!

768
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:09,320
Are you okay?
I didn't use all of my strength...

769
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:17,820
Your nose is so weak.
I barely touched it and it bleeds.

770
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:26,240
I was too harsh when I said
I kept you because you were pitiful.

771
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:29,120
I'm sorry. I sincerely apologize.

772
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:33,980
Same here, I gave you a bloody nose.

773
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:37,440
You're so tiny
but knuckles are freaking hard.

774
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:40,400
Hey, you can be my bodyguard.

775
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:43,880
I'm already tired
of seeing your face at the cafe.

776
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:45,590
Really?

777
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,610
Really?

778
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:51,370
Yeah!

779
00:52:58,910 --> 00:52:59,910
It's this.

780
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,640
It's the same.

781
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,360
I'm sorry. Drink it well.

782
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:15,200
Two cups of American.

783
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,470
Strong or light?

784
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:17,090
Light.

785
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:17,990
Light.

786
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:21,140
I thought she said to give her a straw...

787
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:25,130
Strong as in powerful, not straw. Idiot.

788
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:28,860
Why don't they speak Korean, not English?

789
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:35,080
I can't even work
right because I want to see Chan.

790
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:37,970
Oh Chan~

791
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:39,670
Oh Hyung-nim!

792
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:40,620
Oh Chan!

793
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:42,810
Do you like me that much?

794
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:45,450
Chan! My Chan!

795
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:49,820
I wanted to feel you.

796
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:53,490
I asked you to send me three words.
Why did you ignore me so much?

797
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,440
You were a little stalker.

798
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,200
You're disgusting.

799
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:59,200
Thank you, good bye!

800
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,650
Go Eun Chan!
Go inside and wash the apples!

801
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:07,100
Yes!

802
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:09,920
Goodbye!

803
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,810
Move!

804
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:20,880
You go on your own.

805
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:22,700
The waffle's going to cool down.

806
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:24,830
Your priorities disappeared.

807
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:27,970
There are no priorities
when it comes to waffles!

808
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,190
Manager! You're so mean!

809
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:36,680
I've been watching you for awhile,
and you only bother Eun Chan.

810
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,600
I saw it all!

811
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:39,510
You secretly follow and watch him.

812
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:41,370
You bother him with stupid things
whenever you have the chance.

813
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,230
That's why Eun Chan keeps getting
annoyed and being cautious around you.

814
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:45,120
When did I do that?

815
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:48,520
Don't worry.  If you go out again,
we're all leaving with you.

816
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,090
Ah~ idiot...

817
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:57,640
Manager!
If you keep doing that I'm really leaving.

818
00:54:57,690 --> 00:54:59,640
I'm serious!

819
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:02,900
You idiot. That's not harassing,
that's playing around.

820
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:05,540
They're having a love war.

821
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,100
Manager.

822
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:15,040
I know a good fish cakes place.
Want to go with me?

823
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:17,490
I'll buy.

824
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:21,510
It's not working again.

825
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:24,880
It's broken so can you give me a ride?

826
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:28,060
Look look! The engine...

827
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:31,910
Even you're not helping.

828
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:36,640
Manager...a bowl of black noodles?

829
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:38,460
Manager! A bowl of fish cakes!

830
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:40,050
Later!

831
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,600
What's wrong with him?

832
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:50,760
His grandmother collapsed.

833
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:52,430
What?

834
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:05,460
You didn't answer your phone.

835
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:08,470
I was wondering how your grandmother was.

836
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:11,800
Come in.

837
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:33,870
Is your grandmother okay?

838
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:38,190
Last stage of stomach cancer.

839
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:42,260
And surgery?

840
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:46,770
Because she's old and the
cancer progressed too much.

841
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:50,840
It's too late for treatment.

842
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,490
It's hard, huh?

843
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:02,360
Me? No, it's harder for my grandmother.

844
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,400
I don't know what to think.

845
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:14,470
When my grandmother who always allowed
me to do everything I wanted,

846
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:18,240
suddenly called me out from the States,

847
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,670
made me go on all those blind
dates I didn't want to go on,

848
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:25,090
forced me to take over Coffee Prince.

849
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:27,790
I should have noticed it then.

850
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:36,050
If you want to cry, why don't you?

851
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:40,850
It's okay.

852
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:43,890
You don't look okay.

853
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:51,490
I hate myself.

854
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:55,250
I'm turning thirty soon.

855
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:58,450
And I've just been worrying my grandmother...

856
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:02,460
What did I do with my life?

857
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:08,960
I never thought my way of living was wrong.

858
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:17,530
Today, I found out I'm so selfish...

859
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:28,380
It's late. You should go.

860
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:35,100
Do you want me to make you feel better?

861
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:05,470
I think I would just like to be by his side.

862
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:09,330
Should I just reveal that I'm a girl?

863
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:13,070
Go Eun Chan, to save the person she love,
pretends to be a boy.

864
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:15,490
Do you only see me as that much?

865
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:22,170
Whenever I'm with you mister,
it feels like I'm getting Christmas gifts.

866
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,140
Have you ever kissed?

867
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:28,350
Lately, I look at Eun Chan
and I think about my past.

868
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:30,050
I like him.

869
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,050
Is it love?
