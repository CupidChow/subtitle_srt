1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:03,110
There is this ahjussi.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,990
Whenever I meet him,
I feel as if on cloud 9.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,790
Like a warm, cotton blanket.
The morning rays of the sun.

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,180
The other person – I kind of dislike him,
but he's still okay.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,920
He has a really prickly personality,
but not an entirely bad person nor a good person.

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,760
Like him. Not like him.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,310
There are more than a hundred-thousands
of reasons for liking her…

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,500
I just like her even if I try not to.
So hopelessly I just like her.

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,960
Hey, your shoulder…
that woman… bra…?

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,050
- You like Eun Sae?
- Yes.

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,000
Would you like to go with me to
a party for an art exhibition?

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,320
I look so ragged that if you went
with me you'd feel embarrassed.

13
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,000
How can people not
recognize such a pretty lady?

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,800
You're beautiful in my eyes.

15
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,380
Sixth Cup

16
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,420
Ahjussi, it's dark.

17
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,470
A ghost could pop out.

18
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:11,650
Boo!

19
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,370
Ah! Don't do that. Please don't.

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,570
Really.

21
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,380
What is that?

22
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,740
Mother-of-pearl inlays were
cut and individually pasted.

23
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,280
The inlays used on wardrobes?
Wow…

24
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,180
Right.

25
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,050
Wow.

26
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,210
Man, it's like the turbo shell.
No, like the back of a turtle's shell.

27
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,430
It's like… like the sea.

28
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,580
When I was small,
my family and I went for a trip to the beach.

29
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,660
That time I drowned in the water,
and swallowed so much water.

30
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:45,020
When my eyes opened, while I was gagging,
the sea was shiny like that.

31
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,060
Maybe call it mystery...

32
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,720
The artist would probably like that name.

33
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,290
Do you know the artist?

34
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,760
Most likely.

35
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,710
I thought there was something to eat.

36
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,350
Mister.

37
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,790
Mister, what is this called?

38
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,160
Oh, this looks like caviar.

39
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,110
Caviar?

40
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,000
Shark eggs.

41
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,510
I know that they're shark eggs.
Caviar…

42
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,530
How are you feeling?

43
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,710
Good?

44
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,860
Nervous.

45
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,680
Unni, you were really great.
Congratulations.

46
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,700
She is the artist.

47
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,540
Mister, the artist for that piece and
Han Yoo Ju are the same person?

48
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,790
Oh, you know?

49
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,580
Hello. Who is she?

50
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,150
She's cute.

51
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,270
A little friend.

52
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,080
What's going on?

53
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,200
Bringing the girlfriend here as well.

54
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,260
She wanted to see the exhibition.

55
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,810
Showing off the girlfriend and this and that.

56
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,640
Oh my, what guts.

57
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,920
Showing off the girlfriend to one's girlfriend?

58
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,910
I'm starting to feel funny.

59
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,310
What is it?

60
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,250
The restroom…

61
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,310
I'll be right here.

62
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,680
Cute, huh?

63
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,300
Cute.

64
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,340
Han Yoo Ju,
you're really something, huh?

65
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:31,130
To show this to you… I'm less nervous.
Aren't a snobby?

66
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,330
You're not.

67
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,740
Because of a girl friend who's got it going
for her, I'm also feeling elevated too.

68
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,850
She couldn't have possibly
recognized me, right?

69
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,060
Of all places, why Han Yoo Ju?

70
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,730
Ugh… so hot.

71
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,290
Thought I was going to drown in my sweat.

72
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,530
So hot. My hair…

73
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,010
How refreshing.

74
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,740
What did I do to my chest?

75
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,610
One day the flat plains.
One day the Everest's.

76
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,080
Did you hear that Han Yoo Ju is drawing
for Hyu Jin Group's building?

77
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,730
So lucky for someone who's recently
came back from New York.

78
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,180
Really lucky.

79
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,030
How much money will she be making?

80
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,030
Han Yoo Ju is Miss B?

81
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,640
Ugh, Miss B isn't supposed to appear.

82
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,750
Frustrating!

83
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:50,110
They really look good together.

84
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,270
He really didn't recognize me.

85
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,570
Two cousins over one woman.
Despicable people.

86
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,320
Really pathetic.

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,680
Choi Han Kyul.

88
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,100
Hey.

89
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,850
How can you leave your partner all alone?

90
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,190
It's really impolite.
Bring her over.

91
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,590
Yeah. Just a moment.

92
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,080
Don't come. Don't come.

93
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,610
No one will recognize you.
Don't worry.

94
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,390
What if they do recognize me?

95
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,000
What's going on?

96
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,870
His girlfriend… of two-months.

97
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,460
In terms of youthfulness,
she is above me.

98
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,710
Congratulations.

99
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,350
I knew you'd succeed but
still it's beyond expectations.

100
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,550
I'm telling you this on the sly,

101
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,320
I'm really happy right now.

102
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,040
You really worked hard for it.

103
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,240
You've the right to enjoy yourself today.

104
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,640
Look… it'll be fine.

105
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,650
Mister, just a minute.

106
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,910
Is it okay? Mister…

107
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,050
Mister. Mister.

108
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,200
How did you like it?

109
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,420
Did you enjoy it?

110
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,130
I was hoping the exhibition was enjoyable.

111
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,600
Awesome!

112
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,110
Really? Thank you.

113
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,100
To be honest, I was nervous.

114
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,740
Say hello.
This is Han Seong's girlfriend.

115
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,170
Hello.

116
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,190
Ma'am, a moment please.

117
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,340
Just a moment.

118
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,120
Okay.

119
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,080
You said you wouldn't be able to
come today. You look a little tanned.

120
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,270
I went somewhere with the employees.

121
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,250
Hyung, things between you and
Han Yoo Ju have worked out, right?

122
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,750
Yeah.

123
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,700
I'm not the watchdog for the two of you,
or a member of an arbitration committee,

124
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,190
but it seems like I keep
looking out for you two.

125
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,650
You guys have to work out.

126
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,560
I get headaches from the
bickering between the two of you.

127
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,990
I will.

128
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,960
Who asked you to do
headache-ing things anyways?

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,270
You're just digging your own grave.
Your own grave.

130
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,690
I need to have dinner with the collectors.
Come with me?

131
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,210
Sure.

132
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,290
I stamped my presence here,
so I guess I can go.

133
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,390
Thanks for coming. Call you later.

134
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,620
Brother.

135
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,810
Bye.

136
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,630
I should also get going too.

137
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,120
Hey, wait a minute.

138
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,930
I can take you home...

139
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,080
It's alright.
I can go back myself. Bye.

140
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,080
Hey...

141
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,080
What was I thinking to follow
him all the way here like this.

142
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,170
What's the matter?

143
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,100
Are you okay?

144
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,150
Did you twist your ankle?

145
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,060
No it isn't. It's fine.

146
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,750
My ankle is really strong.

147
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,510
Look. I've got tough bones.

148
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,670
I'm sorry. I didn't know
that Han Kyul would be coming too.

149
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,060
You were really surprised, right?

150
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,480
No. I'll be going.

151
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,380
Wait. You're mad. I'm sorry.

152
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,890
I wasn't supposed to allow
the two of you to meet.

153
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:45,040
No really. No need to be sorry.
I had fun and it was thrilling.

154
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:52,760
How can two people who've worked closely for
one month be like that. He's kind of slow, huh?

155
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,770
This won't do. I'll take you home.

156
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,080
That sister will be waiting for you.

157
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,430
That unni is Miss B, right?

158
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,980
Ah, I'm so hungry.

159
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,140
I should hurry and go eat.

160
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,250
I'll be going.

161
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,300
W-w-wait.

162
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,040
Take the taxi.

163
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,960
If you go like this on the bus,
they'll be all shocked. Here.

164
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,420
No. I'll call the taxi now. Wait.

165
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,440
I'm fine.
There's a lot of taxis down below.

166
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,830
This is so fun. I'll be riding the taxi.

167
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,730
Thanks for showing me the exhibition.

168
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,070
Bye.

169
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,120
Uh…yeah…

170
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,840
This is the left side.

171
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,280
My feet.

172
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:07,730
Mr. A.

173
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,860
Miss B.

174
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,500
There's no room for me.

175
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,050
Not even in my dreams.

176
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,750
Oh, that hurts…hurts…hurts.

177
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,580
Hey! End it with those geezers.

178
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,490
What are you, a self-respecting woman,
doing hanging out with those rich snobs.

179
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,080
Once in a while she gets it right.

180
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,100
A man and a woman should
share deep feelings with each other.

181
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:40,040
Does having a pretty face
help you earn a living?

182
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,510
Crazy fools...

183
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,070
Who in this world
can be prettier than you?

184
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,000
Mom, that's your take.

185
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,790
So what does that geezer think of you?

186
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,530
What do you mean "think"?

187
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,990
I'll admit that there are boundaries
between their world and my world.

188
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,960
I'll just totally devote myself
to earning a living.

189
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,250
These shoes are so pretty.

190
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,080
I'm going to return them.

191
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,300
Did I say anything?

192
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,650
Regardless, you're doing all the things
that can only be done in movies.

193
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:12,270
Why, a rich male gives to the poor female
expensive clothes, expensive shoes.

194
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:17,320
She gladly receives it, but like a good girl
worries about returning it.

195
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,940
You shouldn't have received it in the first place.
Returning something is a type of work too.

196
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,640
Who is it?

197
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,950
Jaesu Eob-seo

198
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,730
"Good-for-nothing"?

199
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:33,800
Am I your little minion? If you want to eat pizza,
just get it delivered. Why have it delivered to me?

200
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,800
Here, keep the change.

201
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,830
Why is everyone giving me money today?

202
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,250
No, thanks.

203
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,130
What's with you?

204
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,530
Nothing.

205
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,940
Mister, who do you think has it harder?

206
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:05,770
Someone giving up on a one-sided love, or
loving someone despite it being only one-sided.

207
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,750
Who do you think has it harder?

208
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,680
The both seem like it.

209
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,000
What now?

210
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,460
No point in just talking with you.

211
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,560
Coffee bean test!

212
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,090
What do you mean "test"?

213
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,840
I bet all you do is think how
to provoke me, right?

214
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,080
So you do know.

215
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:51,380
Alright. In return, if I figure it out, show me
the other room that you didn't show me last time.

216
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,340
You know security for a deal…

217
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,450
If you don't want to,
that's fine with me.

218
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,480
You don't want to, huh?

219
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,150
Deal.

220
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,030
It smells like chocolate and dirt.
It's mocha matari.

221
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,860
Hey, we're done.

222
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,130
Wait a minute.

223
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,150
I'm getting confused by the pizza smell.

224
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,340
It smells like wood.

225
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,550
I'll match it for you.

226
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,510
One, two, five.

227
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,520
OK. Again.

228
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,660
One. Five.

229
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,030
How can "five" come after "two"?

230
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,780
Wow.

231
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,980
What is all of this?

232
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,510
My toys.

233
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,950
Did you play like this while in the U.S?

234
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,610
When I play like this,
money can be earned.

235
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,380
I did this in the U.S.

236
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,720
Is that why you want to go back to the U.S.?

237
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,830
Wouldn't it be great to become the owner
of this small, peaceful village?

238
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,470
Here, everything goes the way that I want.

239
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,830
You already live however you want anyways.

240
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:43,390
Clay horseman, fight! Your crimes…

241
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,850
The enemy will appear at the wooden bridge.

242
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,290
Clang, clang, clang… Die.

243
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,830
Die. Die!

244
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:54,370
Attack at 12 o'clock. Dragon's head.

245
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,580
Sweep them through the forked path.

246
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,490
- All destroyed.
- Hey, that doesn't match the era. Take it out.

247
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,820
Dragon fly…

248
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,010
You good for nothing dragon heads.

249
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,470
Bite him.

250
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,780
Good job.

251
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,450
What are you looking at?

252
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,380
Nothing.

253
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,520
Where did you go today?

254
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,110
Han Yoo Ju's opening exhibition.

255
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,890
How was it?

256
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,430
Did you like it?

257
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,310
Just this and that.

258
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,010
Why not raise the white flag and surrender?

259
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,810
Mister, you're squat to Han Yoo Ju.

260
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,570
Don't just go around saying Han Yoo Ju.

261
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:48,800
Is Han Yoo Ju your friend?

262
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,270
And why am I not even squat?

263
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,890
I bet, in front of her,
you can't even easily shout.

264
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,540
Pathetic.

265
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,470
This guy…

266
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,780
You're right.

267
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:10,750
I'm going to give up pathetically
liking someone else's girl.

268
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,650
You made the right choice.

269
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:18,560
Just flower the road as you
quietly tread on out.

270
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,230
Goodbye, our unrequited loves.

271
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,710
"Our unrequited loves"?

272
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,200
Don't ask about one's personal life.

273
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:36,110
Do you think it's easy to
end an unrequited love?

274
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,320
You need the other person's help.

275
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,110
For that reason,
Han Yoo Ju is doing really well.

276
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:51,300
Besides giving hope, there is nothing else.

277
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:58,000
Tonight,
I really hated the idea of eating dinner alone.

278
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,680
But on a day like this,
why of all people did I think of you?

279
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:09,780
Hey, you… sleeping?

280
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,910
Hot. Why is it so hot today?!

281
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,670
Hey. Hey, hey.

282
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,150
Hey. Hey. Hey.

283
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:08,700
Hey. Go home and sleep.

284
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:09,810
What?

285
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,110
Go home and sleep.

286
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,510
What would you like?

287
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,370
Wow. Oppa, please look over here once.

288
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,380
Please taste this.

289
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,260
What would you like?

290
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,210
- Ice coffee.
- I want ice coffee too.

291
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,950
Here you go.

292
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,300
For sure, he's got killer looks.

293
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,870
Be the main star.

294
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:45,830
Mr. Boss, you got it going too.
Getting a host feel.

295
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,290
Everyone looks so photogenic on camera.

296
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,760
I'm melting. Melting.

297
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,850
Angel, what brings you here?

298
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,750
What gorilla is this?

299
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,260
Wait, Angel.

300
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,770
Don't you feel great that
the exhibition was a success?

301
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:10,290
I thought I would feel that way,
but it turns out I don't.

302
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:14,410
Seeing the paintings that are sold,
I feel longing and sadness.

303
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,070
Does this mean I'm beyond content?

304
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,120
Would sponsor, DK,
like to hear something like that?

305
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,120
DK?

306
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:25,070
Ah, that person from 100 years ago.

307
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,950
Where did you get the idea of putting
chili bean paste in spaghetti?

308
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,140
Maybe from that kiddo girlfriend?

309
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:34,200
No. I saw it from a cooking program.

310
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,850
Oh, yeah. It was like the ocean.

311
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,350
That kiddo thought your
work was like the ocean.

312
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,980
She talks really cute.

313
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,820
First time seeing those yellow gloves.

314
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:47,700
Oh, these?

315
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,400
I got them as gifts.

316
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,110
The inside is cotton so it's really soft.
It's really nice.

317
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,040
Moment's like this is when I think
that I'm too independent.

318
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:00,580
If this is what marriage is like,
then I think I'd like it too.

319
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,790
Then I say, "Right, this isn't all of it."
Then I re-think about it.

320
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,360
Yeah, this is a good thing.

321
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,330
Then pay for the meal.

322
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,110
Are you full?

323
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,680
Hey, I think it's better over there
than here. Put it over there.

324
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,660
Last time it was over there.

325
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,950
Just go put it back over there.
Position it differently.

326
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,810
Differently.

327
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,140
Here?

328
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:40,230
Okay?

329
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,040
Wait, no. People pass through here.
This would be inconvenient.

330
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,650
Bring it here again.

331
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:44,900
Here.

332
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,160
There.

333
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,560
Wait.
Unlike before, 3 cm to the right. 3 cm.

334
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,600
Okay. Okay.
A little more. Stop, stop!

335
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,650
There, there.

336
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,710
The flower's the other way.

337
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,030
Turn it around so that it can be seen.

338
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,430
Okay, okay.

339
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,460
Done. Done. Okay. Okay.

340
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,620
Okay.
Just put it on the terrace. It's no good.

341
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,120
Why didn't you say so earlier?

342
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,330
To the terrace.

343
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:12,120
Hey, you'll damage the pot.
How can you just drag it?

344
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,960
Are you bored?

345
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,840
Why are you playing around with a kid?

346
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,500
His expressions are so funny.

347
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,650
He lacks decisiveness.
Decisiveness.

348
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,680
This way and that way!

349
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,620
Just tell me to do it. A man should carry it.
How can a woman carry it?

350
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,050
Advertise it why don't you?
Advertise it.

351
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,520
Where to?

352
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,840
- Put it on the terrace.
- Okay.

353
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,440
That airhead makes me crazy. Crazy.

354
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,500
I was planning to wash my hair.

355
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,860
Enjoy.

356
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,360
No..!

357
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,090
Are you alright?

358
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,100
I'm fine.

359
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,360
Really, he…

360
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,850
Hey, your head…

361
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,610
I feel like I'm hurting.

362
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,560
Go Eun Chan.

363
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:26,870
I went outside to meet you,
but I didn't see you for a couple of days.

364
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,230
I came to see if
you were trying to avoid me.

365
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,990
My departure time is now earlier.

366
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,570
I have to deliver milk early
in the morning now.

367
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,770
Oh, I see.

368
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:48,970
It must be hard.
Milk deliveries and working at the shop.

369
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:54,800
That's why, after this week,
I'm planning to quit with the milk delivery.

370
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,660
I'm gonna miss it.

371
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,660
I think I'll miss Ssulja a lot.

372
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:07,850
And me?

373
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,010
I can always call to see you.

374
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,410
Maybe not?

375
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,410
Will she not like us meeting like that?

376
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:24,650
You were really disappointed on
the day of the exhibition, right?

377
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,950
It wasn't my intention to
send you off like that.

378
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:31,000
You keep making me think about you.

379
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,620
I'm sorry.

380
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:36,460
No.

381
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,460
You even gave me cab fare.

382
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:45,520
No, really.
I was the one who was short-sighted.

383
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:51,140
Forgot your clothes and
shoes in the car last time.

384
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:55,950
It must have been shocking to meet
Han Kyul out of the blue like that.

385
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,050
I'm really sorry.

386
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:03,230
That's not it.

387
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:07,360
Mister, you're such a great person.

388
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,500
To like you.

389
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,560
I didn't know myself…

390
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,220
I found myself really liking you.

391
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,500
It was painful going home.

392
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,030
But now I'm fine.

393
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:41,950
She is beautiful and cool.

394
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:47,400
So, I'll give in.

395
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,350
I hope the two of you will be happy.

396
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,000
I'm totally fine now.

397
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,930
- Here you go. Please come again.
- Bye.

398
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,650
Where is Go Eun Chan?

399
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:41,290
Is he up to something foolish again?

400
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,350
What?

401
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:49,250
If you like him,
just say that you do.

402
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,370
Don't hassle him.

403
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:56,400
Who's hassling who?

404
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,040
Is this over-flowing?

405
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,800
Is Eun Chan working this afternoon?

406
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,680
Yeah.

407
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,430
But, mom, are you going somewhere?

408
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,990
Yeah, I'm off to see a friend.

409
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,320
Come straight home after
your singing academy ends.

410
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,460
No hanging around at the karaoke.

411
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,730
What's the difference? Practicing at the academy
or practicing at the karaoke.

412
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,150
I got it. Got it.

413
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:27,120
I'll go first. Take care.

414
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,710
Dumb Hwang

415
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,520
Ugh, this creepy guy.

416
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,990
Don't bother me. What is it now?

417
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,670
You're for sure, right?
You will come out today.

418
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,750
- What?
- I even got waffles for you…

419
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,560
Waffle Sun Ki? What is that?

420
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,370
Just a minute.

421
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,390
Oh, right. We have waffles. Why?

422
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,840
Please be quieter.
I'm in the middle of a call.

423
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,210
Prince?

424
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,490
- If you don't come today too, I'll come get
you from school.   - Prince? What prince?

425
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,790
There are a lot of guys here.
Just do that.

426
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,940
- Hello? Hello?
- Come.

427
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,650
That girl… got even a lot of waffles.

428
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,840
Noo-nim, let's go.

429
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:14,050
It's been a while since coming
to the movie theaters.

430
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,070
For me it seems to have
been almost 15 years.

431
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,780
Really.

432
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,100
In the past, I would come with the kids.
These days they are so busy.

433
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:29,670
I could tell that you wanted to go see
a movie these days. You know I got sense.

434
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,650
Sense or whatever,
just take off that butterfly necktie.

435
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:38,000
This tie represents the
butterfly from my heart.

436
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:43,470
As the green grapes slowly ripen during this month
of July, before the seasons over, with you…

437
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,920
Ah gees, just stop with the yapping.

438
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,980
Noo-nim, c-c-careful.

439
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,040
What happened?
How comes he's not coming?

440
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,600
Stop asking!
It's not like we've been waiting that long.

441
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,890
One hour has already gone by.

442
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:58,430
Hey, I'm just leaving. This isn't a joke.
Me, too. I want to go.

443
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,510
Just wait a little bit more.
I promise to buy something tasty.

444
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,400
Sorry. See you later.

445
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,490
Can this guy even get it?

446
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:17,420
- Hello.
- Hey! What kind of joke are you playing?

447
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,070
The time of F4 has passed…

448
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:29,160
Two managers and princes are coming.

449
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,850
Desirable Guy Han Kyul

450
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,240
Drool. Drool. X 5000

451
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,150
Prince's most cherished manager!

452
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:39,500
Eun Chan.

453
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,430
Waffle Sun Ki

454
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,320
Sya-bang shines X 1000

455
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:51,440
Your face is too beautiful
for making waffles

456
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,910
Sya-bang Sya-bang

457
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,520
Public Nuisance Min Yeop

458
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,800
Bubble~~

459
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,960
You're just an animal~

460
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:03,390
Over confident-and-proud Ha Rim

461
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,590
Try being a little more modest~

462
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:09,010
Over confident-and-proud

463
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:11,370
Don't-bother-me Hong

464
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,090
Is life really that bothersome?

465
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,100
Still you're cool for playing the guitar ^^

466
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,760
Coffee Prince ~~ Would you like
to taste the coffee they brew?

467
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,650
Let's go to Coffee Prince 1st Shop!

468
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,300
Oh, Jesus! Jesus!

469
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:51,410
It was like war.

470
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:54,380
The content is no joke.

471
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:57,460
Brother, don't you owe us one?

472
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,020
That was all just a fad.

473
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:03,500
We really need to make this
into a "regular" spot for locals.

474
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,750
She's not picking up again.

475
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,140
To not meet me because
I didn't keep my promise…

476
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:13,230
You couldn't go out because of work.
My sister isn't that unsympathetic.

477
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:16,930
I would like a break on Wednesday.

478
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,390
Hey, at least change the water or something.

479
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:24,250
"Break..."?* You can only do?

480
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:28,570
Keep quiet so that we can go when it's slow.

481
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,260
No pay during the time
you're gone in the evening.

482
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,250
Okay.

483
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,080
Let's all clean up and go home.

484
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,380
Yes.

485
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:39,860
Why the sigh?

486
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,130
If it's not Yoo Ju noona,
then it's family matters.

487
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,400
There is something nagging me.

488
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:49,260
What is it?

489
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,020
Don't bother me. Just work.

490
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:58,190
Time really flew by today.

491
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,820
Thank you for today.

492
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,930
For someone so miserly to treat me
with a movie and dinner.

493
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,000
You really spent the big bucks today.

494
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,050
Noo-nim.

495
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,430
That is, miss.

496
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,990
I mean, Ms. Ji Yang.

497
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,490
Let's see each other.

498
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:19,980
No use saying that now. Go home.

499
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:27,980
Fluttering ~ I envy the two nightingales
in love, but this body…

500
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,680
Here you go again.

501
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:32,430
If you can consider that
poem as a reflection of my heart.

502
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:37,250
Then, good evening, miss.

503
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,650
Oh, how embarrassing.

504
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,870
Hey, how are you doing?

505
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:51,580
I heard that Min Ho hyung just
opened a psychiatric service.

506
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,610
Oh, it's just that there's someone
who wants some counseling service…

507
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,160
Can those be saved?

508
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,400
I came out really good.

509
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:11,530
Here, the manager comes out better.

510
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,720
I'm so tired. So tired.

511
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,030
Are you okay?

512
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,810
Yes. I'm fine.

513
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,600
Are you hurt anywhere?

514
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,140
I'm sorry.

515
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:51,380
Hey! Go Eun Chan!

516
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:58,090
Hey, why don't you pay attention?

517
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,470
What's wrong?

518
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:02,960
It's true I dozed a little,
but that car came rushing out.

519
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,780
"It's true I dozed a little"?
Where you asking for a death wish?

520
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,970
When you ride, you have to pay attention!

521
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,960
If you're going to ride like that,
then don't ever ride again!

522
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,460
Hello, this is the insurance company?
Yes, I would like to report…

523
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,950
- I'm sorry.
- Just a moment.

524
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:19,900
My employee can't drive good.
If there is a problem, please call here.

525
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,500
My apologies.

526
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,870
What's with him?

527
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,250
Enjoy.

528
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,270
He probably said that out of concern.

529
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:35,220
Regardless, he took care of the accident.

530
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,740
It's because you were there. I thought
he was going to eat someone alive.

531
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,050
Business is going good.
Why is he like that?

532
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:45,750
Mister.

533
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,140
Are you busy? I'm done over here.

534
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:50,640
You ended earlier than expected.

535
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,320
Yoo Ju, I was in a middle of a call.
Sorry. Just a minute.

536
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,910
Yeah. So you weren't hurt anywhere?

537
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:01,900
Except for a scrape on my arm, I'm fine.

538
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,700
I have fast reflexes, you know.

539
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,500
The instant I was falling
I turned my body right away.

540
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:09,200
That's good to hear.

541
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,310
Are you still at the shop?

542
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,860
Because of that UCC, it's all crazy.

543
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,660
The shop is so noisy.

544
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,510
Hey! Go Eun Chan!

545
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,960
Prickly manager is calling.

546
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,420
Mister are the two of you really cousins?

547
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:30,710
You guys are total opposites.

548
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,660
Mister, gotta go…

549
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,570
Alright, let's talk later. Bye.

550
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,760
Oh, sorry.
It was a long hold, wasn't it?

551
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,120
I can go pick you up now.

552
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,940
You're already in a taxi?

553
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:48,310
Why? You could've have waited.

554
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,350
Oh.

555
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:53,560
Okay, I'll call you when I get back.

556
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,240
I heard that it has been more than three years
since the two of you separated.

557
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:01,670
I, too, haven't seen her
for more than one year.

558
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,740
You really have no idea where she went?

559
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,130
I really don't know.

560
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:10,410
How unfortunate. From Japan to here.

561
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:19,100
Should you get in contact with her…
I ask of you…

562
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,590
Darn mosquitoes.

563
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,510
Mister, please turn on the lights.

564
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,690
Mister please turn on the lights.
The lights...

565
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,480
The lights. Lights.

566
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:55,360
What? He selfishly…

567
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,430
How can you just use the
mosquito tent all to yourself?

568
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,020
Go to sleep.

569
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,790
If I die, at least I need to show the cause.

570
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,050
To show the world that I died of suffocation
inside of this disgusting place.

571
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,980
What an unbelievable place.

572
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,870
Hey, Sun Ki, you wake up too!

573
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:12,320
How can you sleep in a place like this?

574
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,030
I lose. I lose.

575
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:28,130
Hey, it's great that business is going well.
But why don't we even get a minute to eat.

576
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,150
You know, Mister.
why aren't you helping me with Eun Sae?

577
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,580
You promised to help me.

578
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:40,150
Hey, she's busy too. Extra classes,
singing academy. You need to understand.

579
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,660
Fine, I promise to make her call you.
I promise.

580
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,480
For real? For real!

581
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,940
Man, did you live all your life
being deceived. Believe me.

582
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:53,510
Before we get caught by the sharp-eyed manager,
let's hurry up and eat.

583
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,420
In a good mood one minute and
a bad mood the next?

584
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:00,850
If wasn't the manager, why I would…

585
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,700
You know our manager to you...

586
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,120
Hey!

587
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:07,810
I meant he keeps looking at you, hyung-nim.
From wherever.

588
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:10,070
After you go to the bathroom,
he stares at you.

589
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,980
You think I'm caught?

590
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:13,960
I think he's checking you.

591
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:15,150
Why would he?

592
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,650
To see if you do your work or not.

593
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:19,060
That evil manager.

594
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:25,000
My Chan, where are you going?

595
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,420
What brings you here?

596
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:29,390
You said you were tired and left early.

597
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,350
I came outside to live.

598
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:38,350
No matter what, I think I'm going to catch
a disease from that house and die.

599
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:45,020
Have some kimbap. Kimbap.

600
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,970
I want to live long.

601
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,450
Mother, are you alright?

602
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,800
Instead of being like that, go to the hospital.

603
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,180
I'm fine.
I'll just take some medicine for indigestion.

604
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,700
At your ages,
how can you get so easily shaken?

605
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:09,490
I've lost my appetite now.

606
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,940
Mother, eat a little bit more.

607
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:14,330
Bring me some tea.

608
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:15,940
Yes.

609
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:42,580
Even envelopes were made.

610
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:45,570
Hwang Min Yeop-nim.

611
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:51,110
Already it has been one month. And I'm really glad
to be able to give you your paychecks.

612
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:53,660
For one month you all worked hard.

613
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:59,950
I'm giving these to you in the morning
so that you get work today in a good mood.

614
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,680
What's with the polite speech?

615
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,180
This is why I can't not like you.

616
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:07,640
Thank you, manager. I will work hard.

617
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:10,220
Next time, please make it a direct deposit.

618
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,000
Why is there so much?
Did you include yourself?

619
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:15,590
Myself, I included less than you.
So don't worry.

620
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:18,170
That's all.

621
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:29,800
He couldn't take care of himself because of
his duty as manager to look out for his employees.

622
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:39,730
Look where you are going.

623
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:41,640
What's with the two of them?

624
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,970
I can't stand looking at how awkward
they are to each other.

625
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,530
It must be good to be young.

626
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:46,680
Pardon.

627
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:49,180
Amusement between man and woman.

628
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,720
Manager, where are you going?

629
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:55,840
Why would you need to know?
After taking care of things, take off.

630
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:59,210
Back and forth - being nice then mean.

631
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,820
If I ask "where you're going?"
Would it hurt to answer?

632
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,340
What makes you want to see a movie with me?
What about him?

633
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:14,500
Sometimes it seems a
friend is better than a boyfriend.

634
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,720
What is it that makes you hesitant to talk?

635
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,200
I want to give you a big hug just once.

636
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:03,390
I'm relieved.

637
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:05,380
Thank you, Han Yoo Ju.

638
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:09,120
I won't have to go to a mental ward after all.

639
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,840
I appreciate it too.

640
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,790
What are you thankful for?

641
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,700
Just everything.

642
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,290
You're suffocating me.

643
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,310
You feel really good.

644
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:05,440
Let's go.

645
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:07,470
Good. Wow. Wow.

646
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:14,450
- Run. Run.
- Jump.

647
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:16,840
Roll. Roll.

648
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,750
Wow. Terrific.

649
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:22,110
- Roll.
- This way.

650
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,100
Here I go.

651
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,060
How's business?

652
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:37,110
Yes, it's going good.

653
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:41,050
Han Kyul still doesn't know
the truth about you?

654
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:44,240
Why? Planning to make him scorn me?

655
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:45,780
Based on what I see…

656
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:53,430
You know, he was like that in he past,
tbut these days he's really weird now.

657
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:57,200
I don't like seeing him at all.
It's like he got a double personality.

658
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,840
Could it be that Mr. X likes Miss Y?
Why would he just provoke her?

659
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:06,530
That's not it. Mr. X has a really pretty woman.

660
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:10,950
Then how does Miss Y like Mr. X?

661
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:15,060
Professionally?

662
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:16,960
Just professionally?

663
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:18,730
Yes.

664
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:24,830
Because Miss Y has fallen in love
with another handsome man.

665
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:31,220
Ahjussi, do you know how fun it is
to make coffee?

666
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:37,680
What beans to use. How to roast.
What water temperature.

667
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:41,290
In any case, it makes the tastes all different.

668
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:45,600
The coffee world seems really infinite.

669
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:50,530
Then shall we have a cup of that
infinite coffee world at my place?

670
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:52,570
Okay-buddy.

671
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:58,110
Terry.

672
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:07,420
Since you're drenched,
take a shower. I'll go outside.

673
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,570
Still, I cannot shower
at someone else's house.

674
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:13,860
So what. Go ahead and shower.
The shower is over there.

675
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,610
Oh, wait.
The bathroom door in the house is broken.

676
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:20,910
The door doesn't lock.

677
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:22,180
Pardon?

678
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,860
Just kidding. The door locks perfectly fine.
Go ahead and shower.

679
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:27,360
Let me know when you're done.

680
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,100
Terry.

681
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:45,130
Where's daddy? Where's daddy?

682
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:47,440
Let's go. Let's go. Go.

683
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:49,310
Where?

684
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,040
Good.

685
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:57,660
What are you doing there?

686
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,140
Why are you here without giving a call?

687
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:02,640
I brought morning breakfast.

688
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,380
I'm hungry from the walk.

689
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:05,700
Let's go inside.

690
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:06,520
Okay.

691
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:07,900
Hey, Yoo Ju, wait.

692
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:12,880
Mister, something to change in.
You can give me anything…

693
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:31,490
She's the milk deliverer. Saw her a couple times
since we live in the same neighborhood.

694
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:35,900
You don't know how surprised I was when I saw her
at the opening of Han Kyul's cafe.

695
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,170
She's a fun kiddo, huh?

696
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,720
You feel sorry for the deception, right?

697
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,810
Yeah.

698
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,920
Why didn't your wear the clothes I gave you?

699
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:56,140
It's alright. It'd be more comfortable
to wear my clothes anyways.

700
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:00,100
I'll be going now.

701
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:03,150
How can you just leave like that?

702
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:05,620
It'll be fast if I ride my bike.

703
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,370
That's right. Your clothes are too wet.

704
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:13,870
Han Seong, aren't the clothes I left
behind last time still somewhere here?

705
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:16,240
No, really. I can just go like this.

706
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,650
If you go like this, you'll catch a cold.

707
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,530
You don't know where it is?

708
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:20,710
Huh?

709
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:24,050
Is it in the closet?

710
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,490
Wait.

711
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:28,940
Why so flustered?
Something getting at you?

712
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,800
Really, I'm fine going like this.

713
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,490
Don't be like that. Have a seat.

714
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,700
Have a seat.

715
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,140
How could you be able
to completely deceive?

716
00:51:54,850 --> 00:52:02,270
Is it really true that the employee I saw
last time at Han Kyul's coffee shop...

717
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:05,270
and the person in front of me
are the same person?

718
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,010
I have so many questions to ask…

719
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:16,780
Now that I think about it,

720
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:21,380
when you told me about the crush on the high school
teacher, I should've figured it out then.

721
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:27,190
I'm sorry. There were reasons…

722
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:35,860
I really have my reasons. Please keep my gender
from the manager, I request of you.

723
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:40,680
May I ask what those reasons are?

724
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:42,790
It's a little complicated.

725
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:46,430
Different issues are all tangled into each other.

726
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:51,830
If he finds out that I'm female,
then I'll get fired from work.

727
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:54,680
Han Kyul isn't that heartless.

728
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:59,460
He'll know one day.
I'll tell him myself.

729
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:00,900
Later.

730
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:09,820
How can you pass off for a guy like that?
Wasn't it hard?

731
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:13,210
Here.

732
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:25,830
It's not that I try to pretend…
Well, you can tell by the way I look.

733
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,930
When I was in school, I would hear
female students call me "oppa" many times.

734
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:39,880
To be honest, there were times I had to act too
because I feared being discovered.

735
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,180
Act?

736
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:45,400
Closed my eyes, and said, "Whatever"
Well, if you want to do it right, go all the way.

737
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:50,680
Couple times I went to the
men's restroom and stood.

738
00:53:54,300 --> 00:54:01,140
By the way, is it okay for me to call you "sister"?

739
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:06,110
For sure better to hear that then "older sister".

740
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,720
I'll return the clothes next time.

741
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:22,420
Mister, sister, thank you for the coffee.

742
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:25,060
Take the clothes are presents.
And let's see each other again.

743
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:26,600
Thank you.

744
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:28,530
Wait.

745
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:34,510
Careful.

746
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,910
Goodbye.

747
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:44,530
Don't worry.
She'll keep your secret.

748
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:46,640
She promised never to tell.

749
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:50,820
Miss B seems rather cool.
Mister, you're really lucky.

750
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:56,110
Bye.

751
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:58,990
Take care. I'll call you.

752
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,080
You're smiling a lot today.

753
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,120
What do you mean?

754
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,380
You like that friend, huh?

755
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,910
What are you talking about?

756
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,880
Oh, you're avoiding my eyes.

757
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:25,200
When did I ever?

758
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:26,450
You're really awkward…

759
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,610
What do you mean "awkward"?

760
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,400
Awkward and shaking.

761
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:30,520
It's so hot.

762
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:33,160
Why are you hot?
You're perfectly fine. Why are you hot?

763
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,820
You want an ice cream?

764
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:39,450
Load the coffee beans onto the car.

765
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,740
Now?

766
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,610
I'm going to do some
deliveries before departing.

767
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:43,670
Yes.

768
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:45,090
- Yes.
- Yes.

769
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:46,340
Did the 2nd floor lights get replaced?

770
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,520
Yes.

771
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:48,570
Yes.

772
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:49,640
The weeds?

773
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,610
They were totally taken care of.

774
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:52,840
The terrace railing?

775
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,220
Yes.

776
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:03,090
Put on antibacterial ointment.

777
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,470
Yes.

778
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:06,000
Pardon?

779
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,800
There's antibacterial ointment
in the counter's second drawer.

780
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,850
Yes.

781
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:18,770
Hey, don't just mop areas that can be seen.
Mop the crooks and crevices too.

782
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,340
Clean the restrooms.

783
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:24,210
When you come in tomorrow morning,
clean the parasol with water. It's full of dust.

784
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,550
And the flower pots - carefully water…

785
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,650
What? You don't want to do it?

786
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:33,900
No. But because of you
I don't want to do it.

787
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:38,450
Why are you like this to me these days?
If something's bothering you, then tell me.

788
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:45,360
Don't do that.

789
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:47,900
Even picking on my personal habits?!

790
00:57:14,990 --> 00:57:17,860
Did I say something wrong? I just...

791
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:23,720
I just… I just wanted to do well…

792
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:30,050
What's going on? Did he figure out I'm female?
What should I do? Run?

793
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,330
Ah, the coffee beans.
Totally forgot to load the coffee beans.

794
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:36,650
Go Eun Chan.

795
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:38,440
Yes.

796
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:41,310
Let's hug once.

797
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:46,690
I can't focus because of you.

798
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:50,740
Let me hug you just once.
Then I think I'll be fine.

799
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:58,610
Is someone going to eat you alive?
Why are you backing away?

800
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:02,080
I just need to hug for a moment.
So stay still.

801
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:05,320
Did you eat something wrong?
So gross.

802
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,100
Man, being so difficult.

803
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:09,310
You did all sorts of things
during the blind dates.

804
00:58:58,850 --> 00:59:03,300
[He shouldn't have held me…]

805
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:09,950
[Because it made me want to tell him I'm a girl…]

806
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,800
Does this ahjussi feel something for me?

807
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:18,770
When are you coming?

808
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,130
This could be at least 1,000.

809
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:23,070
Manager! How come with Go Eun Chan…

810
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:25,880
The manager doesn't know that you're a woman.

811
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:30,940
So, when you see a man you feel fluttery…

812
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,450
Guitar.

813
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:37,160
I felt bad for you so I kept you…

814
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,300
I really hate you.

815
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:41,000
Then it would be better if I just left.
