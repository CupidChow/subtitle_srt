1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,440
My bank account balance is $420.

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,130
Salary from the Taekwondo Hall is $800.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,910
Sticking eyes on the dolls gives $200.
Delivering milk gives $300.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,220
It is still missing $8,000!

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,640
The ring is missing!

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,790
Of course. I want to see you soon...

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,680
but I'm really too dirty right now.

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,200
You rascal, how dare you use your
flirting strategies on me!

9
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,290
Get married immediately!

10
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,080
Starting from today,
Choi Han Kyul is mine!

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,810
Get out!

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,010
Is mine so scary?
He stared at it for such a long time..

13
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,610
Today I'm really jinxed. Jinxed!

14
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,980
Oppa, there's this guy like a hoodlum who is
bullying me all the time.

15
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,540
You, thief! How dare you steal!

16
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,230
I wanted to pay for Eun Sae's registration
fees for the vocal lessons. So what?

17
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,670
Scum like you must be put in jail.
Follow me.

18
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,860
When I release my hands,
you push me away then you run.

19
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,770
It's Ssulja's father.

20
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,100
You're Ssulja's father, right?

21
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,140
I missed you.

22
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,100
Originally,
I didn't want to ask for compensation…

23
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,500
Because of that incident,
my part-time job was taken away.

24
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,270
I didn't even get paid before
they kicked me out.

25
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,060
Do your parents know about
you begging like this?

26
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,380
Oppa, you're a gay?

27
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,300
Are you a boy or a girl?
You look so much like a girl!

28
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,360
Hey! Do you want to be my lover?

29
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,000
L… lover?

30
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,310
Whose lover? Yours?

31
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,040
Wait! Your jaw line on both sides
is quite sharp.

32
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,640
And the bridge of your nose
is not bad either.

33
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,070
What are you doing? Really!

34
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,260
I'm just touching your face, it's not
going to be grinded off just by that.

35
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,490
This mister, you're really gay?

36
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,500
I don't care if you're gay or not.

37
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,180
You'd better apologize
for insulting my parents.

38
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,940
And give me the repair money
for my scooter now.

39
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,590
Have a talk with me.

40
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,700
Let go. Where are you…
You're not letting go?

41
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,060
Contract for Employment

42
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,510
What are you doing now?

43
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,010
Didn't you ask for money?
I'm giving you money. What's wrong?

44
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,540
If you're giving me money, you should
open up  your wallet. Why notebook?

45
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,180
And before you do anything else,
you must apologize for insulting my parents.

46
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,000
What you looking at?
Apologize!

47
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,630
Fine. I apologize. Ok?

48
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,080
Look into my eyes, say it formally and
apologize to me wholeheartedly.

49
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,340
To mention your parents was an
oversight on my part, I'm sorry. That'll do?

50
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,690
Take away the "that'll do?"
and apologize again.

51
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,230
To mention your parents was
an oversight on my part, I'm sorry.

52
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,640
Give me money for the scooter repairs.

53
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,750
Name?

54
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,710
How much can you give me?

55
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,210
Name!

56
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,210
Go Eun Chan.

57
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,160
ID number?

58
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,070
840805-2371291…

59
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,300
Hey! Say it properly.
Properly!

60
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,610
It's 13, right? For male.

61
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,780
Can't you tell whether you're a boy or a girl?

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,450
What else?

63
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:37,940
What's after 13?

64
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,470
1371291.

65
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,570
But I really don't understand.

66
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,690
Why do you have to take down these details?
Just give me the money.

67
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,140
I can tell you really need the
money so I'm getting you a job.

68
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,760
But I can't trust you

69
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,470
so I need to check out your identity first.
Why?

70
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,500
What job is it?

71
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,200
Fake lover.

72
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,280
Whose fake lover?

73
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,260
Mine.

74
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,270
Oh this mister…
He looks so good yet…

75
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,480
You already have a lover, right?
The one I helped to retrieve the bag for…

76
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:11,430
"Because you got hurt!"
Isn't she the one?

77
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,690
She's not someone you
can mention so casually.

78
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,580
Why would I bother to mention her anyway?

79
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,250
You just have to appear at the place
where I have my matchmaking session.

80
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,540
Just pretend to be my lover, that'll do.

81
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,340
That means just disrupt the matchmaking
session and collect the money, that'll do.

82
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,770
You want to do it or not?

83
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,120
As long as you pay me, I guess
it's not anything too difficult.

84
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,360
Identity card.

85
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,390
Where… Where did it go?

86
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,260
Oh yes! That's right.
I left it at home.

87
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,480
But what do you need the identity card for?

88
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,700
How can I trust a hoodlum like you?

89
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,740
Aren't you an accomplice of the thief?

90
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,180
Oh you!

91
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,720
I'm not a hoodlum nor a thief…
I'm really innocent.

92
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,640
Really... Ahjussi's really…

93
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,600
You…

94
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,810
If anything happens,
this will be your mug shot.

95
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,100
Fine. But I need an advance.

96
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,150
Let me think. I need about…

97
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,010
$8,000.

98
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,750
Can you give me about $8,000?

99
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,320
Forget it.

100
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,740
So there's a need for negotiation.

101
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,210
Every outing is $1,000.

102
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,330
Half of that….

103
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,310
Forget I said anything.

104
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,090
$300.

105
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,150
$100.

106
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,270
$200. Nothing less than that.

107
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,030
- As you will.
- Ahjussi!

108
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,700
Fine. Every outing is $100.

109
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,370
But transport and meals….

110
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,260
Snacks...

111
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,130
- Isn't this daylight robbery? It's all inclusive.
- Clothes.

112
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,070
And if there's a need to touch,

113
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,080
that will be charged by category accordingly.

114
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,030
Touch my head, $20.
Face and shoulders, $30.

115
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,610
- This rascal thinks I'm some pervert.
– Waist and back, $50.

116
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,710
And hands on shoulders, it's $70.
A hug is $100 and a kiss is…

117
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,620
I'll stop there. I'll stop there.

118
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,070
Then what if I pounce on top of you?
How much is that?

119
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,740
Didn't you pounce on me in the hotel earlier?
How much will you pay me?

120
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,630
Wow! What a petty guy…

121
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,480
- You were the one who first tripped me with your leg!
- Fine.

122
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,730
Scooter repair fee, $500.

123
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,510
And you'll be paid after.

124
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,250
Advance.

125
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,950
I need the money urgently.

126
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,230
Honestly.

127
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,110
If you don't give me an advance,
mister I won't do it.

128
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,110
Is that your car?

129
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,240
Why is the hotel car park so far away?

130
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,090
My legs hurt.

131
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,570
Give me a ride to the subway.

132
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,400
So comfortable.

133
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,810
Be quiet.

134
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,810
Yes.

135
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,370
At a time like this, music is a must.

136
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,330
Don't touch anything.

137
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,310
Yes.

138
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,400
Oh! What the heck!

139
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,000
You're laughing?

140
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,070
We almost got into an accident.
Did you know that?

141
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,110
My heart almost fell out.

142
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,870
Don't worry. If your heart fell out,
I'll pick it up for you.

143
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:40,160
Mister from now on,
I'll just sit here quietly.

144
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,210
What's this? Mister!

145
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,730
What happened to this?
I didn't touch anything.

146
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:48,150
Ahjussi! I have to hold onto it!

147
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,510
It's opened.

148
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,950
Play on your own.

149
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,040
Wow! So refreshing!

150
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:00,070
No wonder they all drive with the tops down.

151
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,220
Ahjussi! How fast can this car go?

152
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,020
It's none of your business.

153
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,320
What are you doing?

154
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,990
It's dangerous.
You punk, sit down now.

155
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,430
So thrilling!

156
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,100
I'm so happy!

157
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,370
Mister, let's always drive with the top down.

158
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,460
I'll pay you $20 to let me
play like this for awhile.

159
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,580
Hello everyone!

160
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,590
I needed money and I'm going to get it.

161
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:28,490
But I need even more money.

162
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,480
If you're late even one minute tomorrow,
the whole thing is off.

163
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,320
Yes.

164
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,660
Thank you for today.

165
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,300
See ya!

166
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,800
He's a monster.

167
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,890
Mom!

168
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:51,830
Mom!

169
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,870
You're back.

170
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,200
Mom, mom, mom!

171
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,010
Wait! Let me finish writing this.

172
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,550
I'll make you some food a little later.

173
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,850
What are you writing?

174
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,100
Leather shoes are my enemy.

175
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,450
Branded goods are a short cut to bankruptcy.

176
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,910
Pink is an angel from hell.

177
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:11,310
Don't I always get attracted to pink stuff?

178
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,380
I've been thinking about it,
I must have gone crazy.

179
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,810
My daughter runs around out there
everyday to earn money.

180
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,960
Even with twenty-four hours,
it's not enough.

181
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,650
But as the mother,
I get charmed every time I see nice things.

182
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,660
Then I buy everything back.

183
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,960
Every word and every sentence
is completely true.

184
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,090
It's true. As a mother,

185
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,610
you're really into shopping.

186
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,790
Hey! Don't you use my facial mask!

187
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:40,070
Bad girl! Whenever I buy something,
she'll use it all up.

188
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,120
How many marks did you
get for your exam this time?!

189
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,870
Who told you to stir her up?

190
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,600
You can't even cover the cost.

191
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,620
Bad girl!

192
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,280
Mom.

193
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,800
What's this?

194
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:58,880
Oh my!

195
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,610
What's this?

196
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,320
My part-time job gave me an advance of $1,000.

197
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,030
And $500 for the scooter repairs.

198
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,510
But… why would they give you
such a big advance?

199
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,640
Don't tell me…

200
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,610
Not everyone can work in a nightclub.

201
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,030
Those with my figure might just do.

202
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,050
What nightclub!

203
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,200
You…

204
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,730
Tell me the truth,
did you borrow from a loan shark?

205
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,360
I sure didn't!

206
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,110
Why don't you trust your own daughter?

207
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,490
Of course I do.

208
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:29,300
If not you,
then do you expect me to trust her?

209
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:37,430
But with this money, it's not enough to
buy the ring for aunt Dong Sook.

210
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,930
Anyhow, let's take out the fixed deposit
we set aside for Eun Sae's school registration.

211
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,110
Then we'll earn the rest of it.

212
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,740
Stop worrying.

213
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,540
I, too, will work hard peeling those chestnuts.

214
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,340
Let's have a party. Party!

215
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,590
But not more than $10.

216
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,300
Then how much were you
thinking of spending?

217
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:02,020
Let's have a party. Party!

218
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,200
Sorry.

219
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,790
I will peel many, many chestnuts.

220
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,980
Unni, is this a lion?

221
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,350
That's right.

222
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,560
Unni, draw me a flower please.

223
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,850
- I finish up here then I'll draw one for you.
- Yes.

224
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,740
- Hye Jin, come and eat.
- Yes.

225
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:29,140
- Unni, bye! Bye!
- Bye!

226
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:33,160
Yoo Ju, it's time to eat.

227
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,720
You haven't had dinner yet, right?

228
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,910
Let's have meatballs.

229
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,370
I don't eat meatballs.

230
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,410
I've mentioned it many times.

231
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,410
Is that so?

232
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,670
When you asked me to meet you here,
I already knew.

233
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,330
What are you talking about?

234
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,140
Let's go.

235
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,220
Where to?

236
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,180
To the owner of those meatballs.

237
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,240
I'm here to see you.

238
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,690
Again and again, you're lying.

239
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,860
Ssulja's father! Ssulja's father!

240
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:16,910
Ssulja's father!

241
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,320
Oh, it's the milk young lady.

242
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,360
- Hello.
- Yes.

243
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,370
Want to drink this?

244
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,620
Want to eat this?

245
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,230
But...

246
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,230
I'm always calling you Ssulja's father,
you must be upset.

247
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,450
I'm Choi Han Seong.

248
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,250
I'm Go Eun Chan.
I'm twenty-four.

249
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,650
What about you, Mister?

250
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,840
I'm already thirty-one.

251
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,770
Oh... Thirty-one!

252
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,710
Then we don't have to speak in formal terms.

253
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,450
Will that do?

254
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,680
Oh yes,
what happened to money and pride?

255
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,530
Previously, at the wine bar…

256
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,040
Oh, that!

257
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:18,140
It keeps switching around,
that's just me.

258
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,980
Ahjussi, do you have moments like that?

259
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,490
Me?

260
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,890
I'm not too sure...

261
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:34,970
But recently amongst my friends,
there's really a guy like that.

262
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:40,350
What I mean is, that friend…

263
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,010
Nothing, forget it.

264
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,440
Why?

265
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,750
You think I'm too young to
have a conversation with you?

266
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,200
I know a lot about what I should know.

267
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,920
If you don't feel like it,
you don't have to tell me.

268
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,510
Here. It's stuck here.

269
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,950
Here... no, here...

270
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,460
Can you tell me about your friend?

271
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,240
I'm very curious.

272
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,210
It's nothing much.

273
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,460
Tell me.

274
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,010
Well…

275
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,320
That friend…

276
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,720
Had a woman he loved very much.

277
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,480
But two years ago, that woman left.

278
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:48,470
Did they break up or was he jilted?

279
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,940
Both, I guess.

280
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,870
No, I think it should be the latter,

281
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,190
because that woman had another man.

282
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,260
And then?

283
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,700
But...

284
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:05,040
That woman reappeared again
like magic after two years.

285
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:11,210
So I guess he's struggling over
whether they should start over again.

286
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,740
He must be rather vexed.

287
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,980
So that means your friend...

288
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,540
...meets that woman anew again.

289
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:25,600
Whether to start over again…
your friend has to…

290
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,500
Ah! I'm all mixed up…

291
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,600
So I'll just…

292
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,890
Use Mr. A and Miss B to refer to them.

293
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,980
Is Mr. A still in love with Miss B now?

294
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,650
I don't know about that.

295
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,390
How could you not know?

296
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,030
If you miss her and want to hear her voice,

297
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,710
that shows you still love her.

298
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:56,090
Mister, put your hand on your
chest and ask yourself.

299
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,330
Oh no!

300
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,270
Mister, I have to go.
Next time…

301
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,290
Yes, I'm on the way home.

302
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,820
- You're not eating anymore, right?
- Yes.

303
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,680
Now I… I didn't eat it yet!

304
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,650
- How could we finish eating it all up?
- No...

305
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,180
I'm off.

306
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:20,780
Hey! I'm almost home.
Open the door.

307
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,850
Han Yoo Ju, you've become pitiful.

308
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,750
Is Choi Han Seong really that good?

309
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,830
Yes, don't answer that.

310
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,740
The owner of the meatballs has come.

311
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,130
Put in your effort.

312
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,570
You just got home?

313
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,640
Yes.

314
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,640
I'm off.

315
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:23,290
I broke up with DK.

316
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,940
I know.

317
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,290
You're quite famous, you know.

318
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,670
I saw it in the newspapers.

319
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,210
I'd like to…

320
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,250
Start over with you again.

321
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:15,450
I'm here to tell you I'm really sorry…

322
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,540
What are you thinking about?

323
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,260
You...

324
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:06,120
What kind of person do you think I am?

325
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:13,470
I'm someone who'd break up with
you when you said to break up.

326
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,910
To date you when you said to date.

327
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:23,880
You must find me easy, huh?

328
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,880
Nothing like that.

329
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,240
Just go.

330
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,560
Let's not see each other again either.

331
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:50,950
You're really different from me.

332
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,720
Three years ago,

333
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,440
you said goodbye to me like
I'm doing now,

334
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:00,010
when you said
"let's not see each other anymore",

335
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,630
at that time, I felt so silly and
grieved and I cried.

336
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,390
You seem to have a lot of experience, right?

337
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,280
No matter what the situation is,
you can always remain at ease.

338
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,430
I've changed a lot, right?

339
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:26,410
I've even taken revenge by sleeping with you,
I'm low and despicable.

340
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:32,340
The moment I saw you,
my heart was shaken.

341
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:38,310
No matter what you do,
I've always let you.

342
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,480
Go.

343
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,640
I told you to go and you really went.

344
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:09,250
Yes, Go Eun Chan,
there's no need to be afraid.

345
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,810
Mister! Mister! Wait!

346
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,720
I'm getting off, sorry!

347
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,970
Mister!

348
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:36,910
See! See!

349
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,580
He's not answering his phone
and he's not here.

350
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,540
I'm the one who's too naïve.

351
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:45,470
To believe in that hoodlum,
I must be insane.

352
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:50,200
Hey! You took the advance and
you're not showing up?

353
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,080
I'll distribute your mug shot
throughout the whole country.

354
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:54,720
Hoodlum! You hoodlum! Rascal!

355
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:57,190
Mister!

356
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,900
Why did you come so late?

357
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:02,820
Sorry. I was afraid I will be late
so I went home…

358
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:07,850
Took the bus,...
up and down, and I ran here...

359
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,380
I'm so tired.

360
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,640
What are you saying?

361
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,830
See what you're wearing.

362
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,030
What's wrong?

363
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,840
What is this you're wearing?!

364
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:19,000
Follow me, hurry!

365
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,670
Mister, look at this.

366
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:59,970
Rose of Sharon has blossomed.

367
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,310
Are you ready?

368
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,780
Action!

369
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,710
You like coffee very much, right?

370
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:27,990
Nothing much to look at
and talks too much.

371
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,590
Gosh. It's only been 5 minutes and
I'm starting to get so bored.

372
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,800
Everyone says I look like Ming Na Yeon.

373
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,050
Do I really look like her?

374
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,970
I do?

375
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:40,500
Please excuse me for a while.

376
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,220
Show time!

377
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,760
Mister, I think this job is more
interesting than I imagined.

378
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:04,660
Shh! No mistakes.
Get it right the first time!

379
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,010
I know.

380
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,970
What are you doing now?

381
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,950
Quick, turn your head.

382
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,750
Trying to be funny?

383
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:22,290
Didn't you say to turn my head?

384
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,450
The other way.

385
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:04,020
You jerk!

386
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,050
Wait! Wait!

387
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,880
An elegant lady like you
shouldn't be doing this.

388
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,980
Who says I have to wait?

389
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,390
I heard he kissed a guy...

390
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:22,570
Go Eun Chan!

391
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,990
And got beaten up by a girl.

392
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:29,240
That lad is so full of tricks!

393
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,790
Great! OK!

394
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,070
What?

395
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,880
Hey! Just act appropriately.

396
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,490
Why are you behaving like a girl?

397
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,180
That was my first kiss.

398
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,560
How can that be counted as a kiss?

399
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,430
When one's happy, he'll just…

400
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,070
That's my first kiss too…

401
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,530
With a guy!

402
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:56,010
You're so scheming.

403
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,810
Let's go eat.

404
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,220
Good, good.

405
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,780
Yes. I'll make you into dog hair today.
Like this.

406
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,500
What should we do now, Mom?

407
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:23,070
- The rumor about Han Kyul being a gay is all over.
- Go! Go!

408
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:25,540
If his father finds out about it…

409
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,130
Mom, think of something!

410
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,490
Don't bother with him.
I've got my methods.

411
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,550
Just relax and have some cake.

412
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:36,710
Good! Go, Go.

413
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,950
Mother!

414
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,050
Stop calling me.

415
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,000
This…

416
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,360
It's all your fault.
I ended up giving him a double point card.

417
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,240
Just a small matter yet
you're nagging so much.

418
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,080
I'm heading to the office.
Get the car ready for me.

419
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:53,290
And get Gae Shik to the office quickly.

420
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,100
Gae Shik?

421
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,940
Yes, Gae Shik.

422
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,960
Good.

423
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,040
Good!

424
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,510
Coffee Prince Shop, Work Plan

425
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:14,820
With a monthly income of $2,000,
how many cups do you sell in one day?

426
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:18,470
About three hundred a month.

427
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:22,800
Monthly rent is $1,300. And subtracting material costs
and management fee, there's nothing left.

428
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,840
During this period,
did you get to eat rice three meals daily?

429
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:27,880
I prefer ramen or noodles.

430
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,250
Although it is a single unit,
it's still a house to me.

431
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,690
And I have no desire for
money so I live quite freely.

432
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:35,910
Then you should just go on living like that.

433
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,650
Why do you bother to start from scratch again?

434
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,650
But that coffee shop has memories of a beautiful time.
So I don't want to give it up…

435
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:45,440
Didn't you tell me that woman married
another man and is living happily?

436
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,150
Till now, you're still talking about her?

437
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:51,020
- It's really not easy to forget her…
- Stop talking nonsense.

438
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,410
How dare you mention her in front of me!

439
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,540
Pulling out a successful butcher shop owner

440
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:00,510
to run an unfamiliar coffee company.

441
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:03,130
Helping her all the time till
she went overseas for study.

442
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,640
And you only worked at it for five years.

443
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:07,930
Did you open that shop only for her?

444
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,770
And she didn't even show up once,

445
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,550
until ten years later,
she suddenly appeared.

446
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,180
She came on special
occasions every year,

447
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:15,600
but you didn't receive her.

448
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,690
Someone who deserted me,
why should I receive her back?

449
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,230
I've always been worried
about your health,

450
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:26,000
but hearing your loud voice, I'm so happy.

451
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:28,390
Jerk, why are you laughing?

452
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:30,270
Just three months!

453
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,230
I'll give you the money.
Within three months, you must triple it.

454
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,170
Triple? What kind of joke?

455
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,260
At my age, why would I joke with you?

456
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:40,870
Sure.

457
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:45,310
I'll find you a lad who's similarly lost like you,
as quick as I can.

458
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:47,850
You two join hands and
put in your best effort.

459
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:49,630
This is your last chance.

460
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,560
Do you understand?!

461
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:55,370
A guy who's similarly lost like me…
that'll be terribly difficult.

462
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:09,260
Let me do the sums.
The basic fee for an outing…

463
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,330
And the kiss fee, how much would that be?

464
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,950
A guy with only money on his mind,
why so slow when calculating the sums?

465
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,720
Head $20, face three times so $30, back two times
so $100, hands on shoulder three times $70

466
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,450
and the kiss…

467
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,420
Special reward $150.

468
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,800
Wrist $20, neck hugging $50,
how much is that all?

469
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,490
How much?

470
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,580
I don't know.

471
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:29,990
Wait a minute. Since I have a lot on my mind,
I can't add it all up right away.

472
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,840
I have to pay the rent and
my sister's school fees…

473
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,470
How much will the rent increase?

474
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,900
Why? You're paying it for me?

475
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,070
Maybe around $5,000.

476
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,990
I have to count it right.

477
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,410
Take a look.

478
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,660
Oh yes. Take off the watch.

479
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,040
This is a fake.
Can't you give it to me?

480
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,330
Why?

481
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:01,570
So petty. I'll give it back.
You're really petty.

482
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:07,300
What a petty guy.

483
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:11,580
Why is this cup so small?
Only as big as nose bogey.

484
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:22,110
Totally wild. Wild.

485
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,810
Mister, is it true you can only
take one glass of red wine?

486
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,900
Any more than that,
you'll find yourself floating.

487
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,490
Then go ahead and drink more
and live long.

488
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:32,970
Yes.

489
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,790
What's wrong?

490
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,450
There's clearly a smell.

491
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,580
Don't you smell coffee?
The smell of coffee…

492
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,430
How could there be coffee in a
Chinese restaurant?

493
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,920
Hey! Jung Sung!

494
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,040
Sorry! Sorry!

495
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:03,010
Sorry? Is that all?

496
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,390
I'm so upset.

497
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,210
Mister, I've spilled my coffee,
can you give me some napkins?

498
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,370
- Here.
- Thank you.

499
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:14,560
Are you a dog?

500
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,470
How can you smell that from inside here?

501
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:19,100
My nickname is Dog Nose.
I'm Dog Nose.

502
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,420
I didn't want to mention this.

503
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,250
Earlier when you kissed me, I smelt it.

504
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:27,240
You had rice this morning, right?

505
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,190
What again?

506
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:43,780
There's something smelly, really stinks.

507
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,560
What smell is that? It's so strong.

508
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,350
Mister, don't you smell it?

509
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:57,560
I was even peeing behind the rubbish truck…

510
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,730
There's something smelly, really stinks.

511
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,100
What smell? Where is it?

512
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,770
Got it. Got it.

513
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:09,880
You're Dog Nose.
Just eat some more.

514
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,480
Yes.

515
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,020
You're so thin and small.

516
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,390
All that you ate, where did it go?

517
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,790
I have to eat more so I can work.

518
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:20,530
I have to eat to store up while I get the chance
because such opportunities don't come often.

519
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,410
Why do you have to store up?

520
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,090
To vomit it all out again?

521
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,940
Do you want to see it?

522
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:37,270
Hey, until now I still can't digest
that image you showed me.

523
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:38,780
So don't do that again.

524
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,700
This cup is water.

525
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,530
You're not following the beat.

526
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,890
How many times has it been?

527
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,570
Start over again.

528
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,810
We can finish it today, right?

529
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,410
It's already 10 pm.

530
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:45,360
We haven't taken lunch and dinner yet.

531
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:52,030
Sorry everyone.
Go and eat.

532
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,050
Brother.

533
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,800
Are you alright?

534
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,810
Yes, go and eat.

535
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:09,300
What have I done wrong in my previous life?

536
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,900
Why are there so many stairs?

537
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:15,080
What kind of man is he?
Just one cup and he's knocked out.

538
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,740
He's so heavy.

539
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:23,270
I'm going crazy, really.

540
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,760
Mister.

541
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,880
Wake up. You're home.

542
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,220
Mister. Mister.

543
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:41,440
Mister.

544
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:51,970
Mister.

545
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:54,440
Mister, wake up.
You're home.

546
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,280
Mister!

547
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,530
Really!

548
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:51,360
I'll count to three and if you don't get up,
I'm leaving.

549
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:52,730
One, two, three!

550
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:19,700
Eun Chan.

551
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:21,710
What are you carrying?
I'm carrying a pig.

552
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,670
A big fish. A big fish.

553
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:24,810
Fish?

554
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,410
Hey!

555
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,650
The freezer at my place is empty.
Shall I keep that for you?

556
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,930
No.

557
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,280
Eun Chan, I've made soup for sobering up.

558
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:07,690
Hello?

559
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:09,500
Yes, teacher, hello.

560
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:10,670
I've been well…

561
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,020
What?

562
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:14,600
Eun Sae…
what happened to her?

563
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:18,700
I'm sorry.
I'll be right over.

564
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,920
Hello,
hello.

565
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:23,930
- Hello, hello.
– Go Yeong, Go Yeong!

566
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,030
Take this in for me.

567
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:28,130
I have to go out for a while.

568
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,420
Take this to the sleeping mister, alright?

569
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,180
Yes.

570
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:32,680
- Louder!
- Yes!

571
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:48,100
But why must you write such
things on my text book?

572
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:50,700
Who asked you to write this?

573
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:53,850
- Hey, Go Eun Chan!
- Hello.

574
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:56,840
Straighten her up before you
bring her back to school.

575
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,940
What's this? She's writing tontine
transactions into her notebook.

576
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,080
I'm sorry.

577
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:05,960
You're still so willful.
Stand up straight.

578
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:07,420
I'm sorry.

579
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,230
Where did you get the money?

580
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:14,720
Isn't it more than $1,000 for the deposit?

581
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:16,420
Just a bit from here and there.

582
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,330
How is it possible for you
to get that much money?

583
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:20,200
The money from peeling chestnuts
and sticking eyes on the dolls,

584
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:21,900
I took some of it, what's wrong?

585
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,690
Your eyeballs are popping out.

586
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:30,570
It's because I wanted to take the vocal lessons.
So?

587
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,200
Why did you hit me?

588
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,590
What right do you have?

589
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,400
Are you my mother?
Or my father?

590
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,060
What's so great about you
making some money?

591
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,160
Stop that.

592
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,570
I've been so patient with you,
now you're so rude.

593
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:43,520
Can't I say that to you?

594
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:45,150
How dare you stare at me?

595
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,270
If you wanted to take the vocal lessons,
why didn't you tell me?

596
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,900
Are you the president of the Han Gook bank?

597
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,840
When I ask you for money,
can you give it to me?

598
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:52,910
You have nothing yet you talk big.

599
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:56,010
No matter what you say,
I'll continue to collect tontine.

600
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:57,250
Not just in my class,

601
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,340
I'll collect tontine from the whole school.

602
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:02,420
When I become a singer and
sell albums and become famous,

603
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:04,470
at that time,
there won't even be soup left for you.

604
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:06,580
Do you get it?

605
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:09,100
Are you still going to collect tontine?

606
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,600
Of course.

607
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:12,140
And I won't be discovered again.

608
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,920
I'll put it all in my brain.

609
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,440
When I'm famous in future,

610
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:18,720
I'll make an award certificate for you.

611
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:44,780
Mister, are you a beggar?

612
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,370
Ready?

613
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,930
Defense action.

614
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:21,700
Basic action. Go.

615
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:24,000
Defend the bottom.

616
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:26,230
Defend the top.

617
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,240
Defend the face.

618
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:30,130
Tae Kwon!

619
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:31,760
Attention.

620
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:33,150
At ease.

621
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:36,300
Why did you bring me here?

622
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:38,910
I was afraid you'd be robbed
so I took all that trouble to save you.

623
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:40,860
Just eat up and go.

624
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:41,900
Do that again.

625
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:42,740
- Yes.
- Yes.

626
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:43,800
Ready?

627
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:46,520
Teacher!

628
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,850
What teacher?

629
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,770
He pooped.

630
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:51,160
I need to poop too.
Me too.

631
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:55,040
Me too.
Me too...

632
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,900
I'm going crazy.

633
00:46:57,350 --> 00:47:01,490
Me too.
Me too...

634
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:12,260
What are you doing?

635
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:18,550
Just a kid's poo.

636
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:20,070
Must you vomit?

637
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,020
Don't you poo?

638
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:24,720
Stop talking about poo already.

639
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:28,310
This was worn by my father.

640
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,980
I don't usually lend it to others.

641
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:32,190
What about those I bought for you?

642
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:34,080
It's in the washer.
Would you wear it wet?

643
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:35,270
I've got to go see the kids now.

644
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:37,490
Get changed then come quickly.

645
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:57,070
It's been a long time since I saw this.

646
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:00,490
The style of this house
is completely messed up.

647
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:19,670
Eun Chan's daily schedule.

648
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,020
Deliver milk, peel chestnuts,

649
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,440
deliver food…

650
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:37,640
My grandma said my mind
is empty and it's really true.

651
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:51,330
This rascal,
when he was young he looked real smart.

652
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,050
Why are you laughing all the time?

653
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:01,120
I don't know.

654
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,830
Goodbye teacher!

655
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:27,150
- See you!
- Bye.

656
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,610
- Be careful.
- Yes.

657
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:48,690
This is something you wanted, right?
The reward for a job well done is this….

658
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:50,730
$5,000?

659
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,690
This mister is crazy.

660
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:57,250
Minus your pay,
the other $3,500 is on loan to you.

661
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:59,440
You must pay me back.

662
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:02,390
Did mom put some medicine in the soup?

663
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:12,200
One, two...

664
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:12,950
Three!

665
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:14,940
One, two.

666
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:19,960
One, two, three.

667
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:39,820
There's an exhibition in a month.

668
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:46,620
Things are going well for you.

669
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:52,260
But they aren't for me.

670
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:55,760
Everything's in a mess.

671
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:00,610
You can still work.

672
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,860
Things are fine.

673
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,250
Ignoring me?

674
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:18,250
No matter what I say now,

675
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,020
you won't like it.

676
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:22,450
Do you know me that well?

677
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,770
Then you must know when you left me,

678
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:30,710
how much my heart hurt?

679
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:35,300
Missing you like crazy at first…

680
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:39,300
But it didn't help at all. Forget it.

681
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:45,070
Looking at all this,
do you know how much it hurts me?

682
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:47,610
You must know it too.

683
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:09,240
I think I really can't play this game with you.

684
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:14,840
No matter how much I want to hurt you…

685
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:17,880
You seem to be unaffected.

686
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:28,890
Thank you.

687
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:36,880
I didn't think you'd come.

688
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:42,550
I want...

689
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:47,890
to hurt you.

690
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:03,470
Cry.
Cry.

691
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,640
Why wouldn't they take me?
Why?

692
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:07,960
Why?

693
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,630
How will I return the $3,500?

694
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:23,420
Isn't he going matchmaking again?

695
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,780
He didn't say by when I have to pay up, right?

696
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,630
Should I ask him?

697
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:43,560
So anxious!

698
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:47,740
But why am I anxious?

699
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,270
I don't care anymore.

700
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:53,290
Hardworking Youth

701
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:57,500
Hello?

702
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:01,140
Why did you call me so early in the morning?
I didn't get to finish my dream because of you.

703
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:03,700
What early morning?
The sun is up already.

704
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,820
Why are you shouting at me?

705
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,530
I want to know by when
I must return the money.

706
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:11,250
Is there a need to ask?
As soon as possible, of course.

707
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,590
Aren't you going matchmaking again?

708
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:15,130
I think that's a good job for me.

709
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:17,030
So for your sake, I have to go for more of
those sickening matchmaking sessions?

710
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,720
I told you I could do anything.

711
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:20,630
Every outing is $100.

712
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,180
OK?

713
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:23,780
No, thanks.

714
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:25,000
So petty. You're so petty.

715
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:27,730
If I had the money,
I'd return it to you first.

716
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,180
- Hang up.
- Wait!

717
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:35,380
Thank you.

718
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:44,530
Hello? Hello?

719
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:48,100
He hung up without saying goodbye.

720
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:00,960
Rascal.

721
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:15,310
You, you, you, you, you!

722
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:18,460
The sun has risen and is almost setting now.

723
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:21,320
Just take a look at yourself.

724
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,770
Follow me out now!

725
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,200
No, this is... this lunatic.

726
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,950
Grandma, be careful.

727
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:49,040
Grandma!

728
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:51,550
Are you alright, grandma?

729
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:55,470
This place is going to collapse soon.

730
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:57,260
I…

731
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,670
Rascal!

732
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:08,450
You call this a coffee shop?

733
00:59:08,490 --> 00:59:11,270
A dog's kennel is better than this.

734
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:13,880
Shall we go?

735
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,210
Although you know this person,
it's better to go elsewhere for a drink.

736
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:17,680
Where else can we go?

737
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:19,860
From now on,
this is your company.

738
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:20,960
What?

739
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:22,570
Go and say your greetings.

740
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:23,990
That's your teacher.

741
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:34,100
You really didn't get your pay?

742
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,430
I knew he was going to do that.

743
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:40,510
Smiling sinisterly at everyone.

744
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:44,160
That's why I told you not to trust anybody.

745
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:47,160
If I knew he was running away,
I should have caught him earlier.

746
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:51,050
But he disappeared in the night.
What are you going to do now, Eun Chan?

747
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:52,910
It's the place that you will be working.

748
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:58,040
This is your teacher, President Hong.
Have a true-hearted talk with him.

749
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:39,530
A high nose, nice curved chin, puffy lips…
is this a girl or a guy?

750
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,040
Who is this?
My lover.

751
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:43,360
Are you really going to pretend to be a guy?

752
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,110
What if you get caught?

753
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:47,540
Don't worry,
it'll be fine unless I take a shower.

754
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:48,960
She looks like one anyways.

755
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:52,540
They say there's one troublemaker in every household,
you really have no manners.

756
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:54,680
Why do you keep holding my hands
and feeling it?

757
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:57,450
You… you have really nice hands.

758
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:59,680
Whatever, I don't want to do business.

759
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:01,110
If you're so lazy, I wonder
why you even bother breathing?

760
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,170
I'm perfect for being jobless.

761
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:03,870
It's okay to eat it, it's not dirty.

762
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:05,390
Whatever, whatever, I'm going to be jobless.

763
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,000
How could he not see this pretty girl?

764
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:08,490
Can I have your phone number
so I can call you?

765
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:09,360
Look at him, he hasn't come home yet.

766
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:10,290
Are you mad?

767
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:11,740
I found out!

768
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:14,100
How come you don't have any facial hair?
And your feet are so small compared to your age.

769
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:15,950
I'm a girl!
