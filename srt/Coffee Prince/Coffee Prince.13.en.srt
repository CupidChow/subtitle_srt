1
00:00:04,428 --> 00:00:07,799
Thirteenth Cup

2
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,180
93 degrees.

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,850
Seems okay.

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,780
Let's check to make sure.

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,770
90... 92.5.

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,350
Awesome!

7
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,610
The weather really is hot.

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,280
Give me a cup of water.

9
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,950
Yes.

10
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,700
Have free time tonight?

11
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,940
Is something the matter?

12
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,270
It doesn't have to be
something for us to meet.

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,740
Go out on a date.

14
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,400
Today?

15
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,480
I originally wanted to go
home earlier to study.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,520
Saying it like that makes it seem like
you're really serious about studying.

17
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,150
Starting today, I want to study hard.

18
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,010
Starting tomorrow.

19
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,570
Even so tonight, I can't.

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,690
Mom's complaining about how
a girl always comes home so late.

21
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,000
Still have to sew the stuffed dolls' eyes,
still have to shell the chestnuts.

22
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,550
Hey!

23
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,620
Then when are we going to go on a date?!

24
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,560
You're refusing on purpose?

25
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,360
Want to go see a movie?

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,260
Too noisy there and too many people,
don't want to go.

27
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,370
Then how about amusement park?

28
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,770
Right, you don't like crowds.

29
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,840
Then... theater?

30
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,180
Shopping?

31
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,560
Musical?

32
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,690
If that's no good then...

33
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,980
Chat in the park or...

34
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,230
Drive?

35
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,670
Go to my house.

36
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,990
DVDs. It'll be cozy.

37
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,260
Was crying and yelling before.

38
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,230
Now can't even close his mouth.

39
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,420
Oh Angel, sit here.

40
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,450
Should I go buy you a milk to drink?

41
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,920
Are you okay?

42
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,860
Sorry.

43
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:18,630
Walk this way.

44
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,240
What are you doing?

45
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,250
Tastes good?

46
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,510
Young man,

47
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,400
you haven't paid yet.

48
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,510
5000 won.

49
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,760
I won't.

50
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,300
Other than Eun Sae,
I won't see any other woman.

51
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,700
Standing outside the
washroom holding a purse.

52
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,080
Toe nails covered with nail polish.

53
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,780
Are you a servant or an experimental object?

54
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,010
Don't live like that.

55
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,930
So what?

56
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,480
Sun Ki hyung has nail polish too.

57
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,500
Are willingly done and forced the same?

58
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,820
There isn't much difference.

59
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,160
You... really!

60
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,060
What?

61
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,560
See me and you seem like
you can't wait to eat me alive!

62
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:37,560
Maybe he's thinking of the time
when you saw his butt.

63
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,350
Ah, the pretty girl who winked
standing at 11 o'clock.

64
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,660
You wall.

65
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,230
That's right, I'm a wall,
what can you do about it?!

66
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,040
You bad girl.

67
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,250
Come here.

68
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,450
Quickly come here.

69
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,760
You,

70
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,110
hurry up and forget her sister,
go out with the girl I introduced you.

71
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,340
No.

72
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,790
Do as I say!

73
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,530
Why?

74
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,720
Don't ask why, go see her!

75
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,550
You big gorilla.

76
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,610
I like most Eun Sae.

77
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,170
Go clean.

78
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,220
Do you want the noodle to be broken up?

79
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,870
Just once.

80
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,890
I only eat egg white.

81
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,870
I only eat egg yolk.

82
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:20,680
Flavoring?

83
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,530
Only put spice powder.

84
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,170
Okay.

85
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,420
Hey.

86
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,320
How come you can't do anything right?

87
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,520
How can you use scissors to
cut green onions?

88
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,150
For the most part, it was me who cooked.
Later you do the dishes.

89
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,610
That's not true, we cooked together!

90
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,730
Fairly, use rock paper scissors.

91
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,400
Then, don't use rock paper scissors.

92
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,910
Play five-words game.

93
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,000
The loser washes the dishes.

94
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,630
Okay?

95
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,830
Okay.

96
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,420
You like me, don't you?

97
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,660
Ob-vi-ous ans-wer.

98
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,240
Since when has that been?

99
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,930
From when you kissed me.

100
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,340
The kiss from which time?

101
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,700
Match-mak-ing date kiss.

102
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,050
It was that early?

103
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,070
The ramyun is done!

104
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,240
Look at you,
acting weird all on your own.

105
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,920
You dare do whatever that's weird.
Nine words.

106
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,300
You wash the dishes.

107
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,050
Alright.

108
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,850
The cover's mine.

109
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,700
What kind of reason is that!

110
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,880
I'm not eating.

111
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,320
Don't eat then.

112
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,550
So rigid, rigid,
look at the tint in your eyes.

113
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,310
Tastes so good.

114
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,240
It's really hot.

115
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,700
What do I like about you?
Why are you asking this type of question?

116
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,280
That...

117
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,430
Min Yeop said I'm strong,
not feminine.

118
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,480
So he doesn't like me.

119
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,780
There are many beautiful and slim women.

120
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,290
Manager... you're handsome,
your family background is good.

121
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,110
All criterions are very good.

122
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,690
Honestly speaking,
I'm not even a bit pretty.

123
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,640
Looks like a boy.

124
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,520
Family background isn't good either.

125
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,790
Educational level is also not high.

126
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,420
There aren't that many things
to like about me, but still, you do.

127
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,220
No kidding.

128
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,250
But what can I do?

129
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,950
Those qualifications don't mean
much to me I just like you.

130
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,880
Too honest.

131
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,510
You can't do it.

132
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,790
Eating this after brushing
your teeth tastes good, right?

133
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,430
It's my habit.

134
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,460
Really it's a strange habit.

135
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,820
You'll be leaving one month
from now, right?

136
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,930
How about I don't go?

137
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,600
You have to go anyway.

138
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,770
How about we go together?

139
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,960
In Chelsea,
find a condo with many trees as home.

140
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:37,800
After I go to work, you read
under the sunlight in a nearby park.

141
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,630
And when I leave for work,

142
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:43,000
you come to my office and
we go eat dinner together.

143
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,090
Then go listen to music.

144
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,360
If we get hungry,

145
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:51,160
then we walk to a pizza store
from home and get a pizza to eat.

146
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,450
You need to eat a whole one.

147
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,220
Just pure imagination already makes me excited.

148
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,800
You say you're excited but
why is your expression like that?

149
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:06,150
Imagination is okay, but I can't really go.

150
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,260
Why can't you really go?

151
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,870
I don't plan on marrying yet.

152
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,000
What?

153
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,720
Didn't you want me to go
to the U.S. with you?

154
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,720
Then isn't that living together?

155
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,960
Going together is living together?

156
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,730
Without marrying we can still live together.

157
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,920
What?

158
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,590
Ah, that.

159
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,140
I mean, the thing is.

160
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,230
If you really feel strange,
then we can live separately.

161
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,280
But if you actually slept with me,

162
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,470
you won't really bug me
about marrying you, right?

163
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,360
Did I say something I shouldn't have said?

164
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,840
Lovers obviously have to sleep together.

165
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,200
Right?

166
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,940
You really make me hot talking about this.

167
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,240
It's not me who make you this hot.

168
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,150
It's the weather that's too hot.

169
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,120
Also.

170
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,180
If we sleep together,
of course we should get married.

171
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,180
So, if sleeping together means
you have to get married,

172
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,330
does holding hands mean
you have to get engaged?

173
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,510
That... is that how it is?

174
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,630
How can there be so much ice cream left?

175
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,960
Hurry and eat.

176
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,090
I am really glad you're a woman.

177
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,900
It's all melted.

178
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,640
New York.

179
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,810
New.

180
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,570
New York.

181
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,750
What did you say?

182
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,420
Mom, are your ears not working?

183
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,390
Manager asked her to go
to America with him... New York.

184
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,250
He proposed to you, didn't he?

185
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,950
When did he say you are getting married?

186
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,670
Not getting married.

187
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,160
Even if we go together,
we wouldn't have to live together.

188
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,180
Mom.

189
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:35,930
Our manager works at
New York's biggest toy company.

190
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,490
Not marrying?

191
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:38,790
Then, what about us?

192
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,750
You should buy us a condo before marrying!

193
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,500
Hey, little girl.

194
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,700
Why would he do this for me?

195
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,540
Use your brain to think about it.

196
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,270
Hey! Hey!

197
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,050
Quickly finish eating and go out.

198
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,490
Don't you have to go out to see your friends?

199
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,470
Would I still be in the mood to go see friends?

200
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,110
She only cares about her own happiness.

201
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,360
Going off to New York!

202
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,490
Doesn't matter how we are,
it's fine as long as you're okay!

203
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,330
You alone eating well, you're happy, right?

204
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,070
You little girl, what's wrong?

205
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,030
Are you jealous that I'm doing well?

206
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,570
Yes, jealous to death, so what?

207
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,380
Why are you screaming and yelling
over the table early in the morning?

208
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,180
Mom, why do you always reprimand only me?

209
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,860
If she leaves, how are we going to live?

210
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,670
It's already difficult now,
how will just mom and I survive?

211
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,050
Relying solely on shelling chestnuts
and sewing eyes on dolls.

212
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,590
How will it finance me for university?

213
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,580
Eat.

214
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,520
Seeing her sister in love.

215
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,540
She's afraid the brother-in-law
will steal away her own sister.

216
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,640
She's like that for her heart is anxious.

217
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,790
Who is it?

218
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,650
Long time no see.

219
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:15,830
Tomorrow you and I, we'll bring Han Kyul
to the cinerarium of his biological mother.

220
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,470
Let him meet his biological father.

221
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,110
Thinking about it,
that's the humane thing to do.

222
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,670
The child's mother...

223
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,770
I already told her.

224
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,820
What did she say?

225
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,420
She agrees.

226
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,230
I was interested in her,
I'll let you have her now.

227
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:47,620
Look. Check out her perfect female charisma.

228
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,870
Long flowing hair.

229
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,040
Soft and pale skin.

230
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,480
Also, captivating eyes.

231
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,720
Mesmerizing to death, right?

232
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,390
But, the most fatal point is...

233
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,830
Please eat.

234
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,200
A beautiful spirit who knows
how to take care of the other.

235
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,200
Hey, mesmerizing to death, right!

236
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,920
Don't take more than you're offered.

237
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,590
Women don't like it.

238
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,780
Don't be nervous.

239
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,690
Full of self-confidence.

240
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,150
Start!

241
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,810
You're... really beautiful.

242
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:34,030
Can we meet again?

243
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,080
How can I be doing so well?

244
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,580
Seems like I'm an expert at love too.

245
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:52,650
I'm really busy right now.

246
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:56,350
You must be joking,
what can you be busy doing?

247
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,780
I'm near the singing studio.

248
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,910
I'm hungry, hurry up and come over.

249
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,070
No.

250
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,860
No?

251
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,380
When did your guts get outside of you?!

252
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,570
My guts have always been safely inside.

253
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,710
Hanging up.

254
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,360
Eun Sae.

255
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,760
You came here from school?

256
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,590
Uncle, did you go somewhere?

257
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,300
Haven't seen you for several days.

258
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,890
Oh, traveled.

259
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,980
Following the wind, following the clouds.

260
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,780
Like a homeless wanderer.

261
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,860
Wandered around for a
few days then came back.

262
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,460
You really are blessed.

263
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,710
You can go as you wish.

264
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,340
It's so good for you to be alone
by yourself without a care.

265
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,440
Why are you getting married with my mom?

266
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:50,040
That, it's because...

267
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,090
I like your mom.

268
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,490
Compared to one person,
it's better to have two people.

269
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,580
Did you get bullied by someone?

270
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,200
The person following me around everyday
saying he likes me hung up on me.

271
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,700
My unni said she might not get married.

272
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,030
What... marry?

273
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,110
Ah, that, that...

274
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:12,890
Heard she has that kind of relationship
with the coffee shop manager.

275
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,550
It shouldn't be true, right?

276
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,200
My gosh!
Eun Chan really met someone good!

277
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,770
What's so good?

278
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,150
Because he's got lots of money?

279
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,530
My sister isn't the type who likes someone
just because of the money.

280
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,620
Why do you twist what other people mean?

281
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,540
When did I say he's good
because he has lots of money?

282
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,040
I only said he was good.

283
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,670
Why are you accusing me?

284
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,060
Are you sad?

285
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,960
If I release an album and
earn lots of money,

286
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,270
I would buy her a car.

287
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,120
And open a coffee shop for her.

288
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,930
I originally wanted to do that.

289
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,310
She, however, doesn't understand my heart.
Mesmerized by a man...

290
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,780
If mom gets married too,
then I'm left by myself.

291
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,020
Eun Sae.

292
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,680
I like your mom.

293
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:02,850
But... if you don't like it,
I definitely will not get married.

294
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:06,660
Until you agree, I won't marry.
Definitely not.

295
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:10,850
Also, if your mom gets married,
why would you be alone?

296
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,820
It's one more family member.

297
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,450
Uncle, you're a little nice as well.

298
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,610
But I still don't like it.

299
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,220
Hey.

300
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,030
Why didn't you come straight
home after school?

301
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,230
What are you doing here?

302
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,560
I'm going now.

303
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,220
Don't nag.

304
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:29,570
You little girl.

305
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,040
Did you go somewhere far?

306
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,950
Haven't seen you.

307
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,650
Yes.

308
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,220
What is it with him?

309
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:53,850
Who cares,
I don't have time to care about a man.

310
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,700
But, this person really is...

311
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,950
Hey Min Yeop, come here.

312
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,140
You have been caught up in trot music.

313
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,440
Lately, I've always...

314
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,370
Really?

315
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,270
Who are you talking to?

316
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,670
What are you doing?

317
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,790
Hey, have you heard of this?

318
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,650
In love, in love, this...

319
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,210
This has so much feeling.

320
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,800
This has a good feel to groove to.

321
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,230
What?

322
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,300
Jealous of you.

323
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,210
Brother.

324
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,500
Look at manager's shoulders.

325
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,080
Isn't it broad?

326
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,770
It's considered pretty broad.

327
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,460
Don't answer carelessly,
take a look.

328
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,300
Legs are long as well.

329
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,140
Looks good no matter what he wears.

330
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,760
His taste in clothing is also very classy.

331
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,580
Seems like he's not nice,
but he's very kind when you spend time with him.

332
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,770
Seems like a player making no contributions,
but in fact he's very pure.

333
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,390
He's full of charisma all over.

334
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:55,780
Hyung.

335
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,390
You've never seen manager's look
when driving, right?

336
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,330
Driving single-handed.

337
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,480
If you were a woman,
you would be attracted by him as well.

338
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,790
It was like that with the concert,
those girls were staring at manager.

339
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,300
They have good tastes.

340
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,320
When is manager going to U.S.?

341
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,630
I originally wanted to go with him.

342
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,960
But I need to provide for my family.

343
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,250
I'm actually the parent.

344
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:19,950
Discuss it with the manager.

345
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,790
Don't just worry about it on your own.

346
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,500
No.

347
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,310
I don't want to talk about this.

348
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,450
It won't be long till.

349
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,040
He'll have to go.

350
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,780
Not much time left to see him.

351
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,180
Grab onto him.

352
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,640
He liked you even when
he thought you were a guy.

353
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:38,390
Who knows, maybe he won't go.

354
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,560
An ambitious man…

355
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,080
They say it's really low to cling
to someone using love as an excuse.

356
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,790
It's very revolting.

357
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,650
[Han Yoo Ju]

358
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,980
Unable to connect, after the beep...

359
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,260
Yoo Ju, it's me.

360
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,820
You left your phone on.

361
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,270
Did you go relax a bit?

362
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,310
Yoo Ju.

363
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:50,520
You can take your time coming back.

364
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,720
But remember to turn on your phone.

365
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,190
It's better if you pick up as well.

366
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,700
Oh my gosh.

367
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,950
Why are you eating when
it's already night time?

368
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,350
Eun Sae went to bed already?

369
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,180
Yes.

370
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,540
You.

371
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:12,190
You and your manager are dating seriously, right?

372
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,200
Why?

373
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,960
Nothing much, just seems strange.

374
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,320
Claiming yourself to be a man,
cautiously going to work in the shop.

375
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,510
In the end, you meet this kind of fate.

376
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,490
When did a small little girl
grow up so much already?

377
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,310
You've raised me for
twenty so years now.

378
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,760
Of course I've grown.

379
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,530
It's strange then if I haven't.

380
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,160
That's true.

381
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,160
Let's eat together.

382
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,490
Okay.

383
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,640
But.

384
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,380
Their family is a bit...

385
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,950
Aren't our family conditions too poor?

386
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,990
It's true that it'll only go smoothly
if both families match.

387
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,160
What's wrong with our family?

388
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,680
So delicious.

389
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,260
I'll taste it.

390
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,610
Okay.

391
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,250
Tastes so good.

392
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,730
Because of mom, my standards
in choosing women got a lot higher too.

393
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,370
How come my mom knows
how to do everything?

394
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,910
Sweet talker.

395
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,090
Look at how you spoil him.

396
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:33,410
Why did you go so far early
in the morning to buy crabs?

397
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,580
It's not like you're the only one with a son.

398
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,760
Jealous again.

399
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,310
Just a moment...

400
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,620
Mom.

401
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,580
Mother, please wait.

402
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,280
Eat well.

403
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,810
Go somewhere with me.

404

[Jung Eun Sook]
[1947, Sept. 2 – 1979, July 8]

405
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,210
Han Kyul.

406
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,290
You, a few days ago...

407
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,280
Saw someone named Lee Myung Jae, right?

408
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,140
Yes.

409
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,550
That person is your biological father.

410
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,470
I... told him everything.

411
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:51,490
Hope the child will understand
the heart of parents is a type of greed.

412
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,440
If he blames you for not
having told him all this time,

413
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,760
you just listen.

414
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,970
It has taken him thirty years
to meet his birth mother.

415
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,080
I'll be going first.

416
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:09,550
You and Han Kyul
come back together.

417
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,580
Yes.

418
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,010
You.

419
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,630
Worked hard.

420
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,670
Very good.

421
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,820
You can do anything now.

422
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,650
Come, a little reward.

423
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:19,300
Quickly go.

424
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,920
I know, I know.

425
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,880
Seems like you've practiced a lot.

426
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,960
Drawing a lot better than me.

427
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,550
Uncle.

428
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,170
How about I go for a test to become a barista?

429
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,750
You're not being a tae kwan do instructor anymore?

430
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,660
I... don't have the ability to open a studio.

431
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,650
Furthermore, I like coffee.

432
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:45,930
But, Ahjussi.

433
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,980
Can a barista earn lots of money?

434
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,710
When I went to Torino.

435
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,350
I went there through a rumor I heard.

436
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,500
Give or take some,
it was about half our store's size.

437
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,930
But the sales...

438
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,030
Actually reached that of
an average medium-sized business.

439
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,120
Really?

440
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:03,250
It all depends on how it's operated.

441
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,270
You can't expect to earn
100 million per month just like that.

442
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,400
For me,

443
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:11,680
I'll be satisfied if I can earn
two times of the pay right now.

444
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,210
I don't have to worry about Eun Sae's tuition.

445
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,710
And I can give mom some spending money.

446
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,300
I have nothing more to ask for.

447
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,860
Ask for more.

448
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,630
Ask for more.

449
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,710
Otherwise, you want to be like me?

450
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:38,230
I wonder how he's feeling right now?

451
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,270
If he can give a call back,
how good would that be.

452
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,020
I really liked your biological mother.

453
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,460
All alone.

454
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:54,800
The way she didn't mind hard work
in order to pay her tuition...

455
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,120
Was very beautiful.

456
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:58,990
With Lee Myung Jae, the three of us
were very good friends.

457
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,250
Carelessly, I started to like her.

458
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,740
We already decided to
spend our life together.

459
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,650
Agreed no matter what
happened we won't split up.

460
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:12,000
But because she was an orphan,
grandma strongly objected.

461
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:15,770
No.

462
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,960
It was my heart that changed.

463
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,580
It was I who didn't want her anymore.

464
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,600
But...

465
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,050
She didn't speak one word of complaint.

466
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,010
Whenever I see you.

467
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,010
Even though for your mother right now.

468
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:34,440
For the person who already
passed away, I feel very sorry.

469
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,570
However.

470
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,520
To have been able to raise you,

471
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,120
I feel very happy.

472
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,970
It makes me angry.

473
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,910
But I don't know why, exactly.

474
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,280
Maybe it's because of the biological father
who's just now appeared,

475
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:10,380
or because you and Grandmother
suddenly revealed this now,

476
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:16,810
or because of myself, for believing I
was part of your bloodline.

477
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,850
Han Kyul.

478
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,940
Today.

479
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,340
That's it for today, father.

480
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:42,130
Didn't pick up for the whole day,
really strange.

481
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,680
Hey girl.

482
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,010
Did something happen to your lover?

483
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:49,580
Just now he said he'll come back
after going to see grandma.

484
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,780
Seems like he can't come back.

485
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,510
This lowly brother calls all day
and he doesn't return the call.

486
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:57,730
With Madam, however, he calls all the time.

487
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,090
An eight years friendship is destroyed like that.

488
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,390
Don't joke about me anymore.

489
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,150
Oh my gosh.

490
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,240
Who's joking?

491
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:06,760
Joking about Madam,
in case Madam cries,

492
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,810
says I'm impolite to Madam,
Manager will give me a good reprimand.

493
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,420
Is it not, Madam?

494
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,640
But, Han Kyul hyung.

495
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:15,980
Everyone's talking about having a farewell party.

496
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,440
Have you two talked about it?

497
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,460
What will happen after if he goes to the U.S.?

498
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,240
Brother.

499
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:22,330
Does that toy have to be made in the U.S.?

500
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:24,000
Of course.

501
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,560
The States is the original place of manufacturing.

502
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:29,280
Also, he only got officially hired
as a designer after three whole years.

503
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,980
It's not easy.

504
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,510
Really, when?

505
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,560
Heard he received notice last week.

506
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,480
But hyung is really impressive.

507
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,070
Starting work from a block designer.

508
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,810
Sleeping only two, three hours a day.

509
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:46,300
He's succeeded after three years
of tireless hard work.

510
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:50,360
Also there's this place,
Coffee Prince had great improvements too.

511
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,940
Miss Eun Chan, I am earnestly
giving you a word of advice.

512
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:59,150
A man's ambition...
can't use love to disconnect it.

513
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,690
Disconnect what?

514
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,170
It's not a flower,
how can it be disconnected.

515
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,030
If you don't want to part,
then go to the U.S. together.

516
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,430
It's not a place where you can
go by hopping onto the subway.

517
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,640
How can we go together?

518
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,700
Costs for transportation, for living.

519
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:10,800
So much money to be spent.

520
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,240
What's the problem with this?

521
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,520
A lover who has the capabilities
will cover it all.

522
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,620
Buy you a house, a car.

523
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,350
Your way of thinking is really strange.

524
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,450
He's him, I'm me.

525
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,690
Manager buys me whatever and I'll accept it,
you think I'm that type of person?

526
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:26,040
If not then fine,
why are you so serious?

527
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,040
Makes people awkward.

528
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,330
So don't say those things in front of me.

529
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:34,260
Even if you don't tell me to,
I'd still let him go.

530
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,660
Hello?

531
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,720
Are you sleeping?

532
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,990
I think I'm near the house.

533
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,630
Or I think I'm on my way home.

534
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,310
What do you mean I think?

535
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,550
I think I'm near your house.

536
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,580
Can you come here for a minute?

537
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:11,040
I'm tired but since you want me to come,
I'll go.

538
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,320
No, you must be tired.
Get some rest.

539
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:17,040
No, I'm not tired.

540
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,230
- How long will it take?
- 3 minutes.

541
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:29,260
What happened?
A lot of things happened.

542
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,960
Starting from nine in the morning,
there was a group order.

543
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:34,740
I thought I was going to die
trying to get their order.

544
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,000
Anything else?

545
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:40,000
At night these gangsters came and complained
that there was oil in the coffee.

546
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,330
I told them that the oil is
from the coffee beans.

547
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,970
They kept saying it was
because the cup was dirty.

548
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,440
I thought my head was going to explode.

549
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,270
- Anything else?
- Why do you keep saying anything else?

550
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:56,490
Without you around…
I kind of missed you.

551
00:30:56,930 --> 00:31:00,280
Me too.
I missed you too.

552
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,650
Did you go somewhere
with grandmother?

553
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,850
To the cinerarium.

554
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:11,010
To see my birth mother.

555
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,560
I heard I was adopted.

556
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:23,790
The person who gave me a picture
of my mother is my biological father.

557
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:31,560
I don't know what you're talking about.

558
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:35,690
My birth parents and
my current dad were friends.

559
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,810
And a year later,
my birth parents divorced.

560
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,010
My birth father went to Australia
and they lost contact with him.

561
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,750
After that I was born
and my mom died in an accident.

562
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:51,420
Since I was alone and had nowhere to go,
my current parents took me in.

563
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,540
A friend's child.

564
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,000
He took in the child of
the woman he loved,

565
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:01,140
and took care of it as
his own son until now.

566
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:08,400
I was completely fooled by
my grandmother, mother, and father.

567
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:12,070
They treated me so well,
I didn't have a clue.

568
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:17,210
The three of them were so good to me…

569
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:24,420
I wonder why my mother
didn't tell me about it sooner.

570
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:29,360
They shouldn't have told me.
So suddenly like this.

571
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,100
What can I do now?

572
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,820
Aren't I a pitiful son to my father?

573
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:41,870
I thought he had me
with another woman.

574
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:44,580
I yelled and talked back to him.

575
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:47,040
For ten years...

576
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,830
You didn't know.

577
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,720
You didn't know.

578
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,690
Now I know why you do this.

579
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:28,170
It feels good when you are
in a difficult situation.

580
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,490
You have no skills.

581
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:36,780
I heard working at the New York
headquarters is a big thing.

582
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,200
Is there anything you can't do?

583
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:43,870
You have everything
so it makes me lose my nerve.

584
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,700
Did Ha Rim tell you?

585
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,210
Why are you so happy?
I'm feeling sad.

586
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,920
Let's go together.

587
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:56,300
I'm going to stay here,
so go by yourself.

588
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,510
I'll be sure to send a letter everyday.

589
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,030
More than one letter each week.

590
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,790
You're not going with me?

591
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,140
If I go, I'm just going to be
a disturbance to your work.

592
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,150
And I have to work here.

593
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:12,050
I'm the head of my family.

594
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:15,450
It's because of your family's
circumstances, I can...

595
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:20,280
I'll manage. Don't worry.

596
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,770
I did good until now
without anyone's help.

597
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:26,110
I'm going to do good in the future too,
so don't worry.

598
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:32,220
When you're in the U.S., concentrate on
making toys and don't do anything else.

599
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,890
I didn't say this before because
I thought you'd get cocky.

600
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:41,180
Don't wear the black shirt.

601
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:47,570
Last time, all the female customers
couldn't stop staring.

602
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,870
Is there anything else?

603
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:53,570
I think the girls look at me
when I flip my hair like this.

604
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:54,590
Look at this. Look at this.

605
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,630
You show your eye laugh
to anyone and your dimples.

606
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,930
You better not show that to anyone.

607
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,710
- Eun Chan.
- Yes?

608
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,570
Should I not go?

609
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,940
What do you mean not go?

610
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:25,500
You suffered for three years.

611
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:30,230
I'll just think you're going to
the military service and wait for you.

612
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,230
So don't you dare go off and
have an affair or else you're dead!

613
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,350
You're so cute.

614
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,090
Are you that sad?

615
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,970
If you're going to miss me that much,

616
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:48,300
I'll come once a month,
no once a week to see you.

617
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:51,090
You can come to the U.S.
and I'll come to Korea too.

618
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,090
Do you know how much a plane ticket cost?
How can I go once a week?

619
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,710
- I'll buy it for you.
- Is a guy, a servant?

620
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,770
I'm going to earn the money
and take care of it on my own.

621
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:06,160
We shouldn't see each other
for a long time so once a year?

622
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:08,760
Once every six months?

623
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,300
Once every six months?

624
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,220
No way.

625
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,470
Can we go on without seeing
each other for six months?

626
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:25,970
We have to endure it.
We have no choice.

627
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,980
Oh... hold on.

628
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:12,890
Director Choi, this is Han Jung Hwan
from Chungwoon Film. I sent the scenario.

629
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,660
Please call me after you look at it.

630
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,880
Why did you work until now?

631
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,360
That's why you have
blisters on your fingers.

632
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:12,350
It's because I have no skill.

633
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:16,810
The aunt upstairs does more
than me and she's fine.

634
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:23,420
Aren't you coming home
late often these days?

635
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:26,000
I know.

636
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:31,610
Look at your fingers.

637
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,930
It's fine now. Go to sleep.

638
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:40,380
- I'll do it.
- It's okay. It's tiring.

639
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,230
- I'll do it.
- It's okay.

640
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:03,390
Good night, Manager Choi.

641
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:10,350
Hyung, o... ppa.

642
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:13,740
It's disgusting...

643
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,380
I'm hungry but your
refrigerator is empty.

644
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,190
I'm going to go grocery shopping.

645
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,650
Are you not mad anymore?

646
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,300
Sleep a little more.

647
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:30,220
Yoo Ju, hurry back.

648
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,670
Okay.

649
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:53,350
How dare you stare at me like that.
Release your eyes.

650
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:56,820
What are you so mad about?
I didn't do anything wrong.

651
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,580
You were like mad for few days.

652
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,380
What about you?

653
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,490
I'm going to send my boss alone.
So put your lips back in.

654
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,590
Really?

655
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,980
Then do I pretend to send him?

656
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:13,990
You're going to complain that you didn't go
because of us. Just go. Go.

657
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:16,890
Bring me the brush and sit down here.

658
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:23,560
I get scolded whether
I say I'm going or I'm not going.

659
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,960
You have an opinion about everything.
Your hair is a mess.

660
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:31,210
But your boss is going to be sad.

661
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:35,180
Let him cry. He says he will
come see me once a week.

662
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,380
Do you know how much
a plane ticket costs?

663
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,110
So I scolded him saying
do you have money to waste?

664
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:46,640
Truthfully, if we are going to breakup like that
it's better breaking up now.

665
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:50,150
Since you are not listening,
your hair is not listening either.

666
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,540
But sister, I think Hwang Min Yeop
is cheating on me.

667
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,400
He's not answering my calls
and ignores my text messages.

668
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:59,390
Hwang Min Yeop is?
Is he crazy?

669
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,820
He's doing this to my angel?
I'll scold him.

670
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,460
Let's eat ddukbokgi for dinner,
with a lot of odeng.

671
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,830
I'm leaving.

672
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,350
- Mom, I'm leaving.
- Okay.

673
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,460
Mom. Mom. Mom.

674
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,990
She's not going to the U.S.

675
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,790
She's not going?

676
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:23,850
What about the boss?

677
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:26,070
She's just letting the boss go.

678
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,250
Just the boss?

679
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,110
You're happy, right?

680
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,650
Good morning.

681
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:02,150
You don't listen do you?

682
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:04,730
You still wore the black shirt?

683
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:05,880
You don't know?

684
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,580
When people say don't do something,
I do it more.

685
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,340
Are you okay?
I was worried.

686
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,530
About my mom?

687
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,780
I'm fine.

688
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:21,320
You look good, Manager Choi.

689
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:25,640
Even though I'm tired,
I do things that are necessary.

690
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,600
Good morning!

691
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:30,640
You're here.

692
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:34,050
Eun Chan...
you need to clean the bathroom.

693
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:36,450
Someone didn't aim right,
so the toilet is dirty.

694
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,440
Okay.

695
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:42,100
My Chan, the bathroom is out of pads.
Restock it.

696
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:44,110
Okay.

697
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:58,770
What is this?
This is mine.

698
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,360
That? Isn't it mine?

699
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:03,170
You gave it to me as a
present two years ago.

700
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:06,040
Let me see. Let me see.

701
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:10,000
Yes this,
I bought this with my card last year.

702
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,980
I think I did.

703
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:15,670
I was shocked after I found out
that I had CDs missing.

704
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,300
A lot of these are mine.

705
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:18,750
No, it's not.

706
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:20,860
All right. All right. You can have it all.

707
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:22,170
Did you go grocery shopping?

708
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:25,020
Yes. I'll make bean paste stew.

709
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,380
Should we have a party?

710
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:31,060
Let's invite Han Kyul and Eun Chan...
and have a party.

711
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,970
You don't want to?

712
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,730
No, I want to.

713
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,600
Okay.

714
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:38,830
I'll help you after I organize this.

715
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:40,050
Okay.

716
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,880
- Yeah... Han Kyul.
- Did Han Yoo Ju call?

717
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:52,270
I think her cell phone works.

718
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,910
She came yesterday.

719
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,700
Really?

720
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:58,400
Where was she all along?

721
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:03,700
Yoo Ju wants to invite you and Eun Chan for dinner.
Do you have time tomorrow?

722
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:06,170
Why is she inviting Eun Chan?

723
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:08,180
Is Han Yoo Ju planning something?

724
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,460
I don't know.
It's up to you whether you come or not.

725
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:13,320
Hang up. I'm busy. Hang up.

726
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:19,890
How is it?

727
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:22,190
It's a killer.

728
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:35,490
Where were you?

729
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,610
A quiet beach.

730
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:39,700
What is the number to that beach?

731
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:45,620
Write down all of your friends, family and that
beach's number in my phone book. All right?

732
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,750
Why did you come back?

733
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:51,890
It doesn't make sense.

734
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,060
I didn't think about how you felt,

735
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:57,160
and just because you had a
little change of heart, I made you a criminal.

736
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,010
It's funny of me leaving and such.

737
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:02,440
I missed you a lot.

738
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:04,380
When?

739
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:06,160
When the wind blew,

740
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:08,500
when I walked,

741
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:10,780
when I fell asleep alone at night,

742
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,180
when I woke up alone in the morning...

743
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:15,040
Etcetera... etcetera.

744
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,300
What about Eun Chan?

745
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:20,660
After being briefly swayed,

746
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:25,910
the moment you packed your bags,
and got over my feelings for her.

747
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:36,240
Thank you for coming back.

748
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:43,910
I never thought I'd be left behind.

749
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:49,890
Since you were always the one
who loved me more.

750
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:57,690
But seeing the small changes in your gaze,
your sighs, your expressions…

751
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:01,790
Made my heart fall with a thump.

752
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:04,570
Hey, Han Yoo Ju.

753
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:10,350
It's funny,
that as my feelings for you grew,

754
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:14,120
I was losing confidence in you.

755
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:18,100
So... I thought,
"Let's preserve the last of my pride...

756
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:22,410
Before I'm left, let's leave first. "

757
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:25,360
That's why I ran away.

758
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:34,150
I was so afraid of what would happen
if you didn't grab hold of me.

759
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,740
You are like a fox.

760
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:43,150
Thank you for holding
onto me till the very end.

761
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,260
The weather is nice.

762
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:50,870
It's refreshing.

763
00:47:56,110 --> 00:48:03,590
Late at night, in a closed surrounding
you two only played with blocks?

764
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:06,760
- We ate ramen too.
- Just ramen at midnight?

765
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:10,610
Was there any skinship?

766
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,140
We did hug.

767
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:16,690
You are trying to kill the guy,
aren't you?

768
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:20,770
Girls really don't know guys.

769
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,950
The thing that comes to a girl
only maybe once per day,

770
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:27,480
comes to a guy many times each day.

771
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,390
What is that thing?

772
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:33,780
You know when guys in the morning
get again and again.

773
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:38,660
You know hot, hot.

774
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:42,370
Are you getting the grasp?

775
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:44,100
Really?

776
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,710
You're again making me
passionate about teaching.

777
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,640
Then, what do you do at those times?

778
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:52,510
Me?

779
00:48:53,820 --> 00:49:00,790
Its different every time.
I read a book or watch a video.

780
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:03,430
Jin Ha Rim!

781
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:13,930
What are you saying to her?

782
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:16,240
I'm trying to make you feel comfortable.

783
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:21,030
Truthfully, every night you are
always like this with her.

784
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,230
But your body feels different.

785
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:27,260
But why are you teaching
her that yourself?

786
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,190
I know.

787
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:31,720
It smells. The upstairs bathroom
is blocked up again.

788
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:35,040
Sister. Eun Chan.
Can you fix the toilet?

789
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,580
Eun Chan.
Fix the toilet.

790
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:40,020
Eun Chan, can you get me a bag of flour
from the basement?

791
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:45,390
Hey! Don't you have hands and feet?
Fix the bathroom, bring the flour!

792
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,310
You guys don't even do anything.

793
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,400
Why are you guys bossing around the poor child!

794
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:50,480
Hey! Jin Ha Rim!

795
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:54,350
Don't ever talk about how guys are...
whatever to Eun Chan, okay?

796
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,480
You're too harsh.

797
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:58,760
I'm teaching her the facts of life.

798
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,980
My Chan is originally in charge of
the upstairs bathroom. So, what's with you?

799
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:05,130
My Chan? Why is Eun Chan your My Chan?
She's My Chan!

800
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:08,360
She is a girl.
Is it too hard to be considerate of her?

801
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:15,460
I call My Chan. My Chan.
Then what do I call her? Madam?

802
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:19,610
He cares too much.

803
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:25,570
Consideration? I'll do that.
Since she is the wife!

804
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:30,400
This heavy thing. Give it to me.

805
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:33,600
Madam, sit down here.

806
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:41,110
Drink this.

807
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,290
What are you doing?

808
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:44,720
We're being considerate.

809
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:48,100
Tell the boss about us.
About how considerate we were.

810
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,230
What are you talking about?

811
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,600
The sun is strong.
Your face is going to get burned.

812
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,130
Why are you doing this?

813
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:54,460
What are you doing up there?

814
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:57,740
We're being considerate to your wife!

815
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,520
I don't want it. Stop it.

816
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:10,240
Your wife is coming down.

817
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:18,070
Did you tell them to do it?

818
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:19,870
Why did you do it?

819
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,500
Because you seem tired.

820
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:27,290
Hold on.

821
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:33,470
Yes, mom. I was going to call.

822
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,860
I'll visit on the weekend.

823
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:37,810
Go the airport tomorrow.

824
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:39,350
Why the airport?

825
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,420
Your birth father is leaving tomorrow.

826
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,320
If you let him leave like this
you will feel bad too.

827
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:46,320
He's leaving tomorrow?

828
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:57,260
Really?

829
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:58,560
Did you meet Yoo Ju?

830
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,580
No, I talked to Han Sung hyung.

831
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,660
They want to have dinner with us.
At Han Sung hyung's place.

832
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:06,550
Can I go?

833
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,730
Did sister Yoo Ju say I can come?

834
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,720
It's okay if you go but when
you're there don't eat a lot.

835
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:14,730
Don't scare them away.

836
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:17,810
They already know I eat a lot.

837
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:24,010
I should bring a watermelon tomorrow.

838
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,070
You heard my phone conversation, right?

839
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:27,990
My dad's friend.

840
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:32,180
He's leaving on the morning plane tomorrow
so my mom told me to go see him.

841
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:33,370
Yes.

842
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:36,240
Isn't she a angel?

843
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,210
She calls me and tells me to go see him.

844
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,120
Are you listening?

845
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,200
I was thinking.

846
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:52,210
How come there are a lot of things I don't know.

847
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,450
I don't know if I should say cheer up.

848
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:58,230
I don't know what to say to you.

849
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,020
I would feel the same too.

850
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,060
What would you say.

851
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:06,190
Did I tell you this before?

852
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:09,240
No, if I say it you are going
to brag about yourself.

853
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:10,780
I won't say it.

854
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,860
What?
You're making me curious.

855
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:19,090
Well its...

856
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:23,090
Your phone voice is good.

857
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:24,090
Good night.

858
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:31,060
She's playing with me.

859
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,880
What?

860
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:45,280
I wanted to say see off your father well.

861
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:50,280
I should have stayed quiet.
Why did I say it?

862
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:52,950
I'll have a good meeting.

863
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:55,640
Thank you, Go Eun Chan.

864
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:11,830
There's only a few days
left until he leaves.

865
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,630
[Warning. Females prohibited from entering]

866
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:19,050
Super-strength-supplying milk!
Go Eun Chan Milk.

867
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,400
Be strong. Strong. Kisses.

868
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:36,920
Yes, this is Lee Myung Jae.

869
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:38,580
This is Choi Han Kyul.

870
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,510
Yes, Han Kyul.

871
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:45,970
I want to see you.
Can I go see you right now?

872
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:58,490
How did you know I was leaving today?

873
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:01,850
My mom told me.

874
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:04,130
Did you eat breakfast?

875
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:10,580
Breakfast is important to
people who work.

876
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:20,870
Truthfully, few days ago I met your dad.

877
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:25,590
I heard what happened to you
during the past few years.

878
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:29,410
I thought I would not be able
to see you before I left.

879
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:32,940
When are you coming back?

880
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:37,650
If I come back, are you going
to happily greet me?

881
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:56,060
How tall are you?

882
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:59,740
I'm about 184cm.

883
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:12,420
This is my contact information.

884
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:17,320
If there is a chance you're at Australia,
it would be good if you can call me.

885
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:23,390
Well, take care of yourself.

886
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,740
Excuse me.

887
00:57:32,110 --> 00:57:34,910
I heard you had a son.

888
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:37,180
What is his name?

889
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:42,720
Han Young. Lee Han Young.
He just turned 20.

890
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:48,040
He's tall as you.
You guys look alike too.

891
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,010
Hello?

892
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:45,000
Choi Han Kyul at 6:30

893
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
drank Go Eun Chan's milk
and got strength.

894
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:51,110
And at 8:10am, arrived at the airport.

895
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:54,400
At 8:20am, I met my birth father.

896
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:59,410
At 8:50am, we shook hands
and I never cried

897
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:03,630
and saw him off well.

898
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:08,390
Right now, it's 9:10am and Choi Han Kyul
is on his way to meet his grandmother.

899
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:14,480
After I report the sales,
I predict I will arrive at the café after 12.

900
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:16,350
We didn't even complete the three months.

901
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:20,020
What's the hurry that
you are already reporting?

902
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,560
Can you come a little early?

903
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:24,570
Eun Chan.

904
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,310
Yes.

905
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,170
Let's tell each other everything.

906
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:31,590
About what?

907
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:34,190
Just everything.

908
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:35,900
Saying that we love each other,

909
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:37,880
about being sad, missing each other,

910
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,960
being mad at each other, hating each other.

911
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:42,300
Everything.

912
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:46,950
Let's not make it so we can't do
anything for each other.

913
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:50,040
because we don't know
anything about each other.

914
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:53,140
And don't make our hearts
hurt because of this.

915
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:55,920
Let's say everything. All right?

916
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:00,230
Okay. I will tell you everything.

917
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:05,780
I won't stay quiet and tell you everything.

918
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,530
Everything.

919
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:10,190
Okay, that's good.

920
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:36,680
Habit.

921
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:38,660
A shell-less habit.

922
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:41,290
You have to be very grateful for Eun Chan.

923
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:44,120
She breathe life back into an empty person.

924
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:46,080
I like Go Eun Chan.

925
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:48,230
Although I was confused at first,

926
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,500
the more I see her, the more she looks cuter,
seems great, and becomes prettier.

927
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:56,460
So you're mad. Why say you're not going,
when you are?

928
01:00:56,670 --> 01:00:58,770
We have a baby.

929
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:03,520
Our responsibility has suddenly increased.
It's a strange feeling.
