1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:03,730
Hyungnim! Hyungnim!

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:04,720
Fourteenth Cup
Let me show you something really fun...

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:08,080
You're here again!
Here's a free tomato waffle for you.

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:08,950
I don't want this.

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:09,990
Oh, you don't want it?

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,880
I've prepared this for you too.

7
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,310
- I don't-
- You don't like this either?

8
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,020
Then how about choosing this by color?

9
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,090
I've got this, this, and this.

10
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,270
I don't want to eat this!

11
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,950
Oh my, you're perspiring.

12
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,270
Let me fan you… do you
want it strong or weak?

13
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,220
Just take your pick.

14
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,260
Just go away!

15
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,480
But you look like
you're feeling pretty warm.

16
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:26,640
I said, just go away!

17
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,340
Gosh, she's weird, ignoring the
nice things that people do for her.

18
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,930
What's going on?

19
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,180
Hyung's been after that girl
for a couple of days,

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,220
but she's not reciprocating his feelings.

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,730
Just give up on thinking that
every girl will fall for you.

22
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,930
That girl's quite good…
got a lot of character.

23
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:49,430
Yeah.

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,810
You… stop acting like you know everything,
just because you're getting more popular.

25
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,240
How far have you gone?

26
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,230
What, kissing?

27
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,420
Or more?

28
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,130
You really…

29
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,450
She was listening!

30
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:06,770
Really!

31
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:14,160
But, Miyeong's acting weird.

32
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,460
She keeps asking me to buy stuff for her.

33
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:16,400
What does she ask you to buy?

34
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,780
A couple of days ago it was sneakers,

35
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,400
and toe rings that would match her shoes.

36
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,310
Yesterday she asked for a
mobile phone and perfume.

37
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,710
If I buy 3 items for Eun Sae,
she rejects at least one of them.

38
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,930
But this girl doesn't do that…
she insists that I buy the stuff for her.

39
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,270
Hey! That girl thinks too
lowly of you, doesn't she?

40
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,500
Aish… I don't know.

41
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,720
But when I see her, I just feel
like buying presents for her.

42
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,100
Hey! Miyeong?

43
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,750
Who's "Miyeong?"

44
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,380
Eun Sae has been saying
that you were acting weird.

45
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,090
But I didn't believe her.

46
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,550
How could you become a playboy
behind Eun Sae's back?

47
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,150
Are you crazy, you jerk?

48
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,860
Eun Sae was just too mean to me,

49
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,080
I wanted to teach her a lesson.

50
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,260
Do you know how cruel she was to me?

51
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,350
You think being
unfaithful is teaching her a lesson?

52
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,980
I thought you were a good guy,

53
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,130
but looks like you're a total jerk.

54
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,760
Ya, you don't need to say more.

55
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,390
If you want to go out with another
girl, end it with Eun Sae.

56
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,580
How dare you play the field?

57
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,930
Aish… really.

58
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,900
If you make Eun Sae cry, I will…

59
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,620
I want to be nice because you're a girl...

60
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,580
Do you know how bad Eun Sae was to me?

61
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,140
You're not even thinking about
what your sister has done wrong.

62
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:09,870
What?

63
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,780
Hey! What's wrong with the two
of you? There are customers around.

64
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,580
You're showing your true colors now.

65
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,660
Don't appear anywhere near
Eun Sae from now on.

66
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,020
If I see you, I'll kill you.

67
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,660
Do you think there aren't any
girls in the world besides Eun Sae?

68
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,420
I won't stick to her.

69
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:23,650
Is that enough for you?

70
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,040
I did well, right?

71
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,360
Ya, are you okay?

72
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,330
You, how could you poke the kid in the eye?

73
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,000
You shouldn't teach innocent
kids such bad stuff.

74
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,800
If you do it again, I won't stand for it!

75
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,610
Aigoo… look at how you walk.
Your posture, really…

76
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,700
Who would think you're a girl?

77
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,300
Oww… oww… brother?

78
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,930
Aiyoo… you idiot.

79
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,990
Why did you bring this here?

80
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,430
To think you're as tall as an
electric pole but you're so petty.

81
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,530
You're so boastful just
because sales have tripled.

82
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,590
I really am no match for Grandmother.

83
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,120
Did you go to the airport?

84
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,110
There was a little jam
on the roads, you know.

85
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,570
Grandmother…

86
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,170
What's up with you?

87
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,560
It's too hot!

88
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,290
Why are you struggling? Don't move.

89
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,100
Let go of me!

90
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:33,940
Grandmother…

91
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,630
I've made you worry, haven't I?

92
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,890
What parent wouldn't worry
about the kid they've brought up?

93
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,410
Your father was worse than you were.

94
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,450
Have you seen your mom?

95
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,040
No, I haven't seen her.

96
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,670
I felt like I'd cry if I did.

97
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,410
I'll go see her later.

98
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,060
Your dad should be in his office,

99
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,730
holding a special vote or something.

100
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,130
I don't approve of it.

101
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,770
Go and see him before you leave.

102
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,410
I don't want to get in
the way of his meeting.

103
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,000
I'll just hang out with
you for a while before leaving.

104
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,890
So what are you planning to do now?

105
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,160
Sales have tripled, and you've been
holding yourself back for three months.

106
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,700
You're really going to just pack
up and leave after three months?

107
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,560
Why? Do you want to give me
another "Coffee Prince" to manage?

108
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,910
Grandmother… should I
just not go back to the US?

109
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,370
Huh? You rascal. Have you been bribed?

110
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:47,390
You… really… don't
want to go back? Or what?

111
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,250
Aigoo… look at that face,
it looks like flowers are in bloom.

112
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,100
You really like me that much?

113
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,690
You horrible boy.

114
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,630
Well, you're obviously liking this.

115
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,330
I've received some offers of franchises,
so I'll check up on them.

116
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,000
It's going to be difficult
to break new records,

117
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,390
I think everything has reached its peak.

118
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,980
The industry is also a little saturated.

119
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,600
Do you want to take a look at
research materials from the company?

120
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,620
Me?

121
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,450
I might not understand what I was reading.

122
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,050
When are you planning to return to the US?

123
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,870
I'm not very sure.

124
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,690
The head office in the US has invited me
to go back, but I'm still thinking about it.

125
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,110
Opportunities don't come very often.

126
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,710
Don't think of anything else; just
ask yourself what you really want to do.

127
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,290
Did you send your father off?

128
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,110
It would have been
better if you'd told me earlier.

129
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,730
I'm thinking of going
night fishing this weekend.

130
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,770
Will you be busy?

131
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,610
Yes, I'll be busy.

132
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,090
But we can go together
when I've got more free time.

133
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,380
Kilimanjaro from Tanzania.

134
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,750
4 for sweetness.

135
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:13,830
2 for sourness.

136
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,020
1 – 2 for bitterness.

137
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,670
3 for body.

138
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,710
Ooh, I got it right!

139
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,820
This is a light roast.

140
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,550
Light roast?

141
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,490
Okay.

142
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,400
How is it going?

143
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,570
Is your disciple any good?

144
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,450
Oh yes, some consulting firm keeps calling.

145
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,530
They're asking you to give them an answer.

146
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,930
Should we open "Coffee Prince No. 2"?

147
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,730
I have my hands full
with this one. I can't do it.

148
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,670
Go Eun Chan, it's time
to deliver the coffee beans.

149
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:43,780
What's she doing?

150
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,700
She's studying hard.

151
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,180
Why? You're not doing the delivery?

152
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,200
Uh… I have to do this.
Just… just a minute.

153
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,220
That's your problem. Work comes first!

154
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,110
Hurry, go get ready.

155
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,650
She's studying isn't she?
Just go by yourself.

156
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,870
This one is Double A
Snow Top, from Tanzania.

157
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:08,690
Slowly… Tanzania Double A Snow Top.

158
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,780
This one tastes pretty
good on the tip of the tongue.

159
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,370
Let's go…

160
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,900
This is Kilimanjaro from Tanzania… try it.

161
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,260
This is Double A Snow Top from Tanzania.

162
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,340
I need to study… hold on.

163
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,380
Then let's study together.

164
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,000
Ssulja!

165
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,740
Ssulja, Ssulja! How have you been?

166
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,540
Let's do some vocal training.

167
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,340
You must have come here very often;
even Terry knows who you are.

168
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,600
Ya, how many times did you come
to Han Sung Hyung's house?

169
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,670
About… 120 times?

170
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,150
No, 130 times.

171
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,400
What? Are you for real?

172
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,310
Yes.

173
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,120
Yes?!

174
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,440
This was the area I was in charge
of… for milk delivery.

175
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,040
Aish… you get jealous so easily.

176
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,440
Ya, who says I'm jealous?

177
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,400
You little rascal!

178
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,310
You're male aren't you?!

179
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,400
How dare you wag your tail at Eun Chan!

180
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,330
Why are you asking me to do this?

181
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,420
This should be done by a guy.

182
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,730
Aiyoo… look at that kid.
He's eyeing the meat again.

183
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,920
You like her that much?

184
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,250
You haven't stopped smiling
since you got here.

185
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:48,990
It's a lucky thing that Han
Yoo Ju is not my woman.

186
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,820
Where in the world did you go?

187
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,750
Stop upsetting Han Sung Hyung.

188
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,620
And stop packing your things and leaving.

189
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,920
Even I'm sick of it.

190
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,880
Sick of it?

191
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,030
Yah, you've changed.

192
00:08:59,090 --> 00:08:59,930
Yep, I have changed.

193
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,660
It's good, that you've
become brighter, happier.

194
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,130
You're ecstatic that I've
left you, aren't you?

195
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,400
Part of me is a little sad,
but I'm happy too.

196
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,950
But honestly, I wasn't
"yours" a long time ago.

197
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,500
You just kept thinking that I was.

198
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,580
If you had really loved me,

199
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,700
you wouldn't have bothered
about Han Sung and told me straight.

200
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,390
But you never told me about how you felt.

201
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,210
But for Eun Chan,
you fell in love with her

202
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,550
even though you thought
she was a guy? Right?

203
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,170
To you, I was just a…

204
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,210
Habit?

205
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,840
Right. A habit without consequence.

206
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,670
Your feelings for me had
gone a long time ago,

207
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,650
so I was, just like you said, a habit.

208
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,540
You're really slow in that way.

209
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,610
Just like a scarecrow that
only looks in one direction.

210
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,210
You should be very grateful to Eun Chan.

211
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,260
She brought a scarecrow to life.

212
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,420
You're a really good woman.

213
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,640
Honestly, I don't think
I'm a very good woman.

214
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,030
Even if I'm quite pretty.

215
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:00,010
Ooh, you're pretty full of yourself.

216
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,000
You're not pretty anymore.

217
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,860
Ya, Choi Han Kyul… you're too much!

218
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,960
Put the knife down.

219
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,860
Ahjusshi, it's good to see you smiling.

220
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,800
You look good too.

221
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,050
Is Han Kyul being good to you?

222
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,860
Good? He keeps playing around.

223
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,560
I tell him to stop,
then he does it even more.

224
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,520
I don't know how many times we'll quarrel
before he goes back to America.

225
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,440
Han Kyul is really going back to America?
When?

226
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,020
He's got about 20 days left here.

227
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,220
He promised to manage
the store for 3 months.

228
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,710
Ya, I think Choi Han Kyul
can't bear to leave…

229
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,290
Could he bear to leave you here?

230
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,750
What if someone snatches you away?

231
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,190
That's why I've been considering if I
should set my heart on someone else.

232
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,370
What music should we listen to?

233
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,500
Go pick from the CDs down there.

234
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,410
Okay.

235
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,120
Hey, come help me with this.

236
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:49,960
Okay…

237
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,280
It's okay.

238
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,720
You look good.

239
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,160
You too.

240
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,600
What were you doing up here?

241
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,410
To a good life! And no more fights!

242
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,520
No fights!

243
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,140
What should I do?

244
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,010
I'm pitiful, aren't I?

245
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,300
No more fights!

246
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,230
She's so cute.

247
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,710
She's cute, isn't she?

248
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:35,980
But…

249
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,100
How did you know?

250
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,260
Don't laugh.

251
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,190
You kept me out and
were all on the same side.

252
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,480
You'd better not bring up the "Go Eun
Chan Fraud Case" in front of me.

253
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,580
What do you mean by "fraud"?

254
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,630
Well, "fraud" is better
than "betrayal", isn't it?

255
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:55,480
Fraud or betrayal…
I'm more afraid of betrayal.

256
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,470
What about you?

257
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,320
Was I the only one who betrayed someone?

258
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,670
Wow, this girl is really tough.

259
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,470
Should we start calculating from the start?

260
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,480
It's appearing again… that look.

261
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,690
"I'm the victim…"

262
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,880
"I cared about you…"

263
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:10,840
"I'm so kind…"

264
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,930
That look that's full of arrogance.

265
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:16,420
Eun Chan, don't you hate that
look that Han Sung has?

266
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:19,300
He thinks he's always the
good guy, and I'm the sinner.

267
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,800
That look that makes you feel… 2% guilty?

268
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,190
I'm… not very sure about that.

269
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,630
Hey, I didn't want to
bring this up, but you…

270
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,300
What? You want to talk about DK again?

271
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,550
Aren't you tired of it?

272
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,130
You're a guy, you should have a
bigger heart.

273
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,690
If you've got such a big heart, why couldn't
you stand me wavering for just a moment?

274
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,910
And is DK a medal or something?

275
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,680
You keep bringing him up, DK… DK…

276
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,220
Stop talking about him in front of me.

277
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,950
It makes me angry.

278
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,100
Is that because you feel inferior to him?

279
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,850
You are such a joke.

280
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,740
Aigoo… really.

281
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,310
Your jokes aren't funny at all.

282
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,270
Can't you see the kid is terrified?

283
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,400
Chan-ah… don't be afraid, eat more.

284
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,970
They've been together for too long,
and have lost their "taste".

285
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:58,840
Yah, Choi Han Kyul.

286
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,460
You be careful of what you say too.

287
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,480
If you keep calling
her "Han Yoo Ju" or "Honey",

288
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,700
I'll get angry too.

289
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,320
Then you shouldn't call Eun
Chan "little kid" too,

290
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,390
that upsets me too.

291
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,680
Yah, you too, stop calling him "mister".

292
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,800
I get upset too.

293
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,130
No more fights!

294
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,670
No more fights!

295
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:18,670
Oh, that's right.

296
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,980
Your mom called today.

297
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,100
My mom?

298
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,520
Yep, your mom.

299
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,640
It sounds like she'll be coming over soon?

300
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,080
Why don't we take some
time and go over to visit her?

301
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,310
Okay.

302
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,270
Man, it's hot.

303
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,660
What, why?

304
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,660
Why, what? What?

305
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,320
Eun Chan, do you want more to drink?

306
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,250
Why are you giving her more wine to drink?

307
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:53,570
Why? She's likes it.

308
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,930
She's gorgeous, isn't she?

309
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,020
Very gorgeous.

310
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,990
You abandoned your parents
and siblings and came here,

311
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,670
for a married woman with a child?

312
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,560
Just for one woman?

313
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,380
Wow, you really are
great at messing things up.

314
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:31,260
She was working at my dad's waffle shop.

315
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:35,210
Her Japanese wasn't great,
but she worked really hard.

316
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,010
She was really pretty.

317
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,370
I hid my feelings for three years

318
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,390
before I confessed and told her I loved her.

319
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,950
But why did you come to Korea?

320
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,310
There was one night that it snowed heavily.

321
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,490
Someone knocked on the door.

322
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,780
I went outside when I heard the knocking.

323
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,300
It was her, covered in blood.

324
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,510
Squatting outside, barefoot.

325
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,470
She'd been beat up by her drunk husband.

326
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,680
She couldn't even cry.

327
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,250
Just stayed there, shivering.

328
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,590
I went mad.

329
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,380
And just then, her husband appeared,
drunk out of his mind.

330
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,710
So you beat up the guy,
and escaped here?

331
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,700
Did you stab him, or use
a rock to smash his head in?

332
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:28,080
He broke three of my ribs, and six teeth.

333
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,050
It was the first time in my life
I got whacked up so badly.

334
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,980
You didn't fight back?

335
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,790
You rascal, you stood there
and let him hit you?

336
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,590
If I hit him, she would have an
even tougher time in the future.

337
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:44,220
You mean she came here
to escape from her husband?

338
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,560
And you came here to find her?

339
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,580
You knew each other for three years,

340
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,140
but were only in a
relationship for two months?

341
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,520
And you've spent
three years looking for her?

342
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,850
There's more to you than expected.

343
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,940
But… what if she doesn't like you?

344
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:00,990
What will you do then?

345
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,060
I'm satisfied if I can see
that she's happy… do you understand?

346
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:10,620
In my life, I will
never do that for a woman.

347
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,080
If she wants to break up, I'll
agree and that's the end.

348
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,480
And if she says she wants to hook
up, we'll just start dating.

349
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,650
You're really the sentimental sort.

350
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,840
You're envious, aren't you?

351
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,690
Playboys have always been
envious of a couple

352
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,050
that's been together for a long time.

353
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:30,530
Words like "long-lasting," "old,"

354
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:34,970
or "long into the future"...
I can't stand them.

355
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,820
But you like older women, don't you?

356
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:44,160
I though they were having a real fight.

357
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,930
But then they started laughing.

358
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,090
Will we have nine
years together, like them?

359
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,630
Why? Do you want to
break up with me after a year?

360
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,480
If you're going to do that,
we should break up now.

361
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,880
Oh… I said the same thing to Eun Sae.

362
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,900
Wow. But…
where does Grandmother stay?

363
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,140
You said she stayed nearby when we were
delivering the coffee beans the other day.

364
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,510
Why are you asking?

365
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:08,480
It's just… I pass by this
place so often making deliveries.

366
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,540
When I pass by your house,

367
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:15,130
I'd like to think, "oh, this is a
house that Sajangnim has lived in."

368
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,210
Do you want to come
to my house for a visit?

369
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,210
Why do you look so surprised?

370
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,380
Can I… really go?

371
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,020
Why can't you? Just treat it
like you're going to a friend's house.

372
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,270
Nah, it might cause too much trouble.

373
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,780
No, it won't! I'd like to go, just once.

374
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:35,830
When can we go?

375
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,010
What would you go there for?

376
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,440
Yoo Ju, what're you doing?

377
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,100
- I'll leave first…
- Yeah, I'm coming out.

378
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,380
You haven't sent it out yet?
What are you doing?

379
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,350
I gave you instructions
ages ago. Until now…

380
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,270
Forget it, I'll do it myself.

381
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:20,440
Don't ever do this again… how
many times has it been already?

382
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,760
You'd better get your act together.

383
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,390
Oh whatever. Get to the studio
quickly. I'm hanging up.

384
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,820
Who has the guts to make
our Han Sung angry?

385
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,720
The guy is a joke, to have the
guts to anger our Han Sung.

386
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:30,680
What's his address?

387
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,900
What's his name?

388
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,750
What in the world…
what's wrong with you?

389
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,910
Did I sound like Eun Chan?

390
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,020
Haha… do you envy Eun Chan?

391
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,960
Yeah. I'm a little envious.

392
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:49,060
When I see her squabble with
Han Kyul, I feel a little tired too.

393
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,000
Well, they're still a young couple. I can't
even remember how we spent that time?

394
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,480
I'm grateful that we've
gotten through that time.

395
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,760
Calculating who called
first the most times, waiting,

396
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,560
getting angry because of one
word wrong, crying and quarrelling…

397
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,630
yearning to find out how he felt about me.

398
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,320
I'm actually a little envious of them.
It feels so fresh, doesn't it?

399
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:12,100
What? We're not fresh?

400
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,750
I've been feeling like I'm at the
start of a new relationship, all excited.

401
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,410
Looks like you don't feel the same way.

402
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,640
I'll go get the car first, come out soon.

403
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,940
He's cheating on me? That Hwang fool?

404
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,510
Ya, I'm sure he regrets his actions.

405
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,900
Just... don't meet him today.

406
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,760
He's such a joke.

407
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,190
Him? Cheating on me?

408
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:42,120
Well, Min Yeop has
always been pretty innocent.

409
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,050
Help me pass a message to Hwang fool -

410
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,950
from now on, he's been fired from my life.

411
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,830
What are you talking about?!

412
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,360
Why don't you spend
more time thinking it over?!

413
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,670
Ai, this kid.

414
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,040
What is she throwing a tantrum about?

415
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,330
It's nothing. Mom, where're you going?

416
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,110
Porridge?

417
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:09,040
Well, that… Mr. Ku hasn't
opened his shop for a couple of days.

418
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,300
I think he's sick.

419
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,220
Since we're all living in
the same neighborhood…

420
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,570
You're really doing this
because it's neighborly?

421
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,490
It's a little stingy
just to bring porridge over.

422
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:18,770
Why don't you bring some fruits over too?

423
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,910
No, there's no need.

424
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,030
Mr. Ku is too stingy
to buy fruits for himself.

425
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,790
Hold on, I'll pack some for you.

426
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,270
Eat, why aren't you eating?

427
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,720
Buddha gave up everything after eating

428
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:40,090
the milk porridge that you made for him.

429
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:46,630
And what else… Jesus also
drank the wine and ate the bread…

430
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,200
You are such a nuisance.

431
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,760
Can you just eat?

432
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,440
What kind of man are you,
who talks so much?

433
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,610
What are you spending
the money that you earn on?

434
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,470
If you're hungry, eat.

435
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,300
If you're sick, go to the hospital.

436
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,160
Spend it where you should spend it.

437
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,400
Do you want to bring it
to your grave after you die?

438
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:09,960
Noonim, when I was sick,
I gave it a lot of thought.

439
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,240
What?

440
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:16,640
I will set my heart that
has been yearning for you in order.

441
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:19,150
I've thought about it carefully.

442
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,700
You must have had a lot
of trouble because of me.

443
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,420
It suddenly came to me so clearly.

444
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,350
You don't like men who talk a lot,

445
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,780
but I would keep talking and
talking whenever we met.

446
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:34,080
I'd feel the pinch
just over a little money.

447
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:38,340
Bugging you every single
day to go out with me,

448
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,640
I didn't act like a man.

449
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,970
It has been hard on you.

450
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:49,470
I think I would find a
man like me such a pain too.

451
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,700
I'm so sorry for this time.

452
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,580
What do you have to apologise for?

453
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:05,280
Whatever it is, it's good that
you've cooled down about things.

454
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,310
Careful, you'll choke on
the porridge! Slowly!

455
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,230
And…

456
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:22,130
I don't really like men who
don't have a lot to say.

457
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:25,930
What?

458
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,640
What do you mean?

459
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,640
Just like what I said.

460
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,340
I don't think very much of men
who don't have much to say.

461
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,540
Aiyoo… this has to be washed.
It's a little damp.

462
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:47,610
Short legs goes to Jeju island,
Choi Han Kyul goes to New York.

463
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,020
Please take care of my lover.

464
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,710
When it's time, please return
him to the motherland. Okay?

465
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,750
Aja!

466
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,640
Chan!

467
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,150
Let's go.

468
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,940
We're only left with those
at Seocho-Dong right?

469
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:05,810
Right.

470
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,220
Oh my, look at that sweat. You're all wet.

471
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,460
This isn't good. I'd better go
back home and wash up.

472
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,100
Okay.

473
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,300
- That's okay right?
- Yes.

474
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,020
Grandmother's house is nearby.

475
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,270
What?

476
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:18,740
Why are you so shocked?

477
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,640
You said you wanted to go.

478
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,850
We'll reach there in less than 5 minutes.

479
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,640
Quick, get in the car.

480
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,360
But… what do we do if Grandmother gets a shock?

481
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,830
She's always thought that I was a guy.

482
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:33,490
Well, you never really said that
you were male, so it's okay.

483
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,120
Even then...

484
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,540
I would have changed clothes
if I'd known we were going there.

485
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,990
Clothes?

486
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,110
Don't you wear
T-shirts and jeans all the time?

487
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,300
Aish… really. Do you have
to say such things?

488
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,750
Do you have a knife hidden in your mouth?

489
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,140
You say something hurtful every
time you open your mouth.

490
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,000
I hate it so much I could die.

491
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,350
Aww… don't die.

492
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:02,510
What's up with you?

493
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,810
You're 20 minutes late!

494
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:05,570
Let's go.

495
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,860
I'm hungry.
Let's eat before we go.

496
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,140
I'm not hungry.

497
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,510
Let's just walk around for a while.

498
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:11,790
But I've…

499
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,910
You're not hungry?

500
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,630
I've gotta finish lunch and
rush back to the studio.

501
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:26,430
Wow, that's so pretty. Let's
go in to take a look.

502
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,860
Why?

503
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:29,570
Hold on…

504
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:31,530
You go in first.

505
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:37,220
Yeah? Hyung, I'm gonna take
another 30 minutes.

506
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,670
I'll call to ask the movie
company directly.

507
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,060
Yeah… okay.

508
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,260
[We're going to have a baby.]

509
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,660
We…

510
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,740
are going to have a baby.

511
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,700
What?

512
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,080
Really?

513
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,440
Shh, he's sleeping.

514
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,080
Really?

515
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:53,060
Oh, Grandmother, this is a
drip-coffee maker right?

516
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:54,320
Be careful you don't break that.

517
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,060
Can you just put that down?

518
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,780
I can't focus when you're
running around, just sit down.

519
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,710
But how did you know
that was a drip-coffee maker?

520
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,280
Grandmother, I know a lot of things.

521
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:08,270
I'm the best coffee maker in Coffee
Prince, apart from Manager Hong.

522
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:13,400
If your coffee is the best,
the others must really be bad.

523
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,220
With so many people who're just so-so,

524
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,310
how good could you be?

525
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,870
Grandmother, you're really underestimating us.

526
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:22,550
I'm working very hard
for my barista examination.

527
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,570
Should I make you
some coffee? Just hold on.

528
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,960
Forget it, I don't drink coffee anymore.

529
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,340
Grandmother, did you know this?

530
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:34,110
If you put an egg in your coffee,
it isn't just nutritious,

531
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,550
but it can protect your dietary tract too.

532
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,300
I learnt this yesterday.

533
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,580
What kind of coffee is that?

534
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:41,990
Isn't Ginger tea even better?

535
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,610
No… why don't you try some?

536
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,030
I'll make it for you.

537
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,720
Ai… aigoo, that itches.

538
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:49,190
How could a boy's hands be so…

539
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,880
Oh my, you look so pretty.

540
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:57,510
When I bought it, I thought
it was made just for you, my son.

541
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,410
I'm a natural clotheshorse.

542
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,830
Eun Chan is in your room,

543
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:04,610
why don't you go in?

544
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,160
I'll bring this to you.

545
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:17,840
Why are you handling the memorial
by yourself? It's so tiring.

546
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:20,910
She's the person who gave
birth to you. How could I not bother?

547
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:25,870
I heard what Auntie said during the memorial.

548
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,760
I wanted to pay my respects to her.

549
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,170
But now that I know the truth,
I can't bear to do it.

550
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,850
Seeing you kneel and pay your
respects to her, I feel so sorry.

551
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,670
So you feel that way?

552
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,240
My son is so caring.

553
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,540
You should pay your
respects to her the next time.

554
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,240
I'm okay with it.

555
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:57,110
I'm boasting about how
well I've brought you up.

556
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,100
So cute!

557
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,740
Omo… he looks exactly the same.

558
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,730
He looks so smart.

559
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:18,280
Wow, he's really so cute!

560
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,300
What are you doing?

561
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,410
Why do you look so shocked?

562
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,100
You must have been a really bad
student when you were younger.

563
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,650
I don't see any awards around.

564
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,210
That's so old-fashioned.

565
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:33,850
Come outside and eat some fruits.

566
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,650
Can you give this to me?

567
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,910
What do you want it for?

568
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,840
It's nothing.

569
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,250
Although it's not as good as looking
at the real person, it's still cute.

570
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:48,800
Look at the tummy… so cute.

571
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,420
Why'd you do that?

572
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,980
You smell good.

573
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,580
It's nice to see pictures
from your childhood.

574
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:15,780
Grandmother must be getting bored.

575
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,700
Let's go outside.

576
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,880
All the adults are at home,

577
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,670
but my girlfriend and I
are alone in the room…

578
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,430
This feels so exciting.

579
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,040
And so?

580
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,980
Why are you hiding?

581
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,160
Come over here.

582
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,320
Come over… over here.

583
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,370
What are you doing?

584
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,930
Careful you don't fall down.

585
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,470
Wah… it feels great that we're alone too.

586
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,800
Let's stay here for another hour.

587
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,940
This feels exciting.

588
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:04,200
Don't worry,
I'm not going to eat you up.

589
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,760
You…

590
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,090
Man, it's hot.

591
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,800
Are you crazy?

592
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,610
You want me to play cards with you again?

593
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:23,270
You just lost a little money the last time,

594
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,140
and kept asking for it back.

595
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,930
And you want to play again?

596
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,680
But you were cheating at the
game with the Manager.

597
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,710
Even so, how dare you answer back to me?

598
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,260
Look at how you're peeling this?

599
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,780
I knew this would happen when you
said you wanted to peel the fruits.

600
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,130
Look, you've peeled off half the apple!

601
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,220
What do you mean half?

602
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,360
Eat this.

603
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,350
No way.

604
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:45,880
Eat it, eat it.

605
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,450
I don't want to!

606
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,360
Playing a fool.

607
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:50,830
If people didn't know any better,
they'd think you were a couple.

608
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,540
You're a boy,
why are you picking up a knife?

609
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,510
Just leave it there, I'll do it.

610
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,680
When you get married,
I'm sure your wife will love you lots.

611
00:30:58,970 --> 00:30:59,970
She's a girl, mom.

612
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,070
Rubbish.
The kind of jokes you play…

613
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:08,720
Why do you always play these
jokes that make no sense?

614
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:12,300
How could you say that a boy is a girl?

615
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:17,150
Grandmother, it's true that I'm a girl.

616
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,790
Good heavens, what's going on?

617
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:25,260
Didn't you say you only
hired males in the shop?

618
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,270
If you were a girl,
why didn't you say so in the first place?

619
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,600
First you're a boy, then you're a girl.

620
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,880
Are you playing a fool with us?

621
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,750
I didn't mean to lie to everyone.

622
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,610
You must be shocked.
I'm sorry, Grandmother.

623
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,490
Did you know this from the start?

624
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:48,060
Oh, of course.
She's an employee that I hired, after all.

625
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,990
Ai… why are you eating the apple skin?
Don't eat that.

626
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,790
Why are you snatching my food away?

627
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,190
Hurry, spit it out. Spit…

628
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:06,630
It's such a waste to throw it away.

629
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,780
Spit it…

630
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,990
Really, why do you have to make
people say things twice?

631
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:12,760
I really don't get you.

632
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,030
When did I do that?

633
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,060
Hurry, eat this.

634
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,390
You two… what are you doing?

635
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:22,310
Grandmother, why do you look so serious?
Relax.

636
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:25,060
At first, I couldn't figure her out.

637
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,380
But after looking at her over time,

638
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,370
I've found that she's cute,

639
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,080
has a nice personality,
and is really lovable.

640
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,400
She likes to cry,
and throws little tantrums.

641
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:34,430
When did I do that?

642
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,910
You're the one who throws the tantrums.

643
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,360
You two… are you dating?

644
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,340
You're behaving really strangely.

645
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,530
Your eyes seem to be talking to each other.

646
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:45,450
Are you dating?

647
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,880
Grandmother, your eyes are really sharp.

648
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:56,270
You're right.

649
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,700
We are dating.

650
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,490
I like Go Eun Chan.

651
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,240
You rascal, do you have any brains?

652
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,030
How could you like this thing,

653
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,540
that doesn't look like a guy, or a girl?

654
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:12,540
You must have lost your sight.

655
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,440
You didn't like the girls that we spent

656
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,010
so much effort picking out for you.

657
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,810
But the girl you bring home is this…
unbelievable creature?!

658
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:20,590
Grandmother.

659
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,360
You, tell me the truth.

660
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:26,260
You started calling our Han Kyul
your brother from the start,

661
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,420
just to get close to him, didn't you?

662
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,790
Grandmother, what are you talking about?

663
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:33,800
Who tried to get close to me on purpose?

664
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,380
This isn't an interrogation like in the 70s.

665
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,740
I'm the one who likes her,
why are you questioning the kid?

666
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:38,640
You!

667
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,500
Get this thing out of my sight at once!

668
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,140
Grandmother! What do you mean by "thing"?!

669
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,130
How could you call a person a thing,
no matter how angry you are?!

670
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,000
Isn't what you're saying too much?!

671
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,940
What do you mean too much, you rascal?!

672
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,700
Are all the women in the world extinct?!

673
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:55,100
If you want to date a girl like her,

674
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,360
pack your bags and
go back to America right now.

675
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,550
I might not even go to America.

676
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:02,140
I'll come again.

677
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:03,990
Let's go.

678
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,280
Goodbye.

679
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:11,070
I tried to hard to ask you to stay,
but you insisted on leaving.

680
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:15,040
Now you're giving up going
to America just for a girl?!

681
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,660
You'd better break up with that girl right now!

682
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,310
Ah, really.

683
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:23,460
These elders really get on my nerves.

684
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,990
Why is she such a stick-in-the-mud?

685
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:25,800
What is this?

686
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,410
It's my fault for looking like this.

687
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,460
Aish… really.

688
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,560
Aish, I really…

689
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,890
So what does a person
have to look like to be a girl?

690
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,930
Long hair, a soft blouse.

691
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,210
A flowing skirt… something like that.

692
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,400
But there are girls like this,
and girls like that.

693
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:57,420
You were born this way,
what can you do?

694
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,670
I've already said it's fine with me.

695
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,730
What is she unhappy about?

696
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,870
Aish, this just spoils my mood.

697
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,860
My mood is spoilt as well.

698
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:09,480
Why did I have to follow you?
Now I got a scolding too.

699
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,440
That person's temper is really bad.

700
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,370
It's nothing to be angry about,

701
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,510
but he blew his top and
even shouted at Grandmother.

702
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,530
If it were you, wouldn't you scream?!

703
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:23,050
To call a person a thing…
did that make you happy?!

704
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:25,200
If your mum called me a thing in your face,
would you be okay with it?!

705
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,060
Would you still laugh and smile?

706
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,430
But you still shouldn't have shouted.

707
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:31,060
Mothers and grandmothers
have always been like that.

708
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:31,950
Why?

709
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,220
Because "my son is always the best."

710
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,670
Why do you think there are always problems
between mothers and daughters-in-law?

711
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:37,290
You just don't know enough.

712
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,010
Oh, you must be so smart.

713
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,040
So you're not upset at all, are you?

714
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,240
So why did you say you were in a bad mood?

715
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,350
Honestly, she did go a little overboard.

716
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:51,650
You were okay,
but grandmother was a little too much.

717
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,700
Is it because she's a career woman?

718
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:54,740
Maybe a little.

719
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,290
She's mean.

720
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:59,070
No matter what,
how could you say she was downright mean?

721
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,850
No matter how angry you were,

722
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,270
how could you say you
would't be going to America?

723
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:05,670
You're definitely going,
but you hurt Grandmother like that.

724
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,660
I didn't say it because I was angry.

725
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,680
I really am rethinking my decision.

726
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,700
What are you rethinking?

727
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,200
Whether I should go or not.

728
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,360
Isn't that something that's been decided?

729
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,890
You're thinking of not going because of me?

730
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:21,050
You think I'd give up my dream,
just because of a girl?

731
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,290
Then… while you're thinking,
give me a piggyback ride.

732
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:29,480
What?

733
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:32,100
Didn't I piggyback you the other time?

734
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,940
I carried you back home,
and to the Taekwondo hall.

735
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,830
You're already so heavy,
and drunk on top of that.

736
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:37,960
You just lay there.

737
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,400
Oh, my back. My back…

738
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,650
I sprained my back that day,
and it still hurts now.

739
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,130
That's not all.
You always hit my head,

740
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,360
put me in a headlock,
twisting my neck around.

741
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,510
Bringing everything up one by one is difficult,
I don't even remember some things.

742
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:51,160
So what do you want me to do?

743
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,550
If you give me a piggyback ride,
I won't catch and eat you up.

744
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:57,700
Fine fine, a piggyback ride,
is it, you rascal?

745
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,660
Stop calling me a rascal!

746
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,970
Don't call me "Hey you!" all the time.
It makes me feel bad. Hey you!

747
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,950
This punk.

748
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,050
Punk makes me feel bad too.
You punk!

749
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:07,330
Oh you jerk...

750
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,610
Oh hurry up and get on, you jerk.

751
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:25,940
I'm carrying you because I don't want

752
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,300
you to be hurt by what Grandmother said.

753
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,380
I got over that a long time ago.

754
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,190
Then get down.

755
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,650
Ah… a little while longer.

756
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:43,310
Grandmother has liked me from the start.

757
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,800
I'm sure she'll grow to like me again in time.

758
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,700
But actually, liking me as a boy,

759
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:54,370
isn't anything like liking me as
her granddaughter-in-law, right?

760
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,250
Ouch, that hurts.

761
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,590
Are you okay?

762
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,150
How heavy are you?

763
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,590
Why are you so heavy?

764
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,030
I'm not heavy!

765
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:23,480
How could you laugh at something like this?

766
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,940
He can't stop smiling when he looks at her.

767
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,570
He laughs no matter what she says.

768
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,280
When he's talking to her,
it's like he's lost his soul,

769
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,250
and his eyes shine.

770
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:32,680
My son…

771
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,130
It's not like there aren't
nice girls on this earth.

772
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:35,450
Why does he have to
like someone like her?

773
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:37,480
You haven't seen her, that's why.

774
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,730
If you met her,
you wouldn't be able to

775
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,470
figure out whether
she was a boy or a girl.

776
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,160
And what does he mean by "maybe"
he's not going back to New York?

777
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,280
If he says he's not going because

778
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,380
something's happened with the girl,

779
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,580
what do we do?

780
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,370
Hubby…

781
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,390
Just wait and see.

782
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:56,680
He's not someone to make a
hasty decision because of a girl.

783
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,690
You're his parents, how could
you not understand Han Kyul?

784
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,920
He's not someone who brings
girls back home on a whim.

785
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,300
He's someone who didn't even bring any

786
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,700
friends home when he was studying.

787
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,400
Han Kyul's mother,
help me call Han Kyul.

788
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,200
Okay.

789
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,030
How do you know she's not
after your money?

790
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,190
In my opinion,

791
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,460
she's tops in seducing people.

792
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:28,080
Grandmother, what kind of tricks
would a 24-year-old girl have?

793
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:30,960
And am I someone who's easily taken in?

794
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:33,190
All she has to do is blink,
and I know what she's thinking about.

795
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:35,260
If she's really trying to seduce me,
or anything else.

796
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:37,300
She doesn't know how to do
anything like that.

797
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,920
I'd be happy if she knew how!

798
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,710
Aiyoo… you idiot who's lost his head.

799
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,580
You've been seduced by
a fox and lost your soul.

800
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,840
You don't even know what
direction you're headed.

801
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,870
Mother, ask him if he's really not
going to New York because of her.

802
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,820
And what do you mean by
you're not going to New York?

803
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,400
You're not going because of that

804
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,400
rascal called Eun Chan or Go Chan… right?

805
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:56,250
When did I say that I wasn't going back?

806
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,220
I said there might be a chance
that I'm not going back.

807
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,490
Isn't that the same thing?

808
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:00,280
How dare you play these
word games with me.

809
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,370
Fine, fine, I'll go to New York.

810
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,750
That's what you're wishing for right,
Grandmother?

811
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:06,280
I'll go, so stop worrying and go to bed.

812
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,070
Goodnight.

813
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:11,310
Ah… these old people.

814
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,710
I should have worn
something like this to meet them.

815
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,040
Grandmother, Mrs. Choi, please have some tea.

816
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,400
Well, that's cute.

817
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,760
Brave.

818
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:41,330
Brave.

819
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:43,780
Down to earth.

820
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,050
Healthy.

821
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:05,330
The appointment of Mr. Choi
as a senior Blog designer.

822
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,200
Chatting online is good enough?

823
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,560
Go Eun Chan, you are so cool
it freezes my heart.

824
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,870
How could you have put your
feelings in order so quickly?

825
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,740
Then should I clutch my head and cry?

826
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,230
Didn't you say I shouldn't
try to hold him back?

827
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,470
Now that I've controlled my feelings,

828
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,950
you tell me I've done it too quickly?

829
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,440
Why? That's so irritating.

830
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,010
I only said that because I was worried.

831
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,870
What if… Hyung has another woman….

832
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,710
The women in New York
all have amazing figures.

833
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:01,150
They're all so attractive you could die,
like super models.

834
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:05,850
Plastic surgery is really advanced
these days,

835
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,310
you should get something done.

836
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,140
If people didn't know better,

837
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,400
they'd think your head was on backwards.

838
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:12,950
They'd think your chest was your back!

839
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:15,650
And what in the world is that hairstyle?

840
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,400
Do you go to the same barber
as Manager Hong?

841
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,660
And put something on your face, please.

842
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,360
Has your body been itching these days?

843
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,060
Huh?

844
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,620
Let's give you some exercise to
loosen those bones.

845
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:29,680
Oh, look at you!

846
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,600
Oh boy, you're so strong.

847
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:34,170
What are you doing, are you a girl?

848
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,260
Oh, Grandmother, Mrs. Choi, hello.

849
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,190
You're here?

850
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:40,530
Mother, I think it's best if we go.

851
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:42,120
We don't know how things will turn out.

852
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:44,690
It's best not to come looking for trouble.

853
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:47,010
Han Kyul will get upset if he finds out.

854
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:48,800
Well done, a mother making decisions,

855
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,170
because she's worried
her son will get angry.

856
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,610
You.

857
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,480
I want to talk to you.

858
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:02,320
It looks like franchising this
might be a good idea.

859
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,960
The materials you've given me are
even better.

860
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,790
I'm going to stay here, Father.

861
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,060
Honestly, compared to working
alone on blog designs,

862
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:14,600
I'm finding working with everyone in
the coffee shop more interesting.

863
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:19,940
Grandmother and mother
are hoping that I stay too.

864
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:21,520
It's time for me to be filial.

865
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,670
I hear you brought a girl home last night.

866
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:29,890
She's a good kid.

867
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:33,760
Is that a nose, or an eye?

868
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,750
Yoo Ju, come over here.

869
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,330
Is this an arm or a leg?

870
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,040
Come over here.

871
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,700
It's just 5cm long, and you're trying
to find eyes, a nose and a mouth?

872
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:48,970
If you use your heart to look, you'll see it.

873
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:52,640
Look here, do you see a nose?

874
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,270
His nose looks high…
that's definitely like me.

875
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:00,260
His forehead is broad…
that's like me too.

876
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,140
Short hands and legs…
that's like me too.

877
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,620
Haha, that makes me so happy.

878
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,000
You're so happy about this?

879
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:11,740
Honestly, I'm not just happy.

880
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,630
I'm grateful for this present from God.

881
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,890
What should I say…

882
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:20,340
There's a weight of responsibility
pressing down here.

883
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:21,940
It feels… funny.

884
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:23,450
What about you?

885
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,650
I'm both amazed...

886
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,540
And terrified that there's a new life
inside of me.

887
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:31,550
You're nervous, aren't you?

888
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:37,230
That means, you're happy too, right?

889
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,830
Honestly, I worried a lot about this.

890
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:45,460
To give birth to a life,

891
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,590
to be responsible for a lifetime…

892
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:48,900
I'm really scared.

893
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:55,400
But I thought, "can I give up this new life?"

894
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:57,550
I found I couldn't.

895
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,200
I didn't want to do that.

896
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,740
Ah, careful, careful.

897
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:04,590
I'm sorry, we've got to be careful from now.

898
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:05,720
Do you want a drink?

899
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,040
No.

900
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:10,340
Han Yoo Ju,

901
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,300
thanks for making me a dad.

902
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:16,200
Thank you too.

903
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,420
Should we get married?

904
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:21,700
Well,

905
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:24,580
we could bring up the child without
getting married.

906
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,700
When our kid grows up and asks me,

907
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:35,480
"Why do mummy and daddy live apart?"

908
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:36,800
What should we tell him?

909
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:40,630
"3 days in mmmy's house,
3 days in daddy's…

910
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:41,940
what is this?"

911
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:43,450
What do we do then?

912
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:48,080
What do you think we should say?

913
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:49,680
Of course I would only have one answer.

914
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,770
"Go ask your mother, I have no idea."

915
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:56,140
Wah… how could you pass me a
question like that?

916
00:45:57,530 --> 00:45:58,780
But that's the truth.

917
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,210
What?

918
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,060
What I said was the truth!

919
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,530
What? What? Isn't it?

920
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,740
The "feel" in that room isn't good.

921
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:19,530
What does the Grandmother want
to talk to Eun Chan about?

922
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,200
Did he bring her home
to meet them so quickly?

923
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,180
Why do parents bother
about so many things?

924
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:24,810
Whether in Japan, or here?

925
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,490
It's such a pain.

926
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:32,700
Eun Chan looks like
she's going to get scolded.

927
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:35,400
But why is she smiling?

928
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,420
That's right, someone with such a
"pure" soul could never figure this out.

929
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,910
I'm going to ask you straight out.

930
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,530
How far have you gone in this relationship?

931
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,800
That… I don't know what you mean by that?

932
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,050
What do you mean you don't understand?

933
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,950
I'm asking if you've promised to get married.

934
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:55,950
Marriage?

935
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:02,100
You're worried about that?

936
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:04,540
Grandmother, Han Kyul's mother,
please don't worry.

937
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:07,450
I haven't even dreamt about getting married.

938
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:08,620
Not even a dream?

939
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,390
If you're not planning to get married,

940
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:11,370
why are you seeing each other?

941
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:12,890
We're just dating.

942
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:15,910
We haven't been seeing each
other for very long.

943
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,780
And I'm only 24, talking about
marriage is a little…

944
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:21,940
I will only consider marriage
when I'm about 30.

945
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:22,690
What? 30?

946
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:26,210
You really want to destroy a
person's future, don't you?

947
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:28,680
Do you know how old Han Kyul is now?

948
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,790
From 24 to 30, that's…
Han Kyul would be 35.

949
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:37,660
That makes this even worse.

950
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:38,730
Mother, that…

951
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:40,050
Mother? Who are you calling "mother"?

952
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:43,140
You're doing this because of money?

953
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,100
Your family isn't doing well,

954
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:47,220
that's why you want to marry a rich man.

955
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,380
That's what you're thinking, right?

956
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:53,790
Han Kyul's heart is soft, and
he's more sentimental than he looks.

957
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:55,950
He's taken you in because he pities you.

958
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,400
He's being emotional.

959
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:01,000
He's even giving up his
dream of going to America.

960
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,060
It's better if you end things now.

961
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,070
If you drag things out,
both of you will feel worse.

962
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,610
How much do you want?

963
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,130
Mother, that's a little…

964
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:17,230
Grandmother, I'd like to have lots of money.

965
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:21,030
But I wouldn't be as big a fool
as to marry for money.

966
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,510
And although I do like the Manager,

967
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:28,010
if our feelings change,
we could still break up.

968
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:29,700
There's a chance you could break up?

969
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:33,640
How in the world could Han Kyul
like a thing like you?

970
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,270
Oh, my head.

971
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:37,040
Mother, are you okay?

972
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,470
You. Tell me this.

973
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:40,340
Are kids all like you these days?

974
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:42,730
Is getting together and breaking up so easy?

975
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,680
It's not easy.

976
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:47,510
But if the Manager goes to America,

977
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:48,670
we wouldn't be able to see
each other for a long time.

978
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:50,990
Who knows what could happen in that time?

979
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:52,080
That's what I'm trying to say.

980
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,130
Right now, I'd rather die than break up.

981
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:03,230
But his Grandmother and
mother want us to break up.

982
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:06,040
But my heart hasn't changed,
how could I break up?

983
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,390
Right now, there's no way I could do that.

984
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:10,500
I can't do that.

985
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:11,400
I can't do that too.

986
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:14,310
You go inside.

987
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:16,200
What do you mean go inside?

988
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,480
I haven't finished talking.

989
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:20,260
Grandmother, I should hear what
you have to say to her too.

990
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,100
Don't let me hear what happened
through Eun Chan, just tell me straight.

991
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:25,360
Look here,
you're trying to protect her already?

992
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,420
Grandmother, this is my place of work.

993
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:28,800
Come upstairs.

994
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:38,800
What were you talking about,
that took so long?

995
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:41,970
His Grandmother doesn't like me,
and wants me to leave.

996
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,760
She can't bear her
grandson being stolen from her,

997
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:45,900
that's why she's acting like that.

998
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,900
She was like that when her
daughter-in-law joined the family.

999
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:49,740
She didn't like Mrs. Choi either?

1000
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,740
She looks really great to me.

1001
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:53,580
I've already said we're not planning
to get married,

1002
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:55,310
but they still want us to break up.

1003
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,700
She even offered me money.

1004
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,820
If I said we were getting married,
they'd hate me even more.

I'm not going to New York.

Why?

1009
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:14,290
Because of the girl?

1010
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,510
I can't say that's not true.

1011
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:17,460
See, you hear that? I told you so.

1012

He wouldn't bring a girl back
home for no reason.

1013
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,090
Giving up a dream just because of a girl…

1014
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:23,240
You're useless.

1015
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:24,850
Does saying that make you feel better?

1016
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,280
Calling your grandson a fool?

1017
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:29,810
Hoping that your grandson is not
going to America because of a girl?

1018

Do you have to say something like that?

1019
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:33,390
Don't you know your grandson well enough?

1020
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,100
Leaving without a care for my
grandma, mother or father…

1021
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:36,820
Is that a good thing?

1022
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:38,980
Eun Chan is just part of the reason.

1023
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,720
I like her to death.

1024
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:42,360
Do you think I'd be happy
leaving her alone here?

1025
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:46,630
But... Eun Chan isn't the only reason.

1026
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:48,750
I can't bear to leave because Grandmother
isn't feeling well.

1027

I'm not at peace because mother
wants me to stay here too.

1028

You've got a lot of excuses, don't you?

1029
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:56,270
Even if I'm sick, it's not something
that happened overnight.

1030
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:58,500
Your mother wanting you to stay
isn't something new either.

1031
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,450
Now you say what's holding you back?

1032
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:02,400
Ah… really.

1033
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,360
Do you really not
want me to stay here?

1034
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,880
I want to stay here to learn from Father,
is that a bad thing?

1035
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:09,120
Okay. I'll go.

1036
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:12,440
If you both want me to leave,
I can leave.

1037
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:13,550
Fine, I'll go.

You kid…

1041

Where did you learn to argue like that?

1042
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,630
No matter what, she will not do.

1043
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:24,370
I don't like anything about her.

1044

You wouldn't like anyone
I brought home, Grandmother.

1045

I don't like her either.

1046
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:35,850
In the future, your wife will have
to take care of the home.

1047
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:37,850
How could I leave that to her?

1048
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:40,790
You're both thinking too far ahead.

1049

I've really never thought about that,
but listening to what you've said,

1050
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:44,850
I want to get married right now.

1051

Mother, don't you know me well enough?

1053
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:51,170
I've never listened to your advice.

1054
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,890
If you tell me not to do something,
I'd want to do it even more.

1055

00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:25,350
That guy's changed a lot.

1112
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:26,740
He knows how to care for others now.

1113
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,400
Was Grandmother very angry?

1114
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:33,600
Really, how could I just do what
they say at this age?

1115
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,120
Why did they have so much to say?

1116
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,150
You're pouting.

1117
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,010
How could I laugh or smile
at something like this.

1118
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,950
I'm human too.

1119
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,080
I don't feel good.

1120
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,380
What did they say?

1121
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:47,300
That they didn't like me.

1122
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:49,730
What did you say to them?

1123
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:51,600
I told them not to worry.

1124
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:54,800
That there was a chance we'd break up,
even though we're dating.

1125
00:56:56,770 --> 00:56:59,140
You look like you're already
prepared to break up with me.

1126
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:00,130
What could I say at a time like that?

1127
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,100
"I'll never break up with him.
We're getting married."

1128
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:02,840
Could I say that?

1129
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:04,900
I didn't want the elders to faint.

1130
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:07,750
Everything that's happened today
feels like something out of a drama.

1131
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:09,200
What's up with everyone?

1132
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:12,000
I'm a precious child in my house too.

1133
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,990
Is Choi Han Kyul that great?

1134
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:18,090
Well, this might be the last time.

1135
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:20,190
If you go to New York…

1136
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,780
I'm not going to New York.

1137
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:24,340
Really?

1138
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:25,880
W… why?

1139
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:26,800
Why aren't you going?

1140
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:28,170
What do you mean, why?

1141
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:30,510
What you're saying sounds weird.

1142
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:31,960
Are you hoping that I go?

1143
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,140
That's not what I mean.

1144
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:37,340
I'm afraid…
if you're not going because of me,

1145
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:38,570
I'm okay with it.

1146
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,740
Go and work hard.

1147
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:41,920
You sound like you're disappointed
in me for not going.

1148
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:45,870
Of course… well,
I'm not really disappointed…

1149
00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:49,190
Are you really not going because of me?

1150
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:51,560
It's not because of you.

1151
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,030
I'm doing this because of me.

1152
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,040
Because of me,
the person who loves you.

1153
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,410
I don't want to go to America
and cry everyday because I miss you.

1154
00:57:58,450 --> 00:57:59,600
That would be so embarrassing.

1155
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:01,580
It's just easier not to go.

1156
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,580
You're really not going because of me?

1157
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:08,530
That's right.

1158
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:09,790
Really? It's really because of me?

1159
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:11,510
Because you love me?

1160
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:12,860
Really?

1161
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:17,180
Hyung, we're planning a farewell party
for you over the weekend.

1162
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:19,790
I'm not going to New York.

1163
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,420
What are you doing?

1164
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:23,460
Go away.

1165
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,940
I should charge an admission fee
to watch this.

1166
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,670
Go away.

1167
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:35,760
You start getting kissy kissy when you're free…

1168
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:36,920
Are you sparrows?
