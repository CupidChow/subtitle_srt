1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,300
You'll soon work with a lifeless kid,
so both of you better do a good job.

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,260
I am Go Eun Chan, 24 years old.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,700
I can tell that you really need money.
I want to help you look for a job.

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,180
But I can't trust you.
I want to confirm your identity, why?

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,620
That's alright.
But there has to be payment.

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,700
For 100 manwon.
Okay, half. Thirty. Twenty.

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,670
I'll give you the money.
Triple it in three months.

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,990
I broke up with DK.
I want to start over with you.

9
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,110
You are Ssulja's father, right?

10
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,190
I'm the milk deliverer.

11
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,620
This is the place where you will work.

12
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,580
Have a good talk with your teacher, Manager Hong.

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:41,150
Seems like just yesterday you were in diapers.
Is Joon Pil hyung... your father alright?

14
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,210
I haven't seen him in ages.

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,400
When are you going to start work?

16
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,880
We'll have to clear the spider webs,
and catch some mice.

17
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,450
Do you want to start today?

18
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,450
So dirty, so dirty.

19
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,670
You're leaving?

20
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,110
Yes.

21
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,060
They say that in every household,
there's a tough guy.

22
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,600
You should at least give a proper goodbye.
Arrogant kid.

23
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,470
Yes?

24
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,570
You think the shop needs renovation too, right?

25
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,570
Grandma, are you kidding me?

26
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,190
You sure are great at making
a fool out of others.

27
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,980
What kind of cafe is this?
It's a pig sty!

28
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,980
And so?
You don't want to do it?

29
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,700
Don't do it then.

30
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,040
But, I'll confiscate your house and car.

31
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,560
My car!
My car!

32
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,160
I didn't say my goodbyes to the kids.

33
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,150
The owner must have really had his reasons.

34
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,890
This is your weak point.

35
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:54,430
Even if he had his own reasons,
people should act like humans!

36
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,640
Didn't you like the owner even better than me?

37
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,980
What did I tell you?

38
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,380
Other than me, don't get close to others,
not even Manager Hong.

39
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,420
But you didn't listen to me,
and what happened?

40
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,460
You gave your heart to Manager Hong,
and the owner here.

41
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,600
It's better to give your heart to me,
who your mother loves.

42
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,830
Mr. Ku!

43
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:15,740
Noonim!

44
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:16,740
Mom...

45
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,180
What are you doing?

46
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,770
Do you know how sad Eun Chan is feeling?

47
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,770
But you're not even comforting her!

48
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,410
What?
Who likes who?

49
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,300
Noonim, I'm saying it's a nice day,
and the wind is blowing,

50
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,820
but even if a typhoon comes,
the sun will return.

51
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,390
Even if this jerk mistreated Eun Chan...

52
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,920
Good arises out of bad...
life is full of surprises...

53
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,360
Justice will prevail in the end...

54
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,360
Shut up!

55
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,850
I'll keep my mouth shut.

56
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,300
I'll do whatever you ask me to do.

57
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,970
You must be feeling terrible.

58
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,510
Mom is feeling sad too.

59
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,260
He wasn't a bad person from the start.

60
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,060
I think he must have been desperate enough
to act like that.

61
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,300
I should be understanding, right?

62
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,600
If you don't, what else can you do?
You'll only feel bad.

63
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,500
My mother is really kind.

64
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,800
I'll bring the stuffed dolls over.

65
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,800
Yes, go ahead.

66
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,470
Who is it?

67
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,590
I'm from the real estate company.

68
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,480
Please come in.

69
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,580
Is there anything?

70
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,160
You're putting this space up for sale, right?
We're here to have a look.

71
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,240
Who said that I did?

72
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,160
Isn't this Mrs. Bang Nam Jung's flat?

73
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,760
We just received a call not long ago.

74
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,170
She said that she wants to sell it
immediately at a very cheap price.

75
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,580
Bang Nam Jung?

76
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,850
Even though Han Kyul is behaving
this way, I'm more upset at you.

77
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,890
What?
"Mom, I think that's too much"?

78
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,820
Who was the one who was too much?

79
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,690
Your son crossed over the line.

80
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,180
Already 30 years old
and he has never had a proper job.

81
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,060
Half-hearted with his studies, with life.

82
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,990
How did you raise your child?!

83
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,790
Grandma...

84
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,940
If you are unhappy, you should tell me.
Why are you treating mom this way?

85
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,030
Is it because of the match-making?

86
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,180
Oh, that is why.

87
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,560
That's right.
I was dishonest back then.

88
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,430
I'll do it for real this time, okay?

89
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,430
That boat has already left.

90
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,520
If you don't wish to open a cafe,
continue to live the way you are living now.

91
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,430
If so...

92
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,530
Why not arrange a position at your company?
Something like Team Manager...

93
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,700
You think our company is a playground?

94
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,130
Such retards like you...
don't ever think of it!

95
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,070
Your words are harsh today.

96
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,370
Within three months,
triple the investment.

97
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,700
If it succeeds,
I'll give you all my assets when I die.

98
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,950
Mom, how could you say...

99
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:19,560
Once you have the money, you can eat,
sleep, drink without any worry.

100
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,920
Ay, Grandma! Why would you die?

101
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,480
You are as strong as a young person.

102
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,850
You kid!

103
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,630
Look, look.
You are so filled with energy.

104
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,950
What do you want to do?

105
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,450
I don't know.
I really don't want to work.

106
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,950
I'm most suited to only play and have fun.

107
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,420
Don't know, don't know!
Irritating!

108
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,650
I'm not doing it.

109
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,350
Really?
Start from the renovations.

110
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,030
Starting pay will be 800,000 won per month.

111
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,700
Grandma, please leave me be.
What are you doing?

112
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,760
Why are you worried for him?
It's useless.

113
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,300
Just live on that way.

114
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,290
You'll regret it once you're tired of playing.

115
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,840
There isn't any other way
if he doesn't understand.

116
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,230
You're not late?

117
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,100
You're going to Namwon,
you should run along.

118
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,100
Mother, I'm leaving.

119
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,270
You should acknowledge him first, you kid.

120
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,270
If you don't, who else will?

121
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,060
You're really making me work today.

122
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,940
Washing the dishes,
clearing up the storeroom.

123
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,940
Am I your housekeeper?

124
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,500
Can't you say anything else
when we're together?

125
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,360
It is on purpose, right?

126
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,540
I'm asking you because I need the help.

127
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,250
You're sweating.
Do you want the air-conditioner to be on?

128
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,560
No, no, that's fine.

129
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,820
Oh yes.
You don't like it, right?

130
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,140
It's done.

131
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,510
You've worked hard!

132
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,070
Come over here.

133
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,220
Why?

134
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,610
Don't ask and come over here.

135
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,220
What is it?
What are you going to make me do now?

136
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,480
I feel really tired wearing new shoes.

137
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,240
There is a hole here.

138
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,530
Oh, it's soft.

139
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,620
Jump!
Jump!

140
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,370
Oh, it isn't there anymore.

141
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,220
I should go now, right?

142
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,880
Where is this?

143
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,520
Ah, such a weird smell.

144
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,090
Save me!
Save me!

145
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,950
Run away!

146
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,150
My shoes!
I have to give it up.

147
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,560
Ah, it's so tender.
Where is this?

148
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,590
I won't dare to!

149
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,070
I've learnt my mistake!

150
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:10,960
Oh, it's me.

151
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,390
Where are you?

152
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,910
At home.

153
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,930
Can I go over now?

154
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,240
If you are working, I won't go over.

155
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,450
It's okay.

156
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,990
I'm not working today, come over.

157
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,820
Oh, okay.

158
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,360
Oh, you're here?

159
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,380
Yeah, where's Han Yoo Ju?

160
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,060
She washing the dishes.
Come on in.

161
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,670
How did Choi Han Kyul know?

162
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:57,850
That I felt like having some wine.

163
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,980
You two seem to be able to communicate
well, better than me.

164
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,240
But... it has been years
since we got together like this.

165
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,890
Three years.

166
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:10,310
It was three years ago that
Han Yoo Ju abandoned Hyung.

167
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,140
You're still as irritating.

168
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,140
Drink up.

169
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,990
Both of you look good.

170
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,990
Did you have a dramatic reconciliation?

171
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,660
Was it dramatic?

172
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,660
A bit.

173
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,570
I should get going.

174
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,210
I can tell I'm intruding.

175
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,370
I'm sorry for interrupting
your time spent together.

176
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,370
Hey, what's wrong?

177
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,380
Don't leave.

178
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,020
What's wrong with you?

179
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,720
Why did you ask me over?

180
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,060
If I knew that you were with him,
I wouldn't have come.

181
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,240
But that doesn't matter to you, does it?
It only matters to me.

182
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,240
Where did you go to just now?

183
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,690
Home.

184
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,690
Did you met your father?

185
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,690
Yes.

186
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,280
Was it bad? Can't you free yourself from
your issues with your father now?

187
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,860
It feels like it's going on too long.

188
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,070
Too long?

189
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:16,250
I didn't tell you about my issues
with my dad so you could attack me.

190
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,350
Han Kyul.

191
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,950
A kid, pushed around by
his father till he was seventeen...

192
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,090
Forget it.

193
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:29,520
Han Yu Ju. When a problem stays
with someone for a long time,

194
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,320
it's because there's good
enough reason for it.

195
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,560
It's not for nothing.

196
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,100
Han Kyul.

197
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,190
You're really leaving?

198
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,010
Choi Han Kyul!

199
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,640
Mister.
I want to make two bags this round.

200
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,940
Don't be greedy, just do one.

201
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,190
You can't finish it by Thursday.

202
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,030
Mister, I can do it.

203
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,910
Give me one more bag.

204
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,220
I am very free right now. Okay?

205
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,020
Darling, your shoe lace came off.

206
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:13,230
- What is this! You!
- I'm sorry.

207
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,780
What are you doing?
Where do you place your eyes?

208
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,420
Are you alright?

209
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,060
Look at this!

210
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,630
This person, really!

211
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,490
- I'm sorry!
- What are you doing?

212
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,100
How dare you touch another
guy's woman on the chest!

213
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,510
This can't get wet. Hang on.

214
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,770
Are you kidding me?

215
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,960
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

216
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,590
It's nothing serious.
Why do you want to fight? Let's go.

217
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,590
What?
Nothing serious?

218
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,400
It's nothing serious?

219
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,690
It was some other fella the other time.

220
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,070
What kind of jerk is it this round?

221
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,070
I'm going crazy because of you.

222
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:09,040
Where are you going?

223
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,170
Let go!

224
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,090
What's this?
Let go!

225
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,590
Mister.

226
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,200
Stop there!

227
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,370
You're dead if you don't stop!

228
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,760
Let go!

229
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,600
You just won't stop.

230
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,300
If he lets you go, you're dead!

231
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:32,520
Why would I die by your hand?
Why would I?

232
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,370
Are you crazy?
Why are you hitting me?

233
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:42,470
Where are you going? When will you
change that temper of yours?

234
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,860
Stop there!

235
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,890
Don't run away!
I dare you to say it again!

236
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,030
I was wrong!
Don't hit me!

237
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,920
What's wrong with today?

238
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,440
Why?

239
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,440
I don't know, don't know.

240
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,480
Why?

241
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,100
Ah, just keep running.

242
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,360
It feels great!

243
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,650
Oh, mom?

244
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,800
Me?  I'm at my friend's house.

245
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,920
It started to rain suddenly.

246
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,460
I'll go back once the rain stops.

247
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,170
I don't think the rain will stop today.

248
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,810
Make sure the toys aren't wet.
And stay over there for the night.

249
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,330
It isn't a motel here.

250
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,410
Aren't you worried to let
your daughter stay out?

251
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,740
Your face itself is a weapon.

252
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,740
Okay, I'll take care of myself.

253
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:24,640
1, 2, 3...attack!

254
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,990
What are you doing?

255
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,950
Why are you touching these
with your wet hands?

256
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,640
I'm sorry.

257
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:43,260
Hey, are you crying?

258
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,140
No.

259
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:49,350
Collecting albums are my hobby, yet you
touched them with your wet hands, so I...

260
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,140
Are you angry?

261
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,170
My father liked to collect these too.

262
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,010
He had this too.

263
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,470
Did anything happen?

264
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,710
No.

265
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,860
Ah! Water...

266
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,130
I'm sorry.

267
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,640
The taekwondo school closed down.

268
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,470
The owner ran away.

269
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,670
I didn't get my salary.

270
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,160
I didn't even say goodbye to the kids.

271
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,300
Why not go to another school then?

272
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,630
How can a guy cry over things like that?

273
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,630
Just forget about it.

274
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,560
Forget...

275
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,940
You make it sound so easy.

276
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,390
You should get changed.

277
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,680
Don't look like a drenched mouse.

278
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,640
Oh, you're making kimchi fried rice?

279
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,950
You know how to make this too?

280
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,720
You don't look like one who knows how to.

281
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,720
Give me the rice.

282
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,300
It's hot.
Hurry!

283
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,950
You can really tolerate hot stuff.

284
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,950
Did your father pass away?

285
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,380
So, you're the head of the family?

286
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,210
Aren't you going to eat?

287
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,460
It's done.

288
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,700
Hurry!
Hurry!

289
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,380
Ouch! It's hot!

290
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,450
It's really good.

291
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,450
Do you have some more rice and kimchi?

292
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,670
Look at you sewing.

293
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,620
What a weird person.

294
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,620
I can do anything to make a living.

295
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,560
How much do you get sewing one of those?

296
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,740
500 won?

297
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,030
50 won.

298
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:29,200
Such simple labor. Who would be willing
to pay 500 won? So unreasonable.

299
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,610
It looks fun.
I want to try.

300
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,170
Mister, you can't do it.

301
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,540
Why can't I?
Let me show you.

302
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,040
Watch carefully.

303
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:45,990
If you miss the center, the eyes would
be out of place. Be careful!

304
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,990
It will be troublesome to redo it.

305
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,500
Why won't you grow facial hair?

306
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,240
You're 24... 25?

307
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,240
You're no longer young.
Why do you have such slow growth?

308
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,360
It's because I don't eat well.

309
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,750
You don't eat well?

310
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,030
This mister!
Why won't you focus on sewing it?

311
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,240
Hurry up! If you don't, I'll...

312
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,240
Okay.

313
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:17,490
How can a man's hand be so pretty?

314
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,490
What about you?

315
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,370
Mister, were you in a bad mood today?

316
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:26,750
When we were running along the streets,
you said that you felt life was unfair today.

317
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,770
Why?

318
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,770
Problem with women?

319
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:39,080
Why don't you tell me? I'm quite good
with man-woman relationships.

320
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,240
My grandma can't stand it
when I laze around all day,

321
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,690
so she wants me to take over a cafe
that looks like a pig sty. That's why.

322
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,690
It really isn't because of a woman?

323
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,250
The other time...

324
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,940
"You're hurt!"

325
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,210
You aren't meeting her?

326
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,210
I am.

327
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,650
Oh, so you are.

328
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,560
Are you very close?

329
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,540
It's a habit.

330
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,290
Just like drinking water
first thing in the morning.

331
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,620
I can't not see her.

332
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,000
Even if I try not to, I still end up seeing her.
An awful habit.

333
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,410
Why does it sound as if you like it?

334
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,850
So... you'll get married soon, right?

335
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,850
Let's stop it.

336
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,850
Okay.

337
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,650
It's the coffee shop nearby, right?

338
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,650
What is the name?

339
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,840
Coffee shop? It is a pig sty.

340
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,020
What prince? It's like a beggar's home.

341
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,340
Wang Ja Coffee? (prince coffee)

342
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,510
It's nearby.
You should be familiar.

343
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,360
Is it really Wang Ja Coffee?

344
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,840
Manager Hong sold the shop away?

345
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,840
That's weird.

346
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,220
Mister, open that shop.

347
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,160
It'll be successful. Open it.

348
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,340
Why are you so excited?

349
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,810
Ahjussi, re-open it.
And count me in too.

350
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,720
I can clean well and I'm strong.
I'll do whatever you ask me to.

351
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,870
I still owe you money.

352
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,770
If I don't have a job,
I can't return your money.

353
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,300
Mister! Count me in too! Open it!

354
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,160
Don't irritate me.

355
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:17,390
Don't you find it irritating to breathe then?

356
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:21,160
You do nothing but laze around the whole day,
no wonder the woman's family disagrees.

357
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,930
You don't strive for more.
Naturally, everything's irritating to you.

358
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,930
If it were me,
I would have proved them wrong.

359
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,260
I'd show the woman I love how I can succeed.

360
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:32,990
Stop it.

361
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,790
Stop what?

362
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,580
If it doesn't succeed...

363
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,580
Well, let it be then.

364
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,610
To be honest,
you don't make any loss if it closes down.

365
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,410
If it closes down,
continue to play like how you always do.

366
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:46,240
Isn't that so?

367
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,080
Well, that seems reasonable.

368
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:55,410
If you are successful...
Grandma and that woman...

369
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,570
Show them another side of you.

370
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,200
If you really can't do it well,
just carry on with your life.

371
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,970
Ah, open the coffee shop!
Okay? Okay?

372
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,790
Mister, do it.

373
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,540
Go brush your teeth first.

374
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:09,070
I smell kimchi. Oh, it stinks.

375
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,960
Go!

376
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,290
Do the coffee shop...

377
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,980
Shut up.
Don't say anything.

378
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,740
Habit.

379
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,990
Awful habit.

380
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:29,170
Like drinking water first thing in the morning?
What does that mean?

381
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,010
I don't drink water in the morning.

382
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,640
What are you doing?
I'm brushing my teeth!

383
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,580
You grumble even when
you're brushing your teeth?

384
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:45,860
Clean up your mouth.

385
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,500
No manners.

386
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,020
We're both men.
What manners?

387
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,040
Sleep on the sofa for the night.

388
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:53,160
I'm not sleeping over.
I'll leave once the rain stops.

389
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,150
It stained on my pants.

390
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,170
Why is your butt so small?

391
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,580
Why did you whack someone else's butt?

392
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:12,280
Will your butt rot after I hit it?

393
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:15,170
I just find it weird that your butt is so small,
that's all.

394
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,660
Here.

395
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,090
You're sleeping soon?

396
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,650
Let's play awhile before sleeping.

397
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,650
I'm tired.

398
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,650
Do you want to have a look at this?

399
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:48,160
Are you a teenager,
watching stuff like that?

400
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:50,160
Then don't take it with you.

401
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,790
Are you sleeping?

402
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,190
Yeah.

403
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,640
Good night.

404
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,480
Yeah.

405
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:36,090
Ha, he acts so clean and tidy.

406
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,960
The eyes are crooked,
and the stain doesn't erase.

407
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,160
What use is this? You keep it.

408
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,090
You should try running the cafe,
and hire me too.

409
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,670
Think it over. Promise!

410
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,330
Cute.

411
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:04,480
Grandma, give me my car.

412
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,900
What do you mean?
You said to run the cafe.

413
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:11,040
I'm really not joking.

414
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:13,040
When I say I'll do something,
I mean it.

415
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,580
Hey Hungry, are you busy?

416
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,120
You lied to me, didn't you?

417
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,760
What kind of prime location is this?

418
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:29,880
If you clean a bit, and advertise...

419
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,190
Cut the chatter and get in the car.
I'm going to do some market research.

420
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,220
You know the neighborhood, right?

421
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:37,050
Of course, I know it like the back of my hand...
Wait, are you hiring me?

422
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,430
We'll see.

423
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,430
Are you really the boss?

424
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,430
What?

425
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:46,360
But you've gotta pay me decently today, since
I skipped out on an important part-time gig.

426
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,790
100,000 won, okay?

427
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,380
You only see me as money, huh?

428
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,670
Yup.

429
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,660
But it won't be easy in that car.

430
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,860
Move back a little!

431
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,770
How can I?
You want me to push my butt back off the seat?

432
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,370
Yeah. Stop exaggerating.

433
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:17,050
There's Star Cafe.
Bean Cafe over there.

434
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,820
Two big cafes within 500 meters.

435
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,820
This sucks.

436
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,540
Stop.

437
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,730
What's he selling that all those people want?

438
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,920
They're the most well-known waffles in this area.

439
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,280
Why are they all girls?

440
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,860
That's a women's university there.

441
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,560
Really?

442
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,870
Sir, the regulations people are coming.

443
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,410
Okay, I'm going.

444
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,340
Hey, follow him.

445
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:03,980
What?

446
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,980
Hurry.

447
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,290
Excuse me!
Excuse me!

448
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,870
I'd like to work together.
Are you interested?

449
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,160
Don't you want to work under proper,
legal conditions?

450
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,880
What's with that guy?

451
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,540
I can't work under someone else.

452
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:27,250
Think about it.

453
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,770
Please come to Wang Ja Coffee.

454
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,770
Go.

455
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:46,850
What?

456
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,100
Tell him you're a guy?

457
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,870
That's nonsense.

458
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,100
A woman will always be a woman.
How can you be a guy?

459
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,480
Mister..

460
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,000
Let's say you manage to fool him now.
What happens if he finds out afterwards?

461
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,280
I'll tell him the truth then.

462
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:02,080
I'll start work first.

463
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,940
I lied to him that I'm a guy
and I earned some extra money.

464
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:10,060
So why did you take his money?

465
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,240
Well you're right...

466
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,260
I also don't like it either.

467
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,260
But if I tell him now,
he'll get really mad.

468
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:19,410
Ahjussi please, just for once this time.
We'll talk about this later.

469
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,660
Let's get some decent baristas.

470
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,470
Mr. Hong is the barista.

471
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,470
Who allowed you to touch my kitchen?

472
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,310
Do you know why your shop's in such a mess?

473
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,990
Because your coffee's no good.

474
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,080
It's not.

475
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:33,080
Although it's a bit messy...

476
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:37,130
The coffee here is excellent.

477
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,380
Here try some.

478
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:41,710
- Take it away.
- Just try it..

479
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,830
I told you I don't want it.

480
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:46,210
Forget about it.
He doesn't even know how to taste it.

481
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:48,210
I'm pretty sure he drinks alcohol all the time.

482
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,560
He's not a good drinker.

483
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,120
He falls unconscious with just 1 glass.

484
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,120
Why haven't the coffee beans arrived yet?

485
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,200
What?

486
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:58,190
We'll target youngsters in their early 20s.
A lot of young women hang around in this area.

487
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,110
Let's just go back to the '70s and '80s concept.

488
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:03,890
We'll going for variety in the side menu.

489
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,020
Waffles.

490
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,330
What's with a side menu?

491
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,710
What's the use emphasizing on outlook?

492
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,610
Oh...the waffles.

493
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:16,110
There's a well-known waffle stall just
in front of that women's school.

494
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,650
Oh... you're quite clever huh?

495
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,760
First let's change the name of the shop.
Why call it "Wang Ja"?

496
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,580
Call it "Prince."

497
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,870
There isn't any difference.

498
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,080
Three or four employees.
Just like the name, we'll only hire "princes."

499
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,010
Prince.

500
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,530
Men?

501
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,660
What about me?

502
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,340
You won't do.
In future you have to...

503
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,380
Why not?

504
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:34,490
This fella's my first choice.

505
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,930
He's trustworthy and responsible.

506
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,860
Start working from tomorrow.

507
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:45,400
Thank you.

508
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,960
Thank you.

509
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,960
I'll start working.

510
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:55,770
You guys handle everything then.

511
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,510
Wait for a while.

512
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,510
Hi.

513
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,700
Who was that?

514
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,160
DK.

515
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,890
This song sounds really nice.

516
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,050
Why did you hang up so quickly?

517
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:47,380
He just called to ask how I'm doing.

518
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:53,060
Do you feel uneasy that
I'm still talking to DK?

519
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,810
It's alright.

520
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,950
It doesn't look alright.

521
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:04,210
Give me some time.

522
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,130
I'm hungry.

523
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,100
Something spicy?

524
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,350
The spiciest.

525
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:13,820
OK, 10 minutes.

526
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,300
5 minutes.

527
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,360
7 minutes.

528
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,360
1 minute.

529
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,100
What are you doing over there?

530
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,020
What did you hide in there?

531
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,020
I saw everything.

532
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,370
A present?

533
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:45,260
It's a free gift.

534
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,380
I took a bigger one.
It's very useful.

535
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,110
Thank you.

536
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,860
It's a tailor-made ladle.

537
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:01,160
I came here specially to give it to you.
They only give these to shop employees.

538
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,160
Is it alright?
You won't be reprimanded or anything?

539
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,310
It's alright.

540
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,910
I'll get going.

541
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,910
Take care.

542
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:11,130
How are Mr. A and Miss B
doing at the moment?

543
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,120
Oh...that...

544
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,100
I heard they go out to eat together...

545
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,430
...take walks and have tea together.

546
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,130
So they're doing well then.

547
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:27,520
That's great.
Congratulations.

548
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:31,170
So I guess you won't need my help consulting with you anymore.

549
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:34,380
I heard something else, though.

550
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:37,050
I heard that Miss B still has another Mr. C.

551
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,170
An old flame.

552
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,090
Then...

553
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,390
Mr. A doesn't know anything about Mr. C?

554
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,740
No.

555
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,740
He knows.

556
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,270
When he saw Miss A talking to Mr. C
over the phone,

557
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:52,600
he didn't feel good about it.

558
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,990
He's hopeless, right?

559
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:54,810
No.

560
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:57,470
I can totally understand Mr. A's feelings.

561
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:00,990
Since she's already broken up,
why still keep in touch with her ex?

562
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,930
That's too much of Miss A.

563
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,930
Give me your hand.

564
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,150
But...

565
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:12,160
Is Mr. B not be confident of Miss A?

566
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,820
In my opinion, he's pretty cool.
Please tell him to be more confident.

567
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,530
I will.

568
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,210
Can I ask you a question?

569
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:23,600
What?

570
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:30,060
There's this guy who mistook a girl for a guy...

571
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:32,560
What do you mean?

572
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,300
I have to deliver the other stuff now.

573
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,760
I'll tell you next time.

574
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,430
Oh, alright.

575
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,960
See you, Ssulja.
I'm leaving.

576
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,870
Thank you.

577
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,380
Mister.

578
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:47,410
Sorry I always keep on calling you.

579
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:50,360
I don't know if we'll run into
each other in the future.

580
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:55,920
If we don't, if I want to call you, I need your number...
Or not, if you don't want to.

581
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,920
I can tell you...

582
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,920
What's your number?

583
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:07,560
010- 2917 -1215.

584
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,230
Your last name?

585
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,040
Han..?

586
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,820
Ssulja's dad.

587
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,920
Ssulja...

588
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,880
See you.

589
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,670
Take care.

590
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:25,190
010- 2917 -1215.

591
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:31,540
010- 2917 -1215.

592
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,970
I got it finally.
Choi Han Sung.

593
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:41,390
010- 2917 -1215.

594
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,460
The interior design..

595
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,710
The machinery, kitchen utensils, furniture
and the sign will have to be changed.

596
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:53,460
And we have to recruit new employees.
We need at least about 1 billion to 1.5 billion won.

597
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:56,010
And please help me negotiate around.

598
00:38:56,030 --> 00:39:00,060
Mr. Hong's too stubborn.
I can't work with him. Please sack him.

599
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:05,170
Grandma, how on earth did you
get to know such a person?

600
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,650
You and Manager Hong are on the same level.

601
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,410
Same level?

602
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,800
In other words,

603
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,920
both of you are managers.

604
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:14,250
Neither of you can sack each other.

605
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:18,210
For the interior, if you put in the effort,
700,000 to 800,000 won should do.

606
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,950
Use the current machinery available.

607
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,500
For the employees' income,
just deduct from your sales profits.

608
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,370
50 million won.

609
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:27,670
Make sure to show the receipts.

610
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,230
Grandma.

611
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,600
How can you decrease it from
1.5 billion to 50 million won?

612
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,360
I have to go for a meeting now.

613
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,520
Really... this old hag.

614
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:45,910
Have you found out anything?

615
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,630
Of course.

616
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,830
Dong Soo's factory will provide the paint.

617
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:51,310
Min Chul sunbae...

618
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,610
...will provide the furniture for free.

619
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,610
The interior design's up to you then.

620
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,780
I might not even be able to pay you enough.

621
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:01,070
I owe you so much already, brother.

622
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:04,410
We're built on trust, okay?

623
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,320
Thank you.

624
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,940
Go away.
You're blocking me.

625
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,840
Do it anyway.

626
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,140
Concentrate.
Only then you'll have a good figure.

627
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:26,870
She can't have a good figure.

628
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,470
She's going to be a guy
from tomorrow onwards.

629
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:29,770
Right.

630
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:31,280
Then..

631
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,530
I have to train my muscles...
my muscles...

632
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:40,100
You're really going to be a guy.
What if somebody finds out?

633
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,120
Don't worry. Nobody will find out as long as
we don't shower together.

634
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:45,120
I totally agree with her.

635
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:48,110
After all she's flat on the front and behind.

636
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:51,900
Anyway, I'm confident I can do well.
So don't worry too much.

637
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:56,100
After I get my salary, I'll pay off the debts...
and I'll also buy you shoes.

638
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,100
What shoes?

639
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,150
Well, I'll send you lunchbox from now on,
alright?

640
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:03,370
Don't come. What if somebody finds out?

641
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,880
Don't worry.

642
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:06,690
I will definitely say that you're my son.

643
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,840
You're definitely my son.
Like that.

644
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,880
So the shop looks like this?

645
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,130
Oh...it's filthy.

646
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,780
I have an urge to tear it down right away.

647
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:30,810
Does he really know
anything about renovation?

648
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:32,810
Let's make the kitchen an open kitchen.

649
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,680
Who said you can touch my kitchen?

650
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:39,620
Making it an open kitchen means
you're revealing all your recipes to outsiders.

651
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,150
A genuine recipe will not be exhausted
even if you reveal it to others.

652
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,870
Let's just open it in half.

653
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,660
Half of it opened,
the other half sealed.

654
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,090
We'll kill two birds with one stone, OK?

655
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,000
Good morning.

656
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,650
A straight nose.

657
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,570
Oval face, smooth jawline.

658
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,930
Sexy lips.

659
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:01,200
What are you, a guy or a girl?

660
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,540
Brother, who is this person?

661
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,450
My lover.

662
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,730
Ah... that lover...

663
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:07,330
No wonder there were rumors.

664
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,820
You should be very happy.

665
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,160
He's totally my style.

666
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:13,650
Hi, I'm Jin Ha Rim.

667
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,350
How old are you?

668
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:16,610
22?

669
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,730
23?

670
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,080
24, Go Eun Chan.

671
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,770
Ah... Eun Chan.

672
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,370
You look cuter the more I look at you.

673
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:24,510
Let's get started now.

674
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,950
How many people have
you asked to come over?

675
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,100
They will be here in no time.

676
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:28,300
Let's clean all the rubbish first.

677
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:30,840
When can we finish cleaning all of these?
It's so filthy.

678
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,880
What? What is it?

679
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,550
Mice.

680
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,550
Mice... mice...

681
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:42,790
Ah...
I thought something happened.

682
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,790
You caught it?

683
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:46,790
It got away.

684
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:49,600
The mouse was a big as a cat.

685
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,760
I nearly peed in my pants.

686
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:53,870
I caught a full bottle..

687
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:01,410
Mister,
I caught a full bottle. I'll show you.

688
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:05,830
He's braver than I thought.

689
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:26,190
Sir, paint this part of the ceiling over here.

690
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:27,790
Alright... alright.

691
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:41,990
Who's that?

692
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:44,710
What are you doing here?
Move.

693
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,330
Just because of you,
Eun Sae refused to see me anymore.

694
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:51,110
You took away my only angel.

695
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,070
I even saved you from going to prison.

696
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:57,130
Just go away quietly.
I'm very busy right now.

697
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:02,120
There cannot be two suns in the same sky.

698
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,910
Let us finish this off for once.

699
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:07,690
Alright. We'll fight one to one
after I finish moving this.

700
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:10,630
You help me carry it then.

701
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:11,970
Are you mad?

702
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:13,360
Why should I carry this?

703
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:18,190
Move quickly,
so we can fight quickly.

704
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:22,130
Alright then.
I'll finish this off as soon as possible then.

705
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:41,050
What is he doing there?

706
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,440
Are we in a Hercules village now?

707
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:46,180
Did they just eat some
mountain ginseng or something?

708
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,780
Hyung, we can do with a guy like him over there.

709
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,640
Hey... who are you?

710
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:52,820
Who are you?

711
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:57,020
Do you want to work here?

712
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,730
No. No...

713
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:00,980
I'm the boss here.

714
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,310
If you need a job,
work here then.

715
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:06,580
You dare take it,
you'll be dead.

716
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,930
Brother, let's start now.

717
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,080
Here.

718
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,740
What is this?

719
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:10,200
Apologize.

720
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,200
Apologize, quick!

721
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:15,170
Here he comes again.
Apologize again...

722
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,540
Such a bother..

723
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,210
You're really stubborn.

724
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:21,790
Manager Hong, order the coffee beans.

725
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:23,790
Eun Chan..

726
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:26,200
The stuff I told you about yesterday,
go order them now.

727
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:27,630
Alright.

728
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,400
Apologize right now.

729
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,400
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

730
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:34,580
Look at my eyes and apologize
sincerely once again.

731
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,050
Aren't you going to order them quick?

732
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,110
I'll do it right away.

733
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,110
Just stop it right here.

734
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,290
Hwang Min Yeop!
Hwang Min Yeop!

735
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:44,700
What is it?

736
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,820
Help me order the coffee beans.

737
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:47,040
The number is...

738
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:50,440
010 -69804213.
2 kg 20 bags.

739
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,420
- Apologize.
- What is the number again?

740
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,860
010 -69804213. 2 kg 20 bags.

741
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,530
010 -69804213.  2 kg 20 bags.

742
00:46:57,550 --> 00:46:59,340
If you make me repeat it again,
you're dead.

743
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:01,810
010 -69804213.

744
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,990
I'm trembling now...
I'm nervous too.

745
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,990
Quickly apologize.

746
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:08,200
How many bags did you say just now?

747
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,710
Forget about it alright?

748
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:12,700
How long do you want to continue with this?

749
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,010
An eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth.

750
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,150
Do your work now.

751
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:27,890
It's waste that you have a cute face,
you jerk.

752
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,080
What is this?

753
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:44,720
What is it, Han Yoo Ju?

754
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,610
Are you asleep?

755
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:47,520
No.

756
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,250
I'm sorry.

757
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:53,250
For what?

758
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:55,950
That day...

759
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,220
I didn't consider your feelings.

760
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:03,370
About your father...

761
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,430
I shouldn't have said that.

762
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:10,530
I'm not going to defend myself.
Anyway, I'm sorry.

763
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:15,190
Are you really sorry?

764
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:17,190
Yeah.

765
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:20,060
Then do me a favor.

766
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:23,400
I need a mural in my shop.

767
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:26,600
You opened a shop, huh?

768
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:28,600
Yeah.

769
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:33,510
We've gotten rid of the barrier
between us for once right?

770
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,480
I was so scared before.

771
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:39,150
There are things that you're scared of too?

772
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:40,290
Of course.

773
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:42,290
The Choi men.

774
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:45,690
Everything between us will always be
connected to Hyung, huh?

775
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,600
Friend.

776
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:50,600
Don't be like this.

777
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,950
Alright.  I won't.

778
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:59,050
You sound very tired.

779
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,950
I feel like sleeping,
but I can't seem to do so.

780
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,350
Maybe I'm too tired.

781
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,060
Want me to sing you a song?

782
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:12,830
Don't you always say you fall asleep
easily listening to me singing.

783
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:18,760
You're really a good friend.
You know my feelings so well.

784
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,350
In the forest, under a night sky,

785
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,450
on a road that can't be traveled.

786
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:35,760
Only by the dim light

787
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:42,760
do my sad tears ease

788
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:47,160
Still, I keep on living

789
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:51,160
They cannot be broken forever

790
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:55,770
these countless of dreams, soundless...

791
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,260
Are you asleep?

792
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,260
No.

793
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:09,060
Trying to put you to sleep,
I don't even feel like sleeping anymore.

794
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:11,540
You know I have insomnia right?

795
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:14,320
What to do? You have to be responsible.

796
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:19,780
Then, do you want to go paint the mural now?

797
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:21,210
Now?

798
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:23,210
You don't want to?

799
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:25,960
Alright then.

800
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,460
We'll meet at the shop in an hour then.

801
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:58,040
Choi Han Kyul.

802
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,720
You're here?

803
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:17,560
When did you buy the wine?
Looks good...

804
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:20,530
How can Yoo Ju work without wine?

805
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,790
There's music too.

806
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,980
The mural will be a success.

807
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:27,980
Pour me a glass.

808
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:34,130
Oh... sorry.

809
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,780
Alright, done.

810
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:08,640
Making an ordinary chest even more suppressed.

811
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:16,810
Chest...
this thing is just like the neckties that guys use.

812
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:20,140
I'm definitely not torturing you.

813
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:22,140
Done.

814
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:28,370
Go Eun Chan.

815
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:32,870
Now that you've got a job, your life
should change for the better from now on.

816
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:34,730
Fighting!

817
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:37,670
Coffee Prince No. 1 Shop

818
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:51,880
He's early.

819
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,290
Who are you?

820
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:15,110
Who are you?

821
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:18,320
I think we've met before.

822
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:20,740
Scooter?

823
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:23,390
Right?
You don't remember me?

824
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,410
How can he not remember?

825
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:30,040
It's not like you guys just walked
past each other. He even robbed you.

826
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:35,810
I feel like I've been beaten all over..

827
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:40,770
Oh. That's nice.

828
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:43,490
The cement color matches the painting a lot.

829
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:45,160
Looks good.

830
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:47,690
How did you guys get together...?

831
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,540
It's a long story. Right?

832
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,280
My head's not for you to rest your hand.

833
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:58,370
You just do it whenever you're bored...

834
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,460
You used medicated patches?

835
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:05,080
You need those for such a small workload?

836
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:07,800
Really...
you and your dog's nose.

837
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:09,800
My name is Han Yoo Ju.

838
00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:13,260
Let's go eat.

839
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,260
You've worked overnight.
You should be hungry.

840
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:16,510
Let me greet him properly first...

841
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,510
You can greet him later.

842
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,370
Clear off the wine bottle and
glasses over there. Over there too...

843
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,280
What should we eat? Tofu soup.

844
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:27,640
My stomach's not too well.
Let's eat something light.

845
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:48,510
The coffee beans are here.

846
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,300
What do you mean?
20kg 20 bags..

847
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,460
We ordered for 2 kilos per bag.

848
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:58,870
Manager Hong, what's going on?

849
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:00,870
What happened?

850
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:03,350
You were the one who told me to do so.

851
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:05,320
I'm sorry.

852
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:08,310
I mistook the 2 kilos for 20 kilos.

853
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:09,610
Can we have a refund?

854
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:10,500
Are you joking now?

855
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,750
Who'd joke in this situation?

856
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:14,960
And even if we'd ordered such an amount,
you'd think it's strange right?

857
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:16,490
In a newly established shop..

858
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:21,600
How can we afford to buy so many bags of
coffee at a few hundred thousand won each?

859
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:25,370
You knew it's a mistake and yet
you still sent them over, right?

860
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:28,350
I also felt strange. So I confirmed
with you guys several times.

861
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:29,900
Is it really 20 kilos?

862
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,860
Is it not 2 kilos?

863
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,800
Didn't I ask you that?

864
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:36,280
We will definitely not take them back.

865
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:38,490
Mister!

866
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:39,800
I'm sorry.

867
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:40,920
But is there any other way?

868
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,880
1.4 million won,
remit it to our account within today.

869
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,880
You can't just leave like this.

870
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,890
Go Eun Chan.

871
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:50,890
Come with me.

872
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:02,180
Did you even graduate from primary school?

873
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:05,100
You can't even differentiate 20 and 2?

874
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:08,400
I'm sorry.

875
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:09,980
I'll go see them and try to talk to them...

876
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:12,980
Business is built on trust.
Do you know that!?

877
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:17,890
If you make such a mistake from the start,
do you think they'll believe in us again?

878
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:19,850
If it was you,
would you still want to do business with us?

879
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,330
Stop it.
Stop scolding him.

880
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:25,160
I will think of a way to...

881
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,650
Do you always run things this way?

882
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:29,800
All you do is depend on others.

883
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:32,330
You insist on your own opinions.
If they don't work, you blame it on others.

884
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:33,580
What did you say?

885
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,770
Manager, calm down... calm down.

886
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:37,560
You really have no manners huh?

887
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:41,800
Humans make mistakes all the time.
Did you have to scold him like that?

888
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,580
Stop it.

889
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,090
This cannot be solved by throwing a temper.

890
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:48,330
Who made me angry?

891
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:49,650
Do you think we're playing around now?

892
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:51,970
Because of your mistake,
the whole shop's affected now.

893
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,610
Don't you feel guilty at all?

894
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,010
I'm throwing a temper?

895
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:57,360
You...
you're really useless!

896
00:57:58,490 --> 00:57:59,620
You're crying?

897
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:02,520
Does crying solve anything?

898
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:05,960
A guy crying over trivial things...
can't you stop?

899
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:08,920
Let's have a walk outside.
Let's go out first.

900
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:10,370
I'm fine.

901
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:12,440
I think I've judged you wrongly.

902
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:17,120
If you think you can continue like this,
quit right now!

903
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:25,760
Can you leave us for a minute?

904
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:27,760
Alright.

905
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:36,190
Eun Chan, if you're alright...
why don't we have a cup of coffee?

906
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:38,430
I'm fine.

907
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,430
You go look after him.

908
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,840
I heard you bought 20 bags of 20 kg coffee beans.

909
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:49,880
Eun Chan.  Let's roast the beans.

910
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,320
What are you doing?

911
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:53,200
I'm tasting it.

912
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:56,220
If you continue to be like this,
then leave right away.

913
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:58,220
You're curious about him, huh?

914
00:58:58,230 --> 00:58:59,540
Well he's such a person.

915
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:00,730
Let's change the name.

916
00:59:02,090 --> 00:59:03,830
- Coffee..
- PRINCE!

917
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:05,740
Prince...

918
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:08,300
My son, mom is here!

919
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,540
You came?

920
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:10,990
Why don't we leave now?

921
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:12,730
Did you say anything about me?

922
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:14,240
You know our manager?

923
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:16,470
Why am I unable to adapt to Han Yoo Ju?

924
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:19,350
What if I suddenly hold on to your hand?

925
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:20,900
Go Eun Chan.

926
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,900
Can you pretend
that you don't know anything?
