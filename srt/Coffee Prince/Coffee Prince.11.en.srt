1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,080
Also, don't ever stagger
in front of me again.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,530
You're not allowed within 2 meters of me.

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:06,650
Why can't I come near you?

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,970
Why are you playing with me?

5
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,180
Didn't you say you liked me?

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,460
Didn't you say that we
should become sworn brothers?!

7
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,390
At the most, one month.

8
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,510
It'll be over in a month. I'll endure
it until that day so you should too.

9
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,230
Everything will be okay
if you leave this place,

10
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,530
don't concern yourself over
whether I stay or go...

11
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,490
Is Go Eun Chan a woman?

12
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,110
That's a real secret.

13
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:23,170
Do you know how tired Han Kyul hyung is?
How could you keep this from him?

14
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,920
I like you, it doesn't matter if
you are a man or an alien.

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,920
I don't care anymore.

16
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,040
If we sort it out, I might feel even
more tired and even more unbearable...

17
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,680
Let's go wherever it takes us,
let's go forward together.

18
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,860
I can't just answer it, I just can't.
I should endure it.

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,030
One, two, yes?

20
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,150
It's me.

21
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,390
Episode 11

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,990
Are you safely home?

23
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,730
Yeah.

24
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,750
Why do you keep sighing and not talking?

25
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,070
That...

26
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,550
Are you safely home?

27
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:17,820
Hello?

28
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:20,820
Hello?

29
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:23,560
Hello?

30
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,250
I miss you.

31
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,260
We've only just separated so why...

32
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,410
Me too.

33
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,310
You said...

34
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,850
will we have smiles on our faces
when we see each other tomorrow?

35
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,530
We won't argue anymore,
we'll just talk and smile...

36
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,250
Is that right?

37
00:01:59,450 --> 00:01:59,980
That's right.

38
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,490
That's good then.

39
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,580
I'm hanging up now.

40
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,330
Let's talk a little more.

41
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,750
Like this.

42
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:10,780
What?

43
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:13,970
All right then.

44
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,600
We'll talk for a little more.

45
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:19,270
Are you sleeping?

46
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:27,960
I can't.

47
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,630
I have to hang up now,

48
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,860
my mom is calling me.

49
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,050
See you tomorrow.

50
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,200
We...

51
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,070
Alright, sleep well.

52
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,300
I thought my heart was going to explode.

53
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,360
I should say it now.

54
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:11,760
Isn't that right?

55
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,630
It's time to say it now.

56
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,760
Answer me.

57
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,170
Yes!

58
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,350
That's right, that's right,
answer me, hurry up!

59
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,570
I have someone I like.

60
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,780
Who?

61
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,970
My manager.

62
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,190
Does he know you're a woman?

63
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:07,970
I'm going to tell him tomorrow.

64
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,790
It must be hard on you.

65
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,540
Mom.

66
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:19,680
Yeah?

67
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,300
I'm so nervous.

68
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,740
Yes, this is Choi Han Kyul.

69
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,580
Hello?

70
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,540
Hello?

71
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,100
I...

72
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,340
I am Lee Myung Jae.

73
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,420
Mr. Lee Myung Jae?

74
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,940
She's gone crazy, crazy.

75
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,220
Hey, are you really going
to wear that to work?

76
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,680
You're going to cause such a huge problem
with what you're going to do today.

77
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:40,850
I'm going.

78
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,530
Go Eun Chan.

79
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,330
It'll be fine, it'll be fine.

80
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,750
Fighting!

81
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,570
I think I'm going crazy.

82
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,260
I like the Manager as well.

83
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,970
The Manager likes me too,
then what's the problem?

84
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:07,780
What's the problem?

85
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,530
It'll be fine!

86
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,540
It'll be fine!

87
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,380
Go Eun Chan, it'll be fine!

88
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,750
Right now, Han Kyul should
be meeting Lee Myung Jae.

89
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,580
Yeah.

90
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,160
What will they say to each other?

91
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,630
Why are you eating an
ice-cream in the morning?

92
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,080
My father told me that when I was little,

93
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,620
I really liked my uncle and I was
always following you around...

94
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,320
Actually I don't really remember much.

95
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,840
Of course, it was a very long time ago.

96
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,500
No matter what, thank you for coming
out to see me on behalf of your father.

97
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,420
It's all right.

98
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,190
Your father told me that, aside from work,

99
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,200
you're even more interested in other things.

100
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,480
He's very worried about me over
my obsession with toy making.

101
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,530
I used to design robots.

102
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,250
The elders all wished that I wouldn't
carry on in that field of work.

103
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,570
But after doing all kinds of different work,
that's the only thing that interests me...

104
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,350
That's why I'm still quite involved in it.

105
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,840
You get your stubbornness
from your mother.

106
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,700
My mother is not stubborn.

107
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,480
She's been through a lot and has
had to make many compromises

108
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,690
because of my father
and my stubbornness.

109
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,860
Do you know... my birth mother?

110
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,870
What kind of country is this irritating?

111
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,570
Why can't I find any good
news to make my mood better?

112
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,310
What war, what kind of politics...

113
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,310
My head hurts.

114
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,010
Stop annoying me.

115
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,520
You've been whispering a song that

116
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,900
doesn't sound like a
song since this morning.

117
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,580
That's not called whispering,
it's called singing a song.

118
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,950
Old people can't sing it.

119
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,020
Old people? Did you just call me old?

120
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,490
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

121
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,620
Brother.

122
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,800
Your clothes...

123
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,560
You're early today, Ahjussi.

124
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,160
Yes.

125
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,210
This...

126
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,020
Today... I think you're
wearing the wrong clothes.

127
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:39,410
Where's the Manager?

128
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:42,220
What? He's not here yet.

129
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:45,650
But your clothes...

130
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,430
The way I see it, she's
never had any breasts.

131
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,880
Hyung, you're here?

132
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,990
What is this?

133
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,720
You're not trying to hide it anymore
now that I've found out right?

134
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,790
Are you making the first move?

135
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,560
Hey, Hwang Min Yeop, Manager Hong,

136
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,030
No Sun Ki, your movements are quick

137
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,150
Did they teach you to do this already?

138
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,490
They are so clever.

139
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,190
I'm really sorry, Hyung.

140
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,940
I didn't want to lie to you guys
from the beginning...

141
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,600
Is that so?

142
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,260
Then why did you have to plan it all
out and make a fool out of a person?

143
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,040
I'm sorry.

144
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,990
Other than saying sorry right
now, I have nothing else to say.

145
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,210
Sorry? Do you just say sorry
after you've killed someone?

146
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,530
Hey, then just take me as a
person with no consideration at all.

147
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:41,670
What about Han Kyul hyung?

148
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,130
Do you know why he didn't come
to work for the past few days?

149
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,960
So you do know.

150
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,580
Hey, do you know how
tough it was for him?

151
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,390
Do you know that was the first time
I've seen him fall apart like that?

152
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,790
Who are you?!
How dare you play around like this?!

153
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,720
Even if you want to lie to someone,
there should at least be a limit.

154
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,810
Did you really think you
could play us around like that?

155
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,390
Do you know you've already
turned a few people into cripples?

156
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,000
I can't even hit you, this is crazy...

157
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,150
Wait a minute, brother.

158
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,420
Let go.

159
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,750
Does the Manager know too?

160
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,360
Did you tell him?

161
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,890
Is that why he hasn't come?

162
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,230
Don't hold back the tears.

163
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,260
You're a woman now, aren't you?

164
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,950
So you want to use your
tears to gain pity right?

165
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,810
Wow, you're so scary.

166
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,370
How could there be a
person like you in this world?

167
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,660
All the feelings I've
accumulated are gone.

168
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,110
You should go back.

169
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:51,890
About my mother....

170
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,760
No one has ever talked to me
about it with so much detail.

171
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,100
Thank you so much for today uncle.

172
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,130
What are you thanking me for?

173
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,010
Thanks to you, I've thought of the past
and that has brightened up my mood.

174
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,870
I'll see you next time.

175
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,500
This is your mother's picture.

176
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,540
That's all I can give you.

177
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,240
What are you doing?

178
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,860
I've put all your things in the wardrobe.

179
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,940
I'm taking the almond colored shirt.

180
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,180
Mine got ruined in the wash.

181
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,180
I asked what are you doing?

182
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,430
Because DK's schedule has
been pushed forward a day,

183
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,860
I'll be leaving next Sunday.

184
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,400
Didn't I say not to leave?

185
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,380
Let's end this.

186
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,010
I know what's in your heart
and you know what's in mine.

187
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,410
If we carry on like this,
nothing's going to change.

188
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,380
Tell me what my heart is like.

189
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,160
Do you really know what's in my heart?

190
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,700
You know and you're still doing this?

191
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,240
I told you to give me some time.

192
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,440
I admit that I did waver about.

193
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,240
And I said that I would sort it out.

194
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,240
I told you to wait for me.

195
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,070
Wait for you?

196
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21,520
What?

197
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,290
Wait for you to come around?

198
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,830
What should I do during
that period? Pray for you?

199
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,960
Pray that you won't waver about?

200
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,030
Don't let that "man"...

201
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,290
Keep you in a loop.

202
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:37,490
Because she likes another man,
she likes Choi Han Sung's cousin.

203
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:42,430
So Choi Han Sung can only come back.

204
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,390
Do you want me to be that impatient and
endure everything during that period?

205
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,590
Should I pray and wait
for you at the same time?

206
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,880
Yes, even if you have to do that.

207
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,020
You should be clear
about what you've done.

208
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,190
Should I not understand what you've done?
Is this what you mean?

209
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,830
I've already lived with another man
so I should accept you too, right?

210
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,100
I just wavered for a little while,
why can't you understand that, right?

211
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,570
I know.

212
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,210
I know I don't have the
right to say those things.

213
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,590
So that's why I have to leave.

214
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:12,550
I don't want to become your burden.

215
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,980
Don't sort out your own
feelings because of me.

216
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,910
Just go ahead with your own feelings.

217
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,980
Because I've done that before as well.

218
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,950
Don't go.

219
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,610
If you tell me to stay, then I'll stay.

220
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,780
If you tell me to go then I'll go.
I'm not that kind of person.

221
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,600
Don't go.

222
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,370
Don't you know me at all?

223
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,400
I'm leaving.

224
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:36,720
Han Yoo Ju.

225
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,880
Can't you just keep one eye closed
and one eye open and just follow me?

226
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,660
I'll come again to pick up my things.

227
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,510
Why don't you just tell me the truth...

228
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,210
it's because of work isn't it?

229
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,410
Don't try to find an excuse.

230
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,170
It doesn't matter if I wavered or not,
that means absolutely nothing to you.

231
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,130
Is there really another reason?

232
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,200
I really believe that you like this job.

233
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,820
Or have you been kept
in the loop by that jerk?

234
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,370
What's wrong?

235
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,090
Is your conscience acting up
because you're abandoning me again?

236
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,530
The excuses you've found...

237
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,390
they're just tiny, meaningless
reasons, they're nothing.

238
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,380
Han Yoo Ju.

239
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,490
Han Yoo Ju!

240
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,110
I'm here.

241
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,250
Sorry, I'm late.

242
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,450
It's fine, you're the
Manager so that's possible.

243
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,410
I'm late.

244
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,120
Where's Eun Chan?

245
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,440
On the first floor.

246
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,480
Why are you the only one
cleaning up the first floor?

247
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,420
You should've asked them all to help.

248
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,820
Really...

249
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,240
Why did you come late?

250
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,410
That's hard to say.

251
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,140
Did you sleep well yesterday?

252
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,300
Yes.

253
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,270
Why are you answering like that?

254
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,710
Did you not sleep well?

255
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,470
No.

256
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,290
I didn't sleep well.

257
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,530
I've been very shocked.

258
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,260
Let me see your face.

259
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,980
Why have you been staring at
the floor since I've arrived?

260
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,860
Is cleaning more important than me?

261
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,730
What are you saying?

262
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,190
Are you not well?

263
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,370
No.

264
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,490
I'm fine.

265
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:58,950
I thought...

266
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,290
My head hurts.

267
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,350
I said my head hurts.

268
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,940
Should I get some medicine for you?

269
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,580
Wait a sec.

270
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:15,950
Sit down.

271
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,580
This morning, I went to see
someone my father knows.

272
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,810
He told me he knew the
woman who gave birth to me.

273
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,020
I'll show you my mother.

274
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,130
She's pretty, right?

275
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,600
I heard she was a tomboy
when she was young.

276
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,980
She was really outstanding at university.

277
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,450
She was really popular
with the boys as well.

278
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,860
Now you know why I'm so good looking.

279
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,160
I'm so tired.

280
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,510
A day like today,
I really don't feel like working.

281
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,310
Console me.

282
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,390
How?

283
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:16,950
Like this.

284
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,550
It's warm.

285
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,460
The birthmark...

286
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:38,780
What could that be?

287
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,690
It's like a piece of ice in my heart.

288
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,840
Why is it so heavy, so cold?

289
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,020
What is this?

290
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:57,900
Go Eun Chan.

291
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,350
Why are both of us men?

292
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,750
How about we jump across to America?

293
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:10,460
I...

294
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,290
You don't know.

295
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:21,780
This is good.

296
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,960
It's good to have a lover.

297
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,460
I'm going to be 30
the day after tomorrow.

298
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,900
For my mother,
I haven't made a good showing.

299
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,030
Are you all right?

300
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,730
I originally wanted to come and
give her a good beating today.

301
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,490
But with one look, she's a woman.

302
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,160
A girl is a girl.

303
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,800
By her pretty little face, she doesn't know

304
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,240
how many people she's already played.

305
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,580
Don't ponder over it.

306
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,670
As they say, even if you hate the

307
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,830
crime committed, don't hate the criminal.

308
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,670
I think that kid is pretty
upset over it as well.

309
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:35,110
So just forget it, just forget it.

310
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,230
What are you talking about?

311
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:36,950
You don't know?

312
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:37,950
What?

313
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,490
Go Eun Chan.

314
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,810
Really...

315
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:45,250
No matter how much I like that kid,
you shouldn't call him a girl.

316
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,490
Don't let him hear it.

317
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:48,760
His fist is really powerful.

318
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,330
Go Eun Chan didn't tell you?

319
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,440
Tell me what?

320
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,840
That girl, she wore
women's clothing today.

321
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,900
So I personally asked
her if she was a woman.

322
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,060
She had tears in her eyes
and kept saying sorry to me.

323
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,140
We were too stupid.

324
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:07,840
Since she's a woman,
how come we didn't find out sooner?

325
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,740
I really wanted to scratch my eyes out.

326
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,390
Really, what are you talking about?

327
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,110
Go Eun Chan is a woman.

328
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,070
Manager Hong, Hwang Min Yeop, No Sun Ki,
they all knew except for you and me, Hyung.

329
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,620
Thinking about it, I couldn't find anything
confirming the fact that she is a man.

330
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,330
I've never seen her identity card.
Hyung, have you seen her identity card?

331
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,460
Going to the apple farm, playing basketball,

332
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:34,090
she never wanted to wash with us,
she wanted to wash on her own.

333
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,890
We should've realized it then.

334
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,990
If we think about it seriously,
those are not just two strange things.

335
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:41,300
She hasn't got a beard,
her body is so weak and she has no muscle.

336
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,750
She's totally a woman,
why didn't we figure it out earlier?

337
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,760
I'm a fool, I'm a fool!

338
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,340
Really...

339
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,580
Go Eun Chan.

340
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:57,340
Brother.

341
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,610
Brother, don't say anything right now.

342
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,280
Lift your head.

343
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,880
Ha Rim says that you're a woman.

344
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:14,890
Are you really a woman?

345
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:20,990
What?

346
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:24,930
Are you really a woman?

347
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,330
Answer me you jerk, are you a woman?

348
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,430
I asked if you are a woman?!

349
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:02,810
Brother!

350
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:19,250
Manager!

351
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,470
Manager!

352
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,220
Manager!

353
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:28,710
Manager...

354
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,290
Manager!

355
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:52,790
Are you a man or a woman?

356
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,850
You look like a girl.

357
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,250
Have you been in the army?

358
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:57,140
Identity card number.

359
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,590
850805-2371291...

360
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,730
Isn't it 13 right? 13?

361
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,420
Can't you even tell if
you're a man or a woman?

362
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,540
Why don't you have a beard?

363
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,000
That's because I don't eat well.

364
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,860
Prince? A man?

365
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,500
What about me then?

366
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,990
Say hi, this is Hang Sung's girlfriend.

367
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,510
What would happen if I was a woman?

368
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:25,250
If I was a woman then could we date?

369
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,420
Would you like me even if
I was your younger brother?

370
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,100
Where am I the prettiest?

371
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,100
From now on, we're sworn brothers.

372
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,710
Would you like me even more?

373
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,050
Is that your first kiss with me?

374
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,870
Didn't you say that if I was
a woman you wouldn't like it?

375
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,920
You said that you only
liked me because I was a man.

376
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,980
Being in that kind of mood,
it'll be a relief he doesn't get in trouble.

377
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,380
It's so pitiful.

378
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,330
Two special waffles please.

379
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:02,550
Eun Chan doesn't
look too good as well.

380
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,950
She looks like she's going to fall over.

381
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,980
How dare you call her sister?

382
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,830
Now you're up to date with us.

383
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:09,520
What?

384
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,520
Why are you so angry?!

385
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:12,770
How amusing...

386
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,100
You big gorilla!

387
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,950
If he's a big gorilla,
then you're a sparrow.

388
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,380
Hello?

389
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,910
Who else knows?

390
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,660
Does everyone else know besides me?

391
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:33,290
Manager Hong, Sun Ki, Ha Rim,
Min Yeop, who else knows?

392
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,290
Does Han Sung hyung know too?

393
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,220
Does Han Yoo Ju know too?

394
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,850
Where are you now?

395
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:46,440
Let's meet.

396
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,420
Let's talk when we meet.

397
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,420
Answer me, you jerk.

398
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,290
Does Choi Han Sung know?

399
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,850
Answer me, does Choi Han Sung know?!

400
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,460
He knows.

401
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,290
What are you doing here at this hour?

402
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,310
What's wrong?

403
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,780
Why didn't you tell me
that Go Eun Chan is a woman?

404
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,090
Do you want a glass of red wine?

405
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,860
Do you think I'm kidding with you now?

406
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:58,830
When did you find out?

407
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,160
What's the reason for not
telling me when you knew?

408
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,970
Don't you know I've been so
frustrated because of that kid?

409
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,220
You dare say you don't know?!

410
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,400
You never asked me.

411
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:08,920
You didn't ask me.

412
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,500
What other reason do I have to tell you?

413
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:16,040
You knew from the
beginning that she is a woman.

414
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,650
You knew that she is a girl and yet you
still let her come to your art shop?

415
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:21,440
On the day of the performance,
I asked Han Yoo Ju

416
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,870
to come out and you
were out with that kid.

417
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,910
What was the reason?

418
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,220
Do you like that kid?

419
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,660
Were you laughing at me behind my back?!

420
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,040
Why are you angry about this?

421
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:33,670
It's good for you that
Go Eun Chan is a woman.

422
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,120
Eun Chan says she likes you
too so what's the problem?

423
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,810
So you knew everything.

424
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,810
Whatever happened between us,
you knew everything.

425
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,340
But you never told me anything.

426
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,810
Han Yoo Ju told me that
you have another woman,

427
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,420
she means Go Eun Chan right?

428
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,180
The woman you took to
the exhibition that day....

429
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,280
It was Go Eun Chan right?

430
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,110
Is that the reason why
you kept this from me?

431
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,070
That's because Eun Chan
was in a difficult position...

432
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,790
What difficult position?!

433
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,190
If I knew that she is a woman
would the sky fall down?!

434
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,560
That's right.

435
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:12,460
I'm sorry.

436
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,260
Maybe I thought things were too simple.

437
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:18,730
But I didn't want to
make things harder for

438
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:20,630
a kid who wanted to
work at the coffee shop.

439
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,060
Also, since you two like each other...

440
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:28,550
I thought that was enough.

441
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,200
Answer me.

442
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,270
If you don't answer me,
then I don't know what I'll do.

443
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,300
When Han Yoo Ju said
that Choi Han Sung

444
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,590
has another woman,
who was that woman?

445
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,740
Should I go and ask Han Yoo Ju?

446
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,740
That's my business.

447
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,200
It has nothing to do with you.

448
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,820
It does, answer me!

449
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,020
That's enough.

450
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:55,530
I don't want to talk.

451
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,150
Fine, then don't talk.

452
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,040
Han Yoo Ju,

453
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,380
since Hyung is not talking,
then you tell me.

454
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,690
The woman that Hyung brought to

455
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,200
the exhibition, was that Go Eun Chan?

456
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,900
You said that Choi Han Sung has another
woman. Is that woman Go Eun Chan?!

457
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,860
What are you doing?

458
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:23,090
That's right, I did like Go Eun Chan.

459
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,430
But Eun Chan says she doesn't.

460
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,390
I've already sorted it, all right?

461
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,610
This is Choi Han Kyul.

462
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,380
I'm not here right now
so please leave a message.

463
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,180
It's me.

464
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:05,410
You're not answering
your cell so I thought...

465
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,650
Are you at home?

466
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:13,130
If you're at home then...
please pick up the phone.

467
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,280
I'm really sorry.

468
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,630
You haven't had an accident have you?

469
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:23,950
Right?

470
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,840
I have something to tell you.

471
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,300
Move.

472
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,100
Let's talk.

473
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,250
I never thought about lying
to you in the first place.

474
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,080
But I...

475
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,280
At first....

476
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,370
At first, it was because of the money.

477
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,010
The rite was closed down.

478
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,980
And I had no job.

479
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,820
It was really good working
at the Coffee Prince.

480
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,790
I really wanted to continue working there,
but if I told you I was a woman then...

481
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,670
I was afraid you'd kick me out.

482
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:42,530
That's why...

483
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,740
I didn't tell you, I'm really sorry.

484
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,060
I wanted to tell you...

485
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,120
I wanted to tell you but
before you go to America.

486
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,150
I wanted to get along well with you.

487
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,980
I was afraid you wouldn't want to
see me again if I told you I was a woman.

488
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,820
I was worried about that,
that's why I didn't tell you.

489
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,490
I'm sorry.

490
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,250
Tell me you're not.

491
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,030
I beg you, tell me you're not.

492
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,110
Eun Chan.

493
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,620
I won't be angry,
so just tell me the truth.

494
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,750
You didn't lie to me did you?

495
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:30,270
No matter the reason,
you wouldn't lie to me would you?

496
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,990
It's not for a day or two days...

497
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,360
It's been a few months now.

498
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,510
You can't be like this right?

499
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,300
You're not a woman.

500
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,720
You haven't once lied to me.

501
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,690
A person who loves you doesn't lie.

502
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:55,190
Hurry up and tell me that everything
is just a misunderstanding!

503
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:58,650
I'm sorry.

504
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,050
I'm really sorry.

505
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:06,920
You lied to me?

506
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:10,850
Is that it?

507
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:13,540
You...

508
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,520
You lied to me?

509
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:07,340
So you couldn't say anything?

510
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,020
You dummy!

511
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:13,600
Still, he got that angry?

512
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,950
Isn't he going overboard?

513
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:19,620
I didn't like him from the start.

514
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,300
He looked difficult to please.

515
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:27,240
Just get rid of him!
I'll introduce you to someone else!

516
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,600
Even if I can't see him anymore...

517
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,190
even if he refuses to see me...

518
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,520
I want to tell him.

519
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,470
That I really, really love him.

520
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,720
You idiot. Then tell him!

521
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:55,360
My daughter's grown up,
crying over a man.

522
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,550
What's so great about crying over a man

523
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:59,400
that you'd cut these so nicely for her?

524
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,720
Go in.

525
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,120
Two ice mochas.

526
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,300
Welcome.

527
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,970
Why aren't you coming?
Is the cafe a joke to you?

528
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,640
Waffles to table 8.

529
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,370
I'm completely busy.

530
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:28,140
I can't stand to watch this, so
you come and fire her yourself.

531
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,870
If the employee did
something wrong, fire them.

532
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,980
Why should the manager be absent?

533
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,260
Come out!

534
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:38,640
Go Eun Chan.
If the manager tells you to quit, quit.

535
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:49,530
Dr. Kim is coming today.

536
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,330
Please come home early.

537
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,130
Okay.

538
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,610
You're taking that well,
without any complaint.

539
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:05,400
I've got to eat and live.

540
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,270
But mother,

541
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,220
no matter how I think about it,

542
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,340
I don't think it's right
to just send him away.

543
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,200
Lee Myung Jae, I mean.

544
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:22,890
Leaving him in front
of his biological father

545
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,780
without telling him makes me feel guilty.

546
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,350
And I feel scared that he'll ask to meet.

547
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,260
It doesn't look like
he's going to just leave.

548
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:35,040
He's supposed to leave this week,
but I haven't heard from him.

549
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,720
He's his bloodline,
of course he'd feel possessive.

550
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:43,820
Even if he doesn't reveal he's his father,
he'll want to drop by at least once a year.

551
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:47,710
In his position, that's natural.

552
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:53,910
Let's think of what's easiest for Han Kyul.
What's best for him?

553
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:00,460
Seems like just yesterday
we took him in as a baby.

554
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,360
Thank you.

555
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,590
What are you thinking, coming to work?

556
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:08,720
What would you like?

557
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:10,410
Ice coffee?

558
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,870
Don't you know only
guy princes work here?

559
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,470
I'll quit when he
tells me to, but till then,

560
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,280
I thought I should show my sincerity.

561
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,750
You're really shameless.

562
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,780
Do you have to get your way?

563
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,400
I can't understand at all.

564
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:31,540
Then don't.

565
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,710
If you can't understand, don't understand.
What's the problem?

566
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:37,380
Clear that table over there.
I'll handle things here.

567
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,480
Okay.

568
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,370
What the hell are you so mad about?

569
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,160
They like each other.
Isn't it a good thing if she's a girl?

570
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,400
Is liking each other everything?
She lied, and destroyed his trust.

571
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,760
Does a guy who values trust so much just

572
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,450
date this girl, that girl, left and right?

573
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:00,340
Hey, when do you have time?
Let's fight this out.

574
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,760
Manager, I...

575
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,080
It was because of Eun Sae...

576
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,810
I'm really sorry.

577
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:29,010
You sure are good at acting innocent,
then lying and stabbing someone in the back.

578
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:38,510
I got Go Eun Chan's pay ready.

579
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:41,320
But we've still got five or
six days left this month.

580
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,330
Should I deduct that or not?

581
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:45,480
Do whatever you want.
Have you ever deferred to me?

582
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:52,330
That girl's done anything and
everything to keep her family fed.

583
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:57,530
Since her father died when she was sixteen,
she was the head of the household,

584
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:01,270
it was easier to act as a guy.
So that's why she turned out like that.

585
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:03,630
Do you think she enjoyed it?

586
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,990
Forget it. It's your problem, not mine.

587
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,560
Get her pay ready and send her out.

588
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,270
You hired her, so you fire her.

589
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,070
Do you really want to live with me?

590
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,730
This job isn't that exciting.

591
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,220
So isn't agreeing to go to New York

592
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,230
suggesting that you want
to start over with me?

593
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,350
Hello.

594
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,860
I'm running away.

595
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,870
What'll you do if he comes to catch you?

596
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,630
The person running away is the criminal,

597
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,380
and the one chasing is the cop.
Is that right?

598
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,600
Then there are criminals who
wait to be caught by cops.

599
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,840
You know each other, don't you?

600
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,100
Is this the second time?
We met once in New York.

601
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,370
This is the third time.
We met twice in New York.

602
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,850
Did you have dinner? We just ate.

603
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,180
Do you want anything?

604
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,710
Just coffee.

605
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,030
Okay.

606
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,450
I saw a film you worked on in Japan.

607
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,300
Are you interested in working together?

608
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:34,070
It might be fun to mix music
and art in a performance.

609
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,080
Ah.

610
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,920
I'm all out of coffee. Have tea instead.

611
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,560
DK, do you remember this tea?

612
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:51,880
It's lemon chestnut.

613
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,510
I bought it from that place before.

614
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,510
You know, that tea place behind your villa.

615
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:00,790
Don't you remember?

616
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:04,310
You know, it had a small
herb garden out in the back.

617
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,120
I know, Joy Coffee Shop.

618
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,800
That's right, Joy.

619
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:12,000
- Do you still like their walnut pies?
- Excuse me.

620
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,970
I'm sorry, but could you leave us?

621
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:21,040
I was on my way out anyway.

622
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,300
Just a minute.

623
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:35,160
I'm sorry.

624
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:39,040
I'm doing that because I'm mad at him,
so please understand.

625
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:45,330
You like him, and he likes you.
What's the problem?

626
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:55,820
Do I have to answer?

627
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:04,360
You know I still like you....

628
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:06,060
Don't you?

629
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:08,530
It's a bit uncool to know that and be

630
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:10,720
working a different guy in front of me.

631
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:13,270
I'm sorry.

632
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,740
I don't know why I'm like this, either.

633
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:21,020
Tell me honestly. What's the reason?

634
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:22,140
Why?

635
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:30,800
I don't like him looking at other women.

636
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,370
Should I praise you for being honest?

637
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,630
Or do I curse you for not
considering my feelings?

638
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:47,430
I'm always sorry to you.

639
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,780
I don't like walnut pies now.

640
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,290
Bye.

641
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,430
Do you want to call a taxi?

642
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,710
I'm going to take a walk. Go in.

643
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,950
I feel jealous, seeing him again.

644
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:30,510
Isn't that funny of me?

645
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:38,480
Is work what you want?

646
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,410
Even without me,
can you be happy just working?

647
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:44,080
Or do you want to go
back to New York with DK...

648
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,620
What do you really want?

649
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:54,790
We can't have everything we want.

650
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:59,350
Just like you can't have Eun Chan.

651
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:01,530
What are you talking about?
I've never thought that.

652
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:03,970
Yoo Ju.

653
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,570
Let's stop doing this.

654
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:14,270
I needed time to get my
chaotic thoughts in order,

655
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,200
but I'm over her now.

656
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,740
Are you really over her?

657
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,540
When I said I was leaving,
you asked for time.

658
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:39,300
I thought you'd tell me not to leave

659
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,440
because you'd already settled your feelings.

660
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,490
But you asked for time to get over her.

661
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,860
I know you're not one
for saying empty words,

662
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:53,830
but in that moment, you should have said,

663
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:58,310
"I'm over her, she's nothing to me.
Han Yoo Ju, I only want you. "

664
00:45:58,870 --> 00:45:59,950
That's what I hoped you'd say.

665
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,130
What does that mean?

666
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:03,920
That means you're not really over her.

667
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,540
You know I can't say empty words.

668
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:08,480
Why don't you trust me?

669
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,190
Look me in the eyes and answer me.

670
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:13,680
Is Eun Chan really nothing to you?

671
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:20,540
It's been too short of a time for
you to be completely over her.

672
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:22,580
Maybe not for me, but it is for you.

673
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:30,400
I can change quickly and end
things quickly, but you can't.

674
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:32,510
Your feelings can't
change direction quickly,

675
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:34,430
and once they have, it's difficult
for you to change them back.

676
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:37,080
You're different from me.

677
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,310
That's why it makes me more
frightened and more angry.

678
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:39,950
Yoo Ju.

679
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:43,200
From the time I met you,
until you met Eun Chan,

680
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:45,630
there was nobody but me in your eyes.

681
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:47,910
There were plenty of
suitable women around you,

682
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:49,710
but they were nothing to you.

683
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:51,800
You wouldn't even have a cup
of coffee with another woman!

684
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:56,950
When I needed you,
you were always by my side,

685
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:59,020
and whatever I did,
you'd forgive me and accept me.

686
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,430
I was always number one.

687
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:06,890
But now, I expect too much from you.

688
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:10,170
Nothing's changed.

689
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:12,310
No, so much has changed,

690
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:15,820
Because I can't trust you anymore.

691
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:23,780
So... you're leaving no matter what?

692
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:30,010
If you leave like this,
it's really over for us.

693
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,600
I hate this place.
I don't want to see you!

694
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:34,710
What are you telling me to do,
when my man

695
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:36,530
keeps another girl
tucked away in his heart?

696
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:38,100
So you want to break up again?

697
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:44,090
You don't give me any chances,
and decide everything by yourself.

698
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:45,920
What did I do that was so wrong?

699
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:51,780
Both then and now...

700
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:58,870
you sure do break up easily.

701
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,380
I'm going home.

702
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:18,570
Goodbye.

703
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:25,010
- Are you leaving?
- Yeah.

704
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:39,890
Drinking beer makes going
to the bathroom such a pain.

705
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:41,950
What are you saying?

706
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:42,750
What's wrong?

707
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,300
This thing called your heart.

708
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,810
If it were a piece of paper,
you could fold it.

709
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:49,560
If it were kimbap,
you could roll it up.

710
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,110
If it were flowing water,
you could block it.

711
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:54,180
Even if it's scary,
a plane can be put in reverse...

712
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,580
"Put a plane in reverse?"

713
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:59,300
Haven't you seen it on Armed Forces Day?

714
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:06,780
Anyway, things can be blocked,
or reversed, but why not this heart?

715
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:09,150
It's really difficult for me.

716
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:11,670
Is there something in the
water in this neighborhood?

717
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:14,480
Why is it so full of pure,
simple-hearted fools?

718
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,150
I might be better off waiting for

719
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:19,150
Mountain Donghaemul
and Baekdusan to wear down.

720
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:23,930
I'm tired, waiting for her heart.

721
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,350
Did you not like the woman
you met on the blind date?

722
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:28,940
I didn't even look at her.

723
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:34,840
She'd made up her face, tucked things
here and there and did herself up.

724
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:41,080
But my heart... this heart...

725
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:52,870
Why are you here so late at night
and making things annoying for me?

726
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:55,640
Buy some liquor.

727
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,020
Who's got liquor?

728
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:59,570
Come on, you're my only friend around here,

729
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:01,220
go buy some beer.

730
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:04,990
Hey, I hear you're making
lots of money these days.

731
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:08,160
I keep hearing about how people come

732
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,750
from far away just to taste your coffee.

733
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:14,520
Ah, money sure is nice.

734
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:18,740
Why is that because of money?
It's because of my coffee.

735
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:23,420
They're coming because of all the money
that was used to renovate everything.

736
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,300
Think of how it used to be.

737
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,300
Who'd go to a dump like that?
There's no reason to.

738
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,440
True, it's not just
because of my coffee.

739
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:34,770
The kids work hard.

740
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:40,070
I didn't think I'd get attached to them,
but they can act cute.

741
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:44,330
You're old, seeing kids as cute.

742
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:48,640
Ku Young Dal wants to date you.
He's pretty decent.

743
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,300
Mr. Ku's a nice man. I know that.

744
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:55,550
Since I know that, I hope he can
meet a nice lady and live happily.

745
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:58,010
I hear the woman he met on the
date is still an unmarried lady.

746
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:01,750
I'm sure they'll be good together.

747
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:07,030
Think it over carefully.
Don't kick him aside and regret it later.

748
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:09,560
Oh, right.

749
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:12,190
That cafe manager and my Eun Chan...

750
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:14,070
- How are they at the cafe?
- Huh?

751
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:18,850
She's completely depressed,
and doesn't eat.

752
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:20,310
Don't worry too much.

753
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:24,910
Sure, she might feel like she'll die now,
but time takes care of that.

754
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:27,530
That's what's great about youth.

755
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:29,860
Is the manager really angry?

756
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,850
Why wouldn't he be? Of course he is.

757
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:38,290
Man, I want a drink.
You don't even buy me any beer.

758
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:39,370
Good night.

759
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:41,550
Don't drink!

760
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:43,410
Just like a wife.

761
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:45,850
When did you get here?

762
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:47,210
In the afternoon.

763
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:50,120
You should have called.
I'd have come home earlier.

764
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:54,230
It's been a long time since
I have had these noodles.

765
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:55,250
Looks great.

766
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:56,170
Mom, you have some too.

767
00:51:56,850 --> 00:52:00,480
You're not just acting like you want
to eat to make me feel better, are you?

768
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:03,490
Do you think I'm stupid?

769
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:06,280
Why would I eat all
this if I wasn't hungry?

770
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,420
Mom, have some.

771
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,730
If I eat at this hour, it'll
go straight to my stomach. No.

772
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:14,480
But it's okay for your
twenty-something son to develop a belly?

773
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:15,670
Yes.

774
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,360
Eat slowly.

775
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:30,170
I met Dad's friend.

776
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:34,290
I heard from your father.

777
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:42,210
You miss your birth mother, don't you?

778
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:45,110
I saw her picture.

779
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:49,310
He gave it to me.

780
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:53,800
He did?

781
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,870
Seems they were close.

782
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:02,240
Are you sad?

783
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:05,170
Not really.

784
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,250
She gave me such a handsome son...

785
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,770
and passed away first without
being able to see you grow up.

786
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:22,280
I feel worse for her.

787
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:24,840
I feel very sorry, and grateful.

788
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:29,460
Mom.

789
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:31,460
Yes?

790
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,490
I just want to say this.

791
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:44,070
I think you're the only person in the
whole world who has faith in me.

792
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,820
Who could that be at this hour?

793
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:03,110
Madam, it's you.

794
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:04,570
It's Manager Hong.

795
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:08,890
Wow, the view's great here.

796
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:13,110
When I've made tons of
money, sell this place to me.

797
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:16,700
Okay.

798
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:21,880
You're a lot softer than you look.

799
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,320
Is that not true?

800
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:31,550
You look like you wouldn't bleed a
drop if you were pricked with a needle.

801
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:34,520
But you totally fell
for such a little girl.

802
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:39,280
It's a little weird to call her a girl.
Should I just call her a guy?

803
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,110
Or jerk? That jerk!

804
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,820
Or should I just say girl?

805
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:46,940
You sure had fun watching.

806
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:48,950
In the past...

807
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:53,650
there was this girl I loved a ton.

808
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,190
Who? Someone you ran the cafe with?

809
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,970
She was a really, really good liar.

810
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,820
Everything she said was a lie.

811
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:15,510
She'd say she was going to meet friends,
but ending up drinking with guy classmates.

812
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:19,570
She'd say she was stopping by at home,
and then go out dancing with friends.

813
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:23,250
If I gave her money to go to the
hospital because she said she was sick,

814
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:24,560
she'd go and buy rings and bags.

815
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:28,670
I don't know how she
was such a good liar.

816
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:30,550
Do you know what she
said when she left me?

817
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,550
That she was going to study abroad.

818
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:37,970
There was something she'd wanted
to study since she was young,

819
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:39,550
and she said she wanted
to go really badly.

820
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:42,530
So even though it hurt me to let her go,
I even gave her money

821
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:43,530
and sent her off, and said I'd wait.

822
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:48,080
Then a year later,
she wound up marrying some other guy.

823
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,610
You really loved someone like that?

824
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:59,770
Because of her, I added to my
debts, I lost long time friends...

825
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:03,000
What's so funny?
It should make you angry.

826
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,980
Whenever I think of
that woman, I just laugh.

827
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,220
She must've really liked me though.

828
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:15,890
Going out with friends, drinking,
playing, and I still liked her.

829
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:21,920
She must've thought I'd dislike
her if I knew all that about her.

830
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:25,600
How much must she have liked
me to keep lying like that?

831
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:30,350
I'd never even fought with her once.

832
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:31,870
That's a lie.

833
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:32,750
No, it's true.

834
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:38,270
If I got angry, there was one decisive
way to melt that anger at once.

835
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:46,710
"Hong Gae Sik, so you're angry.
Can you really live without that woman?"

836
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:49,670
I'd ask myself that.

837
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:54,500
Then, my anger would just die away.

838
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:00,330
Is that what you came to tell me?

839
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:03,050
That if I'm not going to
break up with Eun Chan,

840
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:04,590
I should let this go,
that a good thing is a good thing.

841
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:07,350
You're always like that.

842
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:14,440
Don't, if you don't want to.

843
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,600
Gotta have another drink.

844
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,970
Go Eun Chan, taking care of your family.

845
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:35,060
Here's a present for you.

846
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:42,550
Whether you're a man, or an alien...

847
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,200
I hate you.

848
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,080
I said I hate you.

849
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:05,180
I miss you.

850
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,050
I miss you.

851
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:16,690
I miss you.

852
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:24,670
I miss you...

853
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:32,980
Honestly, it was fun watching.

854
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,730
It was funny watching
you act as brothers.

855
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:42,050
If the Manager was serious about you,
I'd be angry too. I understand him.

856
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,960
What do you call each other now?

857
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:53,110
Is he your oppa now?

858
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,690
I don't really care if
I'm called hyung or oppa.

859
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:58,050
What?

860
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,070
You don't care?

861
00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:03,600
You don't think about how others
feel around you, and you don't care?

862
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:07,180
Must be nice to be as
carefree as you, No Sun Ki.

863
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,280
Everyone's on your side here.

864
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:21,510
How great to have so much support.

865
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:26,170
I'm sorry. I was short-sighted.

866
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:28,610
I should have said so from the start.

867
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:32,080
I didn't know things would come to this.

868
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,510
I don't want to hear it,
so pack up and leave.

869
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:34,690
Wait, listen to me.

870
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,550
It must've been fun for you.

871
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,730
A guy out of his mind asked
you to act as his boyfriend,

872
00:59:45,970 --> 00:59:48,870
and paid you for going along,

873
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,820
and found you a job,

874
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:52,780
and said he liked you even as a man.

875
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:55,620
That's how it must've been.

876
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,020
I must've looked like such a pushover.

877
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:04,600
Miss Go Eun Chan,
when were you planning on telling me?

878
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:08,040
You must've had plenty of opportunities.

879
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:12,950
When I said we should be sworn brothers,

880
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,420
didn't you understand what
feelings drove me to say that?

881
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:19,720
Couldn't you figure out
how I felt toward you?

882
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,790
Do you know how hard it was for
me when we were at the beach,

883
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:26,740
and why I didn't come to work for days?
Did you really not know, you jerk?!

884
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:31,110
Tell me.

885
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:33,400
Did you really not know?

886
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:38,540
I couldn't say the words.

887
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:44,140
I didn't know how I'd
act if you got this angry,

888
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,060
and I thought I might not be
able to see you ever again.

889
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:50,770
I was wrong, truly wrong.

890
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:52,750
You were only thinking of yourself.

891
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:56,170
You didn't care about how much
you were putting me through.

892
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:00,850
When I said I liked you as a man,

893
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:03,860
when I said let's go as far as we can go,

894
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:06,860
you knew and still didn't say anything?

895
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:11,480
Was it fun?

896
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,530
It wasn't fun at all!

897
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:17,010
I liked you too much,
so I couldn't say it.

898
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:19,850
You said you were going
to America in a month...

899
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:22,010
We'd have to separate in the end anyway...

900
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,530
So I tried to pretend not to know.

901
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:32,250
Here I was, even thinking of
taking you with me to America,

902
01:01:34,310 --> 01:01:36,790
but you were already thinking
about sending me away.

903
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:41,430
What was I to you?

904
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:52,570
You... said you wouldn't like me as a girl.

905
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:55,990
You said you were glad I was a guy.

906
01:01:56,570 --> 01:01:57,840
What could I do, when
I wanted to see you...

907
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:19,600
The kiss was better when you were a guy.

908
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:24,930
What's left between us?

909
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:28,270
Was there ever any trust there?

910
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:36,140
I'd abandoned so much in
my life just to have you.

911
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:38,850
It feels so unfair.

912
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:42,750
You calculated everything to
make sure you wouldn't get hurt.

913
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:45,170
Without a care for me.

914
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,750
Ask yourself this carefully.

915
01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:35,710
Ask if you can live
separated from Go Eun Chan.

916
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:38,600
The fact that Eun Chan told you,
even now when it's so late

917
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:40,700
is probably because she has faith in you.

918
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,450
I feel angry at Choi Han Sung for wavering,
and hateful toward Eun Chan.

919
01:03:44,810 --> 01:03:45,980
Don't go, Han Yoo Ju.

920
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:49,470
If you hurt Han Sung hyung again,
I think I'd hate you.

921
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:52,920
If I knew this is how things would end up,
I should've said the truth from the start.

922
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,750
It would've been better if I'd never liked him.

923
01:03:57,350 --> 01:03:58,250
Go Eun Chan.

924
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,800
I'm glad you're a girl.
