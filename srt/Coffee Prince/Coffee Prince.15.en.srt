Coffee Prince
Episode 15

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,550
You're really not going to America?

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:09,700
Yup.

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,890
You're really not going?

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,840
Ask me again and I'll bash you up.

6
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,780
You've been asking non-stop since yesterday.

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,750
- But...
- Yes, I'm not going.

8
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,630
Really, really, really not going.

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,800
My not going makes you this happy?

10
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,580
Sit.

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,920
But you can't design blocks anymore
and that makes me feel bad.

12
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,620
That's your dream, isn't it?

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,850
Well...

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,010
I like blocks because I can work on it
by myself without others.

15
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,510
But doing this coffee business is fun too.

16
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,170
Everyone working together on something.

17
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,590
That's fine too.

18
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,720
After meeting granny,
I had some thoughts too.

19
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,770
I want to become a very
capable and fine woman.

20
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,950
So that I'd be compatible with you.

21
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,010
I won't just rely on my guy,

22
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,030
I want him to rely on me too.

23
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,340
That's the way.

24
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,690
So I'll work real hard to be filial to my mother,

25
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,070
and be a sister Eun Sae can be proud of.

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,310
Something like that...

27
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,610
Some constructive ideas along this line.

28
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,150
Eun Sae and your mother...

29
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,400
What about me?

30
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,850
There's no need to mention you.
Do you have to check on this every time?

31
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,070
It's so much fun to check on this.

32
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,990
What did your mother say about me?

33
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,130
What about Eun Sae?

34
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,420
Eun Sae?

35
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,800
She says you're bad luck.

36
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,760
My mother feels pressured
about your family background.

37
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,690
I'm not bothered much by it.

38
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,750
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,420
What granny did to you...
I'm very sorry.

40
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,380
It's alright.

41
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,900
Yesterday, I griped about her
in the toilet the whole time.

42
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,830
I said she was bad, very bad,
granny's really bad.

43
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,210
Let's go down.
I'll make you a delicious ice coffee.

44
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:01,990
Really?

45
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,060
Awesome!

46
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,210
She's not someone who
eyes your fortunes.

47
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,430
She's really, very fine.

48
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,990
There's nothing I like about her.

49
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,580
Is she pretty?
Or is her family impressive?

50
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,450
Not one thing is good about her.

51
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,090
What's your basis for
saying that she's not bad?

52
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,890
It's because she doesn't usually doll up
but actually, she's very pretty.

53
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,840
And what?

54
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,810
Family?

55
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,310
Can't you tell her family background just
by looking at her character?

56
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,220
She's much better than Manager Choi.

57
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,650
What nonsense!
What's wrong with my grandson?

58
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,380
Say the right thing even though
your mouth is crooked.

59
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,780
Who is the one who's made the Choi family's
source of headaches settle down?

60
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,290
When Manager Choi was still floating around unable
to assimilate into this place here,

61
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,650
it was Eun Chan who made him settle down.

62
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:49,070
If not for her, forget about the revenue
doubling within three months.

63
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,100
You should be thankful to her but
instead you're jealous of that kid.

64
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,960
What? I'm jealous?

65
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,160
Have you gone senile?

66
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,820
What?

67
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,090
I heard you gave Eun Chan a sum of money.

68
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,890
Thinking that money solves your problem...
that shows you're old and senile already.

69
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,880
Do you think money is everything?

70
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,600
Their family is one which runs away
at the sound of money.

71
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,020
You must know you're the one who benefited...

72
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,210
She's a very suitable granddaughter-in-law.

73
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,540
Who is my granddaughter-in-law? Who?

74
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,730
You've gone overboard at provoking me!

75
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,750
Well, maybe Eun Chan
doesn't want to get married.

76
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,230
It's your grandson who's more anxious.

77
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:24,720
You...

78
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,910
This is not bad.

79
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:41,730
What do you think?

80
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,830
It's a little unclear.

81
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,820
I should have changed my cell phone.

82
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,360
What are you doing?

83
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,950
Come, have a look.

84
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:55,950
So cute!

85
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,760
The baby I love.

86
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,590
Let me have a closer look.

87
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,150
No.

88
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,230
If you're so envious,
ask sister to make you one quickly.

89
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,690
Hey! Can the baby come out anytime
I want it to? Show me.

90
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,030
Tell it to come out now.

91
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,580
Just one more look!

92
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:09,870
Stingy fella!

93
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,280
Problems every two or three days.

94
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:16,300
A few days ago, my senile mother-in-law
was pulling my hair out.

95
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:21,140
Yesterday, my brother-in-law who's in his forties,
demanded that we pay his credit card debts.

96
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,560
You shouldn't get married.

97
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,410
Just work and travel.

98
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,130
Live a carefree life.

99
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,190
Mom, you've been married four times,
why do you tell me not to marry?

100
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,900
If you got married, it'll surely affect your work...
having to take care of the household,

101
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,800
and pandering to the likes of your in-laws.

102
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,940
They'll say they accept your past.

103
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,760
But once you're living together,
every now and then they'll dig up your past.

104
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,700
You won't be able to put up with that.

105
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,090
I'll just bear with it.

106
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,460
Who says I can't?

107
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,790
You're thinking of getting married?

108
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,710
Han Sung wants to marry you?

109
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,890
Girl, if he wants to then marry him.

110
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,660
Don't play hard to get.

111
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,710
You were just telling me not to get married!

112
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,110
Although that's what I said,
that's not what I meant.

113
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,130
Two's always better than one.

114
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:09,430
Compared to general fighting alone,
it's better to have two interdependent on each other.

115
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,510
Working hard at accepting his preferences,
naturally you'll find your heart opening up more.

116
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,650
Just look at me, see how settled I am now.

117
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,750
Problems will always be there.

118
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,050
Eat before it gets cold.

119
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,770
Yes, let's eat.

120
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,830
Get out quick!

121
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,400
I'm sorry, I'll change quickly.

122
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,060
Gosh! No Sun Ki is even singing now.

123
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,350
You! Recently you've been to that woman's house
rather frequently, is something happening?

124
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,130
You've slept with her?

125
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,350
Relationships are so two
dimensional in your eyes.

126
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,640
Then, what's three dimensional?

127
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,140
You're not sleeping with her?

128
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,090
It's fine not to.

129
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,840
You want a platonic love?

130
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,680
Is that what a passionate
young man should engage in?

131
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:03,110
Dichotomizing love into agape
and eros is a mistake in itself.

132
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,500
When you love her, you'll want to hold her.

133
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,370
You'll want to kiss her.

134
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,750
Then you'll want to make love to her.

135
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,050
How can you dichotomize this?

136
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,020
When your heart is moved,
how can your body not go along?

137
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,560
Your body always goes first, you jerk!

138
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,720
Sometimes, that's how it goes.

139
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,540
When isn't she out yet?

140
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,590
Madam, we want to get off work too!

141
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,890
Fine, fine! Sorry! I'll be right out.

142
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,560
Don't hurry her. If manager finds out,
he's going to blow his top at you.

143
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,590
It's so difficult putting up with madam.

144
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,580
What's wrong with him today?

145
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,540
Hey! Hwang Min Yeop, you look awful.

146
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,360
Sorry. I'll change in the toilet
from tomorrow onwards.

147
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,610
It's better if I changed in the toilet myself.

148
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,260
I think it'll be safer too.

149
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,300
Oh, really!

150
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,070
Did he eat something wrong?

151
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:54,900
Oh!

152
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,310
My Chan!

153
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,000
No,

154
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,070
Madam.

155
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,840
What?

156
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,710
Once you heard love not going,
you got so ecstatic.

157
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,010
This...

158
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,240
You and hyung,

159
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,770
any progress at all?

160
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:19,050
If you face any problems in this area,
come ask me any time.

161
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,280
Oh, really!

162
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,830
Try that again and see...

163
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,470
I'll sue you for sexual harassment.

164
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,880
Oh! How could you say that?

165
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,470
I only said that, thinking on your behalf.

166
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,250
Thinking for me?

167
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,390
Oppa!

168
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,300
Show me your butt again.

169
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,430
- Bunny girl, oppa!
- What?!

170
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,300
Butt... Bunny girl!

171
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,200
What are you doing there?

172
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,930
I'll be done soon.

173
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,460
Have you eaten?

174
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,040
I've made kimchi jjigae.

175
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,770
Go back to your parents.

176
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,020
I don't want others to say I'm a married woman
who seduced someone's precious son.

177
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,240
My husband will criticize me,
and so will your parents.

178
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,650
I beg you, please go.

179
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,580
If you continue doing this, I will disappear again.

180
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,060
Will you be happy that I run around to avoid you?

181
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,030
I've fried some saury, it should be delicious.

182
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,490
What are you doing?

183
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,590
Don't bother about me,
this position is more comfortable.

184
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,290
Ah! Really!

185
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,780
Focus your attention. Focus.

186
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,830
Are you showing off your long legs?

187
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,170
Yes.

188
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,170
Would you like another round of coffee?

189
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,090
No.

190
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,500
Ice cream?

191
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,700
Brush your teeth?

192
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:43,660
Soak in the tub?

193
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,630
No.

194
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,700
You're pretending to be studying hard.

195
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,680
That's how I am recently.

196
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,540
Interesting?

197
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,590
It's the first time I think
studying can be so much fun.

198
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,330
How about some ramyun?

199
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,870
Kimchi fried rice?

200
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,740
No.

201
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,910
Someone's talking to you.
How can you reply without looking?

202
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,810
I'm left with just one page.

203
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,760
You keep chatting with me. I spent 30 minutes
and yet I can't finish this one page.

204
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,090
Ah, really!

205
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,260
I'd better go.

206
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:23,510
Hey! How long has it been?
You're leaving so soon?

207
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,870
I wired you some money.

208
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,940
The debt I owe.

209
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,900
The sum I borrowed before I started work.

210
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,470
But I only managed half the amount.

211
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,820
The remaining amount...
the next month...

212
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,870
No, the next, next month,
I'll pay you back for sure.

213
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,620
I paid you with interest too.

214
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,590
What? Interest?

215
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,490
The closer we are, the more we have
to be clear in our accounts.

216
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,170
When did I ever ask for interest?

217
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,210
Jerk, am I a debt collector or some loan shark?
What's this about interest?

218
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,950
I should pay what I owe.

219
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,370
Then repay everything.

220
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,540
I took you to restaurants for some nice food,

221
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,330
I paid for the gas to send you home,

222
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,780
also the money to get you
out of trouble at the cafe,

223
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,070
the money for the instant noodles
and coffee in my house,

224
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,270
repay me everything.

225
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,060
Why are you yelling all of a sudden?

226
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,160
And that was all before we started dating...

227
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,730
Even if we were dating,

228
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,010
how can a debt not be repaid?

229
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,050
Are you being charitable seeing that I'm pitiful?

230
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,550
Charitable? Are you finished?

231
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,430
I'm going.

232
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,070
Where are you going?

233
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,700
I'm not done yet.

234
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,970
Sit down.

235
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,480
I know you're strong and righteous.

236
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,990
But don't do this to me.

237
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,780
Tomorrow, I'll wire the money back to you.

238
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,520
No.

239
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,030
I borrowed it from you so just take it back.

240
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,060
Would you take it back if it were you?
Think of my position too.

241
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,790
My girl is having financial difficulty,
which man on earth will ask her for money back?

242
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,770
No matter how rich the woman was,
the man wouldn't ask too.

243
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,180
Don't belittle these things.

244
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,260
Even between parents or siblings,
I think money owed should be paid up.

245
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,840
It's not like I'm unable to earn money to repay.

246
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,680
Without that money, it's not like
I'll be sleeping in the streets.

247
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,230
There's no reason for me not to repay.

248
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,470
Must you really do this?

249
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,790
I said I don't want it.

250
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,610
Only then can I be at ease.

251
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,490
You're really stubborn.

252
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,740
I don't care. I'm off.

253
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,780
Hey! Hey! Where are you going? Jerk!

254
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,750
Stop right there? Jerk!

255
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,180
One! Two!

256
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,970
Two and a half! Three! Hey! Stand there!

257
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,540
Hey, you're not really gone, right?

258
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,460
I know you're standing outside.
Come back in. Hey!

259
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,750
Don't go!

260
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,940
Hey!

261
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,580
One! Two! Two and a half!

262
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,380
Hey! Really! Hello?

263
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,970
Don't smile!

264
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,560
I'll put on 10kg.
Can you imagine that?

265
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,170
So you mean you'll become like this?

266
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,500
This shape is rather comfortable too.

267
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:45,090
In future you can read your book on top of this.
It's great, right?

268
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,170
Really!

269
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,030
You saw your mother?

270
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,180
Yes.

271
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,160
She told me not to get married.

272
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,540
She said no one on earth
will put up with me.

273
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,870
What's wrong with you?

274
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,140
Here.

275
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,690
Come.

276
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,320
Am I like that?

277
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,880
Well...

278
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:21,880
Once you get started with your work,
you'll bury yourself in it for a month or two.

279
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:26,390
When you choose to leave,
you'll do so even if the sky falls down.

280
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,860
Occasionally, you'll fall for someone else.

281
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,240
That's all.

282
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:37,080
I've put up with all that.
Is there anything else?

283
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,250
That's true.

284
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,420
So there is one man here
who's willing to put up with me.

285
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,430
But...

286
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:47,450
Your parents don't like me, right?

287
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,480
That is an obstacle.

288
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,910
Hold the umbrella.

289
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,930
Let's get married.

290
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,670
Using a cracker as a ring,
is this your proposal?

291
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,750
Our baby...

292
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,250
I want him to grow up in
a healthy environment.

293
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,520
In the family register...

294
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,360
Father - Choi Han Sung,
Mother - Han Yoo Ju.

295
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,480
Like that?

296
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,950
Please think about it.

297
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,920
So you're not calling, huh?

298
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,320
The number you've dialed...

299
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,220
The number you've dialed...

300
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,730
Her phone is off!

301
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,310
How dare you turn your phone off now!

302
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,310
Hey! One! Two! Two and a half! Three!

303
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,590
Ah! Really!

304
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,520
Did she really go home or
something else happened?

305
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,640
Maybe her battery is dead?

306
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,610
Manager Choi, calm your nerves.

307
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:15,770
Oh my gosh?

308
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,150
Oh my gosh! Ah!

309
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,750
How many times did he actually call me?

310
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,710
I'll send him a message.

311
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,430
I'm sleeping.

312
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,710
See you tomorrow.

313
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,290
Okay.

314
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,200
He's indeed stubborn.

315
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,590
- I'm
- I'm...

316
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,320
Sleeping.

317
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:18,950
Sleeping?

318
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,030
See you tomorrow.

319
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,170
Muahaha.

320
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,220
She's totally fooling with me.

321
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,130
Darn.

322
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,150
She wants to return me the money.

323
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,850
Not just the principle sum,
including interests too.

324
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,100
Does that make any sense?

325
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:35,900
It's a headache, right?

326
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,300
According to how I felt at that time,
I should have punched her.

327
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,610
Yours compared to mine is nothing at all.

328
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,580
What?

329
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,610
I'm proposing to a woman pregnant with my child,
yet I have to put up with her idiosyncrasy.

330
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,820
Afraid she would get angry,
I had to beat around the bush for a while.

331
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:51,730
The pregnant lady wouldn't even
bat an eyelid at my proposal.

332
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,120
What are you talking about?

333
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:55,600
What?

334
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,390
She's pregnant?

335
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:05,980
Yes.

336
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,230
Four weeks.

337
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,180
Four!

338
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,510
You've hit the lottery!

339
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,500
Let me have a look.

340
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,480
This is...

341
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,270
Where's the baby?

342
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,270
Right here. Can't you see?

343
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,510
Like a fan.

344
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,350
See? Beautiful, right?

345
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,790
See how happy you are!

346
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,940
But, what if...

347
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,560
It's a baby girl who looks just like you?
That's be terrible.

348
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:34,520
Why?

349
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,840
If it's a girl, of course it's better
for her to look like Han Yoo Ju.

350
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:45,020
But as a girl, she shouldn't act too strong,
just depend on the guy occasionally, that'll be fine.

351
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,310
It's worrying if the girl is too capable.

352
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,020
You can't stop her from growing.

353
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,120
But I'm still envious of you.

354
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,180
What for?

355
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,820
Aren't you a proponent of independent living?

356
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,260
Have you changed?

357
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,400
I'm crazy about Go Eun Chan.

358
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,790
I want to live with her.

359
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,560
Lunatic!

360
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,070
You've really changed a whole lot.

361
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,970
Would marriage be good?

362
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,930
Isn't it better to regret getting married
than regret not getting married?

363
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:16,140
Seems like it could be a good idea.

364
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,180
Right?

365
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:17,870
Huh?

366
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,530
What?

367
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,600
Nothing.

368
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,080
Marriage.

369
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,350
Really!

370
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:44,570
Go Eun Chan! Go Eun Sae!
Wake up now for your food!

371
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,860
Food!

372
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,910
It's time to eat.

373
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,380
Madam.

374
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,950
Did Hwang Min Yeop say anything to you?

375
00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:00,250
Why would he dare to try? He'll die.

376
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,020
He's so slow to react.

377
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,050
I even kissed him already.

378
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,130
What?

379
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,870
What did you say?

380
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:13,150
Don't tell me... he forgot
the touch of my lips so quickly?

381
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,010
Hey!

382
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:14,820
You!

383
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,360
You're just a student yet you dare
to try kissing. I'll tell mom.

384
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,460
Don't tell me you and Manager ahjussi
never kissed too?

385
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,960
That isn't the same as this!

386
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,560
You're an 18 year old student.

387
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:26,500
I... I'm a 24 year old adult.

388
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,630
At least you didn't say you never kissed.

389
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,050
Mom!

390
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,290
Feed me!

391
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,810
Hey! Hey! Go Eun Sae! You!

392
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,820
Stand right there!

393
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,140
The main selling point of Coffee Prince
is the branding of our barista.

394
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:39,870
Whenever one thinks of Coffee Prince,

395
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,880
it brings to mind the coffee personally roasted
and grounded by the barista.

396
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,520
The concept of handmade coffee in people's mind

397
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,900
brings them back again to the
barista's craft and sincerity.

398
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,430
Barista Hong Gae Sik.

399
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:54,440
His very name is the branding of
Coffee Prince branch no. 1.

400
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,400
Naturally, the barista of branch no. 2
will be its branding.

401
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,090
The second selling point is the friendly customer
interaction of our service personnel.

402
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,360
Just hearing to this may not mean much to you,

403
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:08,300
but all the big coffee houses now
are doing self-service.

404
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,940
The biggest weak point of that is
customers don't know how to make a selection.

405
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,040
I was good during practice,

406
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:19,760
but once the teacher says take it as a test,
then I take a look at the watch.

407
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,640
Then I just start to shiver like this.

408
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,520
You just need more practice, that's all.

409
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,890
Easy for you to say.

410
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,490
Just attending special seminars is not enough,

411
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,830
I need to register in a school.

412
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,420
What about the President?

413
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:36,230
I mean, Manager Choi's grandmother,
did she contact you?

414
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,630
No. Why?

415
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:41,220
They are very worried about
Manager Choi's marriage plans.

416
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:44,670
So they're forcing him to match make?

417
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,800
Don't you want to get married?

418
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:50,540
We haven't been dating for that long,
how can we be discussing marriage?

419
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,830
You know it too

420
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,060
that I still have a lot to work on.

421
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,210
Is that what Manager Choi thinks too?

422
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,040
Of course.

423
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,990
He's even busier than me.

424
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,630
Don't tell me...

425
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,050
He really went matchmaking?

426
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,090
If he dares...

427
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,070
I'll be back late tonight,
don't wait up for me.

428
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,660
Does she feed you?

429
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,290
Yes. Before I get chased out,
I force my way into getting some food first.

430
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,300
Then just pack up and live there.

431
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,260
Who knows?

432
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,140
Maybe it'll work out that way.

433
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:22,670
What for? It's fine as it is now.

434
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,620
No?

435
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,410
Huh?

436
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,830
I like it the way it is now.

437
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,950
Hello?

438
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,630
Have you been well?

439
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,070
I'm Han Kyul's mother.

440
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,370
Hello.

441
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,760
Raw fish doesn't need any cooking,
so I like it very much.

442
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,660
What's this?

443
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,050
It's lotus shoot.

444
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,990
Eat this before anything else.

445
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,980
It's an appetizer.

446
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,020
Thank you.

447
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,170
It's a little bitter.

448
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,160
But quite good.

449
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,520
Are you uneasy?

450
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,920
No.

451
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:10,470
I asked about an obvious thing.

452
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,620
Right?

453
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,360
Just speak easily with me.

454
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,140
Han Kyul seems like...

455
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,670
He has intention to marry you.

456
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,050
You two have discussed it?

457
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,380
He's not someone who speaks without thinking.

458
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:30,320
You've known each other for
hardly three months,

459
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,560
so I'm worried if he's a little too anxious.

460
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:38,530
I know both granny and you are very worried.

461
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,200
As I see it,

462
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,700
I'm too far off from the manager now.

463
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,050
He's a fine man.

464
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:49,260
He's handsome and smart and capable.

465
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,190
Seeing him as he is,

466
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,300
I, too, have my own goals.

467
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,610
I want to become a capable person too.

468
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,730
So I can't get married right away.

469
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:03,620
I've yet to achieve anything so far.

470
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,250
What are you hoping to achieve?

471
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,730
Not a big goal really...

472
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,850
I'd like to become a barista.

473
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,770
You should know this too

474
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,900
that the manager really loves his family.

475
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,150
He won't let you worry about him.

476
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,480
So cute!

477
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,160
Sorry!

478
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,660
I'm so late.

479
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,050
You're back.

480
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
What are you doing?

481
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,750
Hey, that...

482
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,970
Cute, right?

483
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,690
Give me five minutes to wash up.

484
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,030
We haven't done this for some time.

485
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,580
Dancing like this.

486
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,690
I have something to say.

487
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,880
I just knew something was up,

488
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,900
You even wanted to dance.

489
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:15,010
I've thought about it,

490
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:17,210
there's nothing great about marriage.

491
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:23,500
If it really doesn't work out,
we can still break up.

492
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,700
We've broken up more than
once or twice already, as it is.

493
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:43,770
Will you marry me?

494
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,480
What's this?

495
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,170
I can't promise you the stars and moon in the sky.

496
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,880
And I'm sorry that...

497
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:57,550
Your hands may still get cold in the water.

498
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,490
But I'll work hard at it.

499
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:06,140
When I can't take it anymore
just by my loving you alone,

500
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,970
I'll work even harder.

501
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:11,310
Will you accept this?

502
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,040
Han Yoo Ju!

503
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,830
You're really good at shocking people.

504
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:37,170
I'm not confident I'll be that
perfect daughter-in-law for your parents.

505
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,760
But even so, I'll work hard at it.

506
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:41,810
Ah! Now, I...

507
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,880
What should I say? Ah!

508
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:47,810
You've made me into a fool,
my head's completely empty!

509
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:52,420
I... want to have a baby just like you.

510
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,870
Thanks...

511
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,180
For being by my side.

512
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,810
I love you.

513
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,430
Me too.

514
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:13,510
I love you lots more.

515
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:16,980
Thank you.

516
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:34,970
Yes, brother?

517
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,200
Hey! Choi Han Kyul.

518
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,850
Han Yoo Ju put a ring on my finger.

519
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:39,070
She asked me to marry her.

520
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,580
I'm going insane.
Is this a dream or for real?

521
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,510
Really, hyung?

522
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:43,430
Let's meet up, all four of us, to celebrate.

523
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,180
No, no, not now.

524
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,530
My baby wants cold noodles.

525
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,280
I'm out buying cold noodles.

526
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,400
Choi Han Sung finally made it.

527
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,420
How did you convince her?

528
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,930
You couldn't have promised her everything, right?

529
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,320
You want to die? Hang up!

530
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,540
Just like this? Then why did you call...

531
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,260
So you're calling just to brag?

532
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:05,880
Yes, I'm bragging, you fool!

533
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,800
Really.

534
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,740
See how happy he is.

535
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,370
Hey! Go Eun Chan.

536
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,600
Fine. I'll let you win this round.

537
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,160
This is all I want from you.

538
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,980
Next month if you wire money to me again,
I'll punch you for sure.

539
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,200
Did you hear me?

540
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,670
I did not.

541
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,760
Really!

542
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,270
I'm not done yet.

543
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,970
Hey! Aren't you giving me an answer?

544
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,790
Ah! Must she really...

545
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,990
Her five commandments.

546
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:50,500
First, no more hounding her.

547
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:53,720
Two, treat her only as a neighbor.

548
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,840
Three, do not get involve in her family matters.

549
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:59,880
Four, no silly smiles when I see her.

550
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:03,960
Five, even if she walks past the shop,
I will not go out for a look.

551
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,210
Only by doing this, will she notice me.

552
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,880
Otherwise, she will leave me for good.

553
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:08,620
Again.

554
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,990
One, no more hounding noonim.

555
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,280
Two...

556
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,570
What are you doing?

557
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,690
Welcome.

558
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,960
What do you want?

559
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,030
Something for boiling soup.

560
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,640
Boiling soup.

561
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,940
How?

562
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:39,730
Are you feeling better?

563
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,960
Yes.

564
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,780
Thanks to you.

565
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,050
No, you don't have to cut it all up.

566
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,960
There aren't many in my family, anyway.

567
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:53,840
Grill it with the kids tonight.

568
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,340
If you have any leftovers,
just put it into the soup.

569
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,610
It seems you've sorted out your feelings already?

570
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,650
Yes.

571
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:08,190
Although it wasn't my intention,
I've put you through quite a lot recently.

572
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,680
I'm sorry.

573
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:13,090
I won't bother you again in future.

574
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,850
Just set your heart at ease and
continue patronizing my shop.

575
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:19,590
When was my heart ever uneasy?

576
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:24,090
Telling the truth, I did make you uneasy.

577
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:41,930
After the girls are married, let's see then.

578
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,800
Thanks.

579
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:50,050
I thought my life as a woman was all over.

580
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,330
Yet you've been so good to me.

581
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,990
What you just said...

582
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,660
Later...

583
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,670
Eun Chan and Eun Sae.

584
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,830
After they're both married out,

585
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,570
and if you still like me then,

586
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,600
we'll eat from the same pot of rice.

587
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,490
Miss, miss...

588
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:24,880
The meat is still here.

589
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:40,890
Time over.

590
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:43,330
It can't be. You must be wrong. Show me.

591
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,990
The examiner says it's over so it is.

592
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,510
Did you purposefully make a mistake?

593
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,230
Just because of the wired money,
you're still unhappy?

594
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,450
Am I like you?

595
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:53,520
I'll make sure I get the money back from you.
You should be ready for that.

596
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:56,100
From now on,
I won't spend even one cent on you.

597
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,580
Oh, I've failed again.

598
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,060
Where did I go wrong?

599
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,480
I can make it dissolve in half a second.
How about if I showed you?

600
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,240
No need.

601
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,170
Hey!

602
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:05,450
Then show me.

603
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:09,320
Han Sung hyung and
Han Yoo Ju are getting married.

604
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,710
What? Really?

605
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,770
When?

606
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,090
That's great. I must call him.

607
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,590
No, don't call.

608
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,540
At night, they have lots to do.

609
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,830
They're looking at children's photos.

610
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,240
Han Yoo Ju is pregnant.

611
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,310
Pregnant?

612
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,340
Oh, that's great!

613
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,200
The baby will be really cute.

614
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,770
But, how is it they're having a baby so soon?

615
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:33,560
How many do you plan to have?

616
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,210
Just three.

617
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,760
What about you?

618
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:43,850
Me too. About the same.

619
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,420
Do you like cleaning?

620
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,660
Who likes cleaning?

621
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:49,390
Dishes-washing?

622
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,710
Can't you see how I break dishes?

623
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,170
But, why are you asking this?

624
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,440
Do you snore when you sleep?

625
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,330
I don't snore.

626
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,450
Impossible.

627
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,410
I have a witness too.
Ask Eun Sae.

628
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:04,560
I don't snore
but I do grind my teeth a little.

629
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,440
That won't do.

630
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,420
That won't fit at all.

631
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,390
My personality's not good
so I can't accept everything.

632
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,150
That won't do.

633
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:19,200
So love about is assessing this and that?
It should all be natural.

634
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,240
But what won't do?

635
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,160
Living together.

636
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,710
Huh?

637
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:23,820
You eat four meals a day, right?

638
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,170
And all high calories too.

639
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,420
Our dietary habits don't fit.

640
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,000
You're an early sleeper, early riser, right?

641
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,500
What's this? Nothing fits.

642
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,160
Really!

643
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,160
Forget it.

644
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,410
I won't be living together with you.

645
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,650
Not living together
then how about marriage?

646
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,690
Ah!

647
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:43,100
You're very particular.

648
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:46,320
But before we marry,
shouldn't we try living together?

649
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:49,510
Manager, you're thinking of getting married?

650
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:52,330
I'm just saying that's all,
I didn't say I want to get married.

651
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,050
I really shouldn't casually
say such things to you.

652
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:57,260
Oh my gosh! He's still upset
about the loan repayment.

653
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,390
Petty.

654
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,370
What?

655
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:00,680
What did you just say?

656
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,360
Too late. I've got to go.

657
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,130
Hey!

658
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,480
What kind of proposal would you like?

659
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,540
What?

660
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,810
What kind of proposal do you like?

661
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,190
I don't know.

662
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:21,680
A big diamond ring,

663
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,940
100 red roses,

664
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:27,500
and violins on a ferry boat.

665
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:33,230
A blown-up picture of myself
posted at the roof a skyscraper.

666
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:33,910
And what else?

667
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,280
Just go. Go.

668
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:39,420
There's nothing serious about you.

669
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:40,860
Forget it.

670
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,740
Are you angry?

671
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:46,630
Yes.

672
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:55,920
You're angry.

673
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,250
Stop it. I have to study.

674
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:03,700
You're angry?

675
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,750
Go.

676
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:21,850
Don't go.

677
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,210
Don't go.

678
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:54,220
You haven't been eating as well recently.

679
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,920
It's not that my body is unwell.

680
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,590
But because of Han Kyul,
my heart is not feeling well.

681
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:04,310
When he was drifting around aimlessly,
I was hoping to have him settle in a job.

682
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,420
Now he's making me worry
over his woman problem.

683
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:13,120
The thing I most regret in my life is...

684
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:18,180
I had to break off with Han Kyul's
birth mother because of your objections.

685
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:21,480
I don't want Han Kyul to go through all that.

686
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:22,970
So you mean,

687
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,330
even now you still love his mother?

688
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,310
I don't mean that.

689
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:34,580
Have some fruit before you leave.

690
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:40,890
Why are you so nice to a man who has
another woman in his heart?

691
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,990
Why are you bringing up the past again?

692
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,060
What are you unhappy about?

693
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,850
Nothing.

694
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,260
Oh yes, mother.

695
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,900
A few days ago, I met her.

696
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:51,900
Who?

697
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,270
Eun Chan.

698
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,630
Why did you meet her?

699
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,620
You're so free.

700
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:02,090
Initially, I thought she and Han Kyul
were so incompatible.

701
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:05,650
But the more I see her,
the more I think she's passionate and pure.

702
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,720
I feel very comfortable with her.

703
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,510
If we teach her well,
I'm sure she'll manage the household well.

704
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,080
She's different from Yoo Ju, mother.

705
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:17,400
Yoo Ju is a little hard to get along with.

706
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,550
Even though she's junior to us,
we still can't treat her as we like.

707
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:23,770
Maybe when we all get familiar,
it gets better.

708
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,240
But Eun Chan,

709
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:27,300
She's so easy to get along with.

710
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:31,950
You shouldn't think she's easy,
you'll suffer for it.

711
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:35,500
That's the kind of person who
plays games behind your back.

712
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:37,860
At this age,
you still don't know about these things?

713
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:40,770
Maybe there's even a chance
to hold your great grandson, mother.

714
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:41,770
Stop this nonsense!

715
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:45,970
Even if I wanted a great grandson,
I wouldn't want her.

716
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,930
Chew well as you eat.

717
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,070
Han Yoo Ju has become an ahjumma.

718
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,720
You're even making lunch for him.

719
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:03,420
I want to try being a good wife.

720
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,530
Why get married?

721
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,400
The way you're asking sounds like
you're discouraging me from it.

722
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,260
No.

723
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,540
I'm just very curious so I asked.

724
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,630
You'll think we will quarrel everyday, right?

725
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,100
Haven't you quarreled a
lifetime's worth of it already?

726
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,130
Oh my gosh! It looks strange.

727
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,680
You eat this.

728
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,620
What's this?

729
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,770
You look fine, Han Yoo Ju.

730
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,650
Now that you're getting married,
you seem even prettier than before.

731
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,000
Just a little wasted.

732
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,350
You think so?

733
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,470
Later, Han Sung and I are going to check out
wedding outfits, you want to come along?

734
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,110
I won't charge you.

735
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,390
I'm not eating this.

736
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,800
Just one more delivery, right?

737
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,720
It's all done.

738
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:57,370
I was on the phone with Han Sung earlier,
he seems so happy.

739
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,160
He's indeed very anxious.
He's gone to check out wedding outfits.

740
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,310
Really?

741
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:04,810
I'd like to try on a wedding dress too.

742
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:06,350
I'm envious.

743
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,460
Got it.

744
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,890
She'll be so pretty.

745
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,970
Sister looks so beautiful!

746
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,350
Wow!

747
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,050
Bravo!

748
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,240
How's this?

749
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,480
Don't ask.

750
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,270
Looks great.

751
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,790
Han Sung's really happy.

752
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,500
You try it on too.

753
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,670
How can I wear something like that?

754
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,230
She's really beautiful.

755
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:18,030
We have to get back, it's really late.

756
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,640
Would you like to wear that and marry me?

757
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,500
What?

758
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:28,510
Marry me, Go Eun Chan.

759
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:32,320
Now, you're proposing to me?

760
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:35,340
So Choi Han Kyul's
getting very anxious too.

761
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:38,120
No matter what,
you shouldn't do it like that.

762
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,610
What kind of proposal is this?

763
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,790
I mean,

764
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:45,980
I'd like you to think about it,
you don't have to give me an answer now.

765
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:48,250
It's not difficult to answer,
what's there to think about?

766
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,690
Hey! Hey!
Why do you have to answer me now?

767
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:53,010
Give it some serious consideration.

768
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:56,370
Of course I'll marry you,
what's there to consider?

769
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:00,420
Aren't you shy about it at all?

770
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,310
Saying it all out so directly.

771
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:06,040
When you hear something like that,
you should be so excited that you can't speak.

772
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,040
Or you'd be so ecstatic.

773
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,020
Oh! Really!

774
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,530
Who says I'm not shy about it?

775
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,530
I'm so shy.

776
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:15,970
No.

777
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:19,740
You proposed and I said yes.
Why are you still unhappy?

778
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,300
I almost made a big mistake.

779
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:24,570
You're the type that's big trouble.
I've been too careless.

780
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:25,750
What do you mean?

781
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:27,230
Rice for breakfast in the morning.

782
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:28,400
Sleeping early at night.

783
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,480
Short phone calls, clean rooms.

784
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,060
Separate laundry...

785
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:33,280
Oh, so difficult.

786
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:34,430
Cancel the marriage.

787
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,240
What cancel?

788
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,470
Yes, cancel it.

789
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,270
Hey, are you here to obstruct
someone else's wedding?

790
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,400
Spare us!

791
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,440
Hey!

792
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:47,360
You think you'll meet a better guy than me?

793
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,760
Hey! You better stand right there.

794
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:53,890
Come here.

795
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,790
Hey! Get out!

796
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,330
Hey! If you're like this, you better get out.

797
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:01,380
Choi Han Kyul!

798
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,190
Granny says to have dinner together tonight.

799
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,220
Hey!

800
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:08,530
The main branch will have direct control over
the selection and management of the other branches.

801
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:12,390
Just like now, our main push is handmade coffee.
Opening branch no. 2 then branch no. 3.

802
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:13,960
Continuing the business like this.

803
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:16,970
From this month onwards,
I'll be paying you a salary.

804
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,890
Why look at me like this?

805
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:21,190
You thought the company will
make you work for nothing?

806
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:22,990
I already appointed a position for you.

807
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:24,820
I don't want to be a nakasan.

808
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,370
Just work as you're doing now and
no one will dare call you a nakasan.

809
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:32,420
Your granny and your mother
are sharpening their knives now.

810
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,270
Are you planning to marry her?

811
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:38,040
I hope you will not object to it.

812
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:40,310
It's not easy to deal with
the womenfolk in our family.

813
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:41,560
You better be fully prepared.

814
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,860
I'm not easy to deal with either.

815
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,570
Oh, Yoo Ju's here.

816
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,330
Come on in.

817
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,490
- Let's go out, father.
- Yes.

818
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,060
Granny! Han Sung hyung is here.

819
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,200
What's wrong?

820
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:57,760
I have no idea.

821
00:44:58,170 --> 00:44:59,100
Let's go out.

822
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:01,980
Put on your shoes.

823
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:05,370
Stop pandering on me, you jerk!

824
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:06,660
It's no use, fella.

825
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,940
I'll say it again a thousand times.

826
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:10,120
I don't like her.

827
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,330
Wow! You look good
even when you're angry.

828
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:13,910
I'll carry you out.

829
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,620
So sickening, this fella!

830
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,260
Ah, you jerk!

831
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:19,850
Let's go.

832
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:21,000
Let's go.

833
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,700
Don't be like this.

834
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:28,930
Granny, I'm so scared of you.

835
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:31,980
Announcing granny's arrival.

836
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,770
- Hi granny, I'm here to visit.
- Hello.

837
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:36,140
You're here.

838
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:42,200
Your parents seem to be in a seminar
those few days around your wedding date.

839
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:43,060
Did they tell you?

840
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:43,780
Yes.

841
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:47,150
They wanted me to change the date saying
there's no way they're free at that time.

842
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:48,210
What a joke.

843
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:49,870
Just have it as you planned.

844
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:53,120
Waiting until they have the time,
you'll be old already.

845
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:54,960
Oh, those bookworms.

846
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,020
Sick of them.

847
00:45:56,090 --> 00:46:01,010
Granny thinks they're very busy so
she doesn't want them to rush here and there.

848
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:04,830
As long as you're okay with it,
just invite some relatives.

849
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,340
And hold a simple wedding here.

850
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:11,110
You could go to your
parents for your honeymoon.

851
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,410
How about that?

852
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,020
Of course we're happy with that.

853
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:19,120
After all, we have to consider
about Yoo Ju's physical condition.

854
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,770
You're so upfront with it.

855
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,620
You have good news?

856
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,560
Mother, it seems you get to hold
your great grandchild.

857
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,850
Am I right?

858
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:32,730
Yes.

859
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:35,800
You two have been getting together
then breaking up so often,

860
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:37,810
but finally you've done something well.

861
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,580
How are you doing with the baby?

862
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:41,550
I'm fine, granny.

863
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,310
When is the expected due date?

864
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:45,030
March next year.

865
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:47,550
Oh my gosh!
Spring blossoms in March.

866
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:49,400
Oh! That's great.

867
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,500
One makes me happy,
the other gives me a headache.

868
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,700
Sickening fella.

869
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:03,850
Oh! Everyone around me hates me.

870
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,080
So sad.

871
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,200
Who else hates you?

872
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:09,020
Is it Eun Chan?

873
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:11,170
Don't mention her in front of me.

874
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:13,090
Bad girl.
She doesn't listen to me at all.

875
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:19,330
I told her not to study, play with me but she just
doesn't listen to me and keeps reading, ignoring me.

876
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,750
And, she's too particular about things.

877
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:26,160
I'm most angry about that.
I lent her some money earlier.

878
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,260
But she insists on repaying me with interest.

879
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:32,300
I told her not to but she just wouldn't listen.

880
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,800
And she keeps nagging all day.

881
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,020
Save on the paper napkins,
why didn't we shut the taps tight,

882
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,020
saying we're some water-deficient country.

883
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:43,020
When there's leftover food,
she says we'll have to finish it all in hell.

884
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,500
She just refuses to let me leave food behind.

885
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,430
But it's my habit to have leftovers,
so she'll finish it all up.

886
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:51,320
I really don't know if she's thick-skinned
or she's just a real survivor.

887
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,000
She takes herself as
some righteous living girl.

888
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:56,000
You... you... you!

889
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:58,390
Oh my gosh! You jerk!

890
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,990
Say no more, son.

891
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:04,550
I, too, can make you a great
grandchild within a year!

892
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,650
Like hyung did, how about I just
go ahead and make one?

893
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,920
Don't use us as your example.

894
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:10,490
You have to solve it yourself.

895
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:12,470
I'll tell you clearly,

896
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,420
Geum Chan or Eun Chan,
that thing will surely not do.

897
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:19,440
Don't just object, you should give it
some serious consideration.

898
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:21,470
I have to be like others,
marry and live my life well.

899
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:23,470
I can't just keep drifting endlessly.

900
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,990
So you do realize you're drifting endlessly?

901
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:27,690
Eun Chan is very bright, and very kind too.

902
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:32,230
Grandma, to tell the truth,
she's much better than Han Kyul, really.

903
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:35,520
Wait, wait, wait!

904
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:36,510
Wait!

905
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:40,290
So those who agree –
father, hyung, Han Yoo Ju...

906
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,400
Sister-in-law.

907
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,020
Plus me, that'll be four.

908
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:53,630
I half-agree.

909
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,010
Daughter-in-law, you!

910
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,080
I really love you, mom!

911
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:02,100
Granny, as majority wins,
there's a conclusion already.

912
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:03,760
What will you do?

913
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:16,110
Must you register in the school?

914
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:17,520
Mind your own business.

915
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,210
You're really looking for trouble.

916
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,780
You should just concentrate on dating.

917
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:25,730
Han Kyul hyung has the money,
it's enough to just rely on him.

918
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:27,390
Why must you ask for trouble?

919
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:29,060
It's not easy to be a barista.

920
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,780
You should just look for
your rich lady and live off her.

921
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:34,760
So hyung hasn't proposed to you yet?

922
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:38,210
That's why you're finding a way
to support yourself, right?

923
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:41,680
But why does that lady keep looking this way?

924
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,960
Oh her!

925
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:50,130
Since a few days ago, she keeps following me.

926
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:53,000
What if I take on the offensive?

927
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:53,830
Brother.

928
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:56,840
Making a woman cry,
you'll have to pay for it later.

929
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:01,350
If a man ignores those signals,
he'll be punished for it even more.

930
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:03,570
Destroying a woman's...

931
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:07,500
Her pride will be totally destroyed.

932
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,470
He really doesn't worry about life at all.

933
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,480
He immediately attacks.

934
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,710
Excuse me.

935
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:28,130
Hang on to this for me.
Just for a while.

936
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:29,110
What?

937
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:31,580
I need to wipe this table.

938
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:41,510
Bring that in for me.

939
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:42,470
What?

940
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:46,040
Cute!

941
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,170
Great!

942
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:55,580
Um...

943
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,650
I brought this here.

944
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:59,600
Fine. Wait.

945
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:02,920
- How old are you?
- What?

946
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:05,600
20 years old.

947
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:07,700
As your oppa,
let me speak to you freely.

948
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:09,830
Oh! Fine.

949
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:13,500
You were here yesterday too, right?

950
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,630
Yesterday, I was here with my friends.

951
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:19,770
How did you know?

952
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:21,400
You were staring at me.

953
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:22,210
What?

954
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:24,660
When did I?

955
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,870
My name is Jin Ha Rim.
What's your name?

956
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,220
Han Byul.

957
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:30,690
Oh! Byul.

958
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:31,540
Star!

959
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,710
Wow! Your name's really nice.

960
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:36,930
If you want a date with me,

961
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,140
the shop will be closed in 30 minutes.

962
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:44,410
Just wait for me at the Jubi Wine Bar
at the nearby junction then.

963
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,100
Wait for me there.

964
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:54,690
Give me your number.

965
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,050
Just maybe I finish a little late.

966
00:51:58,610 --> 00:51:59,620
My number?

967
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:00,630
You won't? Then...

968
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:01,500
No.

969
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:03,310
Well...

970
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,430
Here. Take this.

971
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,040
Here.

972
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:12,900
You're really cute.

973
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:24,780
Go now.

974
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:28,800
This is great.

975
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:32,390
Byul!

976
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:36,460
- Is there a lot?
- Yes, a lot.

977
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:37,880
It's itchy.

978
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:42,100
Eun Sae.

979
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:45,490
Shall I tell you a big secret?

980
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:46,220
What?

981
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:48,230
You sold the ten-thousandth cup of coffee?

982
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:48,820
No.

983
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:50,900
Then you sold a hundred waffles?

984
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,830
No.

985
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,350
Then what is it?

986
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,050
After three bowls of rice and two bowls
of udon, you're still hungry?

987
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:56,820
No.

988
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:01,510
Someone proposed to me today.

989
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:03,510
Really?

990
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,320
He really proposed to you?

991
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:06,190
Who?

992
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,480
You're really going to marry
the manager ahjussi?

993
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:10,660
You mean I can't?

994
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,820
When?

995
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,800
About five years from now.

996
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,230
Is that too late?

997
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:18,380
Five years from now, I'll be 29.

998
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:19,910
He'll be 34.

999
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,600
Is he willing to wait till then?

1000
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:24,060
What else can he do?

1001
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:27,340
Dating for too long isn't good, huh?

1002
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:28,900
Then four years.

1003
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,470
Four years?

1004
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:33,000
You're speaking nonsense again.

1005
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:34,560
Madam, just look at me.

1006
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:38,540
The devoted Hwang Min Yeop... just because I was
a little arrogant, he gave me a cruel strike back too.

1007
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:40,680
But you say four years?

1008
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:41,800
Is that so?

1009
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:43,080
Too much?

1010
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:45,550
How is it you know less of the world than I do?

1011
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,060
No studying after meals,
the world just sleeps.

1012
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,420
Don't tell me you...

1013
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:53,660
You've done it with him?

1014
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,040
What?

1015
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,150
Why are you staring?

1016
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:58,460
What else can a guy and a girl do?

1017
00:53:58,540 --> 00:53:59,280
Other than that.

1018
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:01,390
Your thoughts are really...

1019
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,620
Just say it's not the case,
why did you hit me?

1020
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,090
Stop staring at me.

1021
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,430
What could we have done?

1022
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:13,130
We didn't.

1023
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:33,530
How old is the recipient of the ring?

1024
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,370
24 years old.

1025
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:37,070
Then, something more glamorous is more suitable.

1026
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:38,800
Cute and feminine style...

1027
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,780
She's not that feminine.

1028
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,220
Turn around.

1029
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,900
March forward.

1030
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,320
Like this.

1031
00:54:58,430 --> 00:54:59,790
Legs together.

1032
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:01,340
Lift your heel.

1033
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:01,950
Gently.

1034
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:03,530
Your butt. Hold it in.

1035
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,320
Eyes straight ahead.

1036
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:07,540
Oh! Your legs!

1037
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,400
Seems like it's not working.

1038
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,040
Just go in your pants.

1039
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,950
I'll just practise some more.

1040
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:17,290
Legs together.

1041
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:19,420
Lift the heel.

1042
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:20,410
Butt in.

1043
00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:21,840
Eyes ahead.

1044
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:26,720
Hey,

1045
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,410
I heard from Eun Sae...

1046
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:33,610
That your Manager proposed to you.

1047
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:35,950
Don't worry.
I'll marry in five years' time.

1048
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:38,880
Is he alright with that?
He's not young anymore.

1049
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:41,060
His family must be very anxious too.

1050
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:43,760
I met his mom.
She didn't say anything.

1051
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:45,210
You even met his mom?

1052
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:46,440
What did she say?

1053
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:47,950
Nothing much.

1054
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:50,790
She asked me when did I start to like him.

1055
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,110
She even bought me a raw fish meal.

1056
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:54,890
Nothing else?

1057
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,670
She's just worried that's all.

1058
00:55:56,790 --> 00:56:00,920
We haven't been dating that long
but he mentioned to his family about marriage.

1059
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,930
Oh, he's just a hyper maniac.

1060
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:05,060
What is she worried about?

1061
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:06,950
The manager's mother.

1062
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,460
What is she worried about?

1063
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,900
Is it because our family background
is lacking, embarrassing or what?

1064
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,900
What's her worry?

1065
00:56:14,090 --> 00:56:16,090
It's not that.

1066
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:19,030
She's worried that we're marrying too soon.

1067
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:20,560
Tell her I don't like it too.

1068
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:24,640
Marrying off my daughter,
does she think I'll be happy about that?

1069
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:26,490
What a joke!

1070
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,610
Yoo Ju!

1071
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:14,400
I'm so happy!

1072
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,030
Very happy? Really happy?

1073
00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:19,510
So happy I'm almost crazy.

1074
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:20,910
Don't be too ecstatic.

1075
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:23,410
You should have a flower too.

1076
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:28,500
Wow! This is really like a fairy tale.

1077
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:30,810
Ahjussi and unni must be very happy.

1078
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:34,150
Do you want to get married
at such a place too?

1079
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,650
Yes, maybe.

1080
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:41,310
Just to the knee.

1081
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,090
Nothing shorter.

1082
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:44,850
Like this?

1083
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:46,600
Hey!

1084
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:49,410
You're so conservative.

1085
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:52,080
Girls nowadays
even wear extremely hot shorts.

1086
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,220
What?

1087
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:18,830
Too small!

1088
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:22,580
Here.

1089
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:30,830
Is this a couple ring?

1090
00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:38,560
Please be my bride.

1091
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:45,080
Oh so embarrassing.
Why didn't you answer me?

1092
00:58:58,290 --> 00:58:59,180
Us too...

1093
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,050
Should we get married here?

1094
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,380
Five years from now,
I'm not sure if it's still around.

1095
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:05,910
Is it too late five years from now?

1096
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:07,710
Maybe four years' time?

1097
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,470
Four years? Five years?

1098
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:13,310
I want to get married this year.

1099
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:15,450
What are you saying?

1100
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:18,350
How can we get married this year?

1101
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,050
That's ridiculous!

1102
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:22,160
Why doesn't it make sense?

1103
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,530
Eun Sae is only in senior high year 3.

1104
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:26,540
There are still many more things I want to do.

1105
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:28,630
I'm only 24.

1106
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:31,620
Didn't you mean we'll get
married in five years' time?

1107
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:34,170
How can it be five years' time?

1108
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:42,440
Mother, I knew all along Yoo Ju is very pretty.
Seeing her today, she's just so beautiful.

1109
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:44,800
And she's an artist too.

1110
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:48,840
A caring husband like Han Sung
is hard to find too.

1111
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:50,950
I'm so envious.

1112
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:54,030
Mother!

1113
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,720
Mother!

1114
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,330
Mother!

1115
00:59:58,470 --> 00:59:59,710
Mother!

1116
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:01,410
Mother!

1117
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,380
Fine. Fine.

1118
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:09,250
Let's discuss this one by one.

1119
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:12,730
What's your reason for wanting to delay
the marriage for five years?

1120
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:16,690
I want to become an excellent
barista like Manager Hong.

1121
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:19,470
Before that,
I don't want to be married or something.

1122
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:20,920
Married or something?

1123
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:22,610
I mentioned this before.

1124
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:25,960
My dream is to let Eun Sae and
my mom live happily.

1125
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:29,010
In the past, other than earning money,
nothing else was important.

1126
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:31,030
But now I want to be a barista.

1127
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,610
Working is fun and I can earn money too.

1128
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:36,600
I finally have a dream I can achieve.

1129
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:38,780
I want to attain my goal.

1130
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:43,060
I don't know what you make of me.

1131
01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:45,540
But you can still do this after getting married.

1132
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:48,300
After getting married,
you can still be an excellent barista.

1133
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:53,860
If it's about your family,

1134
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:57,910
you don't have to worry about Eun Sae and
your mom in future, I'll take responsibility it.

1135
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,890
Responsibility? How?

1136
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:02,010
For how long will you be responsible?

1137
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:04,370
If you can't guarantee it,
don't sign a blank cheque.

1138
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:06,820
You mean you won't die?
You'll live forever?

1139
01:01:07,650 --> 01:01:08,760
What did you say?

1140
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:12,580
My father said he'd take responsibility
for our family forever.

1141
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:14,890
But he couldn't do that.

1142
01:01:15,090 --> 01:01:17,600
No one can take responsibility for others.

1143
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,860
It's everyone for themselves.

1144
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,520
Until I can accomplish things
on my own, I won't marry.

1145
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:25,690
What? You won't marry?
Stand right there.

1146
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:26,630
Wait.

1147
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:30,650
I already settled it with my family
and all the elders have agreed.

1148
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:33,520
As long as you say yes,
we can get married right away.

1149
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,170
You already told your family?

1150
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:36,680
You said you're marrying right away?

1151
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:38,800
How can you do that?
Without discussing it with me?

1152
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:39,990
Oh! This is unbelievable.

1153
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:41,170
Unbelievable?

1154
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:45,710
You said so yourself that
you were going to marry me.

1155
01:01:45,790 --> 01:01:48,030
But I didn't say we'll get married right away.

1156
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:49,840
How could you decide on your own?

1157
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:50,730
Me...

1158
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:51,850
Is my family that laughable to you?

1159
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:53,310
Go Eun Chan, why do you talk like this?

1160
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:54,770
Yes, this is how I talk.

1161
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:57,420
Hey! Stand right there!

1162
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,110
I'm sorry.

1163
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:00,630
But I can't get married now.

1164
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:03,160
Is the reason because you're giving me
your heart and I'm giving you money?

1165
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:04,850
Why can't you wait for me?

1166
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:06,430
Can't you just give me
a little understanding?

1167
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:09,250
I... I've given our baby seven names.

1168
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:11,290
The baby should be more important
than yourself, right?

1169
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:13,530
To me, both are just as important.

1170
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:14,830
What kind of man are you?

1171
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:16,810
If you love her, you should
understand her, right?

1172
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:20,630
Didn't she say she'll marry only
after she's succeeded? Jerk!

1173
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:21,860
I'm not going overseas for study.

1174
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,130
I wanted you to see the whole wide world.

1175
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,690
I want to be your support. I'm hoping
you'll grow stronger and have a better future.
