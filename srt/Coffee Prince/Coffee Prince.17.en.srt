1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,060
I don't want to send you either.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,730
When I think about you not being there,

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,390
I don't want to go to
leave for work or work either.

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,460
Do you think I'd want
to send you when I'm like that?

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,510
I want to show you a bigger world.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,520
You said that becoming a barista is
your first dream that you want to make come true.

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,720
If you're going to become a barista,
become the best.

8
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,790
I don't want you to give up
something because you love me.

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,130
I hope that I can be of strength to you,
and you'll be able to advance.

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,770
We may be separated now.

11
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,730
But later, much later.

12
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,140
When you first pickle radish,

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,380
when you hold the hand of your first child,

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,350
I'll always be by your side.

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,320
Even though it may be
hard while we're apart,

16
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,660
let's endure it.

17
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,340
Final Episode 17

18
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,220
Is this...?

19
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,990
Did you sleep well?

20
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,560
The day's gotten bright.

21
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,760
Oh no! My mom's going to kill me.

22
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,720
I came out without telling her.

23
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,960
I'll go with you and tell Mother.

24
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,000
No, no. I'll tell her.

25
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,240
Where did my clothes go?

26
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,880
There. I'll get them for you.

27
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,470
No! I'll pick them up. I will.

28
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,860
Hold on, hold on.

29
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,520
It's embarrassing, so why don't
you go somewhere else?

30
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,080
Hey. I'm looking at something that's mine.
Do you have problems with that?

31
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,170
When did these fall down?

32
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,910
What? What now?

33
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,480
There's one right here too.

34
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:38,960
Hold on.

35
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,260
You feel like a cow hair!

36
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,580
You can't eat stuff like this there,
so eat up and save it.

37
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,660
What is this girl going to eat when
she can't even eat greasy stuff?

38
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,000
It's a worry to send you.

39
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,240
What should we eat?

40
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,270
Train.

41
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,660
What is this? A universe?

42
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,360
You have to call often.

43
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,450
You have to call at least once a day.

44
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,440
Why are you doing this when it's not
like you're leaving right away?

45
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,630
When I said that I was going to New York,
you said that you were going to call me once a week.

46
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,330
That's then.

47
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,370
You're so selfish.

48
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,810
Don't grow your hair out
there or wear miniskirts.

49
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,100
If men ask if you have a boyfriend,
tell them you're married.

50
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,390
Just don't make yourself
stand out, alright?

51
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,560
Am I an invisible person?

52
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,560
How can I not make
myself not stand out?

53
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,250
Don't make excuses.

54
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,780
You can just say yes but
you just complain.

55
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,980
Don't over work.

56
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,540
If your head hurts, rest.

57
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,130
And relax your shoulder muscles.

58
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,610
Alright?

59
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,120
You just be careful.

60
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,280
When you go there, you'll get lonely.

61
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,810
If you're sick, you have to call.

62
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,010
If you just stupidly endure it,
then you're going to be disciplined.

63
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,890
I think we'll miss each other, right?

64
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,030
Yeah.

65
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,200
I'm going to look plenty at this face.

66
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,390
Eyes, nose, and mouth, all mine.

67
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,200
It's all mine.

68
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,030
Stop it. It's ticklish.

69
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,280
Piggy back.

70
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,260
Let's date everyday before you leave.

71
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,630
Where did you say that you wanted to go before?

72
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,390
Theme park?

73
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,070
63 Building? Movie theater?

74
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,390
MinSokChon National Folk village?

75
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,080
Let's go to all of them.

76
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,410
Let's go to all of them.

77
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,430
What about the Nam Sam Tower?

78
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,640
Nam San? Nam San.

79
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,710
- Oh, Eun Sae.
- Hey!

80
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,830
Hey. Are you in your right mind?

81
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,150
You were with the Manager
yesterday, weren't you?

82
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,390
What am I doing asking you?

83
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,510
Listen carefully.

84
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,970
I said that you were going straight
to the café after you exercise,

85
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,780
so don't come home and
go straight to work.

86
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,840
Alright. Thanks.

87
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,490
You two are indebted to me.
You know that, right?

88
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,470
I know already. Hanging up.

89
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,360
Is it home?

90
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,850
Eun Sae seems to be lying
about me to my mom.

91
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,760
I should give her lots of
allowance money then.

92
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,990
What allowance money?

93
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,800
Her personality's going to get bad.

94
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,690
Why are you coming together?

95
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,100
We met in the front.

96
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,900
Oh...

97
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,830
We should prepare to open.

98
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,580
There's something.
Something smells fishy.

99
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,270
She's still in the same clothes!

100
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,650
Something happened at night, right?

101
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,120
Really.

102
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,390
Did you make the Great Wall of China?
Is that it?

103
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,190
What Great Wall of China?
Just work.

104
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,900
I'm right.
Where are you trying to run away?

105
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,870
Look. Look into my eyes.

106
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,630
She always wears the same
clothes for three days!

107
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,090
Eun Chan!

108
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,540
What should we do for
Eun Chan when she leaves?

109
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:16,500
I think she'll need living expenses the most,
but I don't think she'll accept it.

110
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,760
We should get a round
trip airplane ticket for Han Kyul.

111
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,720
He's so down because Eun Chan's going.

112
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,780
We don't know if he'll go and come back
once a month if he goes on like this.

113
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,370
That's very different than someone I know.

114
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,040
What? Me?

115
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,490
What did I do?

116
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,460
When I went to study overseas in Paris,

117
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,640
how many times did you visit?

118
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,960
I wanted to go!

119
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,350
I was busy working on an essay then.

120
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,710
If it was Han Kyul, he would've just thrown away
the treatise and would have come flying.

121
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:44,570
I'm envious of Eun Chan. Envious.

122
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,240
I'm really envious of Choi Han Kyul too.

123
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,790
Eun Chan's probably six years
younger than you, right?

124
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,770
Are you really done talking?

125
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:53,490
Yeah.

126
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,180
Really? Really? Really?

127
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,850
Don't do it!

128
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,180
- I'll call you aunt!
- Aunt? Aunt?

129
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,100
Why are you walking
around like a grasshopper?

130
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,470
Why are you like that?

131
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,420
You work, work.

132
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,570
Congratulations!

133
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,350
Be quiet!

134
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,660
Congratulations!

135
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,420
Manager Hong!

136
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:43,560
Eun Chan and Manager Choi were in the bathroom
lowering their pants and were kissing!

137
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,310
Is it just a few days that they tease you?
Just let them be.

138
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,460
Look at him sweat.
Oh! Your zipper's open!

139
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,850
Go to the bathroom and
look at Eun Chan's face.

140
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,470
Her face is shining.

141
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,030
She came out! She came out!

142
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,930
Isn't it completely different
than yesterday?

143
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,910
- It's sweat.
- Sweat? It's sweat?

144
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,070
Hey. Your Byul was also shining.

145
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,960
Byul? Where is she?

146
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,020
What kind of situation is this?

147
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,570
She's kind of suspicious.
Isn't she a player?

148
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:24,620
Say something that makes sense.
What do you look in her to take her for a...

149
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,750
I don't know her background.

150
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,340
The way I see it, she's on
the top of your head.

151
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,540
Hey! Hey! Hey!

152
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,750
Why are you cleaning all day?

153
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,990
Aren't you doing it loosely because you don't
have that much time left before you go?

154
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,120
You have to mop hard in these places.

155
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,560
Alright.

156
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,450
Hard, hard, hard.

157
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,600
Don't keep doing it in the same place.

158
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,980
Do it in places like here and
in corners like this.

159
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,550
I already mopped it here
already a while ago.

160
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,130
Hold it.

161
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,020
Go ahead and mop in straight lines.

162
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,240
Straight.

163
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,570
Straight. Turn.

164
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,500
I'll do this area later.

165
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,600
Are you bored?

166
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,240
You're strong so... What?
Are you looking at your boss easily?

167
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,350
Just do what you're told to do.
Give me.

168
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,250
- Here. Do it quickly.
- Alright.

169
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,420
Do it next to the corners...
nooks and crannies.

170
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,150
There's a lot of dust in places like this.

171
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,600
Turn it around once.

172
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,110
- Like this?
- Right, now straight.

173
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,400
Straight.

174
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,000
Where are you going?
Not there!

175
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,700
It's dirty here so it's not something that
you can just do once. Go to the end again.

176
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,520
Why are you doing this?

177
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,690
- Straight! One more time!
- Like that!

178
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,120
Straight, straight!

179
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,870
Oh! What is this?

180
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,880
What is this?

181
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,870
Shall we look?

182
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,500
They're shoes.
Maybe a customer left it there by accident?

183
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,940
This looks like it'll fit your feet well.
Let's try it on.

184
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,020
Why are we trying it on
when it's the customer's?

185
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,760
Baristas have to stand for a long time.

186
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,550
Shoes have to be comfortable
so that the feet get less tired.

187
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,700
Did you hide it there?

188
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,560
How'd you know my size?

189
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,300
They were exactly one palm size.

190
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,280
You really make a person's heart flutter.

191
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,930
Thank you, but I'm about to get sad.

192
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,490
I haven't done anything for you.

193
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,450
There's something for you to do.

194
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,690
Scratch my back?

195
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,300
Where?

196
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:48,140
Here?

197
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,570
Yeah. Like that.

198
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,490
It feels good.

199
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:59,400
Don't shower every day and go to the
public bath and scrub off your dead skin.

200
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,590
You have to scratch my back
even when you get old, okay?

201
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,450
There are such things as
children's hands, you know.

202
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,740
But they say that if you buy
women shoes, they run away.

203
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:12,900
Are you alright with that?

204
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,660
Don't worry. I stuck a lucky charm
on the bottom of the shoes.

205
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,780
Really?

206
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:18,990
Where?

207
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,150
You are mine.

208
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,600
Choi Han Kyul.

209
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,010
His spirit sure is strong.

210
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,230
Don't overdo the work, and think of it as
eating and widening your experience.

211
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,580
It's not a time to be easygoing.

212
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,550
How hard it was for me to get
the chance of this overseas schooling.

213
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,310
So I have to work hard.

214
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,730
Don't you think when you're there
you want to see me as soon as possible?

215
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,500
I'm more worried about
the person who's saying that.

216
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,910
What about me?

217
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,630
What if you say that a week's too long
to wait and you come flying over...

218
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,940
Hold on. The battery's done.

219
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,910
Hold on.

220
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,250
Hold on.

221
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,960
Hold on.

222
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,360
Hold... It's done.

223
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,830
There's something I'm curious about.

224
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:18,820
Isn't your ideal woman the type of woman
like Yoo Ju unni who's sexy, slim, and feminine?

225
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,910
- I'm right, right?
- Yeah.

226
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,550
How'd you know?

227
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,790
Then I wonder why you like me.

228
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,830
I'm the direct opposite of Yoo Ju unni.

229
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,530
You know that my Red Cross
mindset is strong.

230
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,320
Who will save Eun Chan but me?

231
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,170
Your voice turns husky
because of one little thing,

232
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,470
You're stubborn so you never listen to anyone,

233
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,540
You drink well, your food expenses are...

234
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,630
Aren't I self sacrificing?

235
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,090
We're the same then.

236
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,290
You're not exactly my type either.

237
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,040
What?

238
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,510
Then who is your ideal guy?

239
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,410
A man that's like my father.

240
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,390
A man like your father?

241
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,300
Then it's a little far from me.

242
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:07,810
If I recall from what I heard, your father was
very caring and family oriented.

243
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,040
Of course. You are completely not like that.

244
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,830
But there are some similarities.

245
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,620
I'm like him?

246
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,910
Where?

247
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,570
Eyes.

248
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,520
Eyes?

249
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,440
When you look at me and smile,
you have the same eyes like my Dad's.

250
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,900
Hey.
My eyes are so handsome.

251
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,880
They're masculine and strong.

252
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,440
You don't see my kind
of eyes very often.

253
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,790
Why aren't you replying?

254
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:43,950
Hello?

255
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,980
Are you sleeping?

256
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,850
Go Eun Chan.

257
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,560
Really...

258
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:57,820
You have to hang up
so I can sleep too.

259
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:58,970
Mouse bell.

260
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,700
What are you doing? Hey!

261
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,570
How can you really sleep?

262
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,390
How cute.

263
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,290
Mouse bell, mouse bell.
Come in, come in.

264
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,540
Hang up and sleep!

265
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,000
So cute. What do I do?

266
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,340
I'm going to die.

267
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,770
Hey.

268
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,330
Eun Chan.

269
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,420
Wake up, wake up.

270
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:22,780
I wake up from the sounds
that come in the morning

271
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:29,160
- To the you that fell asleep in my arms
- Hello?

272
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:33,040
- Woah Woah Woah
- Hello?

273
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,590
I love you

274
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:48,480
There are no sad
separations between us

275
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:55,970
Don't drop tears because of sadness

276
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:07,790
Until the heavens split us apart

277
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:13,200
Until the heavens split us apart

278
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,320
Woah Woah Woah

279
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,660
I love you

280
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,830
One more time.

281
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,400
I love you

282
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,520
Once more.

283
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,180
I love you

284
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,420
Aren't you happy when
I wake you up?

285
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,980
Go Eun Chan, Go Eun Sae!
Aren't you guys going to eat?

286
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,470
She says to eat breakfast.

287
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,500
See you later.

288
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,880
Okay.

289
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,900
With you always

290
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,830
I love you

291
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:09,990
Woah Woah Woah

292
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,960
I love you

293
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,940
One more time!

294
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,710
- Are you crazy? What is this?
- I love you

295
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,280
Once more!

296
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,240
- Move!
- I love you

297
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,630
- Oh my!
- Manager!

298
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,750
Go home early since you must have
a lot of things to pack and organize.

299
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,420
Don't disappoint your mom.

300
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,720
Go home early and be with her too.

301
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,580
Yes, uncle.

302
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,620
Eat your meals and I'll be back in a jiff.

303
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:47,920
Get along well with my mom until then.

304
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:48,840
Alright?

305
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,170
You say your goodbyes
so long when you leave.

306
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,380
You're supposed to
make separations short.

307
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,130
Uncle.

308
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,820
You know that I like you a lot, right?

309
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,400
It's hot.

310
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,830
What if Manager Choi sees?

311
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,020
There's a hole.

312
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,460
It feels good, right?

313
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:47,670
Um...

314
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,830
Sister.

315
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,260
Do you have something to say?

316
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,900
What is this?

317
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,490
A present.

318
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,950
A goodbye present.

319
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,070
Present?

320
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,170
It's make up,

321
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:15,560
and even though it's not as much as Eun Sae,
you'll be pretty too if you dress yourself up.

322
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,430
Rascal. Thanks.

323
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:26,410
You know I really respect
and like you, don't you?

324
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,530
Don't worry about Angel and your mother
because I'll look after them.

325
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,600
I feel strong because you're here.

326
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,890
I believe you, Hwang Min Yeop.

327
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,740
Sister.

328
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,380
Fighting!

329
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,590
What are you doing?
It's awkward.

330
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,420
Take care of yourself,
and come back safely.

331
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,420
You'll do well.
I believe in you.

332
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,540
Thanks, hyung.

333
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,980
Fighting!

334
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,280
Fighting!

335
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,040
You're coming out already?

336
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,400
I'm not ready in my heart yet.

337
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,810
Brother...

338
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,200
even though we bickered a lot,

339
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,960
I really like you.

340
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,770
You know how I feel, right?

341
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:06,060
Why are you crying?

342
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,900
Don't cry.

343
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,980
Ah! I don't know.

344
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,520
My Chan.

345
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,000
Have a good time studying abroad.

346
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,930
I don't know how I'll stay
cheerful after you leave.

347
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,880
Since you can sleep and eat well
wherever you go,

348
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,550
that doesn't worry me.

349
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,280
But there's just one thing that does,
you and men.

350
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:54,520
You'd better not be won over
by some guy's flowery words or killer smile.

351
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,650
I'll handle Han Kyul hyung over here,

352
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,490
so don't worry.

353
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,390
If only you weren't his girl,

354
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,880
I could've tried pursuing you.

355
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:11,850
My Chan, I'll miss you.

356
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,860
P.S. Dreams come true.

357
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,730
Dreams come true.

358
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,240
Dreams come true.

359
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,400
Aja!

360
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,130
Crazy...

361
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,060
I can't.
I have to go to the studio later.

362
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,140
You said that you weren't doing a gallery.

363
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,610
But there is work.

364
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:42,850
You sure are too much.

365
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:47,640
I'm not working a lot nor meeting my friends,
and I'm really trying because I'm thinking of our baby,

366
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,660
but you're like this?

367
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,690
Is there something you want to eat?

368
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,530
Huh? No, I'm alright.

369
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:59,500
Then wait.
Your hubby is going to eat dinner.

370
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,010
Yoo Ju.

371
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,820
Yoo Ju.

372
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,540
Sleep more.

373
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,470
Winters there aren't as
cold as the ones in Seoul.

374
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,970
Don't pack it too much making it heavy.

375
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,660
Huh?

376
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:05,270
Don't pack a lot of winter clothes?

377
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,360
I'll go there in the winter,

378
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,230
so if you need anything,
I'll take it there.

379
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,230
You're coming in the winter?

380
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,360
Winter.

381
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,620
It's black...

382
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,750
Won't this be a bit small?

383
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:22,160
You can't eat rice without
bean paste and pepper paste.

384
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,660
I'll have to pack some more kimchi.

385
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:30,220
Mom! Some pepper flakes too.
It's good if you sprinkle it over some greasy food.

386
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:31,850
Why are you laughing?

387
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,400
If you go to the Korean market there,

388
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,580
there's bean paste, pepper paste,
and pepper flakes.

389
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,150
- You can just buy and eat it there.
- Really?

390
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:40,250
Mom! Don't pack it.
He says that it's all there.

391
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,720
You don't have to take these?

392
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,540
You have to study.

393
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,500
I read all of those.
Why did you bring them downstairs?

394
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,580
Take them away.

395
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,770
Put them back.
Grab this.

396
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,220
- Did you pack emergency medicine?
- Huh?

397
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,250
Stomach pain medicine
or pain reliever medicine.

398
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,920
It may not suit you,

399
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,330
in times of trouble, it's best you take it
with you since you can't speak the language.

400
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,510
Mom...

401
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,230
Where's the stomach pain medicine?

402
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,260
Hold on.

403
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,220
Yeah.

404
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,260
I can't rest my heart.

405
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,620
It's confusing. Talk on the
phone later and pack first.

406
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,450
Eun Chan.

407
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:08,280
Yes?

408
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,190
I'm not going to the airport
since I think I'll hold you back.

409
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,570
Okay.

410
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,530
I'll call you later.

411
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,080
When you go there,

412
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,820
don't eat anything that
you see over there.

413
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,830
And be careful of strangers.

414
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:04,360
Don't play along with them
because they seem nice.

415
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,040
Don't worry.

416
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,190
What else do we need to pack?

417
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,700
I wrote down all the things
we needed to pack,

418
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,700
but that piece of paper just...
Look at me.

419
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:17,490
Just stay.

420
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,330
I'll do everything.

421
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,730
It feels empty already.

422
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:01,850
Without Eun Chan, there's no spirit.

423
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,810
The Manager still hasn't
come back from a delivery?

424
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,710
Isn't he hiding somewhere and crying?

425
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,610
Should I have escorted him?

426
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:15,210
The air seems heavy.

427
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,910
The air... Huh?

428
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,470
But where did Manager Hong go?

429
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,270
Did the plane lift by now?

430
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,920
Rascal...

431
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:40,710
I told Mom and Eun Sae
not to come out either.

432
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,780
I felt like that my feet won't lift if I see Mom
and Eun Sae cry if they came.

433
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,530
You did well.

434
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:50,270
You might get nauseas
on the plane, so just sleep.

435
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,550
And when you arrive, the boarding
house owner will probably be out there.

436
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:56,120
You wrote down the
phone number, right?

437
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,580
How many times do I have to check?

438
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,980
Am I a child?

439
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,870
You're going to be late. Go in.

440
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,990
Call me when you arrive.

441
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,520
Alright.

442
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,720
I'll hang up now.

443
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,290
Be well.

444
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,020
Yeah, you too.

445
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,040
Execuse me...

446
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,980
I love you.

447
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:38,950
I love you.

448
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,260
Choi Han Kyul.

449
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,600
I love you.

450
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,070
I know, rascal.

451
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:00,130
Two years later...

452
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,840
April 20, 2009.

453
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,390
To Manager Han Kyul.

454
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,250
September 2008.

455
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,560
As I inscribe Choi Han Kyul and
Go Eun Chan into the Milano sky.

456
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,450
December 2007.

457
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,770
There are lots of handsome men here.

458
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,850
I've got a lot of them chasing me
around saying they like me.

459
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,070
Still, you're the most
handsome of them all!…

460
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,520
May 2008.

461
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,430
A day that I miss Manager.

462
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,960
Currently 10:40.

463
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,250
With the excuse that I don't
have a part-time job to go to.

464
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,350
- I'm sleeping late these days.
- I will eat well.

465
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,460
Did I come here to study, or play?

466
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:45,400
But thanks to you and grandma,
I'm learning a lot.

467
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,230
It's so interesting.

468
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,360
I'm really thankful for Manager.

469
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,910
He's so loveable.

470
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:55,590
I'll become an impressive woman
and go back soon.

471
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,570
I miss you.

472
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,380
I really miss you!

473
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,650
Ah, I really miss you!

474
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,110
I love you.

475
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,990
Here's a kiss for you!

476
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:09,970
January 4, 2009.

477
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:13,440
Let's go to the delicious hamburger
place together next time.

478
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,560
It's so big that I think
that I'll be okay to share.

479
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,710
January 4, 2009.

480
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,950
As I long for Coffee Prince,
I chomp on hamburgers.

481
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,710
There's not much time left.

482
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,710
From baristas to employees,

483
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,900
the 1st shop of Coffee Princess is planning on
capturing the customers with a female concept,

484
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,560
which will be different than Coffee Prince.

485
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:36,810
Manager, manager, manager.

486
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,960
Yeah, good.

487
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:48,630
Why is the main model like that?

488
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:51,270
She's so plain, plain.
She's too plain.

489
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,470
She's not even a nude model,

490
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,540
but why do they always take pictures
of her taking clothes off?

491
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,930
Yeop!
They all start off like that in the beginning.

492
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:02,410
And honestly looking around
no one has a fine body like Yeop.

493
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,690
Back models! Prepare!

494
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,830
Yes!

495
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,360
Yeop, don't forget.

496
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:16,200
My dream is for you to go to
Teacher Andre's finale stage.

497
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:19,220
Angel, I'll be able to have my pictures
taken in the front one day, right?

498
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,250
Of course. It's amazing that you've
come this far in just a few months.

499
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,220
Just believe me.

500
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,520
Good! Strong, strong!

501
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,740
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

502
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,520
Soo Jin, stick to that side.

503
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:34,830
Put your left hand on his shoulder.

504
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:36,460
Hello.

505
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:37,530
Here.

506
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,240
Take some pictures of that guy...

507
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:51,220
Did you get some airplane tickets?

508
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,770
I haven't yet...

509
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:58,230
What? One more year?

510
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,890
What are you talking about?

511
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:02,550
Its a privilege for the competition winners.
It's a waste if I don't go.

512
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:05,260
I honestly wanted to
study one more year,

513
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,740
and they said that
they'd pay for my schooling too.

514
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:10,260
And they say that we will go around
the world and do demonstrations.

515
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:12,240
I get greedy.

516
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,060
No!

517
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,430
You can't at all costs!

518
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,210
The contract you had with my grandma was that
you study for two years and return to work, right?

519
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:24,680
I even went into construction of Coffee Princess
around the time that you'd be returning, rascal.

520
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,950
Then should I give it up and go?

521
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:31,050
You don't like it, do you?

522
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:34,280
I won't do it if you don't like it.

523
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,000
I should get going.

524
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,320
I'll call you later.

525
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,330
Hey! You're healthy, right?

526
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,960
You aren't sick anywhere, right?

527
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,790
Of course, I'm strong to the bone.

528
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:47,210
I'm hanging up now. My Kyul.

529
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,700
Alright.

530
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,980
The person's phone is turned off right now...

531
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:03,800
Really... Why is she doing this when
I just went on a blind date for fun?

532
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,210
You want to do something?

533
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,500
Fine! Let's end it!

534
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,630
This girl's heart is so heartless.

535
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,040
Really...

536
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,910
Hold on.
Why are the doors like this?

537
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,720
Myung Soo!

538
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,330
Bring over the interior tentative plan.

539
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,210
Yes.

540
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,070
Here.

541
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:28,450
What is the Coffee Princess' concept?

542
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,910
A lovely concept that suits the princesses.

543
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,950
You're right. Lovely.

544
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,370
But where in here can you find lovely?

545
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,300
Is this a boxing ring?

546
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:43,080
Should I call Fedor and have a match here?

547
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:46,180
If possible,
don't skip strategy meetings.

548
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:48,240
I have to explain it to you separately then.

549
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,270
A person who makes coffee can just make coffee.
What strategy meeting?

550
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,880
Manager!

551
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,780
Are you not visiting anymore now
that your business is going well?

552
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,700
Visit more often.

553
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,360
Hwang Min Yeop,
is your modeling work going well?

554
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,520
Of course.

555
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:05,810
I even changed my name.

556
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:06,860
Hwang Min!

557
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,650
My Eun Sae thought of it.

558
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,660
What kind of Hwang Min...
it's so tacky.

559
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:13,070
Min or Min Yeop. Anyway, aren't you going
to send my sister-in-law home early?

560
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,430
Don't pass over 12 o'clock, got it?

561
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,610
You shouldn't do that.

562
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,990
When Eun Chan was here
you sent her home early in the morning.

563
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:21,520
You even stayed out overnight.

564
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,020
When did I?!

565
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:26,200
It was because there was a will behind it.
Am I the same as you?

566
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,690
Hello, teacher.

567
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,690
Hello.

568
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,150
My name is Ha Da Young.

569
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,200
I came because I wanted
to learn coffee from you.

570
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,520
Please take me as your student.

571
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,090
What is she talking about?

572
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:41,580
Coffee Prince is a place
where only guys work.

573
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,700
We don't accept guys.

574
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,830
What kind of rule is that?
Eun Chan even went here.

575
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,210
Hello, I'm Jin Ha Rim.

576
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:49,870
I'm 27 years old.
And what about you?

577
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,940
Hello. I know you.

578
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,580
I came here often.

579
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,870
I'm Ha Da Young.
I'm 24 years old.

580
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:58,100
My popularity is just...

581
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,290
A sharp nose, a slim chin, plump lips...

582
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:05,110
Wow, I think they're plumper
than Eun Chan's.

583
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,630
I think she's also my type.

584
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,840
What? Why?

585
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,620
I'm sorry. I'm late, aren't I?

586
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,360
You're very shameless.

587
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,800
Don't you know that your head is going to
get scraped if you're late on days like this?

588
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:34,980
My work ended late...

589
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,250
A glass, please.

590
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,430
You're empty handed too.

591
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,960
You don't have a single flower?

592
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,580
Look at this, look at this.

593
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:46,600
People who don't know about the situation,
think that Choi Han Sung is a caring husband, right?

594
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:50,310
They don't even know that he doesn't even
buy a single rose on their anniversary.

595
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,190
Why do you need flowers?

596
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,400
You're the flower.

597
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,580
Wow...
when you don't have anything to say, you...

598
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,870
Congratulations on your
second anniversary.

599
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,410
I really need to be congratulated.

600
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:04,500
Poor Han Yoo Ju has to live with
a husband who's busy day and night.

601
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,140
She has a lot of efforts.

602
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:13,630
What is it?

603
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:16,210
What do you mean, what is it?
You're making me embarrassed.

604
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:18,890
I reserved a suite.

605
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,970
I'll give you full service.

606
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,200
Oh! Really...

607
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:27,300
Idiot.

608
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,800
What really?

609
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,940
Massage.

610
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,830
- I said that I'd give you a full massage.
- Massage?

611
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:35,240
Massage? Massage?

612
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,490
Now?

613
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,150
You sure are busy.

614
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,940
Eun Chan will have to go to
a job interview when she returns.

615
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,720
Why are you using only women?
It'll be hard.

616
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,990
There are a lot of things that
need strength than you think.

617
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,630
I have to discuss it with her
when she comes back.

618
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,600
Is there a problem when
Eun Chan comes back?

619
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,810
She makes up for two people right away.

620
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,880
She probably won't be like before.

621
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,390
She will be older.

622
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,040
Revise the things that I have
marked and checked wrong.

623
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,410
Revise?

624
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:07,360
How many times are you
going to make me do this?

625
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,490
Even if madam will be in charge of the café,
you are being so strict on the checking.

626
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:13,560
You sure check well.

627
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:18,210
I thought she was gone a while ago.
What is she still doing here?

628
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,650
Is there a lot of stuff to do?

629
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:24,740
All the girls who come here
have great strength.

630
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,740
She's following after Eun Chan.

631
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:31,700
Madam told me that there was
a lot of scouting around her in Milano.

632
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,920
Seeing that she hasn't returned,
she may be having second thoughts?

633
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,640
Did Eun Chan betray him?

634
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:41,130
Shoot a movie, will you.

635
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,320
She said that she wanted to
stay there one more year.

636
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:45,110
Huh?

637
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,300
She did betray him.

638
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,140
Really? She says its stealing she learned late.
It seems she is really into her studies.

639
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,080
Aren't you going to become a monk
after a year if it goes on like this?

640
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,580
What's there to worry about?
Just tell her to come back in.

641
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,510
Or just drag her over here yourself.

642
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,730
How can I drag a kid that
wants to study more?

643
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:04,310
You have to finish that by mid September.

644
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:07,070
Why does Eun Chan have so much greed?

645
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,910
She should just do it quickly and come in.

646
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,540
My Angel does everything lightheartedly.

647
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,940
Brother! Let's have a beer since it's been
a while since we got together.

648
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:19,930
Oh yeah!

649
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:27,710
You should just eat anything.
Why did you say you were going to make dishes?

650
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:30,940
You still talk a lot when I say
that I'll give you food.

651
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,620
You and I both are single
and had one sided loves so.

652
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:37,440
You have to eat food to
maintain your health.

653
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:41,410
If you're thinking about health,
then clean up your room first.

654
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:45,120
Wow, it's bigger than your head.

655
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,170
Manager?

656
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,730
Why are you like that?

657
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,040
You look well.

658
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:56,740
Your hubby looks good.

659
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:58,570
You have one child?

660
00:41:58,790 --> 00:41:59,790
Yeah.

661
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,140
He went into school this year.

662
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,100
Are you still doing the coffee house?

663
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,860
Yeah.

664
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:11,070
We changed the name to Coffee Prince.

665
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,890
It's doing well.
Come over sometime.

666
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:14,860
Yeah.

667
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:19,060
Are you still alone?

668
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:20,700
It's good, I guess.

669
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:27,070
I left because I wanted you to be happy
and meet someone who's better than me.

670
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:30,600
But since you look well, it's a relief.

671
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:31,840
You're lying.

672
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:33,190
Huh?

673
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,260
I heard that you got married.

674
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:38,730
I think that you're living happily.

675
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:41,580
I just live like I'm living with someone else.

676
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,170
When I make his heart ache,

677
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,030
and I don't do things well,

678
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,450
he doesn't make me feel sorry.

679
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,310
That's good.

680
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,020
You have peach allergies.

681
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,980
Really, I'm going into somebody
else's business.

682
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:59,150
It's because he likes them.

683
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,090
I'm fine as long as I wear
gloves as I wash them.

684
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:05,540
Let's go quickly, Manager Hong.

685
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:07,350
All the ice cream will melt.

686
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:09,040
Alright, rascal.

687
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,870
You should get going.

688
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,690
This time, I'll stay behind.

689
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,450
Yeah, let me leave first once too.

690
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:31,790
Go out this way.

691
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:43,640
Didn't you say that you have to
marry off Eun Chan and Eun Sae?

692
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:45,980
Then when are we going to marry?

693
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:47,370
Leave.

694
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,340
Who's holding you back?

695
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,300
Just leave even now.

696
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,390
It's really noisy.

697
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,940
Don't measure the age and put
a blanket over it.

698
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:58,820
I don't know if you guys put
a blanket over already.

699
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:00,350
What are you talking about?

700
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:03,140
How can you say things so bluntly?

701
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:07,900
I don't think you're in a
good mood today.

702
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,920
I met my ex today.

703
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,150
Who?

704
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:15,020
The senseless witch that
ran off with your money?

705
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:16,110
I mean...

706
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:18,830
That Mee Jan or Mee Sook person?

707
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:23,070
I think the kid looks like me.

708
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,080
No way...

709
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:29,370
His eyes are twinkling,
and he looks exactly like me.

710
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,070
It's his habit.

711
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:34,780
He looked at my Eun Chan and
said that she looked like him.

712
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:38,500
How can Eun Chan's eyes look like your
shriveled eyes? Have you ever had it?

713
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,870
Why are you like this?

714
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:42,050
You have a tendency to
get too close to our Jee Hyang.

715
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,220
Didn't I say not to say our Jee Hyang?

716
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,540
She's my Jee Hyang.
What else do I call her?

717
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:50,450
Let's stop this.

718
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:53,630
We're done eating.
Done!

719
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:54,730
Come here.

720
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:03,710
You still look great even though I thought that
they'd swell up from standing in the study hall all day.

721
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:09,640
Is your heart still hurt because
you saw what happened at the club?

722
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:16,250
All guys do that once they get together.

723
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:19,580
Let's stop meeting each other now.

724
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,170
Didn't I say that the effect
of those words went away?

725
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,520
Stimulate me with some other words.

726
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,490
You're asking to break up for real?

727
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,190
Should I do that?

728
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:36,300
Alright.

729
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,140
Dating one girl for two years...

730
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:41,680
That leaves a permanent stain on
Jin Ha Rim's name in his lifetime.

731
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:44,630
Alright. I'll leave this right here.

732
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,290
It was good while it lasted.

733
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:47,580
Then be healthy.

734
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:49,380
Hey, Jin Ha Rim.

735
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:56,450
You know that your eyes turn down
when you pretend that everything's bright?

736
00:45:58,310 --> 00:45:59,750
You're like that now.

737
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,080
There she goes, analyzing again.

738
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:05,820
Look, where do you see
the corners of my eyes drooping?

739
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,590
Look again.

740
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:09,670
You're tired because of
your father's work.

741
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,170
Why don't you talk about it?

742
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:12,470
How'd you know that?

743
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:15,130
Your hospital is a place that I know.

744
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:17,870
I heard that it closed.

745
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,890
Are you like this because of that?

746
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,700
We're going to open up the hospital again.

747
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,110
Do you know what kind
of person my father is?

748
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:29,270
You should've asked me.
It isn't a secret.

749
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:37,690
Should we go have a drink and not this?

750
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:43,060
You're lighthearted and
easygoing again.

751
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,700
Was this how I was just for a day or two?

752
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:48,290
Let's just get over it like this and that.

753
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,080
You're okay, right?

754
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:03,210
I don't like this school's lighting at all.

755
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,130
Why is it so bright at night?

756
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:11,610
Darling. Is there a desirable place
somewhere in your school?

757
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,760
They say that no one's
in the laboratory.

758
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:22,370
I'm sick of the laboratory.
Pack everything quickly.

759
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,050
Follow me. Run!

760
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,630
Should I warm you up
some milk if you can't sleep?

761
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:16,480
It's because I've become sensitive after
the date for the exhibition has been decided.

762
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:18,330
I just can't concentrate on my work.

763
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,870
Yoo Ju.

764
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:24,980
I don't have any greed anymore.

765
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:29,340
I don't want anything else than
for you to keep looking at me,

766
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:32,990
staying next to me, and working hard
on the things that we like to do.

767
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,380
Do you think it's like that?

768
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:44,910
Would it be greedy if we want more?

769
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,960
Let's stop going to the hospital.

770
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,850
I don't want your body
to get weak because of that.

771
00:48:58,350 --> 00:48:59,900
Should we go on a trip tomorrow?

772
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:00,940
Tomorrow?

773
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,530
You're busy, right?

774
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:06,410
Then forget it. I'll go by myself.

775
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:08,840
Why go alone?

776
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,230
Go with me after I'm done
with the project.

777
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,960
No. It's fine. I want to go alone.

778
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:14,970
Where are you going?

779
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:18,150
Come here.

780
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:19,360
Let's sleep.

781
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:20,370
You can't go.

782
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:23,670
You can't go anywhere.

783
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:26,560
It's hot.

784
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:57,470
I am out right now,

785
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:01,200
- so please leave a message after the beep.
– Why isn't she getting the phone?

786
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,910
Thank you.

787
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:04,230
You stubborn ass.

788
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:09,820
You have to repay all of my torture,
all right?

789
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:15,860
Do more of the studying that you
want to do and then come back.

790
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,130
But just one year.

791
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:21,660
Call me back when you get this message.

792
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:31,540
Go Eun Chan!
Come home quickly!

793
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:37,480
I miss you!

794
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:42,490
Come back soon!

795
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:46,180
Is that the barista's resume?

796
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,020
We decided to have an interview.
Do you want to go?

797
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:50,300
I'm lazy about those things.

798
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:52,200
What are you?!

799
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

800
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,480
Why are you here again?

801
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:56,700
I'm sorry.

802
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:57,860
What are you going to do?

803
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,700
Why don't you wait a few more days?

804
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:01,550
Do you think the months
go by that quickly?

805
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:06,470
I can't tolerate other people
touching my kitchen tools. Get out.

806
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:08,300
I just wanted to put them in order.

807
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,230
If you felt bad, I'm sorry.

808
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:11,210
But senior...

809
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:12,750
Who's your senior?

810
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,700
Can't you teach me how to make waffles?

811
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:17,840
How can waffles be this soft?

812
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,310
You really don't listen to other people.

813
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,200
I will work hard.

814
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:24,160
What? Both of you...
in Japanese?

815
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,250
Where did you learn Japanese?

816
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:28,380
I studied overseas in Mayajaki.

817
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:32,370
It feels refreshing to talk
in Japanese after all this while.

818
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:34,610
What are you two talking about?

819
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,380
You aren't talking about me, are you?

820
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:39,140
I said that you were nice.
Are you happy?

821
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:40,990
I don't believe you anymore.

822
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:51,670
I'm worried because I have
to manage under the concept.

823
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:54,630
Also the part about chaining my legs
together there for two years...

824
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:57,760
I'm thinking about running
my own coffee business.

825
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:02,810
Gathering up the know how in our café could
help you when you start a business later on.

826
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:07,670
The pay is kind of less than
the place where I work now...

827
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:13,390
I have to at least get double more than
the amount right now if I want to move...

828
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,890
Double?

829
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:17,670
Alright.

830
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:21,010
The introduction team will call you
about the interview results.

831
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,020
I understand.

832
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,900
Excuse me, manager.

833
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:33,620
Manager.

834
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,350
Have you finished your job interview?

835
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:49,930
I'm thirsty because I waited so long.

836
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:56,320
I came for a job interview.

837
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,730
Hello, I'm Go Eun Chan.

838
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:01,890
I came because I heard you
were looking for a barista.

839
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:04,500
I have a lot of ability.
Do you want to use me?

840
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:09,890
Yeah, um. You do that.

841
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:12,170
What about your resume...

842
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,980
Are you a boy or a girl?
Do you have your I.D.?

843
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:16,120
I.D.?

844
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:18,900
Hold on. I...
Of course...

845
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:22,090
I forgot it.

846
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,530
I'm really a girl.

847
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:28,560
It sounded like that other applicant
was asking for double the pay.

848
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:30,960
But all you have to do is feed me.

849
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:35,000
Breakfast, lunch, dinner,
and a midnight snack.

850
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:40,390
I'm good at cleaning, I'm strong,
and I make really great coffee.

851
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:44,810
I also have an excellent history
as an international barista.

852
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:46,360
I do pretty well.

853
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:52,200
More than skill, we need someone
with a devoted work ethic.

854
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:58,110
I'm incredibly devoted.

855
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:05,010
If you just say so nicely, I can do the cleaning,
cooking, dishes, and everything for you.

856
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:09,350
You make a person all surprised.

857
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:11,790
When did you come without a call?

858
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:14,470
I missed you so much.

859
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:19,880
You smell good.

860
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:35,790
You're exactly the same.

861
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:50,320
Your eyes are in the same place.

862
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:52,350
Your nose is still pointed.

863
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,200
And your lips are really sexy.

864
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:57,220
My boyfriend looks really handsome.

865
00:55:57,970 --> 00:56:01,110
Why are you joking around with someone
when you're going to come anyway?

866
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:04,720
I got dark circles under my eyes
because of you, you know that?

867
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:06,210
Here?

868
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,450
You were that disappointed?

869
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:11,490
It's hot.

870
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:14,230
I'm getting angry without you doing that.

871
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:15,980
Are you trying to fuss?

872
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:19,450
You should be happy that I came.
Why are you being so rough?

873
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,870
I'm going to get on the plane
and leave again.

874
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,020
Are you trying to threaten me?

875
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,430
Even if you told me to leave now, I won't.

876
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:30,460
I've got to stick by your side
every day from now on.

877
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,850
I won't leave you for even a minute.

878
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,550
24 hours? Day and night?
Every day?

879
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:43,280
Then we'll have to get
married quickly, right?

880
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:47,230
You must be really busy
trying to open up Princess.

881
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:48,550
When are you doing job interviews?

882
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:51,450
Would the interior construction
be done by September?

883
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:55,270
I got an invitation to a latte
art demonstration this week.

884
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:56,680
I even got an interview.

885
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:00,710
The price of Barista,
Go Eun Chan will go up!

886
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,020
Why are you changing the subject?

887
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:03,920
I should've given a call to
mother a few days ago.

888
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:06,730
I wonder if grandma's doing well.

889
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:09,730
Grandma! It's me, Go Eun Chan!

890
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,270
I'm not deaf! Speak softly.

891
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:14,580
Have you been well?

892
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,810
When are you going to start working?

893
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:19,420
Yes?

894
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:20,970
What yes?

895
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:22,880
If you came in,
you should start working.

896
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:24,560
Mother... you should let her rest a bit.

897
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:27,790
I was thinking about saying hello to grandma,
father, and mother before I started working.

898
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,570
I even brought presents for you.

899
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:30,780
Speculate.

900
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,560
Did I ever ask you to buy me presents?

901
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:35,590
Grandma, we'll visit you tomorrow.

902
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,290
Then I'll see you tomorrow, Grandma.

903
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:38,580
Goodbye!

904
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,020
She asked me to keep her return a secret,

905
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:47,230
but she's there with Han Kyul.

906
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:48,820
They're just crazy about each other.

907
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,980
Her life expenses must have been tight.

908
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:55,250
But she called me multiple times
because she was picking your gift.

909
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:59,080
She's very thoughtful,
unlike the other kids these days.

910
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:02,210
When I saw her last time during
a business trip, she seemed very bright.

911
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,050
She's grows to be fond of.

912
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,840
You feel happy once you see her.

913
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,990
What are you two doing?

914
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:13,480
Parents and child both
have fallen head over heels.

915
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:18,390
How come you don't have any greed for a good
daughter-in-law when you only have one son?

916
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:20,980
If the child is alright,
then what should I want more?

917
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:26,240
Mother, I'm thinking about making a
refreshing mallow soup for dinner.

918
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:37,620
Why did she bring a present?

919
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:49,710
What should I do?

920
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:51,700
What should I do?

921
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,050
What should I do?

922
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,530
You guys!
My girlfriend came!

923
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:02,890
My girlfriend came!

924
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:04,050
Ahjussi!

925
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,130
Who is this?

926
00:59:06,270 --> 00:59:07,620
You didn't even call!

927
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,230
Have you been well?

928
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:10,330
My Chan!

929
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:14,950
Woah, it's weird.

930
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:16,420
- What's wrong?
- You're a girl?

931
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:20,460
Sister!

932
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,540
You've gotten really pretty.

933
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:24,620
- Your attitude's the same though.
- Hey, hey, hey!

934
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:25,800
Eun Chan.

935
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:27,840
Can't hear this part well.
Its so soft and low.

936
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:28,890
You've gotten a lot prettier.

937
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:30,110
- Thanks.
- Me too, me too.

938
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:34,490
Me too! It's strange!

939
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:37,710
Show her around the house.

940
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:39,410
No! No!

941
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:41,620
She's going to get hurt!

942
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:43,180
Go around!

943
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,000
Really... Come here!

944
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,330
Come here!

945
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,220
[You're happy because you've
met a good husband, right?]

946
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,890
[I'm happy. ]

947
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:57,510
I don't know...

948
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:15,330
Please treat me well.

949
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:17,660
You really don't listen to people.

950
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:19,160
I'll work hard.

951
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:48,400
Please give me your
cell phone number.

952
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:49,900
You have to put yours in mine too.

953
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:51,600
Your sister is mad.

954
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:54,100
Should I give you my home address too?

955
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:59,240
Hello? Oh, Byul.

956
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:02,630
This weird lady kept pushing me.
I blocked her.

957
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:03,620
Don't worry.

958
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:20,530
I'm good, aren't I?

959
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,880
Coffee Prince, goodbye!

960
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,880
[Coffee Prince closes today!]
