1
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:13,750
Coffee Prince

2
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:34,360
First Cup

3
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,360
Bath House

4
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,970
Who ordered the bean-sprouts noodles?

5
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,630
Hey! Who are you?!
What are you doing here?

6
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,230
How can you come in?
Go out quickly!

7
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,600
How can there be such a thing?! Leave!

8
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,390
This is really.
Leave! Leave immediately!

9
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,550
Hey, I'm asking you to get out!
Are you deaf?!

10
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,420
Leave, right now!

11
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:52,030
How can there be such a guy?

12
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,680
Didn't you order the meal?
Give me the money quickly.

13
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,120
Hey, get out!
Immediately!

14
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,810
I'm a girl!

15
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:06,420
What? What lies are you saying?
Get out immediately!

16
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,860
Stop shouting, it's so noisy.

17
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,750
- Two pieces.
- Two pieces.

18
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,690
It's only two.
Look at this card.

19
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,200
- Two pieces.
- Oh, this.

20
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,110
- Then.
- Wrong card, three pieces.

21
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,930
- Oh, you're right.
- I got them.

22
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,620
I didn't put them out on purpose to let you.

23
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,490
What do you want?

24
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,650
J J Four.

25
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,110
- Three pieces.
- Is that so?

26
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,130
Stop it.
It's three again.

27
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,910
1.. 2.. 3..

28
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,780
- Six pieces, I'm winning.
- Nine pieces.

29
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:05,000
Just that little?
Six!

30
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,770
- What do you want?
- Anything you wish.

31
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,440
- Heart?
- Heart is okay.

32
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,700
- Five cards.
- Four.

33
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:18,130
Oh, you are really good at this.
You are really too bad.

34
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,950
Let's play another set again
when we reach Seoul?

35
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,100
At Seoul too?

36
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,330
There's no need for us to meet again, right?

37
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,180
Yes, it's me.

38
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,430
I just arrived.

39
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,490
Home.

40
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,540
That's right, I want to meet you as well.

41
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,990
But I'm really too dirty right now.

42
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,380
I just can't meet you looking like this.

43
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,130
Just listen to your playboy speech.

44
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,300
I really miss you
till my eyes are popping out soon.

45
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,510
This is not exaggerated.

46
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,790
You never answer the phone every time I call.

47
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,480
Hey, didn't I tell you to leave?!

48
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,070
No matter what that's the place
that I gave my youth to.

49
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,660
What youth? Am I the one
who made your youth disappear?

50
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:22,240
Then just go tell that woman if
you want to talk about your youth.

51
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,060
For a fellow who gave up your twenty years
relationship just because of a stupid girl.

52
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,520
Your face is really thick.

53
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,610
Director.

54
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,100
Hey, you have to hurry and come back.
Your grandma is mad already.

55
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,720
How am I supposed to go when
I have an important appointment?

56
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,650
Right. Have you seen Han Seong yet?

57
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,690
It was hard on him as he tidied the
whole house because you were coming back.

58
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,990
No.

59
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,770
We can meet anytime since we are
living in the same district.

60
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,980
Your meal order is here!

61
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,970
The meal delivery is here.
Bye, mom.

62
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,550
- Son.. Han Kyul.
- Bye. The door is open.

63
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,450
- Excuse me, the meal delivery is here.
- Just put it on that table.

64
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,110
Yes!

65
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,770
What are you doing?
Come in quickly.

66
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,490
Yes.

67
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,120
Hey, is that cold noodles?

68
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,870
Right.

69
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,720
Everyone is really all nude today.
All nude.

70
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,910
Is mine so scary?

71
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,730
All day, starting from the morning,
both women and men. All nude. Ugh!

72
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,660
Oh, my legs are really weak.

73
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,450
He has been staring at it
for quite a long time.

74
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,090
Hey, the money...

75
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,170
See it?

76
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,580
This is Teacher's magnificent flying kick.

77
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:53,350
Hey, kids. Clap!

78
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:59,410
Chan! Chan!
Eun Chan, something big happened.

79
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,200
Well, that Teacher Go...

80
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:06,290
Can you come out for a while because of
my personal private matter?

81
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,590
The wash room is blocked again, right?

82
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,280
Teacher, it'll only take a while.

83
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,030
Practice on your own.

84
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,480
You call this a big issue?
I can do it later.

85
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,360
How can you ask me to unclog the toilet
while I'm teaching the kids?

86
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,100
You're asking me to clear it up
when it's yours?!

87
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,100
The amount is really big,
so just think of it in a positive way.

88
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,200
Quit complaining, really.

89
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,550
Wouldn't it be better to just do
your business a little at a time?

90
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,080
Listen, just wait until you get to my age.

91
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,250
See if you can go a little at a time. Geez.

92
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,370
I heard that the owner has put your
martial arts hall space out for sale.

93
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,970
The taekwondo place...

94
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,660
You know the place where you go like...
You know the dojang, right?

95
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:51,750
Oh my, this is really.

96
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,540
- Oh, it's mom!
- Oh, it's Noona.

97
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,800
New shoes.

98
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,750
Ahjussi.

99
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,820
Mom! Mom!

100
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,200
You bought a new pair of shoes?

101
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,850
Wait up, Mom. Wait.

102
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,370
Hello?

103
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,390
She slipped away again.

104
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,190
- Oppa!
- End the call.

105
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,200
Mom bought another pair of new shoes again.

106
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,130
Oppa, there's a guy who looks like a gangster
who is bullying me all the time.

107
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,480
Gangster?

108
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,010
Don't you like gangsters?
So what's the problem?

109
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,770
Where did she go?

110
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,060
He's really a gangster.

111
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,260
Hey, how can you call me a gangster?

112
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,960
You should call me a ruffian, a ruffian.

113
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,050
Hey, who is he?

114
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:36,650
Hey, I like girls
who have slim arms and legs like you.

115
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,220
Your face is a little big.

116
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,980
What tricks are you trying to play?

117
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,210
If not, I'll sit by your side.

118
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,860
You will be dead if you sit by my side.

119
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,650
Really, why don't you know my heart?

120
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,670
Eun Sae.

121
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,790
What? Who is he?

122
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,450
Hello!

123
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,490
Eun Chan, you are here.

124
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,070
Hey, Go Eun Sae.
Is he your lover?

125
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,730
My heart isn't feeling too well now.

126
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:19,750
I can understand that you like me.

127
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,700
But, we are not the fated ones.

128
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,910
Didn't you drop out during high school?

129
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,410
You have no education, no money
and even your face is really plain.

130
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,250
Based on what confidence
are you trying so hard?

131
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,280
Can't you see how much I love you?

132
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,900
You are my angel.

133
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,230
Go Eun Sae.

134
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,450
I know.

135
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:41,510
But compare to love,
I look more heavily upon conditions.

136
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,480
Then what's this?

137
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,570
Are you saying that rascal's
conditions are acceptable?

138
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,510
We don't ask for anything.

139
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:52,260
That's why I brought them here on my own.
Talk so much...

140
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,770
What kind of place is this?

141
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,520
Oh, it's great.

142
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,430
Hey, have a fight with me.

143
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,650
Mr. Hong, the coffee is awesome.

144
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,870
Oppa, let's settle this matter quickly.
So that we can go home.

145
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,320
What? Home?

146
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,440
What are you doing to my Eun Sae?

147
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,280
- Are you co-habiting?
- Are you not letting go?!

148
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,260
I'm not letting go, Rascal.
Let's battle it out.

149
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,170
Let go!

150
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,980
Stop your pretending.

151
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,060
And remember this.

152
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,050
The guy which I settled three years ago is still
staying in the emergency ward right now.

153
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,420
So just go your way
when your luck is still good.

154
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,320
Rascal, you are really.

155
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,300
You really don't get what I'm saying.

156
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,700
I'm a Taekwondo teacher.

157
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,870
I was a judo's representative in the past.

158
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,070
A Judo representative
that doesn't know Judo at all.

159
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,640
I'm the parent head of our family.

160
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,540
If just because I beat up a fellow like you.

161
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,770
And lose my livelihood after getting called to
the police station, how can I still survive?

162
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,550
I have no strength left to talk to
you as I'm really hungry.

163
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,100
So leave quickly
instead of trying to debate with me.

164
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,400
If not, do you want to have a battle?

165
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,170
This is Prince Coffee, I would like
to order a set of black sauce noodles.

166
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,320
Ahjussi, me too!

167
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,750
You want to eat as well?

168
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,810
Yes, yes. Thank you.

169
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:09,290
Prince coffee cafe! Black sauce noodles
with additional preserve carrots.

170
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,060
This is free.

171
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,150
The freebie is great.

172
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,840
It's really good that there are these too.

173
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,720
Go Eun Sae, you can't go back on your words.

174
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,380
You will be mine if I manage to win this rascal.

175
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,920
Do you have the noodle money?

176
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,580
Am I the one to lose?
You will be the one.

177
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,510
Ahjussi, you have to be the judge.

178
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,030
Hey, you must finish
five bowls of black sauce noodles.

179
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,070
If you lose, you will have to pay
the coffee money as well.

180
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,020
But you didn't say that just now.

181
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:38,720
OK. OK.

182
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,380
Ready, get set.

183
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,990
Start!

184
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,830
Hey, how can you still have any left over?
You should eat up everything.

185
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,020
Crab meat, pizza...

186
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:09,050
Pig porridge, cooking oil, vegetable noodles.

187
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:16,010
Plus-filled bloody boil on the back of a pig's skin.

188
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:20,140
Rotten margarine full of dung flies.

189
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,920
Spaghetti full of squirming, wiggling worms.

190
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:31,770
The greasy, dirty oil from the pores of the nose.

191
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,920
Oh, really.

192
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,850
The black sauce noodles are not good at all.

193
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:13,240
I only have one more left.

194
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,390
Ahjussi!

195
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,360
Please give me some more of the sweet carrots!

196
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,600
Give me more.

197
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,790
What's left over is more than what I expected.

198
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,760
Do you still want some more?

199
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,590
Hey, the restroom is over there!

200
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,740
Go to your grandma.

201
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:59,690
I didn't even want to come over either.
Mom and Grandma made me to come here.

202
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,900
I'll stay for five minutes before leaving.

203
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,660
Do you really don't want to see me that much?

204
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,440
So you didn't even come down for dinner?

205
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,650
Plans to build up Han Kyul

206
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,080
Stage 1) Get him under control.
Stage 2) Bring out the proof.

207
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:25,750
Stage 3) Get him, women.

208
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:47,090
Has the Dad spoken to Han Kyul yet?

209
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:51,100
Have you figured out to use which
methods to deal with Han Kyul?

210
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,200
Yes, this is all.

211
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:59,500
But I still feel that Han Kyul doesn't
understand your situation.

212
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,010
I know what to do.

213
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,860
That fellow is still immature.

214
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,640
He will faint upon hearing that I have cancer.

215
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,320
Just leave it.

216
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,020
It's already enough to live until this age.

217
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,310
I'm a person that won't have any
regrets even if I die tomorrow.

218
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:17,040
I have already lived my life enough.

219
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:21,450
But I'm still really curious.

220
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,220
I understand that Han Kyul's father
is usually reticent.

221
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,860
Han Kyul really liked his dad
when he was young.

222
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,440
But why is he so cold to him right now?

223
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,700
I thought that it'll better
when time passes more.

224
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,450
But it got even worse day after day.

225
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:39,050
Both of them will say that they don't
know too if you ask them.

226
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:42,210
I asked my friends and they said
that all men are like that.

227
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,270
How can it be like that?

228
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,370
Okay, everything is settled.

229
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,100
Call Han Kyul to come over.

230
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,330
Why are your expressions like that?

231
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,390
You're looking pretty swell, aren't you!

232
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,190
Get him under control.

233
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:17,580
Spending my money without care, you've been
having fun playing around for five years.

234
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,470
You couldn't have possibly played less
even though it's been five years, right?!

235
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,180
It's so good.

236
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,730
I finally feel that I have already come
home when I heard your loud voice.

237
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,500
You rascal, how dare you use
your flirting strategies on me!

238
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,320
I let you go overseas
to learn business management.

239
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,850
Then why is your film investment tottering?!

240
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,220
And not only that.

241
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,370
There are six credit card fees
he has to deal with.

242
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,460
You manipulating little boy!

243
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,440
Now you're toying around even more since
the movie world was not enough for you.

244
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:46,160
Didn't you promise
that you will come back before thirty?

245
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,280
I'm only twenty-nine right now.

246
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,990
Grandma.

247
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,520
Let's go to the harbor's ice bar to eat
that shave ice that we had before.

248
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:56,350
What, shaved ice?

249
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,460
Bring out the proof.

250
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,060
Oh, it's him.

251
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,140
That fellow really took good pictures.

252
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,430
Why is this doing here?

253
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,470
Aren't you both in love with each other?

254
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:35,010
Both of you are always sticking together
and you are really loving.

255
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,630
This was taken by your friend
who lives in Seoho.

256
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,760
Loving?

257
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,370
Then, this is not loving?

258
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,540
You, rascal.

259
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,780
You really have such a good image in
front of your Grandma, Mom and Dad.

260
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,630
A man should be established by thirty
and to form a family.

261
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:53,190
How dare you go around
smooching with a boy!

262
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:03,120
Get him, women!

263
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,370
Get married immediately!

264
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,750
Then should I go on a match-making date?

265
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,100
Would that do?

266
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,090
But the girl must be very pretty.

267
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,450
It isn't all for me.
It's for your great grand children.

268
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,250
See, I already told you
that it's not going to work on him.

269
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:20,710
But still we have to give it a try.

270
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,160
So cute.

271
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,180
I'm back!

272
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,000
Oh, you worked hard.

273
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,940
I'm so tired.

274
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,220
Are you finished with the arms and legs?

275
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,290
I haven't finished today's yet.

276
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,190
I just returned
after my class reunion party today.

277
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,610
Those shoes earlier...

278
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,010
Eun Chan, those are not expensive at all.

279
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,380
Don't bother.

280
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,460
It's already considered cheap to spend
$100 for releasing of stress.

281
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,650
What are we to do
when it's mom's happiness in life.

282
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,980
Why do you have so much rubbish
to say when you are pooping?

283
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,160
Is $100 a small amount?

284
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,990
Yes, of course it's not small.

285
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,220
I also know that this is not petty money.

286
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,980
And so, I'm working really hard right now
regardless of the corns on my hands.

287
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:07,160
Our mom, there won't be a need to treat
the corns if you were to save up a little.

288
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:11,170
You are thinking of saying this, right?
There's no need to.

289
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,940
Don't say anymore
when you are a basin full of holes.

290
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,300
Aren't you going to study?

291
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,520
Didn't you said that you are going to college?

292
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,430
I'm now trying to increase my concentration.

293
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:23,130
Mom, I feel that my brain are getting better
by sticking these.

294
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,500
She is really too into it.

295
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,390
So into it, that she has became cross-eyed.

296
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,170
I feel that I become cross-eyed myself
when I looked too long at her.

297
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,250
Hello?

298
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,750
Oh! Hi Dong Sook!

299
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,540
Of course, I came back peacefully.

300
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,590
What, the ring?

301
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,310
The ring, I'm wearing it.

302
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,300
Huh? Where did it go?

303
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,270
No, it's really strange.

304
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,420
In the room, I must have left it in the room.

305
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:53,280
OK, I'll give you a call when I find it.

306
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,990
Why?

307
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,360
Where did I put it?

308
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,210
Oh, right. Handbag.
It's in the handbag.

309
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,020
Did she mention ring?

310
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,980
Yes, but why did that Ahjumma from the class
reunion wants Mom to find it for her?

311
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,460
Help me, it's not there either.

312
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,590
Hey, you should search well for it!

313
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,290
But how can it be under there?

314
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Did you really bring it home?

315
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:24,160
I brought it back for sure.

316
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:27,650
I wouldn't drop it there,
it should be around here.

317
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,950
Oppa, stop searching.

318
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:32,530
What about here? Nothing?

319
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,100
Hey, are you crazy?

320
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,890
Start!

321
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,280
Turn and turn.

322
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:27,050
Don't, don't do it.

323
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:30,220
Don't do that, it's so dirty.

324
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,570
- You are playing dirty today.
- No!

325
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,050
- Really? Aren't you thinking of doing it?
- NO!

326
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:36,190
Don't do it right now.

327
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,180
OK!

328
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,040
Whatever!

329
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,980
Hello?

330
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,840
Why do you sound out of breath?

331
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,370
Han Yoo Ju, it's because of you.

332
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:32,400
For some reason, I feel good when
you call me "Han Yoo Ju".

333
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,400
Where are you?

334
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,020
Right, isn't it early morning over there?

335
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,120
I'm in Seoul.
Let's meet.

336
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,450
What? Are you kidding?

337
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,360
Then, let's meet in front of Hongdae later.

338
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,950
OK.

339
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,630
It's great here, right?

340
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,140
Great.

341
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:06,510
Over here, they have spicy rice cakes,
rice sausages and Choi Han Kyul as well.

342
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,970
And Choi Han Seong too.

343
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,100
- How is he?
- To end it well with such a good lover.

344
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,510
DK Ahjussi.

345
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,290
DK...

346
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,880
Welcome.

347
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,630
How is it?

348
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,590
- How much is it?
- It's $10.

349
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,440
Oh, that hat looks great on you.

350
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,060
Thank you.

351
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,750
So unlucky.
DK Ahjussi.

352
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:37,260
Isn't it too much breaking up after all of that?

353
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,520
Why are you totally
ignoring my feelings right now?

354
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:45,330
You can start new again with Han Seong.

355
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,790
Meet up with him?

356
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,000
Still, you were his first love.
You're being a bit cruel.

357
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,890
Let's go.

358
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,630
Won't your heart be moved since there is a big
possibility of seeing him nearby if you come here.

359
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,610
Does it make you more comfortable
to speak like this?

360
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,110
Are you going up?

361
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:37,610
No.

362
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:50,770
Wait a sec.

363
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,000
I'll take you home
after I pick up the presents.

364
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,810
Hey, what have you got to make me
believe a small part-timer like you

365
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:05,210
to give you a three months pay in advance?

366
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,020
Leave, rascal.

367
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,870
Right, who will give a part-timer
an advance pay?

368
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,920
The most important thing in
delivering meal is the speed.

369
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,170
OK. Fine.

370
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,040
Wait a moment.

371
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:01,220
Are you alright?
Are you okay?

372
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,500
- What happened?
- Handbag.

373
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,870
Let me take a look.

374
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,730
Are you seriously hurt?
Are you okay?

375
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,770
I'm fine.

376
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,650
Don't just keep saying that you are
alright. Stand up first, Noona.

377
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,220
You only call me "Noona"
when you are flustered.

378
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,380
Get up, rascal.

379
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,030
Hey, you are..

380
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,550
You, snatch thief!
How dare you steal!

381
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,680
I want to pay Eun Sae's music school fees,
so what? Huh?

382
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,860
Eun Sae's school fees?

383
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,130
It seems like someone has caught
the thief who robbed me, look there.

384
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,520
I'll go over there while you stay here.

385
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,310
Let's go together.

386
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:51,730
Why must you be so worried over
Eun Sae when she's my lover?

387
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,380
Eun Sae is my angel.

388
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,340
A person like you must be put in jail.
Follow me.

389
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,460
It's really crazy.

390
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:11,690
Grab the chance to run away
when I release my hands.

391
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,260
What?

392
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,590
Escape, you sweet carrot.

393
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,270
Prepare for it, OK?

394
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,940
A young boy like you,
how dare you think about robbing people!

395
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,680
On the count of three.

396
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:29,500
1.. 2.. 3..

397
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,650
What? Push me away and run.

398
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:40,510
Hey, stand there!

399
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,310
He escaped.

400
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,350
Thanks.

401
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,090
Oh, you got hurt.
Are you alright?

402
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,000
Yes, I'm fine.

403
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,410
I'm dead!

404
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,220
What are you doing?

405
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,580
You must be able to start up.

406
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,470
What are we to do?

407
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,920
It's all because of me.

408
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:30,180
Oh no. It's because this is
already a piece of old junk!

409
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:34,330
You can send it for servicing first and then,
give a call here.

410
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,810
You guys planned the act beforehand, right?

411
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,840
For you to get the money for servicing.

412
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:43,500
Isn't it really dangerous for the criminal
to be staying on the crime scene?

413
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:50,980
Tell the truth, isn't it improving?
Tin bucket, antiquities motorbikes.

414
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,430
What exactly are you talking about now?!

415
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,000
Han Kyul.

416
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,200
Just give me a call if you decided
to be frank about it.

417
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,600
I'll be able to help out since you
seem to have a pitiful life.

418
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,980
- What's wrong with you?!
- Aren't you the one who got hurt?

419
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,090
Leave.

420
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,320
Why are you like this?

421
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,760
Don't you understand those kind of people?

422
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,090
They are not the type of people
to be friendly with.

423
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:13,730
Hey there! Hey!

424
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:16,360
I'm not that sort of person!

425
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:19,710
I'm really going crazy.

426
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:22,480
Why won't you start?

427
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:27,630
What? Where did it go to?

428
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:33,060
I don't know, what to do?

429
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,390
I decided to employ a girl
because it's cheaper.

430
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,900
I never thought you will be getting
into trouble the next day.

431
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:50,710
Boss, why do you need to bring up
about me being a girl?

432
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,260
If you are not a girl,
what are you? A boy?

433
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,090
No.

434
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,600
The scooter parked outside,
you have to pay for the damage.

435
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:03,860
With that, you and me,
we are finished with what we owe each other.

436
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,830
Ssulja, Ssulja!
(*the dog's name)

437
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,180
Hello!

438
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:00,130
Have you been well?

439
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,610
Let us practice.

440
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,820
You did well!

441
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:21,650
I'm feeling a little better
all because of you.

442
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,920
I'm really feeling bad lately.

443
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,260
Thank you!

444
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:29,760
Hey, what's your dad doing lately?

445
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,200
He should come out
and take a walk if he's free.

446
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:33,270
To let the streets become brighter
as well, got it?

447
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,160
Bye, unni is going.

448
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,770
Bye!

449
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:38,960
Bye!

450
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,180
Who is it?

451
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,180
That interesting young lady.

452
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,270
Is she your girlfriend?

453
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,010
Mom went out.

454
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,000
About the ring?

455
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,810
Yes, I heard about it.

456
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,330
It's all because of that incident.

457
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,920
Mom and unni, they are now..

458
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,360
Mom!

459
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,920
Yes, Ahjumma.

460
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,430
I'll ask mom to give you a
call when she comes back.

461
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,000
Yes.

462
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:24,040
It's Dong Sook ahjumma, she told us
to find the ring back before next week.

463
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,520
It belongs to her elder sister-in-law.

464
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,260
She has gone on a trip
but will be returning next week.

465
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,380
Are you able to
get a little of the ring payment?

466
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,250
How am I going to get it?

467
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,250
I even lost my job all because of
you and that preserved carrot.

468
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:38,250
How are you going to get it?

469
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,370
Why are you throwing your temper on me?

470
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,750
Why don't you just confront that
fellow since you are so mad?

471
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,280
And tell him to repair that scooter!

472
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,450
You got yourself in trouble
for being such a busybody.

473
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,800
Somebody just knows how to say it out
without even practicing what she preached.

474
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,470
What about you? Your studies aren't
good and you can't speak well either.

475
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,130
Hello.

476
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,790
Yes, mister.

477
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,310
Yes, what?

478
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,210
How can you suddenly
rise the rent like that?

479
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,220
Who is it?

480
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:10,970
I understand that you help
us a lot during this period.

481
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,460
- Yes.
- Is it the landlord?

482
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:16,810
Yes.

483
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:18,930
Yes, I understand.

484
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:19,900
Yes.

485
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,160
What?

486
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,210
Did he raise the rent?

487
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,310
Yes, $10,000.

488
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:28,050
This is really.

489
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,780
Let's eat.

490
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,770
How can I eat like this?

491
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,560
Mom, let's eat.

492
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:45,550
I'm self-reflecting, so I'll be peeling more
chestnuts from today onwards.

493
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,190
Come eat!

494
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,020
Ahjussi...

495
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,440
Ahjussi, what are you doing?

496
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:09,000
I had a dream.

497
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,970
I was suffocating while being
squashed by my sister-in-law.

498
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:21,060
Ah, how the heavy breath
was simply suffocating me.

499
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,250
The piece has once again been rejected.

500
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:31,270
The title was "Raw Meat and Living"

501
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:34,300
Yes, but... mister.

502
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:37,100
The butcher who must slice meat into pieces.

503
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:44,110
Life, sadness, loneliness, setbacks, anger,
knife blades, love and fish sauce.

504
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,650
Ahjussi, I need some money.

505
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:50,960
Hey, why can't you understand that?
What actually is the use of all these?

506
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:57,280
Can only a hungry muse exist for a poet?

507
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:01,200
Goodbye.

508
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,800
Our rhythm is a little too slow.

509
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,660
Then, let's do it again
if you think that it's too slow.

510
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,450
Alright.

511
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:04,840
Hyung, someone is looking for you.

512
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:20,240
Have you been well?

513
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,940
It's really hot.

514
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:29,440
It looks like a thunderstorm is coming,
see how dark the sky is.

515
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:32,660
It should be the typhoon season, right?

516
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,690
I've been here for a month.

517
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,320
I'm sorry.

518
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:58,090
I missed you.

519
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,430
Just say something,
no matter what it may be.

520
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,730
Leave.

521
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:18,250
It was really sudden when you left.

522
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:21,740
It's still really sudden when you return.

523
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:28,580
And also, I don't drink this now.

524
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:53,000
You haven't found work yet although
you've been looking for it since morning.

525
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,240
Have you eaten?
Do you want to a slice of bread?

526
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,480
Is there jam?

527
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,570
Rascal.

528
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,030
Ahjussi.

529
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,040
Can I ask for a loan without any guarantee?

530
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,880
Those are all private loans.

531
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:11,070
The kinds that let you write the agreement
to give up your body.

532
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,860
If not, can I draw from the credit card?

533
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:21,300
No, if you are known as a bad debtor, it will be
really hard for you to maintain your social life.

534
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:24,620
Hey, are you really that short of money?

535
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,830
Didn't you catch a robber at that time?

536
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:30,180
Didn't you get a thank-you gift?

537
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,320
Choi Han Kyul.

538
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,870
No, how can I just ask for money
after I caught a robber?

539
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,930
Didn't he say
he's prepared to give to you, right?

540
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,660
So just take it as he said so.

541
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:52,230
How can you consider so much since
you are in such a situation?

542
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:58,040
There isn't much here.

543
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:02,960
This should add a little to this month's rent.

544
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:09,720
Don't open it now.
It's embarrassing.

545
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:13,890
Ahjussi.

546
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,670
You know I like you, right?

547
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:31,540
Yes, Ah Young?

548
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:33,810
Wine bar?

549
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:35,840
Oh, that's great.

550
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:38,710
I don't care if it's a part-time or
a replacement, anything is fine.

551
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,360
No matter what,
Grandma will stand on my side.

552
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,040
But it seems like mom can't stand
seeing me like this anymore.

553
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,110
Hyung, why don't you inherit the company?

554
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:55,840
I love music.

555
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:58,310
Your movies aren't doing too well, right?

556
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,610
So isn't it good for you
to inherit the company?

557
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,920
I'm unable to do anything well, no matter
what I do. I'm different from you.

558
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,510
You are so smart.

559
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,650
I met Han Yoo Ju.

560
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:21,350
What's this?

561
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:23,990
How am I supposed to wear this?

562
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:26,780
What the heck is this?

563
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,580
I'm going crazy!

564
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,600
Crazy, crazy.

565
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:39,480
She gave up studying overseas for you
and came back.

566
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:41,950
Don't mention about it anymore.

567
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,720
Then what shall we talk about?

568
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:47,730
You still like her?

569
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:50,150
Don't mind me.

570
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,190
Han Yoo Ju already said that I'm out.

571
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,980
That is the same as telling me
that it should end.

572
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:04,130
Well, what do you want me to do?

573
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:06,710
Are you able to work like this?

574
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,040
Then, can't you just let me work
in the kitchen?

575
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:10,940
You are only a replacement.

576
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,510
Stop saying nonsense
and follow me quickly.

577
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,940
He's totally drunk.

578
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,330
Go out and call the taxi, okay?

579
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:25,050
Yes!

580
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,970
Get up, mister.

581
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:41,340
Hey, what's the address?

582
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:43,960
The Intern hostel, 107 building 503.

583
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,690
- What did you say?
- 107 building 503... Go quickly.

584
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:49,980
504? Which one is it, mister?

585
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,580
Ahjussi, wake up! Where do you live?

586
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,160
Tell me the address quickly.

587
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:58,340
What?

588
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,970
So there's still a woman like this.

589
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,860
Have you finished drinking?
I still have an appointment.

590
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,870
Don't drive after you drank.

591
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:14,880
Don't worry.
I'll find a replacement driver.

592
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:15,990
Be careful on your way.

593
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,060
See you next time.

594
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,280
Bye.

595
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:34,530
Hello. I'm in Sam Cheon Dong.
Yes, the security area.

596
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:38,260
How much time do you need?

597
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,370
A few more minutes, okay.

598
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,180
You are Ssulja's dad.

599
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:49,040
You are Ssulja's dad, right?

600
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,130
Ssulja?

601
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,390
The dog that went around the district
during his exercise, your dog, Ssulja.

602
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:58,050
Oh, my Terry is called "Ssulja"?

603
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:00,960
Oh, so the name is Terry.

604
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,120
You seem to be living in our district.

605
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,720
Yes, I deliver milk to your house.

606
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:06,880
You don't know it, right?

607
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:10,130
Oh, the young lady who delivers our milk.
My Terry's girlfriend?

608
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:13,050
Ah-Woo, right?

609
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,430
Then, is it a boy?

610
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,900
Yes.

611
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:21,940
I still thought that it has a really big chest.

612
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:26,540
Oh, I got it wrong.

613
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,790
What's that?

614
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:33,620
Bubbles, I found it there.

615
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,860
Do you want it?
It's best for reducing stress.

616
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:54,920
Ahjussi, is money or pride
more important to you?

617
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:56,750
What?

618
00:46:57,290 --> 00:46:58,360
Nothing.

619
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,770
Hey, Replacement!
Aren't you coming in?

620
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,210
Ahjussi, I'm going.

621
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:07,320
- Hey, take it.
- Keep it, I'm going. Bye!

622
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:21,490
Rose...

623
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:22,810
Ha Rim.

624
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:24,290
It's so nice to see you!

625
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,020
Have fun!

626
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:31,100
Hey, what have you been eating
to be so popular?

627
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,980
Do you want me to teach you?

628
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:35,130
Please don't.

629
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,010
He will even sell off his properties to get
it once something good comes along.

630
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:40,480
Oppa! Oppa!

631
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:43,520
Oppa, Oppa!

632
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,770
Excuse me.

633
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:46,320
Why are you still faking it
with a body like this?

634
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:48,030
Oppa, you have returned for good this time?

635
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:50,340
I planned to go to states to find you
if you weren't coming back again.

636
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:53,420
Why are you here when we
made contact with your brother?

637
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,130
It's so like there to force herself in,
no matter what the situation is.

638
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:58,360
But, Oppa. Are you really going
for the match-making?

639
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,480
No, don't go.

640
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,920
How did you know?

641
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,050
My friend gave me a call saying that she will
be attending a match-making with you.

642
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,890
She's really nothing at all.

643
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:10,140
She did her chest and jaws before.

644
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,110
What's this?

645
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:14,690
We should have a toast since
we haven't met for a long time.

646
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,390
Oppa, let's do a lover's shot.

647
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,340
What lovers? I don't drink wine at all.

648
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:19,620
Just do it for her, Hyung.

649
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,540
You really make people feel so tired.

650
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:22,970
That's right.

651
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:24,620
Just one glass.

652
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:28,360
I have a wish since high school
to have a lovers' shot with you.

653
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,120
Just satisfy her for once.

654
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:33,280
Her annoying voice
is giving me goosebumps!

655
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:37,320
It's crazy, really.

656
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:43,900
Oh, no. Something bad happened.

657
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,350
Money, pride.

658
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,940
Pride, money.

659
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:55,740
Which is more important?

660
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:59,730
Let me guess.

661
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:05,410
What should I guess?
I'm not guessing at all.

662
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,520
Hello?

663
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,520
Yes. Dong Sook ahjumma.

664
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,320
Yes, hello.

665
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:16,410
I'm so sorry.

666
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,440
Slowly...

667
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:27,930
Take care, Ye Ran.

668
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:31,870
Have a hot night with hyung.

669
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,340
Yes, thank you.

670
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:35,080
Bye, bye.

671
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:43,830
So cute.

672
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,890
My bank account balance is $420.

673
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:10,650
Salary from the Taekwondo Hall is $800.

674
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:13,310
Three months...

675
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:16,640
Sticking eyes on the dolls gives $200.

676
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:18,910
Delivering milk gives $300.

677
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,890
Yes, it's over. I have already taken it.

678
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:25,970
My $1,000 before and savings $5,000.

679
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:28,440
It's $6,000 all together.

680
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:32,160
It is still minus $8,000!

681
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:45,570
Starting from today,
Choi Han Kyul is mine!

682
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,400
To call or not to call.

683
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:05,350
To call.

684
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:08,150
Not to call.

685
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,560
Hey, Go Eun Chan.

686
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:14,310
Is money or pride more important?

687
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:18,030
Pride.

688
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,520
Pride.

689
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:25,470
Pride.

690
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:31,990
Right, will pride be able to feed you?

691
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:33,940
Only money can feed you.

692
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:36,260
That's right, money.

693
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:38,320
Oh, cold.

694
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,570
Who is it?

695
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:53,130
Who am I?

696
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:55,090
Oppa..

697
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,360
Meal delivery.

698
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:00,810
What did you say?

699
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:03,830
We met a few days ago
when you are with a female friend.

700
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,730
Oh, the robber.

701
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:08,340
I'm not a robber.

702
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:10,620
I was the one who caught the robber.

703
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,160
Yes, the scooter.

704
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:14,680
I want a little thank you gift.

705
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:17,870
What? You want me to come over now?

706
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:20,460
Where is "over there"?

707
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:23,760
Yes, yes.

708
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:28,840
Oppa...

709
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:31,310
Why don't you believe what I say?

710
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:32,860
Wear it and leave quickly.

711
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:36,260
You don't remember anything
because you were drunk.

712
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:38,770
I remembered everything. You were carrying me,
and then you put me here.

713
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,710
You undressed my upper clothes but
you didn't dare to touch the lower ones.

714
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,430
And just looked on quietly.

715
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:44,030
Because it's too absurd.

716
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:46,390
I wanted to know what you wanted to do.

717
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:48,730
Leave quickly, leave.

718
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:54,280
Oppa! But, you're still mine!

719
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:58,010
That's right, I should get the money
that I should receive.

720
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:59,900
Yes, here I come.

721
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:02,280
This is the last place that I can back out to.

722
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,440
Although it's going to be hard.
Go Eun Chan, fighting!

723
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,800
Oh my, you even ordered the breakfast.

724
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,440
Oppa, you can't go hungry.

725
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:19,890
I'm not eating, leave quickly.

726
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,590
I'll leave after I wash up.

727
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:24,540
Who is it?

728
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:31,830
You really came?

729
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:39,470
Not sure if he's here for the
money or some ulterior motive...

730
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:44,920
You are under-aged, right?

731
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:46,090
No.

732
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:48,440
How can an adult go out in public like that?

733
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,150
And also, are you a boy or a girl?

734
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:53,500
You look exactly like a girl.
Have you been to the army yet?

735
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:55,490
I...

736
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,040
No...

737
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,820
Sit down.

738
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:02,430
There's no need.

739
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:06,330
At first, I didn't want to ask for compensation...

740
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:10,360
But it was just like what you saw, the scooter's
start-up engine is completely damaged.

741
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,830
To make it more clearly...

742
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:15,370
I was fired as well because of that incident.
I didn't even get paid before they kicked me out.

743
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,720
And so, you want some money
for compensation?

744
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:20,910
Yes.

745
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:22,290
How old is that fellow who ran away?

746
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:25,760
How would I know about that since
he dropped out from high school...

747
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,830
You can say it out without any worry since
I don't intend to send him to the police.

748
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:34,690
Although I may guess out a little, but still
you have said out how your system works.

749
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,940
I'm really interested in the underground society.

750
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,810
Underground society?
What are you talking about?

751
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:39,810
I think you better get this clear.

752
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:42,390
You think that it's so easy
to get by in this world?

753
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,690
That's right, you really looked so innocent.

754
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:45,990
And so, that's how it managed to work.

755
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:49,030
This is your first time, right?
It must be really embarrassing.

756
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:52,720
Ahjussi, you are still mistaken right now.

757
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,440
I have no relations at all with
that fellow that ran away.

758
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:56,470
- That fellow...
- I saw it all.

759
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:59,560
I saw you giving him the whatever
finger signs, don't you know?

760
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,470
Your trick had fallen through, don't
you know? You brainless fellow.

761
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:05,090
I think it's more pathetic of you
to be out with a woman at night.

762
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:07,590
Pathetic? Yeah right.
You must have felt envious.

763
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,020
Oh, really.

764
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:13,160
You look down on me just because
I'm here for the money.

765
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:15,660
You can't just ignore people
just because of some money.

766
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:17,250
Rascal, why are you shouting here?

767
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:18,410
Flat down!

768
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:20,320
Flat down? Ahjussi, you are really.

769
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:21,490
Oh, I'm going crazy.

770
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:22,690
What are you doing?
Flat down, quickly.

771
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:25,970
Let go of me.
You are not letting go of me?

772
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,820
Oppa.

773
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:36,710
Oppa, are you gay?

774
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:40,580
Oh, it's so crazy.
What are you doing?

775
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,090
Crazy! Crazy! Crazy!

776
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,850
I'm going crazy!

777
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:49,100
Hey, aren't you getting up?

778
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:01,540
And so why must you beat up others?

779
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:03,830
Leave.

780
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:07,340
Can't you give me the scooter's service fees?

781
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:09,800
I didn't even receive my part-time wages.

782
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:14,060
Anyway, it's still because of that incident.

783
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,730
Do your parents know this as well?

784
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:19,340
That you are begging others like this?
They will know even if they didn't see.

785
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:23,130
There will be such a son
since there is such a father.

786
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:27,540
Apologize.

787
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:31,530
How can you be saying anything
about my parents? Apologize to me!

788
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,820
I told you to apologize!

789
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:35,480
Both of you go out!

790
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:36,550
Apologize!

791
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:37,300
Both of you leave!

792
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:38,050
Apologize!

793
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:38,900
Both of you leave!

794
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:39,820
Leave now!

795
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:40,970
Apologize!

796
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,110
Leave!

797
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:43,620
Apologize!

798
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:45,920
- Out..
- Apologize!

799
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,760
Out now!

800
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:49,810
I'm not going out.

801
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:54,250
- Apologize!
- Oppa!

802
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:56,980
Apologize! Apologize!!

803
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,660
Apologize!!

804
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:02,120
Just for today, how many do I have to meet?

805
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,600
Oh yeah, there are six.

806
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:06,820
It's already arranged.

807
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,890
Six?

808
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,280
Why must the match-making
be arranged like a party?

809
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:15,590
Don't be like that, Mom.

810
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:17,970
Apologize!

811
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:22,510
Apologize to me, apologize!!

812
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,860
Money seeker.

813
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,450
Your father exported 300 this year, right?

814
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:32,120
Yes.

815
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:36,660
To be honest, my wish is to live as
poorly as other people.

816
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:42,180
To live in an apartment in Kang Nam
and run a small beauty shop.

817
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,210
Yes.

818
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:48,840
I feel too warm.

819
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:51,140
Is it okay to take my jacket off?

820
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:53,080
Apologize!

821
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:54,430
Apologize!

822
00:57:54,690 --> 00:57:57,940
Apologize.

823
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:02,210
Excuse me, a glass of ice water.

824
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:08,970
Sir.

825
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:11,110
You are not supposed to do this here.

826
00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:12,840
Oh, sorry.

827
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:13,960
Sorry.

828
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:16,460
You should apologize when you did
something that needs apologizing.

829
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,230
Yes, I'm really sorry.

830
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,950
Sorry.

831
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:24,920
Excuse me.

832
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:28,730
Sam Bong?

833
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:30,700
Oh, what's up?

834
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,460
Oh, right. It's spring.

835
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:38,540
You caught it, I got it.

836
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:41,020
Wait till I come back.

837
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:47,460
What?!

838
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:54,100
I majored in Korean history at MIT.

839
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:58,160
Oh, you are so sexy and gorgeous.

840
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,540
You are enjoying with me?

841
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:04,230
I'm so happy.

842
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:15,800
Can your tongue reach your chin?

843
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:18,220
I can do that.

844
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:29,630
Apologize, you punk!

845
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,800
Huge cups of coffee. Seven glasses of juice.
It's flowing so smoothly just like rain.

846
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:44,220
Those girls are all so troublesome.

847
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:49,550
Really... why are all the girls like that
one after another?

848
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:51,460
Apologize.

849
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,030
Hey, what are you doing?

850
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,540
Apologize.

851
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,220
Apologize for speaking
about my mom and dad.

852
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:02,670
And you must also pay up for all
the expenses I used to follow you.

853
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:04,020
The scooter's servicing fees
must be paid up as well.

854
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,930
You really have lots of tricks up your sleeves.

855
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:07,320
You and all the women that came
out for the match-making.

856
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,250
You are all up to funny tricks.

857
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:11,180
Ahjussi, you must keep up
with your status as well.

858
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:13,590
All the women that came for the match-making,
they're really pretty.

859
01:00:13,590 --> 01:00:15,290
Is it that you like men?

860
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:18,730
Just like what she said just now,
you are gay.

861
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:22,210
Really... rascal, who's gay...

862
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:36,110
Hey, can you turn around slowly.

863
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,090
Why?

864
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:52,580
Hey, do you want to be my lover?

865
01:00:58,390 --> 01:01:00,420
If you're giving me money, you should open up
your wallet. Why did you open your notebook?

866
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:01,780
- Name?
- Go Eun Chan.

867
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:04,000
- ID Number.
- 8408052371.

868
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:05,950
Hey! Say it correctly!

869
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:07,330
13, okay, 13!

870
01:01:07,470 --> 01:01:08,710
Don't you know if you are a girl or guy?

871
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:09,920
Why must you write up such a thing?

872
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:11,380
Giving money is enough.

873
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:12,350
I'm giving you a chance
since you seem to be needing work.

874
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:14,650
But I can't trust you.

875
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:15,500
What kind of work?

876
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:16,460
To be my lover.

877
01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:17,300
You bastard!

878
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:20,160
I heard he kissed a guy
and got beaten up by a woman.

879
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,340
Ahjussi! Ahjussi!

880
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:22,690
What good things have you been doing?

881
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:25,980
- What's that on you? Mine's a pig.
- A big fish. A big fish.

882
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:28,920
I broke up with DK.
I want to start again with you.

883
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:31,090
I wanted to forget the hurt
that you have given me.

884
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,820
Three months.
I'll give you money.

885
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:34,600
You have to restore this place
to what it was originally.

886
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:35,900
It's the place that you will be working.

887
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:39,800
This is your teacher, President Hong.
Have a true-hearted talk with him.
