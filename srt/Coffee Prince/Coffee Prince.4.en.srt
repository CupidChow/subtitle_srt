1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,470
You got hurt, didn't you?

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:03,380
Are you two really close?

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:04,220
A habit.

4
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,230
The type that when I don't see you,
I feel uneasy.

5
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,180
I wish to escape but can't help but
to meet again, that sort of bad habit.

6
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,520
Bad habit.

7
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,410
What is with Wang Ja?
Just call Prince.

8
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,120
Three to four members. Just as
the shop name implies, we only hire princes.

9
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:14,840
Prince?

10
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,470
Men?

11
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,420
That is me!

12
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,310
You are lying to me right?

13
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,080
Hwang Min Yeop!

14
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,150
Make orders for the coffee beans.

15
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,130
2 kilos, 20 bags.

16
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,230
What are you saying?
20 kilos, 20 bags

17
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,040
1400 won. Have to remit it today.

18
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:24,660
Sorry.

19
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,590
You think we are just playing?
Because of your mistake, the whole shop is affected.

20
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:28,690
Aren't you remorseful at all?

21
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,230
Looks like I got the wrong person.

22
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:34,230
If you keep thinking that you are so great,
then you can leave immediately.

23
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,170
Now you seem more human.

24
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,720
It was too cool the previous time.

25
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,760
There is nothing to life.

26
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,720
Happy go lucky.

27
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,780
But,

28
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,250
today is a little different.

29
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,560
Looks like its not bad, Choi Han Kyul.

30
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,310
Sorry, today I will not be sending you home.

31
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,590
I have to go back to the shop to have a look.

32
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,810
Let's walk a while.

33
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,260
If your mood is rotten,
you should do it like this.

34
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,630
Use all your might to swing your shoulders,
and take huge steps.

35
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,890
Like this, your mood will be better.

36
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,290
Like this.

37
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,980
Fourth Cup

38
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,850
Why does he need to scold someone like that?

39
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,310
Furthermore it is in front of that unni,
don't even save a little face for me.

40
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,390
Hey.

41
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,390
Didn't I tell you clearly it is 2 kilos?

42
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,250
Say something.

43
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,780
You only grew your body but not your brains.

44
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,960
Did I say 2 kilos or 20 kilos?

45
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:52,130
I… don't know.
I really can't remember.

46
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:57,280
That time you were reciting the telephone
number so fast. My head was spinning.

47
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,990
What is the use of questioning you now?
My fault for letting you do the ordering.

48
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,210
Go off work.

49
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,890
I got it.

50
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,570
Eun Chan, let's roast the beans.

51
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,640
What is it?

52
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,450
Quick, come out.

53
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,650
The other party is unwilling to sell.
To bring it in is not an easy feat.

54
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,690
Hence to return the goods,
you have to pay.

55
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,080
Because returning the goods is a little difficult.

56
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,370
Grandma, are you busy?

57
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,880
You should be busier than me.
Why are you still calling me?

58
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,510
Nothing, I only want to talk to you.

59
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,360
The preparation is almost done?

60
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,390
Of course, all coming along smoothly.

61
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,030
The opening celebration on Sunday,
you are coming right?

62
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,160
Heard that you bought 20 bags of coffee beans.

63
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,930
How do you plan to use them all?

64
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,800
Are you going to cook it to make bean biscuits?

65
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,160
Ah, the news travels real fast.

66
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,340
The three thousand won is all spent?

67
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,860
Do you want me to lend you money?

68
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,690
The interest is 20%.

69
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,850
Why don't you just over it?
The quality is good, you will be making a loss.

70
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,880
Enough.

71
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,980
Our company sells coffee beans,
why do we need to buy coffee beans?

72
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,280
Then I have nothing to say.

73
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,890
Goodbye.

74
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,190
His pride shoots all the way up to the sky.

75
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,500
Why did I start salivating?

76
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,130
What are you doing?

77
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,660
Hyung, hyung,
the packaging was designed by me.

78
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,150
Why are you roosting the beans?

79
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,280
If the beans were well roasted, we could sell it
for 10 times the original prize.

80
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,020
Its not just 1 or 2 bags, it's twenty bags.

81
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,920
Small profits, quick returns.

82
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,390
With my ability, we definitely will not fail.

83
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,010
I will go do deliveries.

84
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,480
Hi.

85
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,250
Oh, Hyung Min.

86
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,480
Of course it is 100% Arabic,
when did you ever see me tell lies?

87
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,410
What?

88
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,300
You want a sample?

89
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,970
Why do you even need
a sample of the items I produced?

90
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,350
If you don't want it, it's fine.

91
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,580
What's this talk about samples…

92
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:09,740
Go Eun Chan.

93
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,960
Make small bags of 1 kilo,
and load it on the scooter, hurry.

94
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,510
Once I got the orders, I will give you a call.
You will send it there immediately.

95
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,350
Why aren't you answering?

96
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,410
Yes.

97
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,480
Ha Rim.

98
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,340
Send 100g bags to the nearby shops,
tell them it is a free sample.

99
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,870
Do some promotion while you are at it.

100
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,280
Okay.

101
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,940
Min Yeop, put 1 kilo in each small bag,
load them up in the car.

102
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:26,960
I will go deliver the goods now.

103
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,770
Yes.

104
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,370
How are you Manager?

105
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,470
I am Choi Han Kyul.

106
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,810
Can I ask from you a favor to help my shop?

107
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,980
As colleagues, would it be possible
to get the delivery list of retailers?

108
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,100
Rascal.

109
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,010
Turns the situation around real quick.

110
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,280
Thank you.

111
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:53,960
Thank you.

112
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,190
How can my skills be rusty?

113
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,410
Stinkin' fella. You actually dared to…

114
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,640
How old are you?

115
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,510
Yes, yes. Just try the taste.

116
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,530
Hello?

117
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,960
No, I will not accept.

118
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,640
Yes. Thank you.

119
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,630
Quick.

120
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,970
Wow, all the drawing is done.

121
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,720
Thanks for the hard work.

122
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,960
I am very happy too.

123
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,000
That's right.

124
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,520
What happens to the coffee beans?

125
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,870
Sold 14 bags.

126
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,460
What?

127
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,130
Today, you look even more captivating.

128
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,790
Go Eun Chan.

129
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,520
Go Eun Chan.

130
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,940
Go Eun Chan!

131
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,290
Have you finished reflecting?

132
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,330
If you were to commit this type of mistake
again, then you really have to go.

133
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,860
Got it?

134
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,620
What type of attitude is this?

135
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,710
Looks like this cannot go on.

136
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,630
Yah.

137
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:45,420
Because of you, do you know how many
people were made tired out today?

138
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,200
First round, start.

139
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,750
Not taking responsibility for your own mistakes.

140
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,200
Because of you,
those who worked hard for a living…

141
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:58,360
If this is the way you treat your work,
we don't need you here, just leave!

142
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,030
You just refuse to say sorry right?

143
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,680
Ah, brother, don't be like this.

144
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,950
Relax, relax.

145
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,780
Aren't you going to answer me?

146
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,820
Hey, hey, hey!

147
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,310
Boss!

148
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,730
Please kill me.

149
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,940
That, the coffee beans.

150
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,540
That was ordered by me.

151
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,680
I can't remember if Go Eun Chan
said 2 kilos or 20 kilos.

152
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,310
Anyway, I thought it was 20 kilos, really sorry.

153
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,950
Work is also not just like playing "housekeeping".

154
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,780
It is also not something huge. Just forget it
after you have finished with your temper.

155
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,290
What is he saying about leaving?

156
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,220
Can I have a seat?

157
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,200
I was like you before.

158
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,660
I met something that I was wronged for.

159
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,390
It was around high school.

160
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:24,000
Every time when it reached afternoon break,
there will be a flasher outside the perimeter walls.

161
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,580
That day, the flasher appeared again.

162
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:30,810
The classmates were all at
the window shouting, oppa, oppa.

163
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:38,310
I wished to look too, but think that it would be
embarrassing, even if I see it, it would just be like this.

164
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,950
So I pretended to do my homework.

165
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:46,740
At that time, the classmates said,
it's Heo Jeong Woo.

166
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,680
Heo Jeong Woo was our school's
handsome single PE teacher.

167
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,610
I like him very much.

168
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,030
So I immediately squeezed my classmates
aside and asked, "Where? Where?"

169
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,980
At that time, someone pulled my ear from behind.

170
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,770
I shrugged my shoulder and pushed it aside.

171
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,570
It turns out, I was being pulled by my ear by
the physic teacher I liked better than Heo Jeong Woo.

172
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,900
He said, "Hey, rascal, you are so young,
why are you looking at those for?"

173
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,630
"Do you want to look so much?"

174
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,080
Definitely must be embarrassing.

175
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,920
Yes, really embarrassing, also so undeserving.

176
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,400
Now I still find it embarrassing.

177
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,540
I shall tell you the way to catch a flasher.

178
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,200
The more you yell,
the more satisfied the flasher will be.

179
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,440
So if you see a flasher, do not scream.

180
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,270
Then, at his you-know-what,

181
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:52,610
use a very firm stare at that area and say,

182
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,500
just this...?

183
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,860
You seem pretty cool.

184
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,190
You look pretty.

185
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,630
Talented in drawing too.

186
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,250
Great personality.

187
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,030
Me,

188
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,210
I am a little like that.

189
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,140
When I was in high school, I liked art too.

190
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:30,740
Actually I didn't really like the arts,
but I liked the art teacher.

191
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,110
Was the teacher very pretty?

192
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,030
The teacher was single.

193
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,890
So dashing and handsome.

194
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,030
It's ok.

195
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,020
I also liked a female teacher before.

196
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:47,400
I like her so much, until I wished I was a guy.

197
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,230
Hold on.

198
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,060
- Yeah, it's me.
- Oh, crazy, crazy.

199
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,340
I am about to go out.

200
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:04,100
Aigoo, Han Kyul hyung too
with another man's woman...

201
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,630
My Chan, eyes all swollen.

202
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,380
But you are still so pretty, pretty.

203
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,510
Disgusting, so disgusting.

204
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,550
You are exactly my style.
Where are you going?

205
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,540
You are at fault too.

206
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,910
What Manager Hong asked you to do,
why did you give it to Min Yeop to do?

207
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,020
Things which you are responsible for,
you should do it yourself.

208
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,000
Although Min Yeop is at fault too.

209
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,870
But Manager Hong and you are at fault too.

210
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,120
Did I say wrongly?

211
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,820
You just won't admit that
you are at fault too right?

212
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,890
Again, again,
you are like a girl who never stops talking.

213
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,440
I have to go.

214
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,640
Rascal, really.

215
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,390
Min Yeop, Min Yeop, come over.

216
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,190
Say, "I will work harder in the future!"

217
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,790
Come on. Come on.

218
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,640
Quick say it, you fella.

219
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,480
It's fine if you are having fun.
Ah, it hurts!

220
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,940
What is wrong?

221
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,440
Hey.

222
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,620
Quick pick up the phone.

223
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:10,670
Every time I am interviewed, I am asked
what drawing do I intend to draw next.

224
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:14,800
But I don't know what to draw, that
this point of time, and answer properly.

225
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,050
Still have to say I don't know?

226
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,270
You actually don't know.

227
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,650
Ssulja.

228
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,770
Ssulja, hello.

229
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,020
There is someone beside you?

230
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,870
Oh, it's Terry's friend.

231
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,330
I will call you again.

232
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,060
Shall we howl? Howl a little?

233
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,810
Why doesn't he howl?

234
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,230
Sit.

235
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,670
Reaction is a little slow. Today.

236
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,710
Aigoo, love you so much.

237
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,490
Just now I called you?

238
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,670
Really?

239
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,930
Maybe I was in the midst of a call.

240
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,140
What's up?

241
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,470
Mood not so good.

242
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,330
Besides I miss Ssulja.

243
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,600
You only miss Ssulja only?

244
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,430
Because the mouth is bitter,
beer tastes sweet. Definitely sweet.

245
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,430
Why is your mood so bad?

246
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,380
I was a little wronged.

247
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,570
There is a guy who takes a girl as a guy.

248
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,160
One is the employer, the other is the employee.

249
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:30,220
From the start, the employee was told about being
truthful, being responsible and so on and so forth.

250
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:35,710
But towards that girl,
the one who he thinks a guy.

251
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,670
He says words like "I don't need you" that sort.

252
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,330
Hold on, for safety measures
let's use Mr. X and Miss Y

253
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,890
Mr. X is the employer.

254
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,090
Miss Y is the employee.

255
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:50,200
Yes.

256
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,920
Does Miss Y like Mr. X?

257
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,950
That's not it.

258
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:03,150
Although they are friends,
they are also employer and employee.

259
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:08,990
Although they are man and woman,
not in love.

260
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,900
Like this.

261
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,910
Like this?

262
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,230
What is the meaning of "like this"?

263
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,440
Just like this.

264
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,510
That is, what does "like this" mean?

265
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,810
No other special meaning.
Just like this.

266
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,570
The reason for that is…

267
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,480
To Miss Y…

268
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,930
there's Mr. A…

269
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,270
Wow, so many stars.

270
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,050
The last time it rained so hard.

271
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,060
Today, there are so many stars.

272
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,140
So envious.

273
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:59,900
No matter how tough it is, looking
at the sky, looking at the stars.

274
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:04,480
Looking at all these pretty things, then just
be happy like a beautiful child.

275
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,930
To live life like that is very pretty too.

276
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:12,050
I can't do that.
It's a compliment.

277
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,350
Let's toast.

278
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,350
Cheers.

279
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,940
Spilled again?

280
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:30,530
I have a loose jaw.

281
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,100
No need to send me home.

282
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,720
I can walk home myself.

283
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,540
I know, you are saying one thing
but your heart wants another.

284
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,670
We're here.

285
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,300
This is my home.

286
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,580
Wow. Pretty home.

287
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,530
Thank you for sending me home.

288
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,320
Actually, it is the first time
someone sends me home.

289
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,070
Call me anytime.

290
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,030
I will send you home.

291
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,110
Like my father.

292
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,580
Miss B is very fortunate, right Ssulja?

293
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,870
Next time I will buy something nice for you.

294
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,120
Paw, paw, and, this paw.

295
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,050
See you.

296
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,660
Go on in.

297
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,700
Be careful on the roads.

298
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,380
Seeing that girl
makes you feel great, doesn't it?

299
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,590
Right?

300
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,030
Let's go.

301
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,930
Hate you.

302
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,100
Do they still need helpers here?

303
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,400
Didn't you say you can't work under anyone?

304
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,480
My shop was confiscated.

305
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,850
Want to work together?

306
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,600
If not why would I come here?

307
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,430
Get to know each other.

308
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,380
He'll be in charge of the side menu.

309
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,570
I am No Sun Ki.

310
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:30,920
I am Go Eun Chan.

311
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,220
I like to eat the waffles that you make.
Very happy to meet you.

312
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,570
I am Jin Ha Rim.

313
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,290
How old?

314
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,240
25.

315
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,050
Aigoo, same age as me.

316
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,520
Then let's be friends.

317
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,370
Hey, Hwang Min Yeop,
come over to say hello to a big brother.

318
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,920
What brother?

319
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:50,080
Why are you all like this?
Are you a girl or a guy? It's hard to tell.

320
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,910
You shouldn't talk.

321
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,390
lit's hard to tell with you, too
whether you're a gorilla or a human.

322
00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:01,360
Must I work here with these fellas?

323
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,830
Hey, what are you muttering to yourself?

324
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,000
Are you scolding me?
I am correct right?

325
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,060
Who exactly are you?

326
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,750
Are you Japanese or Korean?

327
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,500
Not for you to know.

328
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,440
Full of patriotism.

329
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,000
When he hears the national anthem,
he will shed tears over his face.

330
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,580
Despite that he totally loves canned foods.

331
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,420
In other words, he's totally a bird-brain.

332
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,920
What is the meaning of this?

333
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,130
I understood it all,
you couldn't understand again?

334
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,330
Come with me.

335
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,380
You want to have a one on one with me?

336
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,030
Who is he?

337
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,580
The one in charge of the side orders.

338
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,310
Ask him to leave.

339
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,090
Why does a coffee house require a side menu?

340
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,530
I'm the boss, come with me.

341
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,270
Stinking rascal.

342
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,420
It's spray carnation.

343
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,440
Once you touch it, it will glisten.

344
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,010
Where are you?

345
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,570
I say.

346
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,120
Really good.

347
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,210
What?

348
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,020
The person who asks me what.

349
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,570
Hold on.

350
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,700
Listen well.

351
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:46,300
Someday, in the distant future,
remember the beautiful sunlight

352
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:52,800
and the journey I took to see you

353
00:19:53,450 --> 00:20:03,980
At that faraway beach and sky

354
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:14,650
Remember the precious memories we made

355
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:26,050
You're my dazzlingly bright sea

356
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:36,830
If you shove me away,
my dreams crumble into the whiteness

357
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:47,980
I'm going away on a trip,
a long sea journey

358
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:58,490
I'll carry my body on these soft waves toward you

359
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:09,530
You're my dazzlingly bright sea

360
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:20,590
If you shove me away,
my smile crumbles into the whiteness

361
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:31,990
You know how much I truly love you

362
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:44,200
Wrap yourself warmly, softly, with me

363
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,290
Hello?

364
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,900
It makes me sad,

365
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:04,610
wondering if hearing this song
will bring me pain later.

366
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:33,870
Look at the way you eat.

367
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,410
Even eating raw meat.

368
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,990
Just touch the fire a little and
you send it to your mouth.

369
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,160
Why are you not eating?

370
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,780
My angel says she likes thin ones,
so I am not eating.

371
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:41,620
Why?

372
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,940
So unfortunate.

373
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,910
Who is he?

374
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,510
You're interested in him?

375
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,520
He is just this sort of person.

376
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,330
Really being an "Eun Chan".

377
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,970
What is being an "Eun Chan"?

378
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:09,730
A means of excessively filling up your volume
and weight or simply stuffing yourself.

379
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,890
Often knocking onto and destroying the things
which are within two meters from you.

380
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,820
The saying used
when one is hurt and feels nothing.

381
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:20,580
The important line, "To be like Eun Chan. "
"To be Eun Chan. " "Eun Chan-like. "

382
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,400
And so forth.
What do you think? You like?

383
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,820
My Chan.

384
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:30,580
That is good. "To be like Eun Chan"
"To be Eun Chan" "Eun Chan-like" Good.

385
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,730
What do you think of "To be like Han Kyul"?

386
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,250
Pretend to be reasonable,
while manipulatingly using others.

387
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,140
Yelling in front of others.

388
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,870
Used to describe someone
who looks down on others.

389
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,990
"To be like Han Kyul" "Han Kyul-like"
This is what is...

390
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,710
Look down on others?

391
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,100
That's pretty good.

392
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:52,720
"To be like Han Kyul" to describe looking down
on others, it's not bad too.

393
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,670
Not happy when you heard it?

394
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:00,890
Let's just eat quietly.

395
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,120
Yes, yes.

396
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:07,010
This is the first meal together.
Let's all get along. Good, good.

397
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,170
One more bottle of soju here.

398
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,250
Yes.

399
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,930
Hey, stop! I get it. I get it!

400
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,580
Ah, madman.

401
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,440
Go away, go away.

402
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,560
No! Not there! Not the baby toe!

403
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:36,870
Go away, what are you doing?

404
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,560
Boss.

405
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,820
Crazy fella.

406
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,820
Go away, what are you doing?

407
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:00,910
Stinking rascal, you are crazy.

408
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:03,320
Hey, what are you doing?

409
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,610
You are so dead!

410
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,090
Really.

411
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,290
Ah, really!

412
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,190
Yah!

413
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,310
Ugh, pervert.

414
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,600
You pervert, kissed the mouth.

415
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:15,770
Hwang Min Yeop.

416
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:18,990
You dare to like him? Eun Chan is mine!

417
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:21,400
How is he yours? He is mine.

418
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,730
He won't get any sense
in his head with just that.

419
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,780
You.

420
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,790
- Uncle, give me the big onion
- Oh so spicy!

421
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,410
Water, water, water.

422
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:40,930
Here.

423
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,800
Water, water, water.

424
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,290
Did you like it?

425
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:56,170
When Min Yeop kissed your lips,
did you like it?

426
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,150
Your face is red.

427
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,560
A fiery feeling?

428
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,110
Oh is it a feeling of sparks flying?

429
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,680
He's was so-so compared to you.

430
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:12,270
I do not like Min Yeop's type.
I like your type more.

431
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,900
Don't you know?

432
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,400
What are you saying between friends?

433
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,540
I don't think you are great too.

434
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,490
You started the joke first.

435
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:23,580
If this carries on,
when can I go to New York?

436
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:24,900
You are going to New York?

437
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,560
Why? When?
What are you going to do?

438
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,230
Why do you need to know?

439
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,070
You say things just so
so that people won't like you.

440
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:34,340
Have we always been close?

441
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,660
Talk about feeling close.

442
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,550
Mister.

443
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,470
You are really going to New York…

444
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,210
Nothing.

445
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,050
You know...

446
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,530
What?

447
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,640
See you.

448
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:13,970
Nuisance.

449
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,840
[Coffee Prince Opening Day]

450
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,250
Go Eun Chan, adjust the name tag.

451
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,230
Let's just do this.

452
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,420
At this point of time, the president will
say a word like, everyone work hard.

453
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,240
Do not dig your nose.

454
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,940
Not good if the customers see it.

455
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,690
I got it.

456
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,840
Coffee.

457
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,330
Prince.

458
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,840
Quick! Shout Prince.

459
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,590
Prince!

460
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,070
Enjoy.

461
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,290
Son, mom's here!

462
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,970
Here, here.

463
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:12,660
Why are you here?

464
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,690
Don't yell at me,
I was dragged here against my will.

465
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,820
You can tell by how casually I'm dressed.

466
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:18,160
Promotion was done well.

467
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:21,750
But would business be good
around this area?

468
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,520
You're saying uncaring things again?

469
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,400
Did someone say something?

470
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,570
I didn't hear anything.

471
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,110
Angel.

472
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,600
I drew this.

473
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,770
Idiot.

474
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,960
Is my face that big?

475
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,940
At first I only wanted to draw the face,

476
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,380
but then I thought…

477
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,360
Angel...

478
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,790
Oh wow, this coffee house is so wonderful.

479
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:58,310
It's just the style that I like.

480
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,690
You're here.

481
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,160
Aunty,
it's time we head back.

482
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,870
Later on the weather will get hot.

483
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:08,370
I'm scared that the sun will darken Noonim's fair skin.

484
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,870
I'm really concerned.

485
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:14,340
It's rare that we get to come out,
why not we go for a walk?

486
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,210
Enough, don't push anymore.

487
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:20,200
Scared that Eun Chan's mom's skin will get dark,
then why go for a walk?

488
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,850
Mom, I need to work, hurry and go back.

489
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,950
Then you do your thing, I won't bother you.

490
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,730
What's with you today?

491
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:32,650
Is it because of your uniform
that you look more professional?

492
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,780
I have my thoughts as well.

493
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:38,240
Aunty, let's see the second floor.

494
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,620
Of course we have to go.

495
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,410
Mom, there's nothing on the second floor.

496
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,250
Just because of that we have to go.
Let's go this way.

497
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:49,510
Just because of that we have to go, crazy.

498
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:54,670
Don't wrap it anymore.

499
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:59,740
This has to be thrown out anyway.

500
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:00,820
Stop wrapping!

501
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,250
What!

502
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:05,480
Let's wrap it up, it has to
be thrown anyway, I want this.

503
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:09,290
Han Kyul's family came as well.

504
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,520
Wow, nice car.

505
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:14,980
Grandma, you're here.

506
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:17,970
Mom, you're here.

507
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,010
Impressive!

508
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,380
My son, it's really impressive.

509
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:24,210
His mom is very beautiful, like a rich wife.

510
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:28,230
She's part of the family that owns Dong-in Foods.
Of course she's a rich wife.

511
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,340
Daughter of a wealthy family marries a wealthy
person; she must have never suffered before.

512
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,660
Of course she's pretty.

513
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,540
Then,

514
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:37,220
our boss is really the son of Dong-in Foods?

515
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,220
He carelessly yells at the president.

516
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,760
I was standing strong on refusing, but
she kept saying it won't work without me.

517
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,870
So she handed over her grandson to me.

518
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:49,870
Basically, if this were the olden days, I'd be
the tutor who would instruct the crown prince.

519
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,270
Have to go say hi.

520
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,020
Crown prince?

521
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:00,160
Mister!Mister!

522
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,110
What?

523
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,250
Mister, why are you here?

524
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,280
Yoo Ju drew this?

525
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,090
Impressive.

526
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,470
Grandma.

527
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:12,050
Come over here.

528
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,200
Congratulations.

529
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,360
Our Han Seong is here.

530
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:15,640
I'm a little late.

531
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,150
The traffic was terrible.

532
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,710
Grandma.

533
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,350
Mister.

534
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,100
Mister! Mister!

535
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,670
Mister.

536
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:35,050
Mister, don't say I'm a girl,
you can't say it out!

537
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,840
Don't mention me.

538
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,950
Hello, Mister!

539
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,100
Where are you?

540
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,880
I'm at the entrance, main lounge, main lounge.

541
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:00,190
Then just listen to me starting now,
don't answer me.

542
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,070
Uh…

543
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,590
Don't answer!

544
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,140
What?

545
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,070
Don't ask anything!

546
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:10,740
From there walk straight,
keep going straight, straight.

547
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:15,090
You see a small restaurant,
turn left here, turn left.

548
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,370
Go up the stairs.

549
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:18,950
You'll see a big tree, flowers as well.

550
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:22,060
Then turn left, left…
anyway, turn left!

551
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,120
Mister, mister, hurry!

552
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,790
What are you doing?

553
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,640
Did you mention me at all?

554
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:30,210
What?

555
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,680
You know our boss?

556
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,590
Yes.

557
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,880
What's your relation?

558
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,020
We're cousins.

559
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,270
Then I'm asking you a favor.

560
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,990
Can you pretend to not know me?

561
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:41,850
What?

562
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,900
In order to work here, I told a few lies.

563
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,060
What did you lie about, your age?

564
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,970
They only want males here.

565
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,150
So,

566
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,070
Either way, if our supervisor finds out
I'm female, I'll be fired for sure!

567
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,730
So we can't let him know I'm a girl.

568
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:58,860
Please.

569
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,210
What are you talking about?

570
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,470
How are you like a boy,
one glance can tell you're a girl.

571
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:06,150
Han Kyul really mistook you for a man?

572
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,610
He's probably pretending not to know!

573
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:12,980
It's not like that, from the beginning
our boss thought I'm a male.

574
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:16,240
Headache. How can fate be such a stupid.

575
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,980
Wait.

576
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:21,500
This mean, Mr. X is Han Kyul,
and you're Miss Y?

577
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,600
For real!

578
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,210
You can still laugh out loud!

579
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,630
My blood is flowing the other way.

580
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,230
I understand, I understand.

581
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,470
These clothes really fit you.

582
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,570
Mister!

583
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,840
I know, sorry.

584
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:37,750
You'll help me keep my secret, okay?!

585
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:38,590
Promise.

586
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,000
Oh, okay.

587
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,190
Promise.

588
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:43,140
You can't say it out!
You have to keep it secret!

589
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:46,200
Then I'm trusting you,
I'm going back first.

590
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:48,790
Mister, wait awhile
before coming up. Thanks!

591
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,640
Come in quick.

592
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,130
Everyone worked hard!

593
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:08,990
Thanks for the hard work,
thanks for the hard work.

594
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,320
Boss.

595
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,520
Today was interesting.

596
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:21,490
Also, the issue with the beans, thank you
for forgiving me, see you tomorrow.

597
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:33,420
Ah, it broke down again.

598
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,700
Leave the bike here,
I'll take you home. Get in.

599
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,630
It's fine. I just have to try a few more times.

600
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,580
I'm tired, hurry up and get in.

601
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,890
Ah, why won't it start?

602
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:47,600
Oh, Han Yoo Ju.

603
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:48,890
Now?

604
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:50,460
Okay.

605
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,380
Then, see you in a bit.

606
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:56,350
Sorry, I have something urgent,
have to go first.

607
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,690
You can't drop me off on the way?

608
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,780
Sorry, sorry.

609
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:01,870
Sorry!

610
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:09,680
Fly over there, fly.

611
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,120
Thank you for the present,
and some good news.

612
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,580
Everyone is endlessly complimenting your mural.

613
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,520
Sorry, I was too busy so I couldn't go over.

614
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:26,810
Right, I'm the first to wish you a happy birthday?

615
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,300
There's still one more week.

616
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:32,600
In order for you to be happy everyday starting today,
I want to wish you the best in advance.

617
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,270
Have a cup of tea before you go?

618
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,780
I'm exhausted.

619
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,630
So exhausted.
I don't have any energy at all.

620
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,920
What if I accidentally grasp your hand?

621
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:44,030
Mischievous…

622
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,000
Stop.

623
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,750
I'm leaving.

624
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:48,710
Laugh just like that!
Happy birthday.

625
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,640
Thank you, cutey

626
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:14,400
My Chan, my…

627
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,890
Hey, hey!

628
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,230
Welcome…

629
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,480
What welcome?
This isn't some Chinese fast food.

630
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:22,310
I'm bored out of my mind, play with me?

631
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,400
This is not an amusement park.

632
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,030
- Play what play.
- Why are there no customers?

633
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:28,660
When it was free, everyone swarmed here.

634
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,360
Where did they all go now?

635
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,280
Hey!

636
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,280
Still seeing my Eun Sae, aren't you?

637
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,100
What are you talking about again!

638
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,220
I'm already not in a good mood.

639
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,180
Hey, you come out and face me alone.

640
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,300
Come out.

641
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,780
Come on!

642
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:48,620
Fight, fight!

643
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:49,670
Hey!

644
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:54,670
Use this shovel to see who can dig better.

645
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,960
Come on.

646
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:57,520
You do it yourself first.

647
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:58,620
Okay, here.

648
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,860
Hey, hurry, hurry.

649
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:17,080
He can really dig!

650
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:18,780
Is he human?

651
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,680
Very good!

652
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:38,480
30 minutes.

653
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,300
It's your turn now.

654
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:43,340
Hurry and dig.

655
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:52,420
Bury, bury.

656
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:56,760
Flee!

657
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,010
You're not digging?

658
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,710
I'm gonna start.

659
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,420
Ready, go!

660
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:17,220
Eun Chan, continue drinking, continue drinking!
Min Yeop is catching up to you!

661
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:18,390
Oh, okay.

662
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,850
Continue drinking, continue drinking.

663
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:29,040
I can't drink anymore.

664
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,830
No, no, hurry and drink.

665
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,350
Manager Hong.

666
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,300
Manager Hong!

667
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,240
Manager Hong!

668
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:51,320
Yes.

669
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,090
Everyone left the store alone,
where did they go?

670
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:54,950
What?

671
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,030
Everyone left the store alone,
where did they go?!

672
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,760
Went to play basketball!

673
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:01,930
What is this?

674
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:08,780
There are no customers, so you play.

675
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:12,150
Not a single person there,
the store is completely empty.

676
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,020
Think this is the same as school days
when you skipped class?

677
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,130
Okay.

678
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:21,390
Today I'll teach
according to your level a lesson on attitude.

679
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,380
Like basketball?

680
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:24,760
It's fun?

681
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:28,360
Okay, today play a match with me.

682
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:31,710
I'm wrong, hyung, I mean, boss.

683
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:33,960
Forgive me once!

684
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,920
Hwang Min Yeop, Go Eun Chan.

685
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:38,250
You guys like to compete?

686
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:40,540
You two be a team, I'm alone.

687
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:44,600
The match is one hour; whoever rests
or gives up in the middle is dead.

688
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,410
What is it, you rascal!

689
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,730
Aren't you going to start competing!

690
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:51,190
Yell at you once and you give me attitude
for several days, useless person.

691
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:52,220
What?

692
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:53,650
Want to cry again?

693
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:57,700
Let's start.

694
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:02,960
What?

695
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,340
We have to hold this position for an hour?

696
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,580
Tired to death.

697
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:21,360
Time's up.

698
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,090
You're cool, Go Eun Chan.

699
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:32,560
Eh?

700
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,720
For sticking through to the end
without giving up, you're cool.

701
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:53,110
Now you know.

702
00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:00,150
I thought my brain was going to explode.

703
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,320
Right, right?

704
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:05,120
Boss, I'm really sorry about today.

705
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:08,900
Also, I won't compete with him again.

706
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:12,640
What am I doing here?

707
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,320
You're speaking Japanese again!

708
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:16,980
Boss,

709
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:18,470
let's yell out fighting once!

710
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,540
Fighting, Fighting, Fighting!

711
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,530
Coffee Prince, go!

712
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:34,420
Please make my income
triple the invested amount!

713
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,430
They couldn't have seen, right?

714
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:03,600
What was I thinking,
even playing with water!

715
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:04,560
Min Yeop!

716
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:07,030
- Almost showed my curves.
- Where are you?

717
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:09,250
I'm here.

718
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:11,000
Min Yeop.

719
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:16,460
I'm completely soaked through.

720
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,280
It's all your fault.

721
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:21,200
As long as we had fun, talk so much.

722
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:28,890
What's up, is it broken?

723
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,960
Maybe it's also like its owner.

724
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:34,000
Move aside.

725
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,320
What the?!

726
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:44,490
Scared you?!

727
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:45,370
Stupid!

728
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:46,860
I like you!

729
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,370
What is up with him?

730
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,590
Ah, my crackers, he ate them all!

731
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,350
Cheating customers.
You can't even see an ant here.

732
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:01,100
Like I said, why spend all the money to renovate?

733
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:04,350
This continues, how can income be tripled
the invested amount in three months.

734
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:07,410
Triple the invested amount,
what's that supposed to mean?

735
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:08,670
Rascal.

736
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:11,520
He's okay, can't go to America,
then just go into the company.

737
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:12,820
But to me, this is a matter of life or death.

738
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:15,370
What is this, not even a single customer!

739
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:17,210
Manager Choi is going to America?

740
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,640
Again, again, saying uncaring words again.

741
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:21,880
What?

742
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:26,010
Han Kyul hyung also wants to do well,
that's why he started with us.

743
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,910
We were also able to find a job.

744
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:31,510
It's fine that you can't help out, but saying
those uncaring words again.

745
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:33,020
Rascal, dare talk to an elder like that?!

746
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,870
How did I say uncaring words?!

747
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:37,080
Aigoo, really…

748
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,540
Aigoo, really?

749
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:40,210
You just said aigoo, really?!

750
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,540
Ah…ahjussh, don't be like this!

751
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:43,680
You guys don't be like this.

752
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:44,850
Manager Hong,

753
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:46,240
experimented yet with the menu?

754
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,530
I said last time to strengthen the "iced" line.

755
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:50,370
How can you talk like that?

756
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:52,280
Manager Hong, experimented yet?

757
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:53,460
So what if I haven't?!

758
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:54,880
Am I your follower?

759
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:56,410
Are you ordering me right now?

760
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,480
When did I order you?

761
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:00,750
When, when, every time it's like that!

762
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:03,810
I already said the target market here are the 70-80's.

763
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,410
Coffee isn't a business for young adults!

764
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:08,440
I can say what I like to say, you don't even listen!

765
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:11,700
Today there were no customers so I took
a nap, you seemed like you couldn't bear it.

766
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:14,630
But you still took them out to play!

767
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:17,210
I asked you where you went,
and you left without answering!

768
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:19,660
Manager, it's not that hyung wasn't listening to you.

769
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,180
Clothes are soaked through, he
was in a hurry to change.

770
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:25,130
I know everything, you just disregard me.

771
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:29,810
But it's because of my roasting skills that I was
able to solve the beans problem, you know?

772
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:32,220
The price was 20% of other people's.

773
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:34,270
If it was sold on regular price,
not one could've been sold!

774
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:35,010
What?

775
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:36,620
You unmannered rascal!

776
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:38,100
Mister!

777
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:40,200
Hurry and leave. Didn't you say today
is your birthday so you want to leave earlier?

778
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:41,450
Boss, quickly go.

779
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:43,160
You can't live like this!

780
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,370
The whole day with that impatient expression.

781
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,740
You come to work late.

782
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:47,900
Everything is not satisfying.

783
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,300
If the manager is like this,
how can business be good?!

784
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:51,950
Have you said enough?! Rascal!

785
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,050
Forget it, forget it!

786
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:54,780
What do you mean forget it, forget it!

787
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,530
I'll face you alone?

788
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:58,700
What if you fought him alone?

789
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,380
We're a family.

790
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,620
Let go, let go.

791
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:05,820
Where's the chair?

792
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,450
How is it?

793
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,670
Successful?

794
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,840
Very successful.

795
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:16,130
You look energetic.

796
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:21,000
Your coffee house, the news spread quickly.

797
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:23,230
What news?

798
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:24,650
Good news?

799
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:28,220
Said flies of the world
are all gathered there.

800
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:31,140
It's just starting.

801
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:34,190
Of course to settle firmly is
going to take some time, grandma.

802
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:35,860
Exactly, grandma.

803
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:37,450
Promotion takes some time as well.

804
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:41,230
Report your coffee house sales to your dad.

805
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:50,350
Hey, that day,

806
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:54,860
you were unhappy at Yoo Ju's place?

807
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:58,050
It's in the past, why bring it back up, annoying.

808
00:51:58,170 --> 00:52:00,060
It took me courage to ask that,

809
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:02,000
but you easily brush it aside.

810
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:06,970
Newspapers announced that
Han Yoo Ju is opening a gallery.

811
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:09,310
Why can't I get used to Han Yoo Ju?

812
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:11,390
Because you always want to discipline her.

813
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:15,060
Han Yoo Ju can't be a butterfly specimen.

814
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:18,600
A living butterfly,
it's normal after all to always change.

815
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:20,080
That is also her charm.

816
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:23,540
So that is the charm.

817
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,310
I never knew.

818
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:32,440
Right, your store has a short framed,
round faced employee?

819
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:33,250
Go Eun Chan?

820
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:34,220
Yes, yes.

821
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:35,590
You know him?

822
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,930
He delivers milk to my place.

823
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:40,410
How did you know him?

824
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,490
Interview?

825
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:43,780
It's a long story with him.

826
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:45,580
Did you hear about the rumors
during my time of blind dates?

827
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:49,440
Oh, he's him.

828
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:50,410
Really?

829
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:54,210
That guy's interesting,

830
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:56,470
he's not a boring person.

831
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,410
What are you doing?

832
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:07,210
Oh.

833
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,350
Like this, is it like this?

834
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:16,920
No, your wrist can't exert too much force.

835
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:18,910
Are you that good?

836
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:23,690
I think it's the same as what you're doing.

837
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:25,670
It is if you look casually.

838
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:27,660
But it's not if you look closely.

839
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:31,550
Like this, it's not using the wrist,
you have to use your shoulder.

840
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,620
How can you pour it in at once!

841
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:41,890
Why is it so hard to pour some water?

842
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:44,170
I'm good, aren't I?

843
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:46,310
I practiced everyday.

844
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,230
You really have the Korean perseverance.

845
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:51,590
You're not angry anymore?

846
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:53,450
Who's angry?

847
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:01,850
Try a cup.

848
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:07,090
Tastes good.

849
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,610
Tastes good.

850
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:11,150
Brewed flavor is good as well.

851
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,810
Lighting is good as well.

852
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,060
Ambience is good as well.

853
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,060
You should leave, I have to work.

854
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,140
What are you going to do?

855
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,860
I can help you.

856
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:23,760
It's not something you can help.

857
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:25,650
I can help with anything.

858
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:29,070
Just go like I said, I can't concentrate
with someone watching me work.

859
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:30,000
Go.

860
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,030
I saw you receive a lot of birthday presents.

861
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,960
Open them, I want to see as well.

862
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:34,630
Go.

863
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,840
I will, even if you won't let me.

864
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:38,630
I also have a lot of things to do.

865
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:41,090
Have to brush my teeth, also wash my hair.

866
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:43,860
Also have to sleep, and dream.

867
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,230
Be safe.

868
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:54,250
Boss.

869
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:57,650
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you,

870
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:01,660
the manager that I love, happy birthday to you!

871
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:17,390
Within three months, earn triple
that of the invested amount.

872
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:22,100
If failure, then close down;
if success, then go to America.

873
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,070
Which one is better?

874
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:25,960
Of course it's better to go to America.

875
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:27,610
But it's also possible to not be able to go.

876
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:29,420
Business is really bad.

877
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:30,750
Right.

878
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:35,720
Is my Sun Ki oppa doing well?

879
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,010
How many times have you seen him,
and it's already Sun Ki oppa?

880
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:42,340
Also, aren't you interested in Min Yeop,
why are you still in contact with him?

881
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:43,630
Think it's a little wasteful.

882
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,430
Finally done.

883
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,930
Eat.

884
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:50,690
You're two-timing.

885
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:53,000
Two-timing is our family-trademark.

886
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,430
Look at mom,
Manager Hong ahjussi and ahjussi Ku.

887
00:55:57,690 --> 00:55:59,570
Am I two-timing as well?

888
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,710
I have an ahjussi.

889
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,110
When I see the ahjussi,

890
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:14,570
I'd feel…how do I describe that feeling.

891
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:19,840
Like a warm blanket, like the morning sun.

892
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:23,330
You know what I mean?

893
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:24,240
Yes.

894
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:25,390
Continue.

895
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:29,040
And someone else is…

896
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:33,770
a little hated but still okay.

897
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:39,000
Personality is very annoying,

898
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,820
but he's not a bad person.

899
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:44,010
But also not a good person.

900
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:46,490
Sometimes I like, sometimes I hate.

901
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:48,570
Ah, what am I saying?

902
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:50,490
I know what you mean.

903
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,090
That's two-timing!

904
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:59,350
But both are very handsome.

905
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,210
Look at your behavior,
they don't know you're like this, right?

906
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,150
Yes.

907
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:09,290
Are you that bored?

908
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,290
Crushing on two at the same time,
and drooling as well.

909
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:15,290
Having a sister like you, it's really…

910
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:50,430
No, stand there!

911
00:58:50,930 --> 00:58:52,360
Boss, you're very loyal.

912
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:55,420
You have the ability to make others happy.

913
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:57,440
Let's go somewhere as a group!

914
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,750
Today attract him to go out and play.

915
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:03,900
Boss can make mistakes in love.

916
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:07,310
Boss used his head a bit today.

917
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:10,030
Your beauty really stands out!

918
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:11,610
This friend is pro-single.

919
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,410
How did you know I'm sick?

920
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:15,370
This is a woman's public bath.

921
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:17,350
I have my reasons.
