1
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,390
Your face looks awful,
did you not sleep last night?

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,410
Yeah, just...

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,220
Buy some sleeping pills and sleep.
Your face doesn't look human.

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,500
I told you to quit, why are you here?

5
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,100
You're quite selfish.

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,930
You still have something left to say?

7
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:48,236
Twelfth Cup

8
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,950
I'll give you three minutes.

9
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,400
If you have something to say,
say it quick and get out.

10
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:09,630
At first, I didn't think
you'd like someone like me.

11
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,770
I thought you liked Yoo Ju unni.

12
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,380
She's pretty and charismatic
even from a woman's view.

13
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:22,210
So I thought it'd be
better for me to be a guy.

14
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,690
When I asked you how it
would be if I were a girl,

15
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,800
you said you wouldn't see any more girls.

16
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,100
You said you'd meet an elegant,
rich woman and marry her.

17
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,760
You said you'll meet a woman that
your grandmother and your mother would like.

18
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:42,580
I'm not ladylike. I'm not pretty, either.

19
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,100
If we could be brothers,
we could always be together.

20
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,590
We could goof around together.
You were nice then, too.

21
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,720
I was so happy with that,
that's why I couldn't tell you.

22
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:03,520
I really hate it. Why am I always
betrayed by the ones I love?

23
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,790
Why did my father never tell
me about my birth mother?

24
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,020
Why couldn't you tell me about yourself?

25
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,180
I thought about it over
and over again yesterday...

26
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,580
It was that you and my dad couldn't trust me.

27
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,040
I loved you so much.

28
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,980
But you couldn't trust me, so...

29
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:30,070
It's not that I couldn't trust you.
I couldn't trust myself.

30
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:33,640
When I told you that I loved you,

31
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,640
I had to ignore what my friends
and my family would think.

32
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,140
To come up with that
decision and act upon it...

33
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,800
It was really hard for me.

34
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,540
Go Eun Chan, you know...

35
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,500
I need someone who trusts me.

36
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,800
Even if the rest of the world says I'm
worthless, I need someone who says,

37
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:05,930
"Choi Han Kyul hasn't had a chance, Choi
Han Kyul does what he says he's going to do,

38
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:11,800
Choi Han Kyul just hasn't found
what he wants to do in life,

39
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,360
but he can do it if he puts his heart to it."

40
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,950
I need someone who trusts me like that.

41
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,480
Not someone like you,
who deceives even in love,

42
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,230
calculating whether or not they'll be found out.

43
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,280
I didn't have the courage.

44
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,280
I didn't want to get dumped...

45
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,090
I wanted to tell you, but if I told you...

46
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,450
I was afraid you'd say
you wouldn't see me again.

47
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:43,360
The reason why I'm telling you now
is that I want you to see me as a woman.

48
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:51,900
I'm really sorry.
I know I was wrong, but...

49
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,160
I like you.

50
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,740
I love you.

51
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,620
If you tell me to quit, I'll quit.

52
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,820
If you don't want to see me...

53
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,520
can't we just see each other?

54
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,520
I don't have the courage
to see you anymore.

55
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,060
I don't know who you are.

56
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:25,320
The Go Eun Chan I knew...
my little bell,

57
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,880
was a kid I trusted and liked.

58
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,510
Who stood up to the world with just
what he had and nothing more,

59
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,090
and I wanted to be like that kid.

60
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,510
But you...

61
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,410
you're not the Go Eun Chan I knew.

62
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,040
Let's stop seeing each other.

63
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,830
Go Eun Chan is quitting,
get his pay ready.

64
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,460
Don't drag this out so long – too long!

65
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,160
What are you so angry about?

66
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:25,310
Stop it.

67
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,380
Stop what?

68
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,160
Are you showing off?

69
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,930
Let's pretend you had a harder time
than Eun Chan – so what?

70
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,640
Is having a harder time and loving more that
big of a deal, that you can't bear it?

71
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,070
What's so difficult that you have to cause
all this fuss? You've already done enough.

72
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,950
In the end, it's just that Eun Chan is
a girl, and you guys like each other.

73
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,620
You should be dancing with happiness together.

74
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,420
Is it so bad that you have to bother the entire
café? Is this a place for you guys to fight?

75
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,510
Brother.

76
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,640
A love fight should only last
so long. What's the deal?

77
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,480
If you're going to end it, end it peacefully.

78
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,180
You're making such a big fuss about it.

79
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,030
Go and tell Eun Chan to
pack up and come down.

80
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,990
Brother.

81
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,440
I'm going to go crazy.

82
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,780
Brother.

83
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,800
Where are you guys going?

84
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,950
Brother, let's go out, let's go out and talk.

85
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,160
Where are you going out to?

86
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,400
Watch the shop.

87
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,670
I'm going to go out.

88
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,890
I can't work here anymore with this.

89
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,150
I tried to patient, but this is too much.

90
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,890
What's wrong, Manager Hong?

91
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,910
If you leave, who's going
to make the coffee?

92
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,480
All the customers come for your coffee.

93
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,400
There's no need for you to quit.
I'm leaving in a month.

94
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,600
Yeah? Then I'll come back in
a month. Feel much better now.

95
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:46,260
Manager Hong, don't act so emotionally.

96
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,560
Sister.

97
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,800
Right now the Manager is really mad.

98
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,250
He'll ask you to come back when he's cooled off, so...

99
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:01,900
Don't be too hurt, and
think of it as taking a break.

100
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,780
You're so big, and you're about to cry.

101
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,130
Go work.

102
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,700
Yes.

103
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,530
I don't know what to say...
let's stay in touch.

104
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,350
DK is taking our entire gallery.

105
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,040
He's buying all the popular paintings,
and now he's even taking the painter.

106
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,840
DK is having so much fun.

107
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,810
I'm sorry. We still had days
left according to the contract.

108
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,770
I don't want to hear it.

109
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,350
Either way, the damage is done.

110
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,930
Choi Han Sung

111
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,770
I'm going to go crazy.

112
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,750
I don't have anything to say to you.

113
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,480
Don't say anything and just listen.

114
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,380
When I first met Eun Chan,
it was about 4 months ago.

115
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,920
She was our milk delivery.

116
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,990
Even though it should be
hard for a lady to do that,

117
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,310
she was cheerful about it,
and I liked that about her.

118
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:51,230
And the girl I took to Yoo Ju's
gallery party was Go Eun Chan.

119
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,930
It was her first opening
after she came to Korea,

120
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,130
and after finding out DK was her sponsor,

121
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,410
I was mad, so I took just took her.

122
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:04,080
But that day, she was really pretty.

123
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:11,120
But, by the time I noticed she was
pretty, Go Eun Chan already liked you.

124
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:15,780
She was crying and told me
that she really liked you.

125
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:21,620
Your speech is really boring.
How long do I have to listen to you?

126
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:26,120
She wanted to tell you, but
she didn't have the courage.

127
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,570
She didn't feel like she
was either a guy or a girl.

128
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,150
She cried a lot that day.

129
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,500
I'll tell you the truth.

130
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,960
I was shaken by her.

131
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,950
But... she likes you,

132
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,890
so we decided to just be friends.

133
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,850
And I don't know why
I was shaken up by her.

134
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,570
That's really all.

135
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:06,690
Eun Chan is telling you the truth
now because she trusts you.

136
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,640
I really have nothing else to say.

137
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:21,170
Whether to believe it or not is your problem.

138
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,480
It's $10.

139
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,050
Thank you.

140
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,820
Goodbye.

141
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,700
Table 5, one espresso, one Americano,
one iced mocha, and one latte.

142
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,400
Welcome.

143
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,150
Welcome.

144
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,550
Table 6, two iced mochas, three
Americanos, and five waffles.

145
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,440
What? Repeat it.

146
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:51,680
Table 5, one espresso, one Americano,
one iced mocha, and one latte.

147
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,200
And Table 6, two iced mochas,
three Americanos, and five waffles.

148
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,800
Table 5, one espresso, one iced
mocha, one Americano, one latte?

149
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,640
How many times do I have to tell you?
Are you stupid? I told you twice already.

150
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,200
Don't get mad.

151
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,840
It's because of you, we're this busy.

152
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:05,470
What?

153
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,480
Lazy Manager Hong left, like you wanted,
and the liar Go Eun Chan left, too.

154
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,400
It's your wish, granted.

155
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,740
What? What are you talking about?

156
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,770
We don't have time to fight
like this. The customers are waiting.

157
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:20,540
If you had given Eun Chan the chance to tell
it herself, it wouldn't have become this big.

158
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:20,960
You know?

159
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,090
Who knew? I thought Go Eun
Chan had already told, so...

160
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,470
How could you be useful
with such a big mouth?

161
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,250
I told you plenty of times not to
interfere with other people's relationships.

162
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,450
- Now I know why you can't date.
- Are you done?

163
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,780
I'm done. I don't want
to talk with you anymore.

164
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,040
You and the Manager only care
about yourselves getting hurt...

165
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,740
How about you?
You don't care about others.

166
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,900
Isn't my not caring better than
your interfering and ruining everything?

167
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,990
You, seriously...

168
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,740
Take this, it's for Table 10.

169
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,430
Everyone's being too much, too much.

170
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,380
Manager.

171
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,720
Manager!
Can you make us an espresso?

172
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,420
Okay.

173
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,580
Hello?

174
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,580
What's with your house?

175
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,190
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about Eun Chan.

176
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,200
Tell me about you going overseas.

177
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,970
Why so suddenly?

178
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,050
When are you coming back if you go?

179
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,380
It'll be hard to come soon.

180
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,150
Is it because of Go Eun Chan?

181
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,220
Was the relationship between
Go Eun Chan and Choi Han Sung,

182
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,250
serious enough for you to go overseas?

183
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:46,780
What are you so curious about?
Are you wondering how far those two got?

184
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,070
It would have been nice if
you had told me sooner.

185
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:57,580
There's nothing to know about
how far Han Sung and Eun Chan went.

186
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:03,580
Han Sung was shaken up by himself,
and it was only for a short time, anyway.

187
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:08,020
So, forgive Eun Chan.

188
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,110
Then why are you packing up?

189
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,720
It's a problem between Hang Sung and me.

190
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,680
You know our relationship.

191
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:19,700
It's always me who leans,
hopes, and does whatever I want.

192
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:26,320
Han Sung just receives it, takes it in,
and takes care of things.

193
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:32,920
I thought Choi Han Sung's happy
face was because of Han Yoo Ju...

194
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,030
But I found out it's not because of me.

195
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,850
I know it's not mature of me.

196
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,170
And I'm not cool, either.

197
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:47,140
Han Yoo Ju is really stupid.
I know all that.

198
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,880
But my heart... my heart won't listen.

199
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:58,030
I wonder why Choi Han Sung
never saw me as competition.

200
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:03,580
Because I didn't stand a chance against him?

201
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:08,650
Or because he believed that
you wouldn't dump him for me?

202
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,650
I asked him once about you,
if he wasn't worried.

203
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,940
He said he wasn't.

204
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,510
He said you were his little brother.

205
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,300
That's not all.

206
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,760
He trusted you.

207
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,750
Even though there was a little
crack in your relationship,

208
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,850
he believed that you would return back to him.

209
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,740
That's why he was stupidly waiting for
a girl who left him for someone else.

210
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:36,410
If that's true,
then you don't trust Eun Chan?

211
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,990
Choi Han Sung seems strong.

212
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,950
Having someone else next to your
loved one, it feels really dirty.

213
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,400
I wonder how he was so
patient with that, all this time.

214
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,250
I can't do it.

215
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,910
Your relationship with him was really
solid, no space for me to even squeeze into.

216
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:07,290
I think that made me want to come between
you and him even more, like a little kid.

217
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:16,090
But if Han Yoo Ju hurts Han Sung hyung
again, I think I'll hate you.

218
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,430
Is the bathroom your bedroom?

219
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,590
Why are you crying in there again?

220
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,710
You're crying again, aren't you?

221
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,910
No.

222
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,260
What do you mean, "no"?

223
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,130
Mom, Go Eun Chan keeps crying.

224
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,780
Tell her to stop crying and to come out.

225
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,960
I need to wash up...

226
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,110
Stop it!

227
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,070
You only hate me.

228
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,330
Go to the store and buy
facial wash and toothpaste.

229
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,160
No.

230
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,250
Is "no" your dog's name?

231
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,930
Since you're on break, you haven't read a
single book, only watching TV all the time.

232
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,700
I don't know what you're up to...

233
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,870
Give it here.

234
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,360
Can I buy ice cream?

235
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,600
How can you look at your
child like that? It's scary.

236
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:54,250
I wanted to tell you, but if I told you, I was
afraid you'd say you wouldn't see me again.

237
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,260
The reason why I'm telling you now
is that I want you to see me as a woman.

238
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,000
If you tell me to quit, I'll quit.

239
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,500
If you don't want to see me...
can't we just see each other?

240
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:35,420
Ask yourself this: if you
can live without Go Eun Chan.

241
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,010
I could have just taken a taxi.

242
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,230
Be healthy.

243
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,250
Don't go.

244
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,080
No matter how much I think about it,

245
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:53,690
I can't live like a crazy man like
I did two years ago when you left.

246
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,910
So you should quit, I can't allow it twice.

247
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,550
DK is waiting.

248
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,060
Call him and tell him you can't come.

249
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,580
If you're going to do this,
just stop the car.

250
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,530
I'll go in a different car.

251
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,680
You were shaken, too.

252
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,940
How come you can, and I can't?

253
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:39,000
While you were with me,
you dated DK for over a year.

254
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,280
Even the day before we broke up, you were
with DK, but you said you were at work.

255
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,680
I didn't believe it, but you did.

256
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:52,960
When I didn't believe you,
you said, "You idiot..."

257
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,560
"If you don't believe it,
what are you going to do?"

258
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,100
You said that, and I let it go!

259
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:04,300
If you can let go of things like that,
why are you getting so shaken up now?

260
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,380
What was so good about her?

261
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,050
Because she was innocent?

262
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,640
She's just a cute, little kid?

263
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,350
Seeing you lying like that to me...

264
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,780
watching you check for her text
messages after sleeping with me,

265
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,720
do you know how shameful I felt?

266
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,580
I'm sorry, I did a horrible thing.

267
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,010
But that's not love,
I was just shaken up.

268
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,700
I was just shaken up!

269
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,000
How is shaken up and love different?

270
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:40,980
I don't know how that's different.

271
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,700
I love you, don't go.

272
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,810
Don't go.

273
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,030
Don't go!

274
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,640
Hey, Han Yoo Ju, don't go!

275
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,550
Want it?

276
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,550
You coming?

277
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,900
You're not going?

278
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,510
I'm going.

279
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:25,680
New York: Final Call

280
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,000
Go Eun Chan. I bought pig intestines filled with rice.

281
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:00,300
With extra salt and pepper!

282
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,020
Sounds delicious.

283
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,870
Is that a face that says delicious?

284
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,380
It's because I'm full.

285
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,500
- Try it.
- No...

286
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:16,780
You peeled all this?
This is more than one order.

287
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,470
We'll become very rich.

288
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:23,610
If you peel and sew eyes without sleeping
every day, we'll have bunch of money, a bunch.

289
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,160
It'll be good if we get rich.

290
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:28,450
Following everything that girls do when
they get dumped, you're doing all of it,

291
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,280
not sleeping, ignoring your health,
pretending like you're not sad when you are.

292
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,760
I don't want it, I don't want it.

293
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,120
Go get some sleep.

294
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,160
You look stupid when you're this tired.

295
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,830
I'm going to get some fresh air.

296
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,620
Where?

297
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,480
I'll buy some chips.

298
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,690
I bought Sun Dae, what chips?

299
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,360
I'll buy some ramen, too.

300
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,920
I can't ask how you are.

301
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,630
Your face doesn't look good.

302
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,830
Really? I'm okay.

303
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:28,050
Han Kyul is still mad?

304
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,810
I got fired from work.

305
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:37,330
I'm sorry, I think I caused
you all this hurt, I'm sorry.

306
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,620
Why are you sorry?

307
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,250
It's my fault.

308
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,880
It's because he likes you very much.

309
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,140
That's why he's mad and
pretends he doesn't care anymore.

310
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:53,480
Even though he doesn't look like it,
he gets attached very deeply.

311
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:58,130
Once he gives you his heart,
he gives it all.

312
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:01,270
That's why he's sad and hurt,
so just wait a little.

313
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,000
You know how he feels, right?

314
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:09,120
I don't think I knew, then... although
I don't know it all now, either.

315
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:15,300
Telling him that I liked him...
I feel sorry,

316
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,400
and it only hurts, so I feel tired.

317
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,960
If I'd known this would happen,
I would have told him from the start.

318
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:31,650
Another side of me thinks I should never
have said anything, through the end.

319
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:34,620
It would have been better
not to have liked him at all.

320
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:45,970
If I think about the times I liked him...
I was so happy, and I miss it...

321
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:55,650
So just wait a bit longer.

322
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:59,410
When Han Kyul finds out your feelings,
he'll understand.

323
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,660
Really?

324
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,950
Of course. You're really pretty.

325
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,530
Oh yeah.

326
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:14,650
Don't tell Han Kyul
what happened between us.

327
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:17,070
About what?

328
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,750
Oh, that...

329
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,790
Even if Han Kyul says it's
okay, that he'll understand,

330
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:31,790
and that you should tell him
everything, don't tell him.

331
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:37,760
If you tell him because you
want to feel better about it,

332
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,860
it'll only hurt him.

333
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,360
So don't feel so down, and cheer up.

334
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:53,650
Mister, thank you.

335
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:57,100
You're like Santa to me.

336
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:04,120
I'm the one who should be thankful,
for being able to be Santa to you.

337
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,320
So even if it's difficult,
be strong.

338
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,490
Han Gyul has really fallen for you.

339
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,370
I can assure that.

340
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,180
You seem really tired.

341
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:26,270
I have a lot of things going on.

342
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,220
Can you take it all?

343
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,040
Should I go with you?

344
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,640
Manager Hong isn't here,
who's going to make the coffee?

345
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,680
Why is Manager Hong acting
like this? He's not a kid.

346
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:50,070
With Eun Chan, you're really...

347
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:58,150
Either hire a barista or a worker,
it's not like it's only one or two days.

348
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,120
There are two people missing.
It's impossible with just us.

349
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,370
Um, sir.

350
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,510
Can't you just let it go?

351
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:10,630
It's wrong that she did that,
but she has nowhere else to go.

352
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,560
Eun Sae said she's been taking pills for
indigestion, and she has to take pills to sleep.

353
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:17,360
This is the worst things have ever been.

354
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,330
I'm going to go crazy.

355
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,300
I'm leaving.

356
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,280
Manager.

357
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:26,780
They say that you should hate the crime,
not the person. Just forgive Eun Chan, okay?

358
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,830
Why is he talking smart today?
Get back to work.

359
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,900
Just let it go, okay?

360
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:37,450
Don't just talk, get to work.

361
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:40,630
The way I see it,
Eun Chan had a harder time.

362
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,380
She's young too, she was scared
that it would turn out like this.

363
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,400
Are you home?

364
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:15,900
Can I come in?

365
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,130
I met Eun Chan.

366
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:28,250
I was at the store and
I just ran into her.

367
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,710
Just ran into her?

368
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:34,770
You just run into her through milk delivery,
just run into her at the store.

369
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:37,740
You guys must be meant to be,
you just run into each other.

370
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:41,520
If we did have something,
do you think I'd tell you?

371
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,370
How is she?

372
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:48,300
What?

373
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,650
Eun Chan?

374
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:53,000
How do you think she is?

375
00:31:55,470 --> 00:32:00,510
When I first found out that you liked Yoo Ju,

376
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:03,660
I thought that you'd wrap up your feelings fast.

377
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:08,510
It might be a little prideful of me,
but I felt bad for you, too.

378
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:16,160
My being shaken up by Eun Chan, just
understand it like I did when you liked Yoo Ju.

379
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:19,680
If you don't like me meeting
Eun Chan, I won't see her.

380
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,860
I'll try not to just run
into her, either. Okay?

381
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:28,420
If you have nothing to
say, go home. I'm tired.

382
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,550
I'm sorry.

383
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,850
I came here to apologize.

384
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,200
I'm sorry I hit you last time.

385
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:41,210
I did wrong, I'm sorry.

386
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:45,200
Hit me back and let it go.

387
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:52,510
I didn't help things between
you and Han Yoo Ju, either.

388
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,830
I'm sorry.

389
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,800
I'm sorry for the past 9 years,

390
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:04,500
and I was too harsh for just jumping
at you like that about Eun Chan.

391
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,870
I'm really sorry.

392
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,440
You can hit me if you want.

393
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,780
You can hit me back with
interest if you want.

394
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:25,230
What's with your face?

395
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,110
Did Han Yoo Ju...

396
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,350
She left.

397
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:42,270
I clung on to her and cried
not to go, but she left.

398
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,360
She's really tiring, Han Yoo Ju.

399
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,720
I did wrong.

400
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:54,080
When Yoo Ju said she'd leave,
that's when I woke up.

401
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,700
This wasn't what was
supposed to happen.

402
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,200
Don't worry too much.

403
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:04,000
It's 10 years between me and her.

404
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:09,750
There's something between us
that you can't even imagine.

405
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,860
We'll finish it our way.

406
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:17,540
Han Yoo Ju really loves you.
She'll come back.

407
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,750
You take care of your problem.

408
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:26,580
It's good that it was you
that Han Yoo Ju liked.

409
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:30,850
If it was someone else, I would
have taken her away a long time ago.

410
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,330
I think it was for the best.

411
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:35,570
I like you more than you realize.

412
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:41,360
I'm just saying, just know it.

413
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:45,440
You're going to make up
with Go Eun Chan, right?

414
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,160
I don't know...

415
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:52,200
What?
What do you mean you don't know?

416
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,510
Hello?

417
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,170
I'm Choi Han Sung.

418
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,200
Yeah.

419
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:15,050
I can't reach Yoo Ju through
her New York contact number.

420
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,120
I don't want to tell you.

421
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:31,790
I thought she thought
work was most important,

422
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:34,450
but there must be something
more important there.

423
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:38,140
I didn't want to tell you,
but Yoo Ju didn't come with me.

424
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,450
Manager Hong.

425
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:49,560
What did you do at home all day?

426
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,270
If you stayed home,
you should have cleaned up.

427
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,470
You only clean your room, too.

428
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:58,340
There were a bunch of customers
asking for your coffee today.

429
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:02,820
No matter how much I think about it, your
coffee is the town's best... the world's best.

430
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:11,500
Mister, starting tomorrow can you...?
You've rested enough.

431
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:14,570
You had enough to drink, too,
for the past four days.

432
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:21,270
And Han Kyul hyung is feeling sorry, too...

433
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,930
Hey, make some ramen. I'm hungry.

434
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,910
This is quite funny, now that I'm rereading it.

435
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:35,570
I thought you were angry...
You were reading a comic book?

436
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:40,540
Hey, reading comic books all day
while lying around is the best.

437
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,020
What else is rebellion? This is it.

438
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:45,540
Hey, put in two eggs, and
a lot of green onions.

439
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,700
Come out, Go Eun Chan!

440
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,720
He still hasn't come home yet.

441
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:28,250
What the...

442
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,640
Oh, no.

443
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,970
You need to wake up.

444
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,850
How long are you going to cry, Go Eun Chan?

445
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:38,480
Go Eun Chan should live Go Eun Chan's life.

446
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:43,800
And Choi Han Kyul needs to
live Choi Han Kyul's life.

447
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,540
That's how it should be.

448
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:53,850
Go Eun Chan, so clumsy...

449
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,880
How far did it spill...

450
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,050
How many are there?

451
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,390
Is this all yours?

452
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:46,750
You spilled all of it
all over the neighborhood.

453
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:50,150
How are you going to make money
like this? Everything's unfit for you.

454
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,990
What are you doing?

455
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,330
Aren't you going to bring it over?

456
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,410
Yeah...

457
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,280
Oh, you spilled it all,
what are we going to do...

458
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,300
Did it hurt?

459
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,250
No.

460
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:34,200
Aren't you worried about the café?

461
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,000
Is something up?

462
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:42,470
We're busy, you're not there, and
Manager Hong isn't there either.

463
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:50,510
Come back, starting tomorrow.

464
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,470
I'm still mad, but...

465
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:02,130
I hate you, and I can't really
understand you, but...

466
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:08,660
I asked myself,
"Could I live not seeing Go Eun Chan?"

467
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,260
"Am I just going to break up with her like this?"

468
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:20,310
And I realized that's not right.

469
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:29,410
You're going to cry again.

470
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,220
Why do you cry so much?

471
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:39,120
And, you... from now on,
you should only cry in front of me.

472
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:43,550
If you cry like this in front
of other guys, you're in trouble.

473
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:56,230
I'm sorry.

474
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,730
I did wrong.

475
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,130
I get it, so stop crying.

476
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:09,360
I was just having fun
playing around with you,

477
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:12,780
without thinking how much
it must be hurting you.

478
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:16,480
I was only worried
about me not getting hurt...

479
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:22,040
I was running away looking
for a place to escape...

480
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:28,000
Without realizing your feelings when
you were making me those toys,

481
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,580
how much you were hurt,

482
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,980
without realizing any of that,

483
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:37,380
pretending to know it all.

484
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,780
I was just happy when
you said let's go with it.

485
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,570
I didn't think about how you felt.

486
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:45,760
I'm sorry.

487
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,960
Are you reciting an apologetic letter?

488
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:52,800
I'm sorry I caused you to
go through such a hard time.

489
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:57,140
I was bad, I'm really sorry.

490
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,990
I'm sorry, too.

491
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:13,620
Kissing you at the café last time, and
pretending that I didn't feel anything.

492
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:17,320
I did it to hurt you.

493
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:25,450
I was just so angry...

494
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:28,150
those weren't my true feelings.

495
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,790
I was immature,

496
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,410
not thinking about how hurt you would be...

497
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:43,180
I'm sorry. I apologize, forgive me.

498
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:51,800
It was my mistake from the start,

499
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:55,090
so that's all okay.

500
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,900
Go Eun Chan...

501
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:13,780
I'm glad you're a girl.

502
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:56,250
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, DING!

503
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:58,280
It's 12.

504
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,530
What are you doing?

505
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:03,920
They're meeting each other,
crying in each other's arms. Great.

506
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,030
Be more late, more late.

507
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,800
Mom, if Go Eun Chan and the Manager marry,

508
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:13,960
he'll buy us a house, right?

509
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:15,180
What?

510
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:18,830
My friend's older sister got
married to a small business owner,

511
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,830
and he bought a house, a car, a
designer bag and shoes for his in-laws.

512
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:28,330
Since the manager's company is a larger-scale
business, the Manager will do more for us.

513
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:30,020
Right, mom?

514
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,920
Why am I a Begger's Mom?

515
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,150
I'm your mom.

516
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,440
I know you like it, too.

517
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:40,130
What's to like?
Do you just marry without anything?

518
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:45,140
Your sister is only 24, what marriage?

519
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,930
24 is old enough.

520
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,580
Hey, you...

521
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:03,780
Brother, how are you?

522
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,020
What are you doing here?

523
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:07,470
Can't you see? She's cleaning.

524
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:11,330
You're here too? I thought
you were home sleeping.

525
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,840
Go get another tag.

526
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:17,870
What the heck?
It's like nothing happened.

527
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:20,070
Is this a dream?

528
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,780
Oh, you're here, Manager.

529
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:34,460
Sister, Manager's here.

530
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,480
Sister!

531
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,980
Manager's here, Manager's here.

532
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,040
Sister, Manager's here.

533
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:55,290
Why did you come to work?

534
00:48:56,450 --> 00:48:59,260
It was hot at home,
so I came for some air conditioner. Satisfied?

535
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:18,510
This manager stays angry too long.
Since you're young, try to understand.

536
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:20,500
You should just let it go.

537
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,920
She must have put a lot of
courage into coming back here.

538
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:25,270
Jin Ha Rim, did you change sides?

539
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,090
I think it's a little odd.

540
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:30,580
How come he's not saying
anything to Eun Chan?

541
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:33,110
Maybe he told her to come back.

542
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:38,090
Can't you see the cold
mood the café is in?

543
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,550
- Get ready to go make a delivery.
- Me?

544
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,510
Go Eun Chan, aren't you going to answer?

545
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:48,050
Yes, Manager.

546
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,800
Hey, you didn't just come out.

547
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,310
Something happened yesterday, didn't it?

548
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:03,620
Oh, really?

549
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:06,050
What'd you say? What'd you say?

550
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,950
"I made a mistake, I'm sorry."
Something like that?

551
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:11,190
What mistake? They love each other.

552
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:12,180
Did you?

553
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:13,260
Stop it.

554
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,540
You're coy, you're coy.

555
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,660
You're doing everything but acting
all innocent. Give me your cellphone.

556
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:19,890
Why?

557
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:22,300
I want to check it with my own two eyes.

558
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:28,550
I want to send a text message
saying, "I love you oppa, your Chan".

559
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,690
"I love you" is too much.

560
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:31,880
No, let's send a message saying,

561
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,000
"Oppa, let's have
sweet and sour chicken together."

562
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:35,170
Stop it, stop it.

563
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,710
Wait a minute, I can send it with mine.

564
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:38,790
Hold on.

565
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:40,370
Don't.

566
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:42,230
Send a heart too, a red one.

567
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,070
Send two hearts.

568
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:46,840
It's going to cost more, just send one.

569
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,430
Hold on.

570
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,630
Send it with mine.

571
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:57,100
Seriously.

572
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,720
She's running away.

573
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,900
Why isn't he reacting to it?

574
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:31,560
He's too serious.

575
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:33,200
Maybe I sent it in my name...

576
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:34,970
Did you send two hearts?
You should send one...

577
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:36,860
Hold on.

578
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:39,790
Thank you

579
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:49,260
He's smiling, he's smiling.

580
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,700
He's smiling.

581
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:03,880
The Manager smiled!

582
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:05,320
He must like you.

583
00:52:06,810 --> 00:52:10,330
Congratulations on making
it back to Coffee Prince.

584
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:14,020
Then is it Princess, now?

585
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:16,470
Should we hire another pretty girl?

586
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,110
I'll pick, I'll pick.

587
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:21,290
Go Eun Chan! Hey Eun Chan!

588
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,260
If I knew My Chan was a girl,
I would have gone for her.

589
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:37,710
From the beginning,
this started out weird.

590
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:41,280
Can I loosen up now?

591
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,300
I thought the mood
in the café was stuffy lately.

592
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:45,800
You got tense?

593
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:48,570
Look how they left together awkwardly.

594
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:50,910
In a love fight, you need
to finish it up quickly.

595
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:52,390
I saw the Manager in a new light.

596
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:54,490
He's quite soft, despite how he looks.

597
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:57,080
Liking her even though
he thought she was a guy.

598
00:52:57,290 --> 00:53:00,590
He's the type where, once you get attached
to something, you can't get out of there.

599
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:02,270
But I'm still a little dumbfounded.

600
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:06,630
A girl acting as a guy.
She acted so well.

601
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:11,490
Look how my urine is thick.
It's coming out very nicely, very nicely.

602
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,330
I was stressed from their love fight.

603
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,860
She saw mine too!

604
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:20,870
Hey, whose do you think she
liked the best of ours?

605
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,910
What do you mean "liked the best?"

606
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:40,850
Because of Coffee Prince,
we're not making much at our store.

607
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:43,230
Send us some customers.

608
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,490
We're not doing that well, either.

609
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:47,090
I'm sorry.

610
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:49,010
- I'll see you next week.
- Yeah.

611
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:02,900
You already finished?

612
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:03,740
Yeah.

613
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:06,440
Great job.

614
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:08,310
But how come there's only one?

615
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:09,850
You drink it first, then give it.

616
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:11,720
It's okay, I had a fruit drink.

617
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:14,770
Drink it when I say to drink it.

618
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,380
Don't make me repeat things.

619
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,440
Okay.

620
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:24,090
What's wrong with you?

621
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:25,860
It went into my nose.

622
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:27,730
That's right, this is
the image of Go Eun Chan.

623
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:37,550
What are you looking so fondly at?

624
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:39,110
Do you like me that much?

625
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:40,810
It feels like a dream.

626
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:44,160
Talking to you and smiling.

627
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,980
I'm so happy.

628
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,150
It's sticky.

629
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:00,530
Let's see... there's a washroom over there.

630
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:07,770
She's a girl, a girl.

631
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:11,820
She's a girl, a girl.

632
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,800
Girl, girl.

633
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:16,240
You embarrassed?

634
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,850
It would have been nice to tell me
sooner, we can hold hands like this.

635
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:30,940
I didn't know that you liked me.

636
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,080
Does it make sense that you didn't know?

637
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:37,150
I went to the hospital
because of you, seriously.

638
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,360
Hospital?

639
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:40,300
I was just confused.

640
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:43,550
I thought you only thought of
me as a cute younger brother.

641
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:48,250
I wasn't sure how you
could like a girl like me.

642
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:50,650
What's wrong with you?

643
00:55:54,980 --> 00:56:00,710
When I first saw you, I was really taken aback,
but I thought you were really handsome.

644
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,180
When you first saw me?

645
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:04,170
Oh, being a robber.

646
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,710
No, I delivered to your house.

647
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:10,790
You were towel-drying your legs, remember?

648
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:13,150
I think it was 2-3 months ago.

649
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:14,370
Delivery is here.

650
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:26,590
Helmet?

651
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,960
It was really impressive.

652
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:30,800
What was?

653
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:36,430
Hey! You're funny... what are
you saying was impressive?

654
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,390
Your wet hair.

655
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:45,560
Why didn't you tell me before?

656
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,350
Are you still mad?

657
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:49,600
Hold on...

658
00:56:56,490 --> 00:56:58,070
Girl...

659
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:03,000
I can't get used to it,
can't get used to it.

660
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:06,590
Yeah, hyung.

661
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:15,920
Drink this.

662
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:17,880
Yeah.

663
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,430
She's a monster, Han Yoo Ju.

664
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:27,490
I'm hating her.

665
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,820
If she's not in New York, where is she?

666
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:32,060
I think I was too harsh to Han Yoo Ju.

667
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:35,150
I thought I knew everything about her.

668
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:38,800
I don't know where her mom's house is,

669
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:41,250
or any contact numbers of her close friends.

670
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,780
Did you go to the lake house?

671
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:44,360
I went, but...

672
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:49,260
Nothing could be wrong, could it?

673
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:51,900
I'm really getting punished this time.

674
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:53,800
I'm sure nothing's wrong.

675
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:57,800
She takes good care of herself,
so she'll be fine.

676
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,540
If she was hurt, we would
have gotten a call already.

677
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:02,480
Let's wait, hyung.

678
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,830
Lie down.

679
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,230
Your face looks really bad.

680
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:12,960
Go.

681
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:14,870
Okay.

682
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,160
Should I turn off the lights?

683
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,860
Yeah, thanks.

684
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:28,080
What about that? I even kissed her.

685
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:30,440
Speak softly, you jerk.

686
00:58:31,070 --> 00:58:34,240
Is that something to show off
about to a possible sister-in-law?

687
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:36,790
It's been a while, so Eun Chan won't remember.

688
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:43,580
I showed my tattoo on my butt to Eun Chan.

689
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:45,640
You idiot...

690
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:50,080
She didn't even ask to see it,
and you got all hyped up yourself,

691
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:53,770
and pulled down your underwear
showing your butt, telling her to look.

692
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,600
"See how pretty this is,
look, look at this... "

693
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:59,080
What are you saying to yourself?

694
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,590
You're too interested in him.

695
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,050
It's not that.
You left in a hurry to his house.

696
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:09,070
So I was worried about what happened.

697
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:10,970
Is something up?

698
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,900
Han Yoo Ju left for New York, but...

699
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,520
Really? When?

700
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,380
Why are you so interested?

701
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:19,580
Is something bothering you?

702
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,320
She said she was going, but didn't.

703
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:24,650
It's a love fight between them.

704
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:29,250
They've been a couple for 10 years, there
can be little dents here and there.

705
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:31,570
If there aren't, that's more weird.

706
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,340
But Han Sung hyung liked you.

707
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:39,250
I don't think so.

708
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,790
No way.

709
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:45,260
I was just like a younger sister to him.

710
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:46,500
How about you?

711
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:50,510
Are you cheating with
me and Han Sung hyung?

712
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:52,700
No, it's not that.

713
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:56,180
At first, I did like mister.

714
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:58,240
Mister? What mister?

715
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:02,640
Mister Han Sung.

716
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:04,900
Look at you...

717
01:00:05,350 --> 01:00:08,800
No, when I was starting
to like Hang Sung hyung,

718
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:12,240
I ended up liking you much more.

719
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:15,110
I don't know if that's cheating, but...

720
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:15,700
What?

721
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:16,970
But now, it's not like that.

722
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:17,920
Really.

723
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:22,990
But why is it me over Han Sung hyung?

724
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:27,000
People usually choose
Han Sung hyung over me.

725
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:30,710
He's nice, friendly,
comforting, and warm. Huh?

726
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,910
But why is it me for you?

727
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,310
I wonder... I don't really know.

728
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,990
Tell the truth, you like me
and Han Sung hyung both, right?

729
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:45,610
No, really. It's not like I can take
out my heart and show it to you.

730
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:51,740
Han Sung is just
a nice mister, and you...

731
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:54,340
I don't know why, but...

732
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,440
I like you.

733
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:04,860
I still can't get over it.

734
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:09,930
I did wrong.
I'm sorry, but...

735
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:13,640
After falling asleep, I just get
up and get angry all of a sudden.

736
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:17,560
I love you.

737
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:21,580
I love you.

738
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,430
I love you.

739
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,220
I really love you.

740
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,680
I love you.

741
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:36,150
Hey. Tell the truth.
You're a player, right?

742
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:40,920
I say I'm still mad, and you say you love me.
Where did you learn to change the subject?

743
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:44,890
I didn't know you were like that...

744
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:49,490
You jerk, why did you give
me such a hard time, huh?

745
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:53,550
When we could have said "I love you" to each
other and dated as much as we wanted?

746
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:54,680
Bad Go Eun Chan.

747
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:56,550
You jerk.

748
01:01:57,230 --> 01:01:59,240
And take note of this.

749
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:03,560
I love you more.

750
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:08,220
How dare you.

751
01:02:08,430 --> 01:02:10,160
Bye.

752
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:39,250
Wow! He loves me.

753
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:40,370
He loves me.

754
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:41,620
He loves me!

755
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:47,660
He loves me!

756
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:02,900
I feel good.

757
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,670
I feel so good.
