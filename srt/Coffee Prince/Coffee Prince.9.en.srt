1
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,670
You may be suffocated.

2
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,480
Who are you?

3
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:11,880
Coffee Prince

4
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,460
Isn't it heavy?

5
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,030
Your hair is as big as a big bird nest.

6
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,460
Are we brothers now?

7
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,280
Why? You don't want to?

8
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,590
No, I was just wondering
what'll be different from now.

9
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,620
Will you love me more?

10
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,160
What do you mean love.

11
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,220
Then, you're going to adore me more?

12
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:40,910
Well, I can adore you.
That's not too hard.

13
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,410
How are you going to do that?

14
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,810
Like this?

15
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,080
Ham.

16
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,290
Sprouts.

17
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,260
Here.

18
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,950
Kimchi.

19
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,130
Are you going to give me everything I ask for?
Then...

20
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,340
Scooter, house, car.

21
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,470
Two scooters.

22
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,320
One car.

23
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,320
One house.

24
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,090
Also, airship?

25
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,060
Here, airship.

26
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,060
Train.

27
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,730
The operation went well,
considering that we were drunk.

28
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,210
It hurts!

29
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,790
Let me see if the hole got pierced well.

30
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,660
It hurts.

31
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:36,680
It hurts!

32
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:40,150
You're exaggerating, you boy.

33
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,530
Brother.

34
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,880
Brother.

35
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,300
What?

36
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,100
Brother.

37
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:01,700
Brother.

38
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,850
Seriously.

39
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,470
You're laughing?

40
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,840
Brother, Brother, Brother.

41
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,420
Brother.

42
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,010
Hello.

43
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,390
It's me.

44
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,400
What are you doing right now?

45
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,760
Do you want to eat lunch together?

46
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,200
I'll go there.

47
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,200
I have an appointment.

48
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,830
Are you avoiding me?

49
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,460
I can't say that I'm not.

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,660
When are you going to do this until?

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,410
Okay.

52
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,900
Then I'll wait for you.

53
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,750
Call me.

54
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,500
The bill for the table, brother!

55
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,290
Okay!

56
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,730
- Do you have anything else you need?
- Younger brother!

57
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,850
Yes, brother?

58
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,330
Thank you, good bye.

59
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,710
Just because. Go now.

60
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,270
I'm really busy.

61
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,030
Oh, younger brother!

62
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,790
What?

63
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,040
What do you mean what?
I just called you.

64
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:05,150
You're playing with me just because
I played with you this morning.

65
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,880
You're childish.

66
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,880
Go Eun Chan!

67
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,460
Were you two together this morning?

68
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,550
You guys like each other, huh?

69
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,760
You're talking about nonsense.

70
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,570
The manager is too good for me.

71
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,300
Why would he like a guy like me?

72
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,670
You're a girl.

73
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,620
Well, whether you're a girl or a boy,
you need something to attract people.

74
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,360
You're threatening me, aren't you?
You're so immature.

75
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,820
I told you that I'm going to clean for you.

76
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,710
When? Today?

77
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,890
Tomorrow?

78
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,890
I'll do it this week.

79
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,550
Why do you keep laughing?

80
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,640
Is it fun?

81
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,360
Of course it's fun, would it be sad?

82
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,760
Ouch!

83
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:51,190
Watch where you're going!

84
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,640
Huh? This is the manager's earring!

85
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,060
It's mine, it's mine.

86
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,660
If it's not, it's not.
Why are you yelling at me?

87
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,340
Manager, cafe la...cafe moc...

88
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,340
Say something.

89
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,900
What?

90
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,050
So tell me!

91
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,840
Since when were you guys brothers?

92
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,490
Since yesterday.

93
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,410
My grandma said that he's cute.
She told us to be sworn brothers.

94
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,150
Sworn brothers?

95
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,900
Oh, then you two are going to
share inheritance too!

96
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,860
Wow, your grandma shouldn't do this to me.

97
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,050
I knew you before and am closer to you.

98
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,140
Then what if by the law...

99
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,840
Go work.

100
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:45,040
Jin Ha Rim, go get the waffle from here.

101
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,130
Han Gyul hyung shouldn't be doing this to me.

102
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,720
I'm closer to him. If he was going to become
sworn brothers with someone, it should be me.

103
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,820
He didn't know Eun Chan for a long time
and they're like "older brother!" "younger brother!".

104
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,580
You're so tactless.

105
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,510
What?

106
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,100
The manager likes Eun Chan, don't you know?

107
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,240
What are you talking about?

108
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,670
The two like each other.
Is that something weird?

109
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,460
It's not considered weird in Japan.

110
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,540
Mister, you know everything too.

111
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,830
The manager and Eun Chan are going out.

112
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,540
Why would guys like each other?

113
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,140
You're making stuff up because
you have nothing else to do.

114
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,850
Go work!

115
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,030
I think you know what I'm talking about.

116
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,190
Seriously, Min Yeop...

117
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,600
Hello?

118
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,940
Eun Chan, this is Han Yoo Ju.

119
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,500
Hello.

120
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,460
Eat slowly.

121
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,110
Okay.

122
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,230
I should say something, but I don't think
I can, after seeing your face.

123
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,270
I think I'm nervous.

124
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,800
I am too, a bit.

125
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,380
I was hesitant to see you, Eun Chan.

126
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,950
Honestly, I used to like Han Sung.

127
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,290
Before I knew that you were Person B.

128
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,020
How about now?

129
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,590
I still like him, but not in a guy girl way.

130
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,120
I have someone I like.

131
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,880
Han Gyul?

132
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,630
Stop joking around with me.

133
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,420
Yes.

134
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,040
Why aren't you telling Han Gyul
that you're a girl?

135
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:11,970
I thought about it a lot too,
but he told me to be his younger brother.

136
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:16,640
If he finds out I'm a girl, it feels like
he won't be by my side like now.

137
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,750
It's not bad right now either.

138
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:29,100
I don't know how you're going
to feel like hearing this,

139
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,250
but you don't have to mind me.

140
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,050
Okay, I won't.

141
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:41,800
What?

142
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,760
Tell me. Do you like Go Eun Chan?

143
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,910
Guys don't hate or like either other.

144
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,180
Then don't stick with him too much.

145
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,630
Why are you being like this?

146
00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:03,470
It feels weird saying this, but Sun Ki keeps
saying that you two like each other.

147
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,720
And it's not just Sun Ki.

148
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,980
When manager Hong sees you two,
he frowns and clicks his tongue.

149
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,630
Min Yeop always giggles as though
something exciting is going on.

150
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,030
The cafe's atmosphere is weird
these days with you two.

151
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,460
Everyone must be bored.

152
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,110
Is your dad the same?

153
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,310
He said that he doesn't need
a son who doesn't follow his will.

154
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:32,130
And that he spent so much money sending me
to a med school but that I'm living not worth it.

155
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,480
He spits everything out and yells,
money, money, money!

156
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,800
It's like he goes crazy about money.

157
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,510
It would be difficult for you too.

158
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:03,350
Did you waver because I made
you have such a difficult time?

159
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,370
No, it's not like that.

160
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,040
If it was because of me, it's easy.

161
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,830
I just have to fix myself.

162
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:19,460
I'm thinking about what's happening
to me right now.

163
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:33,510
The only thing I know is that
this had happened to you before.

164
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:41,100
I wasted so much time trying to understand you
during the two years we weren't together.

165
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,000
Now that it's happening to me...

166
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:52,450
Are you telling me that it wasn't
an accident and that you love her?

167
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,190
At that time, I loved that person.

168
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:06,120
What should I do?

169
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,990
I'll take care of it.

170
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:15,360
I was worried that you would become
hurt because of the little kid.

171
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,410
But I think I'm more hurt.

172
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,940
Let's go on a vacation.

173
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,410
Let's do that.

174
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,020
Stop, stop.

175
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,020
Wow, you're fast.

176
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,680
You could've told me you were going grocery
shopping because you ran out of eggs.

177
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,350
You're always telling me to just follow you.

178
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,040
Are you a mystic?

179
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,980
Are you an actor?

180
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:07,010
Should I tell you everything when coming to buy milk,
chocolate syrup, waffle, kiwi, and the plate you broke?

181
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,870
When was your first kiss?

182
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,280
You always change the topic
if you have nothing to say.

183
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,280
Yoo Ju noona?

184
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:19,850
Does kissing a cousin's girlfriend make...

185
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,620
I tried. But I got rejected.

186
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:28,700
Then was I your first kiss?

187
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,040
Idiot.

188
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,780
Yoo Ju is your first love.

189
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,000
If you didn't do it with Yoo Ju,
then I'm the only person.

190
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:42,400
I told you that I loved Han Yoo Ju
for nine years,

191
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,730
but I didn't say that I loved only
Han Yoo Ju for nine years.

192
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,140
Isn't that the same thing?

193
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,830
How is that the same thing?

194
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,350
Saying that I loved Han Yoo Ju
means I loved Han Yoo Ju.

195
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,970
But saying that I loved only Han Yoo Ju
means I loved only Han Yoo Ju.

196
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,520
Get it?

197
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:04,820
Then who was your first kiss?

198
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,340
Someone who studied abroad with me.

199
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,340
How many times did you meet her?

200
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,820
About three or four times.

201
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,820
A first kiss in three or four times?

202
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,770
How about sleeping?

203
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,660
We didn't sleep together.

204
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,590
That's unlike you.

205
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,470
I liked her friend.

206
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,230
What?!

207
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,230
You're so mean!

208
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,700
You jerk.

209
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,080
Why are you talking
to your older brother like that!

210
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,420
What? I'm so mean?!

211
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:31,140
It hurts.

212
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,940
Say that you're sorry.

213
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,970
You're being mean!

214
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,940
If you don't listen to me,
I'm going to pinch you.

215
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,800
I didn't do anything wrong!

216
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,090
I'm sorry, younger brother!

217
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,200
You're handsome, brother!

218
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,420
Handsome? You're not.

219
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,860
Ouch, you're handsome, brother!

220
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,300
Everyone else goes to mountains and seas.

221
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,460
What am I doing here?

222
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,130
It's cool here,
why would you go to a summer resort?

223
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,130
It only costs a little bit.

224
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:08,070
Anyways, what are we going to do about our concert?
Is it okay for us to do it this roughly?

225
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,740
I want to have a big one.

226
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,480
A drum this big.

227
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,110
Or a trumpet this big.

228
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,130
- Or a...
- Do you know how to play them?

229
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,750
No.

230
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,590
Just massage my shoulders.

231
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,110
How about a dance party instead of a concert?

232
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,630
I can shake my body a bit.

233
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,290
How about tackling, boxing, or wrestling?

234
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,450
- Wrestling! Wrestling!
- Tackling! Tackling!

235
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,130
Go clean, you boy.

236
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,130
Okay, brother!

237
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,560
Do you like calling manager "older brother"?

238
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,850
Shouldn't you be calling him "oppa"?

239
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,330
You punk!

240
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,210
Receive my sword!

241
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:50,040
They're doing this!

242
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,980
Hey, go clean.

243
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,970
This is fun!

244
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,270
- Everyone!
- This is fun!

245
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,140
It hurts.

246
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,340
It's not like you were trying to escape or anything.

247
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,370
Why did you jump down from the second floor?

248
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,580
Or else, I would have been trapped inside.

249
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,100
Your house is mysterious too.

250
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,820
They trapped a son who went to
their house for his mom's birthday.

251
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,820
Your mom must love you a lot.

252
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,100
If I was her, I would've kicked you out.

253
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,100
It was just two times.

254
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,510
Oh my, it's a cockroach!

255
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,000
How can you live in this place?

256
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,710
I don't think I can live here even for one day.

257
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,210
Then don't come here next time.

258
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,790
No, it's not like that.

259
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,210
Mister, what are you doing to my Sun Ki!

260
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,520
You vulgar boy.

261
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,520
You ordered Eun Chan to clean.

262
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:57,390
Would anything go wrong if
you just keep it as a secret?

263
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,500
Angel!

264
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,480
I bought what you told me to buy.

265
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,810
What do you mean angel?

266
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,830
Hey, your angel is next to Sun Ki like a gum.

267
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:12,970
Why are you doing this?

268
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,440
Just sit down and rest.

269
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,220
I'll do everything.

270
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,350
Then you...

271
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,450
Laundry this.

272
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,510
Okay.

273
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,560
Hey, the television!

274
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,220
Put it back.

275
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,410
Does it even work?

276
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,410
Trash this!

277
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,960
Trash these papers!

278
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,500
How do you read these kinds of things?

279
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,280
Read this once, please?

280
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,090
Read this.

281
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,410
Angel, angel.

282
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,630
Let's go out now.

283
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,920
I'll buy you chicken feet.

284
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,920
Hey, what do you mean chicken feet?

285
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:59,940
Did you wash the dishes?

286
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,270
No, you told me to laundry these.

287
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,890
Then wash the dishes.

288
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,290
Hey, and trash those stuff too.

289
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,240
I'll put out Sun Ki's clothes.

290
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,660
Aren't you going to do those?

291
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,750
Hwang Min Yeop, don't do them.

292
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,060
Is Min Yeop your servant?

293
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:24,830
He always does whatever I tell him to do.

294
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,220
Right, Hwang Min Yeop?

295
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,900
Hey, hey, hey.

296
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,280
Get out, I'll do it.

297
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:42,390
I'll do it. You're going to get sick
if you keep doing this, get out.

298
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,450
What else did you tell me to do?

299
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:52,260
Hwang Min Yeop, I want a glass of water.

300
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,580
You get it.

301
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,580
Hey!

302
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,580
Stop!

303
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,700
You follow me.

304
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,040
Hey!

305
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,110
I like that brother a lot.

306
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,250
How can you embarrass me in front of him?

307
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,740
Hwang Min Yeop, it seems like you'll hit me?

308
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,330
You shouldn't treat someone
who likes you like that!

309
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,320
Who told you to like me?!

310
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:35,050
Just give up! I don't like you
following me around, okay?

311
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,870
You're stupid and just strong.

312
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,070
It was embarrassing for me
to show you to my friends, okay?

313
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,800
Seriously!

314
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,850
I knew you were going to get busted.

315
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,310
Do you really not like Min Yeop?

316
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:40,430
Tell him that you're sorry tomorrow.

317
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,710
Brother, I'm so sorry.

318
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,850
You become closer as you fight.

319
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,320
Like you and the manager?

320
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,320
Why are you...

321
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,860
It's embarrassing.

322
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,930
I'm having a good time
with my brother these days.

323
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,270
Unni, why hyung?

324
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,170
Okay, make fun of me.

325
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:09,700
But still, I see his face everyday
and am by his side all the time.

326
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:13,680
And we joke around and talk a lot.
It's really good.

327
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,700
You would want to become more than that.

328
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:20,480
If you guys hold hands, you'd want to hug him.
If you guys hug, you'd want to kiss him.

329
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,710
Why do you like those things so much?

330
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,370
I like the way things are right now, okay?

331
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,900
That musician mister doesn't call anymore?

332
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,170
It seems as though he's busy.

333
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,180
Something happened, right?

334
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,930
We kissed.

335
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,930
I knew it.

336
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,110
You were being so out there these days.

337
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,620
You're going to be a player soon?

338
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,070
I'm over that mister already, okay?

339
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,940
He has a girlfriend.

340
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,940
But why did he do that to me?

341
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,340
Did I make him confused?

342
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,040
You have to draw the line.

343
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:11,890
Eat it.

344
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,030
No, just leave it.

345
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:17,870
It's so hot.

346
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,630
Hold on.

347
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,630
Ahjumma!

348
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,020
Are you guys married?

349
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,320
Do we look like it?

350
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:27,160
If you didn't, don't marry.

351
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,060
You guys look perfect.

352
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,520
We're not going to get married.

353
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,740
It seems like you'll become
tangled with a lot of girls.

354
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,560
He got caught cheating on me.

355
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:42,970
She also went to some other person
two years ago and came back to me.

356
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,170
That's good for you guys.

357
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,490
Aunt, do you sell game?

358
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,450
Of course.

359
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,080
Let's do it again.

360
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,180
Why are you not good at this?

361
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:58,300
Flower watching in the spring,
ocean in the summer.

362
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,900
Leaves in the fall, and snow in the winter.

363
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,740
Also?

364
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:07,530
Eat delicious things and watch funny things.

365
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,380
Also?

366
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,680
Get married and have children.

367
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,870
Stop saying those stuff.

368
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,610
You're making me anticipate again.

369
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,800
You told me to say what I want to do with you.

370
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,040
Get the phone.

371
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,670
It turned off.

372
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,390
Are you okay?

373
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,990
Sorry.

374
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,830
The time I was the most scared was
when I was in the last year of middle school.

375
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:29,950
My mom and her boyfriend were fighting.

376
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:35,510
I became angry and closed
my door loudly without realizing it.

377
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,620
I shivered with fear for several seconds.

378
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,890
I was scared my mom was going to hit me.

379
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,060
Han Yoo Ju?

380
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,700
I'm really sensitive.

381
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:47,820
I have a lot of fears and try to see
what the other is thinking a lot.

382
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:52,250
I met Eun Chan yesterday.

383
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,810
Call her first.

384
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,770
The little kid is trying hard,
but the adult is a bit careless.

385
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,730
I want to call her when I organize my mind.

386
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:09,820
Adults are slow because they
have a lot to think about.

387
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,050
You got a text message.

388
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,670
Aren't you curious about what she sent you?

389
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:30,910
You kissed Eun Chan first, didn't you?

390
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,160
Oh, I can't remember.

391
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,950
Oh my, you're trying to avoid it.

392
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,220
I'm in a hurry.

393
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,060
Where are you going?

394
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,060
To the restroom.

395
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:55,570
You're so funny.

396
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,790
What if I call him.

397
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,150
Then what am I going to say?

398
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,150
How are you?

399
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,930
You're doing well, right, mister?

400
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,930
I'm doing well.

401
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,290
Please call me when you have time.

402
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,290
Bye!

403
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,730
Do you like her?

404
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,730
Okay. Let me ask one more thing.

405
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,730
A place called Junghwa Kindergarten.

406
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,000
I asked you if you like her.

407
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,980
Yes, yes, 3rd street, yes, thank you.

408
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,890
Give it to me!

409
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,190
You should've answered me
when I asked you a question.

410
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,320
How did you feel when Eun Sae was stuck
to you saying that she liked you?

411
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:11,210
Hand me the notebook.

412
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:17,860
Because I truly like you,
I obey you well, but you, hyung!

413
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,120
You don't even tell her to think properly.

414
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:23,910
You answer her and smile at her.

415
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,870
Let go!

416
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,480
You stupid bastard.

417
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,690
I told you not to talk in Japanese!

418
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,900
You're so arrogant. You don't even
know who your senior is.

419
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,690
Who's arrogant!

420
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,270
Do you want to fight with me too?

421
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,650
Let go!

422
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:45,500
Hey, where are you going?!

423
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,550
Yes?

424
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,550
Hi, how are you?

425
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,260
This is Myung Jae.

426
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,820
Oh, oh, really?

427
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,890
Are you in Sidney right now?

428
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:16,450
No. I came to Korea.

429
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,040
I have to meet someone in Korea.

430
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:24,130
Mother and sister-in-law...

431
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:27,560
Han Gyul is doing well, right?

432
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,810
The wine is okay, right?

433
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,810
Just drink half a glass.

434
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:50,600
I was going to go home in the weekend.

435
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:54,480
And I call grandma once every two to three days.

436
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:59,550
Since the old one is slower than young people,

437
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,620
don't worry about it too much.

438
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:09,240
Don't tell mother that I know about my birth.

439
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:14,290
Why did you want to meet me?

440
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,290
How much do you know?

441
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:23,050
You gave birth to me illegally.

442
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,650
The mother right now isn't my real one.

443
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,030
I was in the orphanage for about
three years and got adopted by you.

444
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:38,460
What was the person who gave birth to me like?

445
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,840
She was a warm and affectionate person.

446
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:49,950
She studied hard from young age and became
a math teacher in a middle school.

447
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:54,860
She was very competitive and didn't like to lose.

448
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:57,310
Did she leave you?

449
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:02,190
Or did you dump her?

450
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,980
I dumped her.

451
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:12,380
There was nothing else I could do then.

452
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,650
How did she pass away?

453
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:20,300
From a car accident, before you turned 1.

454
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:26,520
I wasn't ready to be responsible for a person.

455
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:32,570
And I didn't have the courage to convince
your grandmother either.

456
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,230
I wasn't good enough.

457
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,230
Yes, you wouldn't have been good enough.

458
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:41,170
You even left me at the orphanage.

459
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,290
Why isn't he picking up his phone?

460
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,230
Hello?

461
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,230
Oh, son.

462
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,710
You're doing well, right?

463
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,950
Of course, I'm good.

464
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,970
Your business is going well?

465
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,450
Yes.

466
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,390
Mom.

467
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,950
Why are you calling me like that again?

468
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,820
You have something to request, don't you?

469
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,290
You know that I love you a lot, right?

470
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,220
Of course.

471
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,830
I love you a lot too.

472
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,960
Thanks, mom.

473
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,950
Thank you.

474
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:54,030
Why are you acting like this?

475
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,000
Do you want to speak to grandma?

476
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,640
No, I'm going now.

477
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,640
Okay.

478
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,640
Okay.

479
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:06,540
Han Gyul said that he was thankful.

480
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:12,140
He must have been so troubled.

481
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,440
You did well.

482
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:20,570
It's better for you to be a bad person.

483
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:24,580
Anyways, Lee Myung Jae came.

484
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,740
No news is good news.

485
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:32,240
He said he came for business reasons.

486
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,970
Business?

487
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,780
If he came for business, he should've taken
care of that and just left. Why did he call?

488
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:40,320
Did he want to upset someone?

489
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,630
Do it properly.

490
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,520
I can't let our Han Gyul meet him.

491
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,170
It's his first time in Seoul in 10 years.

492
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:50,730
I can't just let him go back like that.

493
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,730
I have to meet him at least once.

494
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:57,030
That's why I don't like you.

495
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,340
I can't let go of my son.

496
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,020
Why is he taking his words back now.

497
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:04,240
Lee Myung Jae didn't say anything about that.

498
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,930
Why do you assume things so easily?

499
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,400
Let's leave him alone for now.

500
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:10,430
Mother-in-law.

501
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:14,750
If he says something about Han Gyul,
bring him to me.

502
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:18,210
He's not a rash person.

503
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,850
Do it properly.

504
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:26,540
Or else, I'm going to leave this house.

505
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:01,910
This is the delicious Coffee Prince.

506
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:05,280
Is delicious Coffee Prince your name?

507
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,500
Manager?

508
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:07,900
Manager?

509
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:09,900
Older brother!

510
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:15,800
Are you sleeping?

511
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:17,970
No, I wasn't.

512
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,970
Where are you?

513
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,970
I don't know.

514
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:24,350
Why didn't you pick you the phone all day long?

515
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,910
I don't know.

516
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:31,030
You're doing it again, making me curious.

517
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:33,030
Where are you?

518
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,930
I don't know.

519
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,060
Your house?

520
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,060
Cafe?

521
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,290
What's this sound?

522
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,070
Oh, you're here!

523
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:58,370
I was looking for you a lot,
but you're here.

524
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,620
Hello.

525
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,860
I bet a lobster this big.

526
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,810
You always think about eating.

527
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,810
You can't back down.

528
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,590
You're trying to take money off
from your salary again, aren't you?

529
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,630
You can't.

530
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,140
You have to pay money, no matter what.

531
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:27,480
Keep your space.

532
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,410
Space.

533
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,280
Put your knees in.

534
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,910
Keep your pose.

535
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:38,260
And hit it like this.

536
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,480
You seem like a pro.

537
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:41,690
- I'm going to put the balls in.
- Okay, put them in.

538
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:43,660
- Keep your eyes open.
- Eyes open.

539
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,350
- Think about someone you hate!
- Go Eun Chan!

540
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,810
Start.

541
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,720
It's coming, here, here.

542
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,420
Do it properly.

543
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,650
Your muscles are worthless.

544
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,560
It's because I haven't done this in a long time.

545
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,350
But why are you playing baseball at night?

546
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,650
- Because I'm frustrated.
- Why are you frustrated?

547
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,310
Go Eun Chan.
Let's go see the ocean.

548
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:08,680
Ocean?

549
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,680
Okay!

550
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:17,480
Hey, you have to slow down on a curved road.

551
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,800
Do you think this is a motor scooter?

552
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,420
You're so small yet you're not even scared.

553
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,290
Stop the car!

554
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,120
Don't give me tips.

555
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,620
I do well if you just leave me alone.

556
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,340
Whatever.
I'll just leave the car to you.

557
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:38,700
- If you make a scratch!
- "I'm going to take money from your salary!"

558
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,540
You were going to say that, weren't you?

559
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,680
Do whatever you want.

560
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,140
Seriously.

561
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,470
What?

562
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:54,870
I saw someone wearing
white clothes in the mirror!

563
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,870
You're talking nonsense.

564
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,870
Look.

565
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,350
This is so fun.

566
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,350
Did you get scared?

567
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:24,270
Since it's dark,
it looks like we're in a whale's belly.

568
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:28,390
This is the inside of a whale's belly.

569
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:29,900
Pinocchio.

570
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:36,770
If we light a candle and torture
the whale, will it cough us out?

571
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,510
Cough us out, cough us out.

572
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,760
You're so unfair!

573
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,760
Come in here, it's cool.

574
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:57,360
It's okay.

575
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,430
Hey. When's your birthday?

576
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,640
December.

577
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,040
Blood type?

578
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,010
O.

579
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,720
I'm B.

580
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,720
I don't like guys with blood type B.

581
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,720
Why don't you like them?

582
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,650
They're the representative of arrogant,
sensitive, and stingy guys.

583
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,610
No!

584
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,610
That's just a stereotype, put that away.

585
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,190
B guys are really diverse.

586
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,720
They're tough, loyal, warm...

587
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,710
Whatever.

588
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,660
Let's go together!

589
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:36,510
What kind of a person does that?

590
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,890
You don't know me well.

591
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,280
That's blood type A.

592
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,280
Okay, okay, I know.

593
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,460
You make me angry.

594
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:49,160
Since when did you like toys?

595
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:54,870
Just, because I played with toys ever since
I was young, I think I became like that naturally.

596
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,430
You didn't have friends?

597
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:58,200
Why did you play with toys?

598
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,930
My friends hated me.

599
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,580
Why?

600
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:05,060
As you can see,
I kind of have a bad personality.

601
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,430
I was ten times worse then.

602
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:12,620
I got angry at people who were nice to me,
and punched people easily.

603
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,410
Why?

604
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,940
I don't know.

605
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,660
I think I just got angry for no reason,
now that I think about it.

606
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:31,920
I heard that the person who gave birth to me
was a math teacher in a middle school.

607
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,730
My father finally told me.

608
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:39,500
Why are you talking about that while smiling?

609
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,860
It's not funny at all.

610
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:53,920
Go Eun Chan.

611
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:58,350
You like it now that I'm your older brother,
don't you?

612
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:04,970
Do you really like me as a younger brother?

613
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,060
What do you like the most about me?

614
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,710
What?

615
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,060
Just.

616
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:18,060
As a younger brother.

617
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:22,980
You're joking around again.

618
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:29,110
When do you like me the most?

619
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,460
I'm really cute, huh?

620
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:36,010
Then, what do you like the most about me?

621
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:38,010
Everything.

622
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:45,800
Of course, as a brother.

623
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,540
Let's go.

624
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:29,790
Why do you keep staring at me?

625
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:33,440
We can do this since we're sworn brothers.

626
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:36,590
Of course.

627
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:06,800
I found it!

628
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,330
Let's just go home.

629
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,840
We need to see the sun rise
now that we're here.

630
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,840
It's really hard to come here often.

631
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:21,410
Wouldn't it be better to sleep for at least
a little bit since we have to work tomorrow?

632
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,840
It's not like we're going to faint
if we don't sleep for a day.

633
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,710
It would be hard for you,
since you're old.

634
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:35,680
You look really sleepy.

635
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:38,330
Sleep for a little bit.

636
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:51,080
We can do this since we're sworn brothers.

637
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:14,810
Go Eun Chan.

638
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:20,440
I don't think I can take it any longer.

639
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,880
You're dismissed starting from today.

640
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:14,450
Mom is grinding the knife.

641
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:16,450
Ugh, I'm dead.

642
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:25,010
Aren't you tired?

643
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,720
Come out after you take a little nap.

644
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,570
You're out.

645
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:31,070
What?

646
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,040
I don't think we can be sworn brothers.
Let's stop seeing each other.

647
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,330
You're being like that again.

648
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,330
I'll see you later.

649
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,780
Hey!

650
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:04,880
Yesterday, I mean
when did you come back this morning?

651
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:05,900
I came early.

652
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,780
I don't believe you.
You're a girl and go outside at nights.

653
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:11,170
If you're going to do that,
don't go to work!

654
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,170
Mom, I'm late, bye!

655
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:15,170
Hello.

656
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:17,740
You're going to get a indigestion.

657
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:20,070
Miss!

658
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,750
Why are you here? You're early?

659
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,830
Oh, you don't get my phone calls
and keep avoiding me.

660
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:28,250
What do you mean avoiding you?

661
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:32,000
We can just meet once in awhile
since we're neighbors.

662
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:36,010
I need to hear a definite answer today
no matter what.

663
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:41,260
If you didn't like my proposal, then
I can propose again in a better way.

664
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:44,140
It's okay. I don't want any proposes.

665
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,170
Miss!

666
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,170
How about the Han River ship?

667
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:51,460
If you ride that at night and take a tour...

668
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,780
I already did those a long time ago. It's okay.

669
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:59,370
Is it because of manager Hong? It is, isn't it?

670
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,950
Really!

671
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:04,180
I don't like you, I don't like you!

672
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:06,540
Mom! Dong Sook ahjumma is on the phone.

673
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:09,090
Miss! Miss!

674
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:10,680
Ji Hyang!

675
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,410
You're late again!

676
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:41,350
Hi!

677
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,450
Hello.

678
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,810
Manager!

679
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,130
Did you sleep?

680
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,310
Manager!

681
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,010
Did something happen?

682
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,880
Manager.

683
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:25,900
Did something happen?

684
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,630
You need to tell me what's going on.

685
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:37,400
Did I do something wrong again?

686
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:45,910
I told you that you were out this morning.

687
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:59,210
Why so suddenly?

688
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:01,820
You don't have to pay the debt.
Don't come out to the cafe.

689
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:03,820
Why are you doing this to me?

690
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:08,880
Don't appear in this place ever again.
Can't you hear me?

691
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:11,580
Why are you acting like this again?

692
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:14,470
You always tell me not to come
if I make a mistake.

693
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:15,710
I'm not leaving.

694
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,710
I'm never going to leave!

695
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:20,580
I don't know if you're coming here as a hobby.

696
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:24,440
But, I'm... I'm never leaving!

697
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:27,240
Okay, then I'll leave.

698
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:30,590
Aren't you being a bit too mean?

699
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:35,380
Who is the person who first told
me to become his brother?

700
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:39,010
How can someone change this much in a day?

701
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:41,870
I'm this kind of person.
Didn't you know?

702
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,650
Yes. I didn't know.

703
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,630
How can you do this to a person?
Are you playing around right now?

704
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,970
I don't like you.

705
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:55,740
I don't like you anymore.
Stop getting onto me, it irritates me.

706
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:05,140
Then you would change your mind soon.

707
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,470
Since you change your mind easily.

708
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,470
This and that.

709
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:14,220
I really hate you.

710
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:17,320
Why?

711
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:20,440
Because you love me?

712
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,360
Why are you laughing?

713
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:35,600
Is it that easy for you?

714
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:40,960
It's easy for you.

715
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,500
It doesn't bother you.

716
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,600
It's just me, just me.

717
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,200
Excuse me.

718
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:09,600
I came here to make something clear.

719
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:12,340
Do you like Ji Hyang, hyung?

720
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,800
Do you?

721
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:16,030
Let's make this clear.

722
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:18,030
Hyung?

723
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,720
I'm angry.

724
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:23,770
Why am I doing this?

725
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:26,400
Kim Ji Hyang, this is Hong Gae Sik.

726
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:30,190
Are you going out with the
butcher shop's Koo Young Dal?

727
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,490
Then do you like me?

728
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,490
I don't like you.

729
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,730
I don't like you either.

730
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,730
Whatever, you person.

731
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:40,310
You heard it correctly, right?

732
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:42,880
This imagined obstacle.

733
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,220
That tortures me even more!

734
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:46,880
Hyung, please help me.

735
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:50,900
If you become the bridge for our love.

736
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,390
You two take care of your love fight.

737
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,790
One cup of American.

738
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:04,120
Go Eun Chan, in a bad mood.

739
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,750
Hwang Min Yeop, also in a bad mood.

740
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:08,750
Hyung is no where to be seen.

741
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:11,770
And a customer who asked to take
the seed out from the kiwi juice.

742
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,780
Today is such a good day.

743
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,520
Huh? It's a text message from brother!

744
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:20,240
I'm going to rest. Please take care of the shop.

745
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:22,240
Is he sick?

746
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:24,240
Here's the coffee.

747
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:26,540
Give me an espresso.

748
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:28,470
Okay.

749
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,990
When are you going to hide your gender until?

750
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:40,630
If I tell him, everything is going to be over.

751
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,970
He said that it's a relief that I'm a guy.

752
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:45,540
You guys are crazy.

753
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:48,520
Here.

754
00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:03,630
Manager.

755
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:04,980
Brother.

756
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:07,420
Can I just come out?

757
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,540
What is that?

758
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:49,790
How can the manager be
absent for several days in a row?

759
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:47,400
Manager!

760
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:50,040
Manager!

761
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:56,550
Manager!

762
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:58,380
Why are you being like this?

763
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:01,180
Manager!

764
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:03,180
Manager!

765
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:10,360
Don't do this.

766
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,450
Manager.

767
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,410
Manager.

768
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:22,680
Manager!

769
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,540
I miss you.

770
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:43,410
Where are you?

771
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,070
Please call me.

772
00:58:56,490 --> 00:58:59,420
I love you.

773
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:21,610
You mean jerk!

774
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:24,770
Why aren't you calling me!

775
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,380
Making me worry...

776
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:45,460
I fought with the manager today.

777
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,880
Just tell him the truth.

778
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:49,020
The manager likes you too.

779
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,020
I'm going to study abroad with DK.

780
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:52,760
Can you give me some time?

781
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:57,180
I just like watching you smile
and cry from next to you.

782
00:59:57,290 --> 00:59:59,500
It's three months soon,
I have to do it till the end.

783
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:02,100
I want to show grandma that I've done well.

784
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:04,990
Manager told me not to come out.

785
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:08,150
But I don't want to quit.

786
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,320
What are you talking about?

787
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:12,320
Go Eun Chan is a girl?
