1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,000
Do you want me to make you feel better?

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,390
What do you think you're doing?

3
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,000
Are you crazy?

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,550
You're crazy.

5
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,480
It definitely gave you energy.

6
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,290
I knew my kiss of support
would give you strength.

7
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,940
Go home now.

8
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,770
Manager, didn't you do it too?

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,250
Before, when you were going on blind dates.

10
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,220
You did it too.

11
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,360
And to think I could talk to you...

12
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,460
Then why did you close your eyes?

13
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,460
You're the one who puckered up.

14
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,150
When did I do that?

15
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,640
Eighth Cup

16
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,980
Are you going to give me strength again?

17
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,170
You do it, and you're dead.

18
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,720
How Han Kyul-ian.

19
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,420
Do you know what that means?

20
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,740
It means…

21
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,940
To look cool when you're
having a hard time.

22
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,390
You can't admit you like
something when you do.

23
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,170
You're good at making things up.

24
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,640
You have to visit your grandmother.

25
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,620
I should.

26
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,290
I don't know how I should act.

27
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,860
What should I say?

28
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,790
My dad died after he was
sick for a very long time.

29
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,340
But I showed him my report card.

30
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:00,160
And when my mom scolded me,
I tattled to my dad.

31
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:05,130
If I got sleepy,
I slept next to the IV stand.

32
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,780
The day he passed away,

33
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:12,440
when I said good bye to him
before I went to school,

34
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,810
I just knew right away.

35
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,440
There might be a chance that
when I came back from school,

36
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,280
Dad won't be there.

37
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,960
Little punk.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,080
What if I was a girl?

39
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:45,340
If I was a girl,
do you think we could date?

40
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,190
It's a good thing you're not a girl.

41
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,950
Why?

42
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,370
If a girl as hectic as
you followed me around...

43
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,870
saying she likes me and
that she wants to date me,

44
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,410
It'll be too hectic.

45
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,570
Huh… you sure are infatuated with yourself.

46
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,980
Who said I wanted it?

47
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,380
I think it's time for me
to stop fooling around.

48
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,490
Getting pushed and pulled,
even dating is annoying.

49
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,510
I'll get married to some girl who
my grandmother and mother both approve.

50
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:22,290
It'll be some rich business
man's third daughter, right?

51
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,040
It doesn't sound too bad.

52
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,750
Because my grandmother grew up
in a good environment,

53
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,710
that kind of a girl is
her ideal granddaughter-in-law.

54
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,350
And my mom's that kind
of daughter-in-law too.

55
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,520
Jong Gook oppa, just wait a little.

56
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,770
I'll come out with an album within the year.

57
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,070
Then I'm going to sing a duet with you.

58
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:53,370
Should I just reveal that I'm a girl?

59
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,240
Calm down.

60
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,130
If you tell him,

61
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,980
do you think he'll be like
Oh My Darling right away?

62
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,820
What if he doesn't like you as a girl?

63
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,870
Do you have the courage
to still face him after that?

64
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:12,600
I went to the café last time,
and I suddenly had this thought.

65
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,080
I think I would just like to be by his side.

66
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,640
Then, I would have nothing else to want.

67
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,370
There are two solutions.

68
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,570
You can tell him expecting
to never see him again.

69
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,660
Or you throw away your greed
and live like this with him in front of you.

70
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,890
Just to tell you,
Oscar from The Rose of Versailles.

71
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,260
Pretended that she was a
boy to save the country.

72
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,000
But I don't have a duty like that.

73
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,420
Unni,

74
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,330
you have love!

75
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,060
Go Eun Chan to protect the man she loves,
pretends to be a boy.

76
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,260
We have to go to the Soo Suh neighborhood.

77
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,770
After we deliver ten kilograms to Toto,

78
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,010
I think we're done with today's
coffee bean deliveries.

79
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,570
I'll drop you off in Soo Suh,
so you can go home afterwards.

80
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,040
What about you, Manager?

81
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,960
I have to drop by the hospital.

82
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,380
Then you'll come back to work, right?

83
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,150
Then, let's go together.

84
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:23,860
I don't think it's respectful to not pay
a visit to an elder in the hospital.

85
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,740
Hm, my knees keep hurting these days.

86
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,840
It's been a long time
since I've hugged my mother.

87
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,380
You were really worried. right?

88
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,530
You know your grandmother is not
going to like it if you know, right?

89
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:09,400
Don't act like you're worried
and just act as you normally would.

90
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,120
My mother's face aged a lot...

91
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,180
Hello!

92
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,430
Who?

93
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,530
My employee. He came to visit.

94
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,780
I asked someone and they said
100% fruit juice is okay.

95
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,990
You gave a lot of attention.
Thank you.

96
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,550
Come on in.

97
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,410
Your stomach's acting up because you keep
eating spicy, salty and sweet stuff too much.

98
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,400
What's going to happen to my grandmother?

99
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,960
I guess you can't have any shaved ice
with red beans now.

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,780
Look at this punk!

101
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,530
He's totally excited.

102
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,930
Are you having a good time
making fun of me?

103
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,390
I'm not enjoying it at all.

104
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,350
My heart hurts so much.

105
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,620
I might go to the bathroom and cry a lot.

106
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,020
Look, look!

107
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,720
This is why I can't even allow myself to be sick.

108
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,600
I'm sick because I did a bit of work.

109
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,590
Why don't you just tell me to go die,
you rascal!

110
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,720
And why have you been just
standing over there?

111
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,890
You should introduce yourself to me.

112
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,330
I introduced myself to you before.

113
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,830
Hello! I'm Go Eun Chan
and working at Coffee Prince.

114
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,270
Grandma! Have some strength!

115
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,980
This punk thinks I'm deaf.

116
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,140
What are you going to do with someone
who has no control over himself?

117
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,810
Replace him immediately.

118
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,120
What's this?

119
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,150
You folded a lot.

120
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,250
It looks like a thousand!

121
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,080
Did you make a wish
while folding them?

122
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:10,060
I prayed that she would pass away
slowly without pain.

123
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,960
But folding paper cranes is a little lame.

124
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,480
But that's why it's pretty,
Choi Han Seong.

125
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,700
I have nothing…

126
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,450
What's this!

127
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,200
I have nothing to eat.

128
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:41,690
Yeah... look at this one! Look!

129
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,060
You're sweeping the board!

130
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,630
You guys are cheating!

131
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,410
What? Who's cheating?

132
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:52,320
Do you have proof?
Do you have proof?

133
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,060
I do! I do!

134
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,620
When manager touched his nose,
you put down that card.

135
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,150
And when you touch your ear,
he puts down that card!

136
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,680
You guys work perfectly together.

137
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,780
Do you still deny cheating?

138
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:02,800
I'm not playing anymore...

139
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,900
I touched my nose because it itched!

140
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,890
You stay still, you cheater.

141
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,460
I'm not going to play!

142
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,410
How dare you accuse me of cheating?

143
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,140
Where did you come from?

144
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,360
Did you come to visit a sick person
or raise their blood pressure?

145
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,600
I didn't want to play Go Stop,
and you're the one who pressured me to play.

146
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,070
And then you accused me of cheating?

147
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,850
I hate people who do that
playing Go Stop. Go.

148
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,320
Do you think it's over
if you clear the board?

149
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,160
Let's play one more round!

150
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,890
Or... just give me back my money.

151
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,590
Why should I give you my money?

152
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,340
I won't!

153
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,130
You're here?

154
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,500
Welcome!

155
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,190
Grandmother looks good.

156
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,290
Grandmother, I'm here.

157
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,810
Eun Chan, you came too.

158
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,110
Hello.

159
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,910
Are we all in mourning?
Why is everyone coming?

160
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,890
What, Grandmother?

161
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,250
I'm going to the bathroom.

162
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,230
Do I need your permission for that too?

163
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,080
I'll go with you! I'll help!

164
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,240
You rascal!
Even though I'm old, I'm still a girl!

165
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,360
You keep treating me like
a brainless old lady.

166
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,880
Grandmother, go with me.

167
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,760
It's all right!
The bathroom's right there.

168
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,170
Let's go, let's go.

169
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,920
Why are you here?

170
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,010
I was playing.

171
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,310
Sit, sit!

172
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,660
Did you get anything?

173
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,830
Get what?

174
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:29,540
The two planned it out...
I only have 1000 won left.

175
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,510
Where's Han Seong?

176
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:56,270
Grandmother wanted vegetable soup,
so he went to buy some.

177
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,510
And Go Eun Chan?

178
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,690
He went with.

179
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,690
I told them I wanted to be here with you.

180
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,220
But...

181
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,450
Eun Chan is very unique.

182
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,630
When I'm with elders,
I get stiff and feel really nervous.

183
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,360
But how come Eun Chan is
so perfectly comfortable?

184
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,490
He's good to everyone.

185
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:21,970
He doesn't shy away from strangers
and he becomes friends easily.

186
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,840
I think he can do everything if he wants...
he just doesn't have the opportunity.

187
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,010
Either way, he's a really unique person.

188
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,840
A star's shining here too.

189
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,590
Grandmother is healthier
than I thought she was.

190
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,820
I'm relieved. I worried a lot
after Han Seong called me.

191
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,490
I pay attention only when something happens...

192
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:50,600
Last night, I realized it's been a lot time
since I went night fishing with Grandmother.

193
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,340
Do you know how good she is at fishing?

194
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,350
Do you want to borrow it?

195
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,390
This side is exclusive for Choi Han Kyul.

196
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,580
You're having a hard time, huh?

197
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:21,160
I know Grandmother likes spending time
with me more than fishing.

198
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:26,440
So when she said to go fishing with her,
I feel bad for thinking she was annoying.

199
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,050
Are you happy that you're
working at the café again?

200
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,490
How did you know?

201
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,620
Then how would the two
of you come here?

202
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,090
He said that he really needed me…

203
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,830
Because I wasn't there,
sales weren't going up.

204
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,380
So he kept begging me to come back
and I was getting annoyed.

205
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,590
Who? Han Kyul?

206
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,980
Well, yeah.

207
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,770
Mister, I saw your name!

208
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,810
Music Director, Choi Han Seong.

209
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,810
In a movie! It was really cool!

210
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,270
What movie?

211
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,020
I forgot.

212
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,840
Let's eat before we go back.

213
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,640
I don't want to.

214
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,760
What's wrong with you?

215
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,490
Don't pay attention and just drive.

216
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,720
You're tired because you're hungry, huh?

217
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,600
See, who told you to come?

218
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,540
Eat two bowls of rib stew.
That's good, right?

219
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,970
I don't want to eat.
Let's just go.

220
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,140
Are you sick?

221
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,750
I'm not sick or hungry.
Let's just go back!

222
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,050
Stop annoying me.

223
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,650
You punk,
why are you giving me an attitude?

224
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,160
I kept saying you were cute
and now you do what you want.

225
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,590
How can you be like that?

226
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,060
How can you lie on your
cousin's girlfriend's lap?

227
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,490
How can you do it especially
when he's not there?

228
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:08,660
So disgusting and annoying.

229
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,030
What? Annoying?

230
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,280
Do you have any brains or not?

231
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,460
How do you think Han Seong felt?

232
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,760
How can you be so forward with your actions?

233
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,020
You're lucky Han Seong is
just a really nice guy.

234
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:20,960
Stop it.

235
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,190
If you like her that much,
why don't you just steal her?

236
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,450
Do you only see me as that much?

237
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,020
How can I...
with my cousin's girl...

238
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,540
Stop pretending like you have a conscience.

239
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,200
You already do lots of weird things.

240
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,730
With an already taken girl, disgusting.

241
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,290
Not just a couple of days,
but a couple of years.

242
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,570
How annoying!

243
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,650
Wow, I'm hearing all kinds of things in my life.

244
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,720
Seriously... wow...

245
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,250
How is it?

246
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:08,420
The title is Lame Paper Cranes.

247
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:13,160
Why do you keep getting more handsome?
It makes me nervous.

248
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:19,490
Wow, I've been nervous for nine years
since we've been going out.

249
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,680
You're just getting nervous now?

250
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,010
How was I in my twenties?

251
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,870
Your twenties?

252
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:37,260
Busy, hectic, urgent...
It felt like you were chasing after something.

253
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,840
You kept running after something,

254
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,700
but I'm not sure what that something was.

255
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:52,190
These days I look at Eun Chan,
and I think about my past.

256
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:56,640
Why wasn't I so fresh
like that in my twenties?

257
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,890
You're still fresh.

258
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,470
Only a little more of liking her,
and that's it.

259
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,600
She's just cute and pretty. That's all.

260
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,840
I'm not going to let anymore happen!

261
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,920
Huh? Huh?

262
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,560
And what if you won't?

263
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,690
You punk! Really!

264
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:37,910
Hyung nim!

265
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,090
- Move!
- Eun Sae...

266
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,920
Manager, what's wrong with them?

267
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:56,690
They're burning, mixing and making
all the flavor come alive.

268
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,230
Why isn't she answering her phone?

269
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:12,590
I was wondering if you
can give me counseling on life.

270
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:19,980
My Eun Sae keeps ignoring my phone calls
and I don't know what to do about it.

271
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,620
You've been waiting for one
girl for three years.

272
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,450
Can you tell me the secrets?

273
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,970
Stop talking nonsense.

274
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,420
Don't worry about it!

275
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:31,100
I'm taking your amazing secret of love
with me to my grave.

276
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,770
Do you want to know another secret?

277
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,470
I'm Japanese.

278
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,730
Nihonjin desu.

279
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:45,010
Wow!
So that's what... no wonder!

280
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,810
You're so good at Japanese.

281
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:51,040
I'm sorry I've been annoying about telling you
to speak your country's language.

282
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,170
I'll keep your secrets, don't worry.

283
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,040
You're telling me all your secrets.

284
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,770
Wow, so this is a man's worry.

285
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,680
I really wasn't going tell anyone this...

286
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,860
But I feel like it's unfair if
I know all your secrets.

287
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:16,310
Go Eun Chan... is a girl.

288
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,680
What?

289
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,410
Girl.

290
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,490
I'm serious. She's our older sister.

291
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,160
I gave him a kiss.

292
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,400
I went to the hospital with him.

293
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,340
I made him laugh.

294
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,260
And still it's her?

295
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,880
And when will the results come out?

296
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,650
Hello!

297
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,840
Good morning!

298
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,900
I think it'll be good for her to stay at the hospital
until the results come out?

299
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:24,460
Okay then, I'll see you at home.

300
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,610
Left, left.

301
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,090
No, it's crooked.
Can't you even see it?

302
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,280
Right, right.

303
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,560
A little more.

304
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:47,860
No, you can't even see that?
Are you a fish?

305
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,110
The picture's upside down!

306
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,020
How can you not even see that?

307
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:05,940
Hey! I don't know why I have
to say this to you but...

308
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,760
You think I'm a jerk who looks
at my cousin's girlfriend.

309
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,260
I mean, Han Yoo Ju and I.

310
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,420
We used to be but now we are...

311
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,490
Hey, the picture's upside down.

312
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,450
Introducing super star, Jang Dong Geun!

313
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,110
I'm totally cute, right?

314
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,520
Hello! I'm Go Eun Sae.

315
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,410
It starts now, little by little

316
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,020
Next.

317
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,400
I'm usually really good.

318
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,210
It's okay.

319
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,010
Do you want to see me dance?

320
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,520
It's okay. You can go now.

321
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:57,730
- Next.
- One more!

322
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,660
Next!

323
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,120
Next!

324
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,820
Hey! I watched a movie with
customer number three yesterday!

325
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,110
Isn't that breaking the rules?

326
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,310
What rules?

327
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:22,310
How dare you call the relationship
between a man and a woman rules?

328
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,400
But this is a secret to Han Kyul, okay?

329
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:30,490
Look! She's dying of happiness.

330
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:35,020
You're the one dying of happiness.

331
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,580
Look at the picture, she's dying.

332
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,580
Do you want to meet her friends?

333
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,130
I'm so hungry.

334
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,300
Are we going to the farm
to get the apples?

335
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,120
The farmer's going to deliver to us.

336
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,960
Did you organize all the orders and stuff?

337
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:52,350
I put the list and stuff in your car.

338
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,170
After we eat, let's go deliver.

339
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:56,850
You can go with Ha Rim.

340
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,340
I have stuff to do.

341
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,350
Where are you going?
You only ate one row.

342
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,960
I'm done. I'm going to go.

343
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,230
He's not even looking at me now.

344
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,050
Hey! Hey!

345
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,540
What's wrong with you?

346
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,310
If you have a problem,
let's talk about it.

347
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,120
What did I do?

348
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,410
Besides you,
I'm already in a crazy situation.

349
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,720
Hurry and tell me without the attitude.

350
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,360
What's the problem?

351
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,450
I like you.

352
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,580
What?

353
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,670
I like you.

354
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:43,390
But I shouldn't...
because it's man to man.

355
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,730
You punk, playing again.

356
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,120
So I'm trying to set aside my feelings.

357
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,300
Just leave me alone.

358
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:27,320
Tiny punk keeps sucking out my soul.

359
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:36,830
Psychiatry, psychiatry.

360
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,110
Do you want some coffee?

361
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,660
No, I'm good.

362
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,730
Have you kissed?

363
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,920
An impulse to want to become a woman.

364
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,500
An impulse to want to put on make up.

365
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,900
Or feeling nervous when seeing men...

366
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:13,270
Since when have you had these symptoms?

367
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,300
I don't have symptoms like that.

368
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:20,620
Then, you just simply like men...

369
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,270
Excuse me, I'll come next time.

370
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,850
You just need medicine.

371
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:29,720
I'll give you three days worth.

372
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:35,060
I try not to, but I keep getting mad.

373
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:37,280
When I see his face,
my insides get hot.

374
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,110
Because you like him?

375
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,910
I'm not sure myself.

376
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,970
I like him, I hate him.

377
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,700
I get mad.
It keeps changing.

378
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,900
Do you think a pretty face will come
out if you do it like that?

379
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:50,910
What is that?

380
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,070
She's drawing an angel.

381
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,810
Angel.

382
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:11,820
Why are you here?

383
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,640
I told you not to come here.

384
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,100
You weren't answering the phone.

385
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:18,020
I wanted to watch a movie with you.

386
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,440
Have you seen this movie?
I heard it was fun.

387
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,960
Who said I was going to
watch movies with you?

388
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,430
Angel.

389
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,750
Let's go together.

390
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:35,530
Listen carefully because
I'm not going to repeat it again.

391
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,260
I like smart guys.

392
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:39,060
I hate guys who are stupid like you.

393
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,660
I'm going to study!

394
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,240
I even applied to a prep
school for exit exams.

395
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,300
Either way.

396
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,080
Don't call or visit me.

397
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:51,950
And don't send me text messages
with wrong spellings, okay?

398
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,440
I did that on purpose to make you laugh.

399
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,920
Wait.

400
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,980
But first, just take this.

401
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:22,480
Even if I try everything,
I don't think it'll work with that person.

402
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:30,300
I know it won't work but I still like him.

403
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,600
Do you think it's love?

404
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,210
Just end it. Stop hanging on pitifully.

405
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,180
Yeah, I'm going to.

406
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,590
Hey! Hey!

407
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,610
Do you want ice cream?

408
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:54,120
Hey!

409
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,580
What's wrong?

410
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:03,190
I got cut from the audition.

411
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,550
Are you crying?

412
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,210
Yeah.

413
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,580
Ju!

414
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:42,960
You're coming now?

415
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:50,000
Do you remember the first time
I opened an art exhibition?

416
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:53,420
I'll never forget that shabby basement.

417
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,260
The smell was terrifying too.

418
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,810
You bit your lip to prevent
yourself from crying.

419
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,010
That's why I fell for you.

420
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:04,720
I thought you said you fell
for my artistic inspiration and talents?

421
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,470
That comes later...

422
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,620
How's the musician?

423
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,300
How's the underwear model?

424
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:15,720
We're good.
He's warm and comfortable.

425
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,720
It's good.

426
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:23,240
I came here to get you.

427
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,350
I'm going to make a restaurant.

428
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,570
And I want to fill it with your artwork.

429
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:32,330
The door handles, the lighting,
even the spoons,

430
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:36,480
I want you to design it and
participate in its making.

431
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:38,940
I'll give you rights to the restaurant.

432
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:44,600
I like this one. Give it to me.

433
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,210
The pancake you made last time,
can you make it smaller?

434
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:01,210
Just enough for one person?

435
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,450
The price would be about 3000 won or so.

436
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,650
It would not be profitable that way.

437
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,160
Is that so?

438
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,700
You're good looking,
with a good personality.

439
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,700
You're really mysterious, huh?

440
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,840
I thought you're Japanese initially.

441
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,480
You're right, I am Japanese.

442
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,760
It's true?

443
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,580
Then how come you can
speak fluent Korean?

444
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,320
My mother's a Korean.

445
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,300
I'm just asking out of curiosity.

446
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:29,290
How did you hide your chest?

447
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,430
You don't have any?

448
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,920
Hwang Min Yeop!

449
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,730
What good do you see in that girl?

450
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:53,030
There's a limit to avoiding somebody.
It's total disrespect now.

451
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:58,530
She's really tortured Min Yeop half-dead.

452
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:00,380
Is she the only girl in the world?

453
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:02,330
She's my first crush.

454
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,460
The first girl I have ever kissed.

455
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:07,390
I only love Go Eun Sae.

456
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,390
Min Yeop,
the first is not everything in your life.

457
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:13,070
There will be a second after the first,
then the third...

458
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,070
even 100th, 1000th, 10,000th.

459
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,640
Hey, how are you planning
to repay my kindness?

460
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,160
Go away! I have no mood to joke now.

461
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,780
I'll do you a good deed for once.

462
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:26,840
I will handle Go Eun Sae.
You just do as I say.

463
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,240
You come over here.

464
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,590
Come over here.

465
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,900
What are you doing?

466
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,070
What have you told Sun Ki?

467
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,290
That...

468
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:38,280
That is...

469
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:39,430
That...

470
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,570
Come let's have a drink together.

471
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,830
- That...
- Shut up!

472
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:44,270
What's up with you guys?

473
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,060
There are still guests around.
What are you guys doing?

474
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,150
Aren't you going in?

475
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,810
Your voice is louder.

476
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:53,570
What did you just say?

477
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,440
I said I'm going deaf because
of your loud voice.

478
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,660
Look at the guests' reactions,
they're more bothered by you.

479
00:31:58,690 --> 00:31:59,530
What?

480
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,310
Ah...
why did you park your car here again?

481
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,290
How many times have I told you?
Not to park your car here.

482
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,680
Everyone would want to touch your car
and they'll leave fingerprints.

483
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,150
Drive it away quick.

484
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,070
Who are you to tell me to move my car?
Go back to work!

485
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,520
Well done for today.

486
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,820
Le's go eat something.

487
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:39,700
Aren't you going?

488
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,750
See you.

489
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,000
Come over if you feel like eating.

490
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,080
See you.

491
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,130
Have you managed to settle your feelings?

492
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:51,610
That day you told me that you had
some feelings for me,

493
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,610
I'm asking you about that now.

494
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,650
Have you settled your feelings?

495
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,040
Basically.

496
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,540
When I've settled my feelings totally,
I'll tell you about it.

497
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,770
See you.

498
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,840
I played well, right?

499
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:28,560
How do I play this?

500
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,340
Now I know why Kenny G's
face is puckered up.

501
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:43,160
Want to learn to play that?

502
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,960
No, I have no music talent.

503
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,620
Mom used to bring me to music school
to learn the piano when I was young,

504
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,620
and all I did was mess up the keys.

505
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,900
I was quite famous for that incident.

506
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:52,900
Trying playing it.

507
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,540
No way. I might break it.

508
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,660
It's alright. Just try playing it.

509
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:04,740
You play well.

510
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,240
So you knew how to play?

511
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,710
Looks like you're in good form today, huh?

512
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,140
Exactly contradictory to my feelings now.

513
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:23,050
Rather than fighting my way
against the opposite direction,

514
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:26,250
it's better to follow my own feelings
no matter how bad it is.

515
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,130
Mister, you're just like a Santa.

516
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,040
Am I that kind?

517
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,790
And your body's also a bit...

518
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,860
Large?

519
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,900
Yeah.

520
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:48,100
When I'm with you,
it feels like I've received a Christmas present.

521
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,760
You really know how to sweet talk, huh?

522
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:53,950
Let's start.

523
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,760
You will keep your promise right?
If you spill it out...

524
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,430
Come to my house to do cleaning.

525
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,130
What?

526
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,290
Once a week.

527
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:13,100
Then I'll keep the promise.

528
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:15,650
A promise is a promise,
what's this about?

529
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,320
If you're not happy, then forget it.

530
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,830
Alright, I'll do the cleaning.

531
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,310
I'll just have to do the cleaning, right?

532
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,860
You must not say anything else.

533
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,880
What is it about saying something else?

534
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,620
Did you damage your brain?

535
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,280
Could you have managed studies
with that brain of yours?

536
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,410
Why are you rubbing on me?

537
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,700
After all, I have an IQ of three digits.

538
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,780
Have you read the books
I bought for you last time?

539
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:40,270
I was tired,
so I just flipped over some pages.

540
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,870
The milk temperature used to
make Ratia should be?

541
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,690
65 degrees.

542
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,560
So, you did read a bit?

543
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,270
I didn't get that from reading
and memorizing from books.

544
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,270
I got that from practical experience.

545
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,530
Do you like eating ice?

546
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,260
Alright, I got it.

547
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,830
I will talk to her about it.

548
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,430
Oh.

549
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,540
Who was that?

550
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,460
Han Kyul.

551
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:05,770
He wants to go for a joy ride tonight.

552
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,550
What is there to drive around
in the middle of the night?

553
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:12,040
What's wrong? We can enjoy looking
at the night scenery of the Han River,

554
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,040
it should feel really good.

555
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:18,790
You will be blessed.

556
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:22,680
If we had sent Han Kyul to the orphanage.

557
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:27,930
Thanks to you, Mother. I have a good son.

558
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:32,420
If you hadn't said those words,
I couldn't have acted so cool about it.

559
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,790
I'm in a good mood now.

560
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,430
Here you go.

561
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,570
Mother.

562
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:43,860
Isn't this your most precious...?

563
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,650
Is this for real?

564
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:51,390
You cannot go back on your words.

565
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:55,140
Hey, let me hold it for a while,
and I'll give it to you later.

566
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,180
Give it to me.

567
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,530
Grandmother.

568
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,770
How can you eat ice?

569
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,440
What's with this child?

570
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:09,200
You're eating shaved ice.
You should protect your stomach.

571
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:12,770
Why are you being so troublesome?

572
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:14,630
Grandmother, you came here just
because of your grandson, right?

573
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,550
It's so cold.

574
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:19,960
Soup, eel, chicken stew, pig's feet.
There are lots of healthy foods.

575
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,160
Why shaved ice? Ice.

576
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:21,770
Hey! you.

577
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,850
Weren't you the one who
felt like eating this?

578
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,050
Grandmother,

579
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,610
my manager wasn't good in his studies
when he's young, right?

580
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,660
Look at his face before
you ask me this question.

581
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,940
You must have spent a lot
employing home tutors, huh?

582
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,070
You went to New York also because you couldn't get
into the universities in Korea, right?

583
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,080
Am I right?

584
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,600
With my handsome face,
if I excelled in studies as well.

585
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,430
Don't you think it'd be really unfair?

586
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,860
Right, Grandmother?

587
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,230
Well, that's right.

588
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,930
Both of you aren't Nam Chul
and Nam Sang Nam,

589
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,930
why do you both always stick together
and bicker all day?

590
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:49,110
Oh, you're talking about the
group which dances,

591
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:51,110
swaying their bodies here and there, right?

592
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,140
I know that dance.

593
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,800
You even know that?

594
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,570
It's delicious.

595
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,980
It feels so nice.

596
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:05,660
Grandmother, wait for me.
Wait for a while.

597
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,030
How can a guy look so pretty?

598
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:14,600
He's quite friendly.
At least he'll not die of hunger.

599
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,560
Why don't I take him in as a brother,
grandmother?

600
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:21,050
How's the shop doing?

601
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,910
It hasn't collapsed yet,
you're managing it properly?

602
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,270
I've even got an apple business done.

603
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,320
Now I'm planning for our
shop's second promotion.

604
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,320
It'll be a very special one.

605
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,660
I will succeed and prove myself to you.

606
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,830
That's good.

607
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,260
Grandmother.

608
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,400
A hot one, and a cold one...
consume them in turns.

609
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,580
Or else you'll fall sick.

610
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,540
I was taking a cold one in the beginning,

611
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,540
what nonsense are you talking about falling sick.

612
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:51,980
I'm eating ice now. What for do you want me
to drink something hot?

613
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,510
You just ate some ice just now.
Quickly have a hot drink now.

614
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,780
You child.

615
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,990
Wait a minute.

616
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,730
Eat this and later, drink this...

617
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,610
Ah... it's hot.

618
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:08,110
Feels nice.

619
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,690
Drink this quick. Quick... quick...

620
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,890
What are you rushing for? It's so hot.

621
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,250
Grandmother, grandmother, grandmother.

622
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,810
Look over here. Look over here.

623
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:24,990
I'll come over too.

624
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,460
1... 2... 3...

625
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:38,220
Our darling here is frightened?

626
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:41,020
We have something to discuss with you.

627
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:43,010
Relax, relax...

628
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,370
No doubt she's my angel.

629
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:58,500
Are you playing with me?

630
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,040
I don't know where you guys came from.

631
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:02,190
But my boyfriend's a
gang boss in this area.

632
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,260
If he finds out that you guys are bullying me,

633
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,670
he'll dig your eyes out and kick
them like a football.

634
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,030
She said he'll kick our eyes like football,
this angel.

635
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,560
Min Yeop has a weird liking.

636
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:14,790
I'll hand this over to the cops.

637
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,730
You guys are dead.

638
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,750
- Yes, it's the police, right?
- Catch her, catch her.

639
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,850
Hey, grab her phone first.

640
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:28,270
This is what you called righteousness?

641
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,460
Did you come because of that?
Didn't you come because of the 50,000 won?

642
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,680
Let me do it.

643
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,490
Get off me!

644
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,570
I will kill you guys.

645
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,320
Angel! Angel!

646
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,100
Eun Sae, are you alright?

647
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,960
What should I do now?

648
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:59,290
You guys are dead.

649
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,210
Min Yeop Oppa.

650
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,220
You jerks!

651
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,880
What's wrong with him today?

652
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,370
Thank you.

653
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,200
His face's messed up.

654
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,250
Enjoy your drink.

655
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:34,220
I couldn't think of anything
else seeing Eun Sae cry.

656
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,990
You fella, how dare you
abandon your comrades?

657
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,760
I should be the one wearing this.
Why should it be you?

658
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,350
No, you can't wear that.
Eun Sae gave that to me.

659
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,900
Hey, come with me.

660
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,500
What are you doing?

661
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,610
What is it?

662
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:48,610
Hey!

663
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:51,260
I've been thinking and I still can't forgive
you for what you've done.

664
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:54,180
What are you doing?

665
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:56,610
I want you to write a blood promise.
You jerk.

666
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:57,540
You really.

667
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:00,130
You!

668
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,900
If you dare say it out...
be careful I'll sew up your mouth!

669
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:07,770
My lifespan has decreased
by 100 years just because of you.

670
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,360
I'm sorry, Hyung nim.

671
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:12,620
I won't betray you from now onwards.

672
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:15,240
Can you swear on Eun Sae's name?

673
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,890
I swear.

674
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:20,330
You like Eun Sae that much, huh?

675
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:26,750
Hey!

676
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,110
I'm just asking because I'm curious.

677
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,900
What do you think of me as a girl?

678
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:34,640
Eh?

679
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,910
I am a girl.
But others think I'm a guy.

680
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,970
Just that, if I was a girl...

681
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,580
Ah! I'm crazy. I'm crazy.

682
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,420
To have said such things to you.

683
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,250
For me,

684
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,750
if you're a girl, it'll be revolting.

685
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,750
Eh?

686
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:56,670
Frankly, I can't even differentiate
whether you're a guy or a girl.

687
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:58,770
And you're not as pretty as Eun Sae.

688
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,380
I don't like girls who are stronger me.

689
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,190
What more can I say to you?

690
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:04,150
I'm sorry.

691
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,080
My standard's higher.

692
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,790
Each of you choose an instrument of your own.

693
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:15,890
We're not even a band.
Why do we have to perform?

694
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:17,640
You always do things your way.

695
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,210
You can handle the stage designs, right?

696
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,230
I can handle those.

697
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,680
But Hyung,
we can't present a stage performance.

698
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:26,240
What is a stage performance?

699
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,240
Is it a band?

700
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,580
Sun Ki,
you know how to play the guitar, right?

701
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:32,940
Not on professional basis.

702
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:35,220
Stop doing unnecessary things already.

703
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,520
You think we can promote the shop
by displaying a performance?

704
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,520
All we have are regular
customers all the time.

705
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,950
Always wasting your time
on meaningless stuff.

706
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,080
Except for Manager Hong,
everyone's in for this.

707
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:45,800
I will allocate you guys your instruments.
Go back and practice.

708
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:47,060
Let's promote our shop while it's doing well.

709
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:49,060
We have to take this opportunity.

710
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:49,930
The end.

711
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,710
The end, the end...
I don't feel like doing this.

712
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,460
Is it that we can't afford to hire a band?

713
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,700
Let's just use a karaoke set.

714
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,580
Bingo!

715
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,220
[Little Girl]

716
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:29,690
Not bad.

717
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:31,810
It's not that easy to play this either.

718
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,630
Well, nothing's easy in this world.

719
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:37,820
I have to perform my best during the gig,
and make Manager Hong's glasses fall.

720
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:40,050
You guys still bickering nowadays?

721
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,440
I tolerate him more.

722
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:46,900
I wonder who he takes after,
such a bad temper.

723
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:48,810
His mother looks like a nice person.

724
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:50,690
Of course Auntie's a nice person.

725
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:53,870
I used to envy Han Kyul's family
when I was young.

726
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,910
They always had home made Kimchee
and pickles prepared for dinner.

727
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:59,080
The curtains were changed every season.

728
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,540
All of those were interesting,
it made me envious.

729
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:04,120
Didn't your mother do that too?

730
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:08,280
My parents were always busy with studies.

731
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,910
So basically I'd spent most of
the time with my nanny.

732
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:15,170
You felt lonely?

733
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,930
I didn't like being alone.

734
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:21,930
So I always switched on
the lights night and day.

735
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,510
The music turned on as well.

736
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:27,120
In the end, I fell in love with music.

737
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:32,200
But what does a music producer do actually?

738
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,200
Rather than hearing what people say,

739
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,200
follow me.

740
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:46,060
Listen here.

741
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:56,430
When will the music play?

742
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,250
Here it comes.

743
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,940
It's amusing.

744
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,710
You really composed this?

745
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,560
It's really amusing.

746
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,620
It's so nice.

747
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:30,660
Mister, you're really good.

748
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:47,180
What is it, Mister?

749
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:20,330
Hello.

750
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:22,900
Hello.

751
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:01,330
I'll call you again tomorrow.

752
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,000
Brother, have you kissed before?

753
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:20,410
With Customer Number three?

754
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:21,860
You guys have already kissed?

755
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:24,800
It's not even something difficult,
why waste time?

756
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,750
We did it last night.

757
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,040
Hyung, how can you simply kiss just like that?

758
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:31,040
Kissing as if it's a joke,
kissing anybody just like that.

759
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,370
They're more difficult things than kissing...

760
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:34,370
we can't waste our time on that, right?

761
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:38,820
You, did you?

762
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:42,560
You fella, you have a girl already?

763
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:43,890
Is it somebody I know?

764
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,910
You fella,
save that I was worried that you couldn't...

765
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,920
find one because of your pretty face.

766
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:49,750
Hyung.

767
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:52,220
It seems like he has a girl already.

768
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:55,770
Should we give him some advice?
He doesn't know a thing.

769
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:57,190
When did I say I have a girl?

770
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:59,320
Bring her over one day.
We'll have a look.

771
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,430
Right, bring her over.

772
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:02,690
We'll have a look over this girl.

773
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,380
You really scare me lot nowadays, huh?

774
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:43,470
I will appear like this more often before I die.

775
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:49,510
Do you want to be frightened
like this every time?

776
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:55,730
I'll be a good boy for today.

777
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,780
Besides grandfather, no man has ever let you
pillow his arm, right?

778
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:38,510
Choi Han Kyul.

779
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:42,050
Come and have a drink if you're not busy.

780
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:47,710
Come to the office, starting next week.

781
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:53,290
You're not young anymore.
Don't waste your time on useless stuff.

782
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:57,580
The world's not that easy,
that you can do whatever you like.

783
00:50:57,610 --> 00:51:00,210
You don't know what I really want.

784
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,350
Do you know that?

785
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:06,250
Let's have a drink.
It's the first time you've said this to me.

786
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:09,400
I was curious to what you'll say to me.

787
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:13,100
In the end you still chose to tell me off.

788
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:15,040
I'm leaving.

789
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:19,980
I vacated a position for you
in the Marketing Team.

790
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:32,080
I can't drink such strong liquor.

791
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:34,970
I get drunk with a glass.

792
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,060
Just like what I promised Grandmother,
I will go to New York in three months.

793
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,570
Is playing with toys your dream?

794
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,990
Useless fella.

795
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:51,370
You were the one who
fathered this useless fella.

796
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,750
You never used to yell at me.

797
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:57,430
That's something new.

798
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:00,170
Even if I'd run away from home for 1 month,

799
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:03,110
or if I'd thrown a temper
refusing to go to university,

800
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:04,310
or even do something worst than that.

801
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:06,360
Don't act like a kid asking for attention now.

802
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:09,180
I had even once wished that
you could slap me on the face!

803
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:16,240
If you had intended not to care,

804
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:20,300
then you shouldn't have taken
me in from the beginning.

805
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:48,580
Why suddenly apply facial mask today?

806
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:49,720
Something's bothering me.

807
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,070
So what?

808
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:53,680
Human feelings are so complicated,
like a spider's web.

809
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,080
What's a scissor for?

810
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:57,450
Just cut it with a scissor.

811
00:52:57,490 --> 00:52:59,160
That's brutal.

812
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:00,550
Hey!

813
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:01,150
I work so hard to bring you up.

814
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:03,150
You don't even buy me
chewing gum to repay me.

815
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,460
And yet you bought Min Yeop
a pair of sunglasses.

816
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:09,710
I was just letting a bothersome guy
have a taste of sweetness.

817
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,570
Here you go.

818
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:21,890
Hello?

819
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:26,000
The whistle woke me up from my dream.

820
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:31,940
The whistle blowing from my window.

821
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:35,780
Don't go. Don't dare you go.

822
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:40,080
It's like a wave of sand...

823
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,830
A person who's lived with a woman before
is indeed different from others.

824
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:47,430
You can even memorise the poem just like that.

825
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,810
It's my creation.

826
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:52,650
He's very talented.

827
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,700
Why don't you sing a song?

828
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,330
What should I sing?

829
00:53:58,090 --> 00:53:59,820
Why don't we drink some beer?

830
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:00,750
Beer?

831
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,230
You're buying?

832
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:04,290
Aren't you going home?

833
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,830
Don't you plan to sleep?

834
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:07,380
Why don't you sleep?

835
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:09,280
Really...

836
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:10,960
I'll help her fan.

837
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,570
Really.

838
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:19,270
Why are you so quiet?

839
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,810
What's wrong?

840
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,800
Want me to switch on the TV?

841
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:26,580
I asked you to come over because
I wanted to hear you ramble.

842
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,980
Why aren't you helping me out?

843
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:32,340
I'll rant about myself then.

844
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:36,300
My past might be a bit boring,
but just listen.

845
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,010
You also know how to talk about your past?

846
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:44,670
It happened during my
2nd year of senior high.

847
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:48,880
I escaped from class and rushed home secretly.

848
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:55,070
My Aunt from America making a fuss
grabbing grandmother and my father's hands.

849
00:54:56,310 --> 00:55:02,610
Not only did my mother raise a kid out of
my father's affair with another woman,

850
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,920
she also honored and cleaned
the woman's grave for ten years.

851
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:12,400
My aunt cried asking,
how can such a thing happen.

852
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,800
You know what I was thinking then?

853
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:19,040
I had to creep off quietly,
without being discovered.

854
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:24,740
I kept quiet until this very moment.

855
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:29,970
But I spilled everything out today.

856
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:31,040
So...

857
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:37,390
The mother now is not your biological mother?

858
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:42,400
She's more like a real mother to me
than my biological mother.

859
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:52,660
I was afraid I might not be able to cope
if I'd spilled it out, so I just kept quiet.

860
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:56,670
I regret not keeping it a secret until the end.

861
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,600
Ah...
you are pretending to be drunk again, right?

862
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,270
You always need people
to carry you when you're drunk.

863
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:23,730
Oh... really!

864
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,040
My life's really difficult.

865
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:16,420
You're gay, right?

866
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:28,550
But I'm not.

867
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:35,080
So stop seducing me.

868
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:38,250
Who asked you?

869
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:41,650
To ask me to come over so late at night?

870
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:47,650
Let's be sworn brothers.

871
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:53,870
It's not like we're writing
some kind of historical legend.

872
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:07,990
Have you read that book before?

873
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:12,260
Do you know the story of Do Won Gyul?

874
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:14,340
You think you're clever.

875
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:16,380
Comic books have it as well.

876
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:19,040
Yoo Bi, Gwan Woo and Jang Bi.

877
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:21,030
Isn't it all about them?

878
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:22,320
You're right.

879
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:27,170
Sworn brothers who are
even closer than real brothers.

880
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:35,360
So even before they die,
they have no reason to separate.

881
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:50,540
Call me brother from now on.

882
00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:56,150
Try calling me.

883
00:58:56,180 --> 00:59:00,130
Let' see... we as sworn brothers,
we need an item to prove it.

884
00:59:04,330 --> 00:59:05,820
You have an ear hole?

885
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:09,400
Why do we need proof?
You're so old-fashioned.

886
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:15,300
Try calling me brother for once.

887
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,280
Why should I call you brother?

888
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:18,810
Come here.

889
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,190
Call me brother.

890
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:24,470
I'm not calling.

891
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,100
Call me brother.

892
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:43,670
Come here.

893
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:44,920
Let go off me.

894
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:46,130
Call me brother.

895
00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:59,350
Say that you're happy that
we're sworn brothers now.

896
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:00,760
Brother!

897
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:09,930
Just like that,
even if it means being a younger brother,

898
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:12,530
I still want to stay by his side.

899
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:17,660
Just like that,
even if it means being an older brother,

900
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:19,660
I still want to stay by his side.

901
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:25,180
So we're brothers from now on?

902
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:27,370
So you'll give me lots of love?

903
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:29,850
What are you talking about
love between men?

904
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:33,240
It doesn't matter as long as you're giving it
to somebody you like.

905
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:37,510
You're telling me it's not a mistake?
Instead, you really like her now?

906
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,520
My wish has finally come true.

907
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:41,040
What else do you know?

908
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,220
Don't tell mom that I already know about this.

909
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:45,300
Don't tell her.

910
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:47,430
I like that fella.

911
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:51,020
Out of all the people in the world,
why Eun Chan?
