1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,540
It's almost bedtime.
Why are you eating now?

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,450
I just feel like some ice-cream.

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,520
Sister, get some for me.

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,880
Only at such times
will you call me "sister", you sly fox!

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,940
Hang up!

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,350
Hello.

7
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,150
Hi.

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,790
How have you been doing?

9
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:38,550
I sent you some messages.
Why didn't you reply?

10
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,680
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,830
About what?

12
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,540
That day...

13
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,320
You were startled, right?

14
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,430
That has been bothering me a little...

15
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,370
How about we just forget about it?

16
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,840
My memory is very good.

17
00:00:58,870 --> 00:00:59,850
Then...

18
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,250
Just pretend you forgot.

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,620
Why must I forget it?

20
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,490
So that we can be friends again.

21
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,400
Friends?

22
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,650
You want to be friends with me?

23
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,640
Yes.

24
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,170
You listen well when I pour out my heart.

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,320
You often treat me to meals.

26
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,530
Am I being too selfish about this?

27
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,800
No.

28
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,960
Rather than calling it for
my own sake and being indecisive,

29
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:34,010
it's better to not leave any room for
hanging on like what you're doing.

30
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,940
In my life, I'm getting another good friend.

31
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,520
Feels good.

32
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,320
Time to feed you.
Your stomach's begging for food.

33
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,910
I wasn't hungry just now.

34
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,440
Maybe when I see you, my appetite grows.

35
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,620
There's never been a day like this
when I don't feel hungry.

36
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:01,060
This should get recorded into
Go Eun Chan's history book forever.

37
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,520
My manager,

38
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,930
he told me not to work there anymore.

39
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,770
And he said it very angrily.

40
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,290
Totally terrifying.

41
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,010
And I thought we could get along well.

42
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,780
But I really don't know what he's thinking.

43
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,430
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,420
It's already my habit to tell you these things.

45
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,100
I think I like my manager.

46
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,560
No, I like him very much.

47
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,650
Very surprised, right?

48
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:39,400
No.

49
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,840
I knew it long ago.

50
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,470
I could sense
that Miss Y has fallen for with Mr. X.

51
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,300
But isn't the situation getting
a little complicated?

52
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,590
Mr. X still sees Miss Y as a guy all this while.

53
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,420
Aren't you going to confess to him?

54
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,360
Rather than get dumped by him for being a girl,

55
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:03,860
it's better to continue
getting on with him as a guy.

56
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,900
Let's get something to eat.

57
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,610
We'll celebrate us being friends again.
My treat.

58
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,770
What would you like?

59
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,310
Hamburger?

60
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,540
Pizza?

61
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,050
Whatever.

62
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,080
Delicious stuff.

63
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,050
Brother!

64
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,710
Brother!

65
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,160
What on earth is happening to you?

66
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,080
Come in.

67
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,490
Are you moving?

68
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,030
Sit.

69
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,580
Where?

70
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,210
Have you eaten?

71
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,900
Shall I shut up and not ask anything?

72
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,860
You want some?

73
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:16,480
Brother, after you left that day,
Eun Chan became listless and wan.

74
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,050
That's it. You'd better shut up.

75
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,960
Brother.

76
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,680
Brother.

77
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:31,850
I...

78
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,180
I like that guy,

79
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,760
Go Eun Chan.

80
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,310
My Chan?

81
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,520
Brother, don't I like Eun Chan too?

82
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,990
Anyhow,
it's him who got me in this state.

83
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,050
I'm completely messed up.

84
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,030
Eun Chan knows about this too?

85
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,860
How would he know?

86
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,440
Don't worry.

87
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,860
I'll try to sort out my feelings quickly.

88
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,310
Why must it...?

89
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,020
Eat quickly. Why are you
holding on to your cell phone?

90
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,080
Dumb Hwang is not calling me.

91
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,100
That's great. You got your wish.

92
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,630
Aigoo! See how you're
wolfing it down! What's up?

93
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,310
Only when I'm full
then I'll have energy to work.

94
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,120
Eat slowly.

95
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,500
Brother!

96
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,750
With more and more customers,
shouldn't we add more tables?

97
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,680
Why isn't he answering his cell phone?

98
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,580
Why isn't the manager coming to work?

99
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,700
Is he sick?

100
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,130
Business is getting better too.
Did we do anything wrong?

101
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,730
Hey! Go Eun Chan!

102
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,870
Your brother hasn't come for a few days,
aren't you worried?

103
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,970
Anyway, in a month's time
he's going to America, isn't he?

104
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:27,770
Give me that.

105
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,350
Whether he comes or not,
we still have to work hard, right?

106
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,940
What? Since he's leaving?

107
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,410
Hey! He cares so much for you
yet you're saying since he's leaving...

108
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,060
Not too long ago you called him "brother" now
and again, how did you become another person?

109
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,290
So what can I do?

110
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,700
Cry and yell,
begging him to come to work?

111
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,210
How can you speak like this?

112
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,700
Do you have such bad upbringing?

113
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,200
What's wrong with me?

114
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,850
Oh! Manager!

115
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,780
Oh, you're here!

116
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,350
It must have been busy.

117
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,280
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:21,420
Just missing for three days,
why did you have to leave with such fanfare?

119
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,280
I thought you were running away for good.

120
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,870
Is the business better?

121
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,110
Sit down for some tea.

122
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,420
Why? Something to say to me?

123
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,940
If I don't, then we can't have tea together?
Sit.

124
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,060
You look a little thin.

125
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,270
Yeah.

126
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,490
Thanks.

127
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,200
Are you feeling better?

128
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,300
The three-month deadline is almost up,
I want to finish what I started.

129
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,960
This is grandmother's dream,
I want to show her my success.

130
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,210
This guy has matured.

131
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,120
Um... it's time to expand the coffee menu.

132
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,130
According to the season change.

133
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,120
Put your heart at ease and
get along with Eun Chan.

134
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,400
It's so awkward.

135
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,010
It seems I've crossed my line.

136
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,340
With you around, I feel more steady.

137
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,890
Those tables at the entrance,
bring them in here.

138
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,290
The entrance is blocked and that's bad.

139
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:23,820
Yes.

140
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,200
Are you sick?

141
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,690
Your face...

142
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,920
Do you want something to eat?

143
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,980
How about some cake?

144
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:38,910
You haven't eaten breakfast yet, right?

145
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,230
I'm alright.

146
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,900
It hurts, right?

147
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,480
The more you give,
the more he clams up.

148
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,110
It's really cute.

149
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,540
What's wrong?

150
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,870
He seems to have gone through a lot of pain.

151
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,180
I think so too.

152
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,960
That's bad for me.

153
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,200
If he found out I broke some plates,
he's sure to blow his top!

154
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,240
So you're going back to New York?

155
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,240
He kept emphasizing that there are
other artists keen on the job.

156
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,320
So I'm a little frustrated,

157
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,210
and I almost told him to go ahead
and use another artist.

158
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,660
In my view, there's no other artist better than you.

159
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,330
DK must know this very well too.
So you won't want to miss this opportunity.

160
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,240
He's a man with high standards.

161
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,510
That's surprising!
I didn't expect you to praise him.

162
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,670
Have you decided?

163
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,800
Are you going?

164
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,490
I've made an appointment to see him later.

165
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,240
Which is the most famous
Korean restaurant in Seoul?

166
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,250
He said we have to meet there.

167
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,350
That's how he is...

168
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,650
So are you going or not?

169
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,450
One.

170
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,040
I go.

171
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:19,530
Two.

172
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,530
I wait.

173
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,170
Three.

174
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,680
I don't go or wait.

175
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,600
We break up.
Which number will it be?

176
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,480
You're slow in answering.

177
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,640
Give me some time.

178
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,830
How long?

179
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,590
One week?

180
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,320
Ten days?

181
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,290
Looks like you need more time than that.

182
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,760
Is it so difficult just to look at him?

183
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,620
What is?

184
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,910
It's all over your face.

185
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,610
You're so tense
you can't even look in that direction.

186
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,610
If you're going to be like this
then you should just run away.

187
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,080
What will be solved if I ran away?

188
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:18,520
If you use this back on me next time,
you're dead.

189
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,530
Manager, manager... scooter.

190
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,370
How about a ride on my scooter?

191
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,520
No, thanks.

192
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,900
How is your grandmother doing nowadays?

193
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,740
Mind your own business.

194
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,500
And stop loitering around me in future.

195
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,530
Keep a safe distance of two meters.

196
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:06,340
If you're not happy with that,
then roll up your mat and leave.

197
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,830
You really know how to torture others...

198
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:50,120
Your Ice Americano is done
and here's the apple.

199
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,260
Thank you.

200
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,530
Hey!

201
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,650
What would you like?

202
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,940
One Ice Mocha.

203
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,190
Ice Mocha?

204
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,720
Hey, Go Eun Chan.

205
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,880
What do you think about being gay?

206
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,450
No particular views on that.

207
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,920
Then, what about your views on Han Kyul?

208
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,210
Nowadays society has changed.

209
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,370
If you like him then you like him...

210
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,940
What am I saying?

211
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,730
I have to go pee.

212
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,610
Sorry to keep you waiting.

213
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,650
Angel, Angel, Angel.

214
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,460
Missed calls, all from Angel.

215
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,210
It's totally full with Angel.

216
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,960
It seems she just realized your worth now.

217
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,160
Shall I return her call today?

218
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,120
What if she really becomes unhappy?
What'll I do?

219
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,010
Do you want to get Eun Sae or not?

220
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,370
Eun Sae... I can get her?

221
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,510
Seeing you two,
my heart's bursting with joy.

222
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,660
- Hey, follow me.
- Where are we going?

223
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,270
Yes, Coffee Prince.

224
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,550
This is the life insurance company.
Do you do delivery?

225
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,560
Delivery?

226
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:09,250
This is no coffee-on-wheels,
delivering everywhere.

227
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,270
Yes, we do.

228
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,790
Thirty coffees and twenty waffles?

229
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,260
When must it be delivered?

230
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,750
I'll do the delivery,
it's embarrassing to have the manager himself go.

231
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,450
What's wrong with doing delivery?

232
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,920
You've changed.
For someone who's been so proud all his life.

233
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,760
Hey, Chan!

234
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,710
Hurry, my Chan! Hurry!

235
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,740
Oh, what's wrong with my stomach?

236
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,010
You do the delivery.

237
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,670
What's wrong with me?

238
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:52,460
If you order more than twenty coffees, we do delivery.
Please call us anytime.

239
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:53,900
We'll be sure to call you.

240
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:54,840
Thank you.

241
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,540
Oh, what is that smell?

242
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,300
Wow! It looks delicious.

243
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,340
There's coffee...

244
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,320
And waffles too.

245
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,120
And I was going on my diet.

246
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,930
Smells great.

247
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,460
This looks delicious.

248
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:11,370
I just want to eat it now.

249
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,360
Manager!

250
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,700
You've changed my view about you.

251
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,160
If we do delivery,
then our business will multiply.

252
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:29,190
Close proximity prohibited.
Is talking prohibited too?

253
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,700
Hey!

254
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,040
Get off.

255
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,740
Get off!

256
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,650
Really!

257
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:11,070
Get off. Get off now.

258
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,240
Shove off.

259
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,790
Why is close proximity prohibited?

260
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,180
I told you to shove off.

261
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,500
Then just run over me.

262
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,060
I really want to do that too.

263
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,500
If I did as I wished you would have been
run down more than ten times already.

264
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,460
Why did you toy with me?

265
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,340
You said you liked me.

266
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,660
And we've sworn to be brothers too.

267
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,980
You really want me to be your brother?

268
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,130
You like that?

269
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,870
I don't like it either.

270
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,870
You think I do?

271
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,870
Didn't you say that if I was a girl,
you wouldn't like me?

272
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,890
Didn't you say you like me being a guy?

273
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,590
You're going off to America in a month's time.

274
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,590
What do you expect me to do?

275
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,690
When we went to the beach,
I was so happy.

276
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,570
I was doing fine on my own.

277
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,430
But you got me into this state.

278
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:45,520
You once said you needed to sort out
your feelings and that I should leave you alone.

279
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,100
Now I'll borrow your line.

280
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:51,310
Leave me alone.

281
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,080
Get in the car.

282
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,610
You're not going back to the shop?

283
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,110
It's only a month at the most.

284
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,190
It'll be over in a month.

285
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,100
I'm going to hang on till then
and you should to.

286
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,950
You'll be fine as soon as you leave.

287
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,440
Don't you bother
about who you leave behind?

288
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,860
Fine.

289
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:46,780
For the remaining month,
let's try to get along.

290
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,030
Shut up.

291
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,390
One more word from you,
see if I'll hit you.

292
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,900
Why?!

293
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,560
I asked him what he was doing
and he replied "Why?"!

294
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,910
This guy! He's dead.

295
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,890
Eun Sae,

296
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:21,120
I had a big fight with the manager today.

297
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,630
I questioned him about why he was so fickle.

298
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,290
Why he toyed with me?

299
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,540
But,

300
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:32,840
he said I'm making things hard on him.

301
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,490
Why am I so stupid?

302
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,800
Thinking about it,

303
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,320
he's the one that's been wronged.

304
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:49,540
What gives me the right to cry or yell?

305
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:59,800
What should I do?
Because of me, he's hurting.

306
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:04,560
No matter how much more you ponder over it,
a love-idiot like you won't come up with any good idea.

307
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,700
Just tell him everything.

308
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,720
He likes you too, doesn't he?

309
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,670
Didn't you tell me not to say it?

310
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,640
At that time I didn't know
you'd like him so much.

311
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,580
If I did tell him,
I might never ever see him again.

312
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:22,920
I'm afraid of how angry he'll be
that I lied to him.

313
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,970
It might not be the right thing to do,

314
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:31,850
But since he's going to America
in a month anyway.

315
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,970
Just one more month.

316
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,760
Just...

317
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,880
I'll just...

318
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:50,420
With just a few practices and you're going to perform?
Isn't that too reckless?

319
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,900
That's why I need your help.

320
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:59,660
Han Yoo Ju says you've cheated on her,
what's that about?

321
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,880
You really have someone else?

322
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,580
What if I said I do?

323
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,730
Will you snatch Yoo Ju away?

324
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,840
I should just run off with her.

325
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,950
To an uninhabited island.

326
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,240
You wish to die?

327
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,290
It's funny, right?

328
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,990
I think it's funny, too.

329
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,790
Hey! Are you guys joking around?

330
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,600
Can't you even follow the rhythm and the tune?

331
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,290
You! You're just hitting any old how.

332
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,580
We should just give up.

333
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,900
The way we are now,
they sure will be stoning us.

334
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,830
Yes, the performance is in two days.
This is truly a problem.

335
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,090
This really helps relieve stress.

336
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,080
Let's try again.

337
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,080
Since it's a performance,
let's try out best.

338
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,340
Let's start!

339
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,750
How noisy.

340
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,980
Are you chasing birds?

341
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,000
Look who's here!

342
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,690
Have you been good?

343
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,020
You look very energetic.

344
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:13,880
You!

345
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,860
When an elder is sick,
you should come pay a visit.

346
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,680
Why didn't you show your manners?

347
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,000
If I went, it'll only push your blood pressure up.

348
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,750
The ambience is quite good.

349
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,430
She's feeling much better now.

350
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,900
Now, she's up to going to the office too.

351
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,280
That's great.

352
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,320
I thought two lazy bums won't be able to do much.

353
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,750
It seems you do have some ability after all.

354
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,950
Manager Choi is doing a good job.

355
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:39,760
I thought he'll just fool around for three months,
then run away.

356
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:44,210
Have you ever seen me pour in time
and effort on anything that's useless?

357
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,850
Don't tell him what I told you.

358
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:48,730
That guy is obnoxious, if he knew I praised him,
he'll be lazy straightaway.

359
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,510
You're sure right about that.

360
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,960
Grandma!

361
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,090
Mom, you're here too?

362
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,760
This is not bad.

363
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,250
Is there a seat for me or not in this place?

364
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,600
Of course, there is. Sit over here.

365
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,250
Can you drink coffee?

366
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,150
Of course I can.

367
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,680
Grandma, sit here.

368
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,140
Mom, sit here.

369
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,620
Two coffees and a cake, right?

370
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,060
See that guy?

371
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,100
He looks small but it seems
he can handle quite a lot.

372
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,780
He's the one we met at the hospital.

373
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,480
He seemed like a child outside but here,
he's quite independent.

374
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,950
Hey!

375
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,310
How have you been?

376
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,330
Hello, grandmother.

377
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,970
Hello, mother.

378
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:40,720
You're earning your keep, right?

379
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,880
Of course, I'm working conscientiously.

380
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,140
You're really going to America?

381
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,600
Of course it's for real,
how can I fake that?

382
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,370
I don't want you to go there.

383
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,020
Can you not go?

384
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:03,140
Aigoo!
You're using the beauty strategy again.

385
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:05,480
An agreement has to be kept, right? Mom.

386
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:09,360
If only children would listen to their parents...

387
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,340
Bill here, please.

388
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,620
Yes.

389
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,490
Please wait for me.

390
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,120
Don't disregard your health because of work.

391
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,020
Do you get it, grandma?

392
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,450
Yes.

393
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:33,490
Be careful getting in.

394
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,100
I heard from your father.

395
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:46,270
You must have been sad, right, my son?

396
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,600
I would like to go on a trip with my son.

397
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,490
Find time to go with me.

398
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,510
Is that alright?

399
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:58,480
If I go with you,
others will think that I'm a gigolo.

400
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,110
Go well, mom.

401
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,600
What are you doing?
You're not a kid anymore.

402
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:22,070
Didn't you say you don't like me?

403
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,590
So now I'll pretend like I don't know you.

404
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:27,620
As a man, I don't like you but it doesn't mean
don't like you as a younger brother.

405
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,540
I say,

406
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,110
No,

407
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,580
I don't want to be your younger brother.

408
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,540
I say, we've been neighbors for seven years.

409
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,040
Suddenly you say, let's date.

410
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,830
Does that make sense?

411
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:40,030
How embarrassing it is for me.

412
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,860
I've decided to go for matchmaking.

413
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,350
I've decided to give up on you.

414
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,670
Then just go matchmaking.
No one is stopping you.

415
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,470
This is not how people should behave.

416
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:55,240
You're a man but you're so petty.

417
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,740
Go on!

418
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:00,980
Ah!

419
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,100
Why are you here?

420
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,460
We came for the performance, oppa.

421
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,500
Be careful what you say.

422
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:12,090
Don't worry, I already told them.

423
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,080
Right?

424
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:14,900
So, where is my Sun Ki oppa?

425
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,110
Good luck for your show.

426
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,460
Oppa, fighting!

427
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,370
Don't do anything overboard.

428
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,570
Let the rope down.

429
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:22,530
Oh, yes!

430
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:26,960
Wow!

431
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,460
You guys put in a lot of effort.

432
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,630
You're here?

433
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,960
Congrats!

434
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,790
Wow!

435
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,400
Where's Han Kyul?

436
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,010
Inside.

437

Hi! Hyung, how are you?

Wow! It's beautiful.

[The Princes' Small Music Performance]

443
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,670
Hello everyone!

444
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:01,800
Thank you for coming to Coffee Prince
on a hot summer day.

445
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:07,080
I'm the youngest amongst the Coffee Princes,
I'm DJ Min Yeop.

446
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,710
Next let me introduce you
to the Coffee Princes.

00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:48,250
Thank you, everyone!

456
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:55,240
Right after this,
the Coffee Prince Show is going to start.

457
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:55,380
Coffee Prince!

458
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,380
One! Two!

459
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:51,470
I love coffee, I love tea

460
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:55,890
I love the java jive and it loves me

461
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:59,990
Coffee and tea and the java and me

462
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:04,320
A cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, a cup

463
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,580
I love java, sweet and hot

464
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:12,630
Whoops! Mr. Moto, I'm a coffee pot

465
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:17,220
Shoot me the pot and I'll pour me a shot

466
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:21,070
A cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, a cup

467
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:25,580
Oh, slip me a slug from the wonderful mug

468
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:29,600
And I cut a rug till I'm snug in a jug

469
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:36,070
A slice of onion and a raw one... draw one.

Waiter, waiter, percolator

471
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:42,530
I love coffee, I love tea

472
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:45,450
I love the java jive and it loves me

473
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:50,670
Coffee and tea and the java and me

474
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,710
A cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, a cup

475
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,580
We should have made this place into a club.

476
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:19,730
Hey, come over, my Chan.

477
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,270
Min Yeop, you too.

478
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,780
It's good to be young.

479
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,160
Great.

480
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:45,710
What's this? I can't dance. Don't.

481
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,710
Don't!

482
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:51,030
Brother, with me.

483
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:54,640
Like this?

484
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,200
Oh, I'm so tired.

485
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,530
Mister, I have a present for you.

486
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,370
What?

487
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,370
What's this?

488
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,570
The first coffee beans roasted by me.

489
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,650
It might not taste good
but it's quite meaningful.

490
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:26,030
Thanks for helping us with the show.

491
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,900
And something for Ssulja too.

492
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,620
Hey! This is chewing gum for dogs?

493
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,450
Ssulja will surely be thrilled.

494
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,630
How can I bear to drink this coffee?

495
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:37,440
I'm afraid you might get
a stomach ache after drinking it.

496
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,930
I'm still not up to standard yet.

497
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:42,130
Anyway, thanks!

498
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:45,840
Why is it you seem to
be treating her like a girl?

499
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:46,470
Go Eun Chan,

500
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:49,070
Do you like men?

501
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:53,060
You smile at me too,
so you're like this to everyone?

502
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:58,480
Brother, what do you think?
When she's like this...

503
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,640
I like it.

504
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,760
You do?

505
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,100
Yes.

506
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:08,810
I, for one,
think it's really nothing special.

507
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,840
Looking at you,
I'm embarrassed to continue sitting here.

508
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,230
You two are like a couple.

509
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,580
Is there anyone for me?

510
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:20,080
Yes, there is.

511
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,440
Han Yoo Ju.

512
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,770
Hey! Hey!

513
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,110
I'm leaving now. I'm not feeling too well.

514
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,210
Hey! Eun Chan!

515
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,330
Why are you treating her like this?

516
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,670
I'll go take a look.

517
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:50,750
You better go.
Sister said she was coming.

518
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,430
It's alright.

519
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:02,280
The manager,
he told me not to work at the shop anymore.

520
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:06,650
Hong ahjussi also told me it's better to give up.

521
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,700
But,

522
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,870
I don't want to give up my job there.

523
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,170
Because...

524
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:18,280
I need the money.

525
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,270
That's an excuse.

526
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:26,890
I love coffee too much...

527
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,640
That's an excuse too.

528
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:36,110
It's so warm and great and interesting

529
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:41,350
that I almost forgot that I'm in a lie.

530
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:46,650
Now I know I made a mistake.

531
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,400
But,

532
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:56,320
I'm always hoping he's there with me.

533
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:59,180
Always wishing he'd like only me.

534
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,930
Longing for him not to go to America.

535
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,010
But what am I now?

536
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:12,340
I'm not a guy nor a girl,

537
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:15,470
I'm too scared to tell him.

538
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:08,000
Choi Han Kyul.

539
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,630
For everything, thanks!

540
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,620
To say thanks now is quite tiring too.

541
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:26,250
Everyday, that's all I say to you.

542
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:30,260
Hearing me say thanks again,
you must be sick of it, right?

543
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:36,840
Good night.

544
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,980
I don't know why this is so.

545
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:46,860
Whether you're laughing or crying.

546
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:50,830
Just watching you brings me joy.

547
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:56,020
That's what I like.

548
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:06,720
Promise me one thing.

549
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,400
In front of me, just do what you want.

550
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,460
Your mood, your feelings.

551
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,070
Without hiding anything.

552
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,840
How's that?

553
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,170
Deal.

554
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:27,720
Deal and sign.

555
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,240
Go on.

556
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,900
Yes?

557
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,350
Where are you?

558
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,440
I'm on my way home.

559
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:22,500
Are you with Eun Chan?

560
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,720
Did you send her home?

561
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,510
Yes.

562
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,690
Is that so?

563
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:40,490
I'm with Han Kyul.

564
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:43,940
They like each other.

565
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:46,220
Han Kyul and Eun Chan.

566
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,460
They both like each other.

567
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,340
I really don't know what to say.

568
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:54,680
Shall I comfort you?

569
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:58,080
No.

570
00:44:59,120 --> 00:44:59,840
I'm fine.

571
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,240
Alright.

572
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,610
I know.

573
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:29,130
I really feel like I've done you wrong.

574
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,030
Why do you feel that way?

575
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:38,950
I asked you to come so that you could meet up
with Han Seong why wouldn't you go see him?

576
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:41,360
Are the two of you avoiding each other?

577
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:50,040
I hope no one gets hurt.

578
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:53,690
But is that too much to ask for?

579
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:09,340
Your coffee's ready.

580
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:11,010
Thanks!

581
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:14,440
Last night's show was fantastic.

582
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:16,160
Thanks!

583
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,510
It seems the show is bringing results.

584
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,240
Han Seong mister helped me a lot.

585
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,220
Are you very close to Han Seong?

586
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:24,200
Yes.

587
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,450
We meet often.

588
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:26,790
What do you do together?

589
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:31,340
Play with Ssulja, ride bikes, eat together.

590
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:32,770
We drink together too.

591
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,160
Isn't that dating?

592
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:38,710
You seem to be close with men especially.

593
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:03,140
Men don't like to walk like this.

594
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:05,590
So they like to walk backwards?

595
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:07,970
Walking barefoot on the grass,

596
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,520
And at the speed of the earth's revolution too,
I don't like to walk like that.

597
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:15,410
Only for the sake of winning the lady
that I'm willing to walk like this.

598
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:19,930
For you.

599
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:25,360
DK, I haven't quite...

600
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:31,090
In the New York house,
the flowers are almost dying.

601
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,100
You go and save them.

602
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:35,630
You don't keep flowers, do you?

603
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:37,850
You said you didn't know how.

604
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:40,120
People do change.

605
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,340
If you don't believe me,
go take a look yourself.

606
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:46,630
That's right, people do change.

607
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:48,920
Let's eat.

608
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:50,420
I'm hungry.

609
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:15,750
Mister, who are you?

610
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,780
A chef.

611
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:20,860
How old are you?

612
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:23,790
Three years old.

613
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,920
Mom!

614
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:30,330
No Eul's here.

615
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,530
Mom, I'm back.

616
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,890
No Eul, you're back.

617
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,690
- Thank you, teacher.
- Goodbye!

618
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:46,280
Did you have fun today? My son.

619
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:55,140
I took a call for delivery.

620
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:58,050
It's for tomorrow morning
to be delivered by 7.30AM.

621
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,520
Where?

622
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,380
The securities firm at the junction.

623
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:04,950
Then, we have to be here real early.

624
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,360
I'll do it.

625
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:10,660
I've already told Sun Ki about it.

626
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,830
Why is a guy's waist so tiny?

627
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,670
What's the use of such a tiny waist?

628
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:52,430
I'll do it myself.

629
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:06,580
Eun Chan hyung!

630
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:06,920
This...

631
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:11,570
Look at this.

632
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,990
Tomorrow night, let's meet at 7pm.
I'll be waiting.

633
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:15,550
I'll be waiting. From Eun Sae.

634
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:17,850
I'll be waiting.

635
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,300
Hyungnim!

636
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:23,950
Let me go! Let go!

637
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:25,570
Hey! Let me see too!

638
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:26,800
What is it? Let me see.

639
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,120
Manager, you want to see it too?

640
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,700
My angel is meeting me tomorrow night...

641
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,500
Drink.

642
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:41,890
Yes.

643
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:50,360
You still like to surprise people.

644
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,230
Appearing so suddenly.

645
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:54,250
It's been fifteen years, right?

646
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:00,850
Those days we thought we'd never grow old
but look at you now.

647
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:06,930
Did you tell mother that I'm back?

648
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:10,320
Han Kyul is doing well.

649
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:23,090
They're building a bridge in the Middle East.

650
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:23,810
Libya.

651
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:31,640
If I start work there,
I'll be away there for couple years.

652
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:36,710
This scenery is not bad.

653
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:39,120
I heard you came to Seoul last year too.

654
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,970
Why didn't you contact me?

655
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:47,580
You miss Han Kyul, right?

656
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:53,570
The coffee's very fragrant.

657
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:54,710
Suits me just fine.

658
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:55,690
Really?

659
00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:57,560
Is it really good?

660
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:01,540
I burnt it a bit so it might be too strong.

661
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:03,450
It seems you like strong coffee.

662
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:06,000
That's a relief.

663
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,010
Where's Sun Ki?

664
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:10,080
In the restroom.

665
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:15,460
Mister, I'll call you back later.

666
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:17,280
Oh, Han Kyul's there?

667
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,030
Yes.

668
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:20,620
Alright. I'll call you again.

669
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:31,320
Your coffee is so fragrant.
Get me one too.

670
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:33,980
Hey!

671
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:36,080
Who washed this cup?

672
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:40,350
That woman is really...
Mistakes can't be avoided but she keeps complaining.

673
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:41,080
What's wrong?

674
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:42,890
She kept complaining about
how we washed the cups.

675
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:45,430
I said sorry at least seven times.

676
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,930
It's still ringing in my ears.

677
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,860
Who washed this cup?

678
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:52,740
I don't know.

679
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:53,760
Could I have been the one?

680
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:57,550
You're on the phone the whole time
that's why this isn't clean.

681
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:59,540
I'll do it again, I'm sorry.

682
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:01,490
You're always apologizing.

683
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,920
Brother, stop it.

684
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,780
There are customers out there.

685
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:06,880
Go Eun Chan, you make it right.

686
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,360
I'll clean up the place before I leave tonight.

687
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:10,900
I'm sorry.

688
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:32,710
I've just got my documentation done.

689
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:36,560
I'm going back to New York with DK.

690
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,780
I think that job will be fun.

691
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:43,290
And I'm starting over with DK.

692
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,480
DK says he still likes me.

693
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:50,310
Looking back, I think I liked him too.

694
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:52,270
This is just me.

695
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:54,170
Now this, then that.

696
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,510
Who gives you the right to?

697
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,640
Don't go.

698
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,890
Thanks...

699
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:03,760
For saying that.

700
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:05,580
Like you said,

701
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:09,600
I wavered, no.

702
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:14,130
To be frank, I'm still wavering.

703
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:17,280
But please don't go.

704
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:21,900
I'll come around soon.
What are you doing? Don't go.

705
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:24,440
You're not just wavering.

706
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:29,650
Han Seong, you're in love with her.

707
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:33,650
So foolish of you.

708
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:39,730
To not realize it when you've found a new love.

709
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,410
Suddenly I don't feel like talking anymore.

710
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:03,500
Everyone's worked hard.

711
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:04,970
Let's go eat together.

712
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,410
Eun Chan hyungnim!

713
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:11,410
He was distracted earlier so now
he has to stay back to clean up the place.

714
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:14,060
If you guys not being serious in your work too,
you'll bear the consequences also.

715
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:15,480
Yes.

716
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:18,110
Hey! Give me a thump on my back.

717
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:19,570
That's one dollar.

718
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,990
Money-crazy!

719
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:26,050
How could you talk like that
when you like him.

720
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:28,410
My Chan has to suffer all by himself.

721
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,540
Yes. Even though Chan noonim is strong,

722
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,540
but doing it all by herself must be terrible.

723
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:33,810
Sister.

724
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:35,880
Man! If only she was a girl...

725
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:39,680
Forget it. As long as they like each other,
who cares whether he's a guy or girl.

726
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:43,610
Manager Hong, do you know something I don't?

727
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:45,430
You mean, there's someone who doesn't know?

728
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:46,640
They are good together.

729
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,660
You talk so easily about other people's...

730
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,410
Eun Chan is a girl.

731
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,120
So what's the problem?

732
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:55,440
Even if she's a guy,
there's nothing wrong too.

733
00:55:58,970 --> 00:55:59,960
Go Eun Chan is a girl?

734
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,860
Don't stick your hands into this.

735
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:04,220
Really?

736
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:07,610
Ah, well, this has to be a secret.

737
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:09,330
Oh you!

738
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,610
Get in! Get in!

739
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,070
Go Eun Chan!

740
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:19,510
Wake up from your stupor!

741
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:23,130
So mesmerized by a man that
you can't even do your work.

742
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:26,350
All the books on coffee left unread,
what on earth are you thinking?

743
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,180
What's wrong with this?

744
00:56:39,290 --> 00:56:41,640
As an elder, you can't do this.

745
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:45,240
Han Kyul was in so much pain
and you still hid it from him?

746
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:48,210
You guys can't be doing this too.

747
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:49,910
He has to cry over it.

748
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:52,610
You shouldn't interfere,
just do what you're supposed to do.

749
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:54,320
Is it that serious?

750
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:56,500
I didn't even know that they're in love.

751
00:56:56,930 --> 00:56:58,680
You guys are too much!

752
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:01,590
You don't bother whether he's dead or alive,
you're laughing away, making noise.

753
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:04,670
Someone who was idling has fallen in love,
what's so great about that?

754
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:07,090
Manager Choi asked for it himself.

755
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:08,430
Leave him alone.

756
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:09,700
When he can't take it no more, he'll give up.

757
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:10,930
It's because he can bear it that he continues.

758
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:11,560
Right?

759
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:13,690
Manager, you must have been torn in love before,
how can you say...

760
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:17,370
To be torn in love is the happiest
time of one's life,

761
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:19,950
Later on, he'll find this as his favorite time too.

762
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:22,310
When it doesn't concern you,
you can say anything.

763
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:23,910
I can fully empathize with Go Eun Chan.

764
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,320
She's the parent of a struggling family, right?

765
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:27,340
For the sake of a job, she'll do anything.

766
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:30,200
Lying to everyone,
do you think it's easy on her?

767
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,000
Then when she got the job,
she should have made it known clearly.

768
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:34,760
Brother,

769
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:36,620
don't throw your temper, we...

770
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:38,430
You're the same as them,

771
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:40,210
toying around with people.

772
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:41,930
Jerks!

773
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:44,240
Get it from him.

774
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:47,060
Brother, brother...

775
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,740
Forget it.

776
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:50,380
Let me go!

777
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,550
Brother!

778
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:57,480
Open up!

779
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,600
Hey! Why is he shouting?

780
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:05,500
Brother.

781
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,690
Brother.

782
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:09,000
Hyung.

783
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,320
Brother,brother,

784
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,990
why are you back here again?

785
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:39,190
I'm not destroying the mural,

786
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:42,820
I just feel that it's a little off so...

787
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:47,020
Just once...

788
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:52,110
I'll say this just once so listen up.

789
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:58,250
I like you.

790
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:02,880
Whether you're a man,

791
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,460
or an alien...

792
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:09,470
I don't care anymore.

793
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:18,490
I tried getting rid of my feelings,
but I couldn't...

794
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:24,640
So let's go, as far as we can go.

795
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:31,740
Let's give it a try.

796
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:05,400
Go Eun Chan,

797
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,860
why do we both have to be guys?

798
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:12,940
Just like having an ice block in my heart,
I feel heavy and cold.

799
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,990
Due to DK's schedule changes,
the date has been brought forward.

800
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:17,810
I'll be leaving next week.

801
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:19,650
Do you really know me well?

802
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:22,600
Think about it carefully,
there's no evidence to prove that he's a guy.

803
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:24,510
Have you seen Go Eun Chan's identity card?

804
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:26,250
Why didn't you tell me earlier
that Go Eun Chan is a girl?

805
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:29,820
I was afraid that you wouldn't
want me around anymore.

806
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:33,420
That I won't see you anymore.
