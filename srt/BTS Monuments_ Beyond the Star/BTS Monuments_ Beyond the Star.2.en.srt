1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:05,338
{\an8}When I heard we had booked
the Olympic Gymnastics Arena,

2
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:06,923
the first thing I thought was,

3
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:10,010
"Oh, we're finally on top."

4
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:27,193
{\an8}I still remember the time we watched

5
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:30,822
{\an8}BEAST's performance in the back-row seats
when we were trainees.

6
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,741
{\an8}It's so big.

7
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,785
"What? We're going to
perform in the same place

8
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,078
{\an8}where we saw others perform?"

9
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,621
{\an8}"That place was so big."

10
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:41,583
Oh, my.

11
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,334
We are finally going to have a concert.

12
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,338
Are all of these seats going to be filled?

13
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,673
-  Yes.
- Really?

14
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,216
"Did we sell out?"

15
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,551
{\an8}"Are people actually coming?"

16
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,886
{\an8}"We can do it for two days?"

17
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,721
We kept asking these kinds of questions.

18
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,974
The scene when we first entered the venue,

19
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:01,519
along with many other things,
was unforgettable.

20
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,898
The Olympic Gymnastics Arena
is a dream for idols, the peak.

21
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:08,485
A place where idols can go
when they reach the top.

22
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,446
We did manage
to get first place somehow.

23
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,990
But being able to perform
in the Olympic Gymnastics Arena

24
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,533
really marked your success as an artist.

25
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,243
{\an8}This was the biggest venue

26
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,913
you could perform at as a Korean artist.

27
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,082
Gocheok Sky Dome didn't exist yet.

28
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,416
It was really symbolic.

29
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,667
We had made it.

30
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,733
Let's do our chant.

31
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,693
- Bang Bangtan! Bangtan!
- Bangtan!

32
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,951
The cheering was on another level
with 25,000 people.

33
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,286
The sound was piercing through my earbuds.

34
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:03,581
It felt as if I was waiting for
the pistol to go off in a race.

35
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,583
I was that nervous.

36
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,128
I couldn't see anything at first.

37
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,883
<i>♪ Please let me breathe ♪</i>

38
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:18,930
<i>♪ Let's Run Run Run again
I can't stop running ♪</i>

39
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,682
<i>♪ Let's Run Run Run again ♪</i>

40
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,976
{\an8}I loved concerts. I still do.

41
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,061
{\an8}How I feel about concerts hasn't changed.

42
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:29,983
It was the only place where
I could dance and sing without worry.

43
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,152
I'm doing what is precious to me

44
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:36,322
in front of the people
who are precious to me.

45
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,200
That's why I like it the most.

46
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,662
In a way, I think I became an artist
to be able to do concerts.

47
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,039
It was to that extent.

48
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,377
"Artists equal concerts,"
was a concept embedded in my head.

49
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:52,797
{\an8}First of all, back when we...

50
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,716
{\an8}Back when we had our first concert,

51
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:59,470
we never imagined
we would have a concert this big.

52
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,682
I didn't realize BTS
had gotten this successful.

53
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,184
It was overwhelming.

54
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,644
We were feeling every one of the emotions

55
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,606
we'd felt along the way all at once.

56
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,483
Our first concert
was during <i>The Red Bullet Tour.</i>

57
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,319
I think it was at Melon-AX.

58
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,779
{\an8}I'm so thankful that we've become

59
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,574
{\an8}artists who can hold concerts.

60
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:23,411
I'm so nervous to show ARMY
a performance they've never seen before.

61
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:28,541
Which new performance
do you think they'll like the most?

62
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,294
Maybe <i>Rain.</i> No, I think <i>Blanket Kick.</i>

63
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,005
I have a feeling
they'll really like <i>Blanket Kick.</i>

64
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,090
- Our leader should say something.
- Do I just go for it?

65
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,176
Let's do our best
for our first-ever concert.

66
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,053
- Bangtan, Bangtan. Bang Bangtan!
- Bang Bangtan!

67
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:50,647
<i>♪ Let's jump! Throw your hands up
and shout everyone jumpin' up ♪</i>

68
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:54,067
It was our first-ever concert
with our own music.

69
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,486
We weren't in a situation
to be picky about

70
00:03:56,486 --> 00:04:01,449
how many hundreds or thousands
of people were attending.

71
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:04,452
We were just so thankful for the fans

72
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,996
who came to see us.

73
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,831
- I'm exhausted.
- That was fun.

74
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,750
- Wow.
- Good job, everyone.

75
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,085
Good job, everyone!

76
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,463
So at that moment,

77
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,424
when we achieved the goal of performing
at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena,

78
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,719
it felt like we were in a panorama.

79
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,806
It was a visual of what we had done

80
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,641
or what we had experienced
to get this far.

81
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,561
{\an8} You can brag about us

82
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:35,692
{\an8}when we continue to grow and become
a more incredible version of BTS.

83
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,364
{\an8} We just have to do it again.

84
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,409
At a place this big.

85
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:49,122
{\an8} I was never an obedient kid,

86
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,834
but I'm happy to be here
in front of so many ARMY

87
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,044
and performing for you all.

88
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,596
No, don't cry.

89
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:14,522
I'm so thankful that you made it possible

90
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,774
for us to perform in such a big arena.

91
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:21,863
I think there were a lot of times
when I couldn't control my emotions.

92
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,949
As our songs
matched my emotions,

93
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,994
the view in front of my eyes

94
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,539
and the moment itself
were just so precious.

95
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,584
I remember singing <i>2! 3!</i>

96
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,878
in Gocheok Sky Dome.

97
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,964
I was really emotional then.

98
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,645
<i>♪ Been trying to tell you this ♪</i>

99
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,565
<i>♪ I was supposed to tell you this ♪</i>

100
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,444
<i>♪ This is all for you ♪</i>

101
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,529
<i>♪ 'Let's only walk on flower paths' ♪</i>

102
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,740
We wanted to dedicate a song to our fans

103
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,409
and that's how we came up with

104
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:11,662
<i>2! 3! (Still Wishing
There Will Be Better Days)</i>

105
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,082
but it's not easy to listen to.

106
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,043
It was a record of that time.

107
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:22,382
{\an8}My panic disorder is triggered
whenever a soundtrack is released.

108
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,885
{\an8}Late 2015 and early to mid-2016

109
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,888
were very difficult times for me psychologically.

110
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,807
There was a lot of talk going around.

111
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,935
But after experiencing it once...

112
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:37,355
It's like feeling the most hopeless
on a day I should be the happiest.

113
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,400
I can't go on the Internet
on the day a song drops.

114
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,859
I hear that we got a good response,

115
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,320
that we placed high in the charts,
and everything but...

116
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,280
I just...

117
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,575
freeze in fear of criticism.

118
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,578
<i>♪ When I say one-two-three,
forget it all ♪</i>

119
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,164
<i>♪ Erase all the sad memories ♪</i>

120
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,543
<i>♪ Take my hand and smile ♪</i>

121
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:02,463
There was a strong negative view
of idols at that time.

122
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:05,383
Nowadays, we are acknowledged

123
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,761
for our achievements
and performances overseas.

124
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:13,891
But it was a really agonizing time
for us back then.

125
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,102
We had a lot of
unreasonable controversies.

126
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,980
Our fans will know what I'm talking about,

127
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,024
but having to deny the bad rumors
was always so upsetting.

128
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,902
We suffered
because of this for years.

129
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:29,323
We were getting desperate and spiteful,
and our fans were the same.

130
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:33,453
So we wanted to say,
"On three, let's forget it all."

131
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,204
<i>♪ On one-two-three ♪</i>

132
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:38,207
<i>♪ May everything change ♪</i>

133
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,585
<i>♪ Here's to better days ♪</i>

134
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,671
<i>♪ Because we are together ♪</i>

135
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:48,384
It's a song that contains the stories
of our fans along with other things.

136
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,803
People who don't know its meaning

137
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:54,182
may consider it a very sad song.

138
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,477
And it was even sadder
when our fans sang it.

139
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,146
It's quite different.

140
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:04,942
Other artists have these
pretty songs dedicated to their fans.

141
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:08,905
The lyrics just fit the times.

142
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,365
I saw people crying as we sang it.

143
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,910
Seeing them crying so hard in front of us

144
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,995
made me cry too.

145
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,164
They understand what kind of song it is.

146
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,876
Occasionally, I realize the weight
of being in the spotlight.

147
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,753
So that's when I think,

148
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:27,048
"How sincere should I be?"

149
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,760
"How many people
will accept my sincerity as it is

150
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:34,514
- if I'm 100% honest about everything?"

151
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,974
It's a fear of mine.
I'm very scared about it.

152
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:38,976
"What if people belittle me

153
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:44,065
for being weak if I express my struggles,
my sorrows, and my sincerity?"

154
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,901
Thinking back, it felt unfair and sad.

155
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:51,531
But I think this kind of dynamic
enables a fandom to grow.

156
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,950
I think the immunity
we acquired at the time

157
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,703
was what shaped us and ARMY.

158
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,790
{\an8}They showed that the artists
knew about the pain and sadness

159
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,416
{\an8}the fandom was experiencing.

160
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,919
I believe it was
the completion and the start

161
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:10,007
of a huge community
of the fandom and the artists.

162
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,426
I think the completion
of this large community

163
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:17,390
was the starting point for the stories
of the "ARMY phenomenon."

164
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,809
<i>♪ ...be more good days ahead ♪</i>

00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,377
Look over here, please.

172
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,006
-  And the award goes to...

173
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:56,304
The other nominees had won
many awards at other awards ceremonies.

174
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:59,390
So we thought,
"There's no chance of winning this one."

175
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,808
But we had a glimmer of hope.

176
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,644
The Artist of the Year
was our last chance.

177
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,524
-  BTS.

178
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,192
Congratulations.

179
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,660
There were...

180
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,246
a lot of things that happened
since our debut.

181
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:26,709
And there were many, many people
who said we wouldn't make it.

182
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,587
We thank you all so much
for believing in us to the end.

183
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,048
I had been holding on
to threadbare hope.

184
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,507
Then we received the award.

185
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,092
I cried.

186
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,471
I think all seven of us cried.

187
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,433
Right before <i>WINGS</i> was released...

188
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,893
Before the album was released,

189
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:47,188
Namjoon and I cried so much
while talking to each other.

190
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,816
As we watched the awards ceremonies

191
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:54,945
before our debut,

192
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,990
we always wondered when we would debut
and receive an award.

193
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,992
During 2011 and 2012,

194
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,244
we would always watch
the MAMA Awards at home.

195
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,455
In truth, the Artist of the Year...

196
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:08,459
is the best award of the year.

197
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:12,004
Artist of the Year meant
we had come in first place that year.

198
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,048
That's what we believed.

199
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:17,468
We said to ourselves, "We did it."

200
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,720
Thanks, guys. Thank you so much.

201
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,639
I love you all so much.

202
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,016
If this were a movie,
this would be its ending scene.

203
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,310
Right? In a movie,

204
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,854
the credits would start rolling.

205
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,482
At that point,
we'd done everything we could

206
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:32,817
as Korean artists.

207
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,654
But then, they wanted us to go to the US.

208
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,656
{\an8}- Si-Hyuk.
- The Billboard Music Awards!

209
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,700
{\an8}- My heart is racing.

210
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,784
{\an8}Am I the only one?

211
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,160
-  Were we invited?
- Yes.

212
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,745
Didn't I tell you last time?

213
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,039
- It should be so much fun...
- We're going.

214
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,792
- We'll go and...
- What if it's over after we perform?

215
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,168
Let's pray for real.

216
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,589
- Thank you!
- Good luck.

217
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:56,757
Enjoy the concert!

218
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:57,967
- The Billboard...
- Thank you!

219
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,385
- Yeah, Billboard!
- Thank you!

220
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,553
Let's go.

221
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,888
Do you think we'll make it?
Probably not, right?

222
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:06,350
At the time, there wasn't much
to say or think but, "Wow!"

223
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,352
"Will we receive an award if we go?"

224
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,146
"Isn't that why they've asked us to come?"

225
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,648
Then someone would say,
"It's not like that in the US."

226
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,442
"You may go there
just to sightsee and come back."

227
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,485
We went after that kind of talk.

228
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:24,326
They made their presence known
not only in the K-pop market

229
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,412
but in the Western pop market as well.

230
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,998
I think we believed that

231
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:32,626
{\an8}we needed to show the objective indicators

232
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:36,005
{\an8}K-pop acts could create

233
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,508
and move on to the next steps
of the process.

234
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,806
I know I've said it before,

235
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:49,059
but I'm so nervous about
going to the Billboard Music Awards.

236
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:54,899
Are you excited about going?

237
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,194
- Are you nervous?
- Yes.

238
00:12:58,736 --> 00:12:59,737
Of course, I'm nervous.

239
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,322
You did say
that you were really nervous.

240
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,908
- I'm so nervous, I'm spilling my food.
-  You're spilling a lot.

241
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:15,169
{\an8} BTS! BTS! BTS!

242
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,551
Las Vegas.

243
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:23,886
Las Vegas.

244
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,221
It's my first time in Las Vegas.

245
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,430
Should we go to a casino?

246
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,392
- I wouldn't know what to do.
- You want to lose everything?

247
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,728
- The one thing we... Or I wanted to do...
- I really wouldn't know.

248
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,564
...when visiting Las Vegas
was to go shopping.

249
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,733
But I forgot my wallet. Yay!

250
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,819
{\an8}"K-pop boy band BTS,

251
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,237
{\an8}welcome to the BBMAs."

252
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,988
When they say this, you all say...

253
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,573
Thanks!

254
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,659
- We're so excited.
- Yeah.

255
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,077
- Yeah.
- Yes.

256
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,038
We're waiting to make
our red carpet entrance.

257
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,250
We'll be on the red carpet
in just 30 minutes.

258
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,627
Billboard.

259
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,840
I don't get nervous often,
but I'm nervous being here.

260
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,092
Aren't you just saying that
because we're being filmed?

261
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,720
Let's try not to exhaust ourselves.

262
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,848
Hang in there for today.

263
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,683
- It may be hard, but...
- Would we get exhausted?

264
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:30,744
"Who are they?"

265
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,372
"They're an idol group
I've never heard of."

266
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,208
"I don't know why they're so popular."

267
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,962
We became a hot topic for that reason.

268
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:45,634
And I believe that was all due
to the ARMY's cheers and support for us

269
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,511
during those events and appearances.

270
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,180
A lot of our fans are here.

271
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,640
That's why I'm more nervous.

272
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,144
About two years ago,

273
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:59,189
I had a dream that went just like this.
That we were all together...

274
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:02,985
It felt like we were
starting something new again.

275
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:07,907
We were doubting whether these people
were actually doing this for us.

276
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:12,453
I'm not sure. I actually wonder
what it would have been like

277
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,706
if we were a team
that was a bit more culturally proficient.

278
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,875
I think being a little clumsy

279
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,835
was quite charming.

280
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:23,505
- Why do I suddenly need the bathroom?
- No, you can't go now.

281
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:26,091
- This is really nerve-racking.
- We're up next.

282
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,427
Why is it so nerve-racking?

283
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,720
Whoo!

284
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,848
{\an8}And the Billboard Music Award goes to...

285
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,935
{\an8}- BTS!
- BTS!

286
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,234
The Top Social Artist award.

287
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:48,489
It was the start of raising people's
awareness of us as the group BTS.

288
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,035
{\an8}Please, ARMY. Remember what we say,

289
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,912
{\an8}"Love myself, love yourself."

290
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,081
We love you all so much. Thank you.

291
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,749
We'll work to become a better BTS.

292
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,543
{\an8}-  "The Top Social Artist."
-"...Social Artist."

293
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,838
{\an8}-"Billboard Music Award... BTS!"
-"...Music Award."

294
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:05,923
Whoo!

295
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,468
I was really flustered when we got it.

296
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,221
To be honest, we didn't even know

297
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,723
what a "Top Social Artist Award"
was at the time.

298
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,226
So we were really flustered
when we got it.

299
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,603
We didn't think of it
as the start of anything.

300
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,355
The artist, Justin Bieber, at the time...

301
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,399
Was it seven years? Ten?

302
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,859
He had received the award
for many consecutive years.

303
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:29,488
We believed this would make a big impact.

304
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,199
So everyone was excited

305
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,952
about moving on to the next stage
of the process.

306
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:38,539
Social media became a huge thing
all over the world,

307
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:42,376
and BTS became
a global sensation through it.

308
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:45,421
They weren't aware of it at first,
but the Western music industry

309
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,506
began to understand that

310
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:51,010
there was a huge public opinion about BTS
and a huge movement taking place.

311
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,428
Introduce yourselves, hello.

312
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,554
{\an8} Nice to meet you.

313
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,305
{\an8}I wanted... So let's do some music together.

314
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,974
{\an8}- Of course. We're more than willing to.
- Yeah.

315
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:01,437
{\an8}I've got beats.
And also, if you have an open hook idea.

316
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,356
{\an8}If you have a hook,
I can start writing to that hook.

317
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,484
{\an8}We can do the verses afterward.

318
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:10,112
{\an8}I just need a hook to write
a melody or something.

319
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,782
He said he'd create
the verses and other stuff

320
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:17,202
if we came up with a hook to give him.

321
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,747
I just joined BTS.

322
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,498
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, are you okay?

323
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,750
- Let's go.
- Okay.

324
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,879
One, two, three.
Over here again. One, two, three.

325
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:43,145
{\an8}-  You've also remixed BTS's...
-  <i>MIC Drop.</i>

326
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,646
{\an8} Yeah,
and you went gold, right?

327
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:45,814
{\an8} Yeah, we went gold with <i>MIC Drop.</i>

328
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,150
{\an8}Which is... I mean,
in two months, we went gold.

329
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,111
{\an8}- I mean, that's incredible.
- Which is crazy at this time, you know?

330
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:54,073
{\an8}Like the way people
listen to music. It's different.

331
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,034
{\an8}People are watching online.
People are streaming.

332
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:00,454
{\an8}And the people are demanding the song.
They love <i>MIC Drop.</i>

333
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,379
Our rating was going up,

334
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:13,759
so I thought,
"Is it a one-time token award?"

335
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,803
But suddenly, we went...

336
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,180
...to the AMAs.

337
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,266
<i>♪ My bad BILLBOARD
My bad WORLDWIDE ♪</i>

342
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,410
We are finally

343
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,665
able to perform at the AMAs.

344
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,709
- We're on our way now.
<i>- ♪ Only you have it ♪</i>

345
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,556
We're really thankful for the many fans

346
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,432
- who showed up for us. We didn't know.
- Yes, that's right.

347
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,893
I think I'm going to be so excited
when the fans cheer for us

348
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,061
during our performance.

349
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:07,646
-  Hey!
- Khalid!

350
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,730
I like you.

351
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,607
- Hey.
- Hey, bro.

352
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,652
How are you guys feeling?
Are you nervous or excited?

353
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,404
- We're excited.
- Yes, excited.

354
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,488
Kind of nervous, but...

355
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,823
- Kind of nervous?
- Yeah, man.

356
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:21,368
No, they'll always... They will love you.

357
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:23,912
BTS and the AMA.

358
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,247
- Bang Bangtan! Bangtan!
- Bangtan!

359
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,331

- All right!

360
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:30,419
BTS! BTS! BTS!

361
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:36,550
BTS! BTS! BTS!

362
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,135
I don't know how we made it this far.

363
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,808
Making their US TV debut.

364
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,769

In game terms,
it was like we were leveling up.

370
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,288
We got more experience
and became stronger.

371
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,998
We acquired new skills,

372
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,209
and those skills were more showy.

373
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,669
It was an enjoyable feeling.

Wow, the meat looks incredible.

377
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,985
It really looks like foreign meat.

378
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,488
- The cooking gloves...
- Ooh!

379
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,907
- Do you need a cutting board?
- This...

380
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,870
-  Kimchi would be awesome.
- Spaghetti in the US.

381
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,789
Can I get a plate, please?

382
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,625
Is this the seasoning?

383
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,878
To our successful tour
in North and South Americas.

384
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,630
- Bangtan, Bangtan. Bang Bangtan!
- Bang Bangtan!

385
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,674
- Congrats!
- Cheers!

386
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,300
I didn't think we would yell
"Bang Bangtan!" here too.

387
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,845
I think it was a year
filled with laughter and happiness.

388
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,765
We kept smiling and laughing.

389
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,060
We made a lot of celebratory toasts too.

390
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,730
We ate delicious food
and had vacations in between schedules.

391
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,816
We were really, really happy.

392
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,235
We had fans who liked us too.

393
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,821
I think we enjoyed all those moments.

394
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:24,658
I think we just shared
a lot of memories

395
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,618
with ARMY, ourselves,

396
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:30,163
and our company staff.

397
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:34,668
So it's a very unforgettable moment.

398
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,878
- It's your first time, right?
- This is your first time, right?

399
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,423
I was too busy trying to drink it,
let alone pop it.

400
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,841
- Here I go.
- Let's go.

401
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,010
- Pop.

402
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,386
Oh, come on!

403
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,389
- Seriously, come on.

404
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,727
Yay, Bangtan! Let's keep doing our best.

405
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,062
- How uncool.
- Yes, let's do our best going forward.

406
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,564
- So uncool.
- Let's do our best.

407
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,233
- That was uncool.
- Let's do our chant.

408
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,610
- Bang Bangtan. Bangtan!
- Bangtan!

409
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,195
Let's keep doing our best.

410
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:03,613
Let's stay strong.

411
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,659
{\an8}-  Hello.
- Hello, Si-Hyuk.

412
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,119
{\an8} Hello.

413
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,288
I'm honored
that Billboard artists like you

414
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,998
have made time to attend my meeting.

415
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,666
-  It's an honor.
- Is this the first since Billboard?

416
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,168
- Yes, it's the first.
- It really is.

417
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,630
The world's top idol group.

418
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,425
- Oh, man.
- Can we edit this out?

419
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,260
- This is just the beginning.
- That's right.

420
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,471
Yes, that's also a reason
why I'm here.

421
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:28,847
- The main point is that...
- We can't look past it.

422
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,766
...you should never forget
your love for music

423
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,893
and appreciation for your fans.

424
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,895
- That's the biggest point.
- We could never forget.

425
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,606
I really want you to keep that in mind.

426
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,275
But there's one more thing I want to say.

427
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:43,695
I've been thinking to myself these days

428
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,447
after sending you on tour.

429
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:50,035
It's been less than six months since we
decided to answer the calling for K-pop,

430
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,996
and so many roads have opened for us.

431
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:56,708
You can make bigger wishes
since everything is going so well,

432
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,795
but I think our goal next year

433
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:04,633
should be to find ways to be happy.

434
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:09,304
It's something that no other superstar
in the world has ever done.

435
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,681
I'm not sure if it's something
you can accomplish by trying.

436
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,975
Not a lot of superstars have good endings.

437
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:17,145
Many of them become depressed
or develop social phobias.

438
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,232
I'm really worried that
you will become unhappy

439
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,734
if you continue to live like this.

440
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,986
You all started this simply
because music made you happy.

441
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:27,697
- Yes. We've also talked about this.
- Yes, we did.

442
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,908
I wondered all the time

443
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,202
- if this is how life should be.
- You're right.

444
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:35,205
I think all of us
have wondered this as well.

445
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:38,792
It may come as a surprise for onlookers
if you think about it.

446
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:42,212
You may wonder why I would have
such an epiphany at a moment like this.

447
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,798
But I think it's very important.

448
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,342
I believe people in management

449
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,219
should think about it.

450
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,721
At a certain point,
it's more important for an artist

451
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:55,642
to have autonomy and be happy as a person.

452
00:23:56,726 --> 00:24:02,023
We had many discussions on
whether to renew our contracts or not.

453
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:05,986
The company wanted us
to renew our contracts.

454
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:09,448
It wasn't a bad proposal for us.

455
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,576
But the members had differing opinions.

456
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:13,827
All of us...

457
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:18,498
had thought a lot about quitting.

458
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:21,877
We felt a lot of pressure
from it all. And we were scared.

459
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,962
There was no one to ask for advice.

460
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,756
Jung Kook and I talked and cried together.

461
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,718
I talked and cried with Hobi too.

462
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:33,430
We shed a lot of tears during that time.

463
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:37,267
We didn't know
we'd attract a lot of attention

464
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,394
when we debuted.

465
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:42,063
I don't like garnering
so much attention,

466
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:44,024
and it's hard psychologically.

467
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,902
I don't have the confidence
to endure this pressure.

468
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:50,572
No one else knows about it

469
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,741
except the seven of us.

470
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:56,077
Because of that,

471
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:59,623
everything that had piled up exploded.

472
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:04,377
We really didn't want to do anything.

473
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:33,198
I was suffering
from burnout at the time.

474
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,534
I was listless after performances.

475
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,452
Every day was a struggle.

476
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,459
I can't get used to it.

477
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:48,588
It just...

478
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,885
It felt like we were constantly running

479
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:57,138
and walking without a destination.

480
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:02,185
It feels like we've compacted
20 years' worth of experiences

481
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:05,522
into our six to seven years of experience.

482
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:09,442
So we were pretty exhausted.
We were way past our limits.

483
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,153
"Will there ever be an end
if we continue?"

484
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,823
Everyone was having a hard time

485
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,867
due to these thoughts.

486
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:21,079
We seriously considered quitting.

487
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:26,543
We didn't think this fame
was a scale we could handle.

488
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,475
I think this part
hurts more than the fall itself.

489
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,938
- Holding ice against the injury...
-  We need the swelling to subside.

490
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,482
Should we make changes to the cue sheet?

491
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:53,695
I don't think it matters.
We're losing energy regardless.

492
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:58,491
It was so hard to see
the other members like this.

493
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:01,661
Si-Hyuk asked us
if we wanted to just rest for six months.

494
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:04,122
We weren't sure if that was the right call

495
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,749
since we were finally doing well.

496
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:10,337
As the head of a management company,

497
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:13,131
I actively tried to make the best decision

498
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,885
from the perspective of an artist.

499
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,638
I'd say, "How can they work
if they're struggling?"

500
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,306
"Their happiness is most important."

501
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,016
My biggest issue was thinking

502
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,393
that we were leaving
without being able to enjoy everything.

503
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,354
Is this the end?

504
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,022
It was unfair in my opinion.

505
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,274
Why are we being like this
after working so hard

506
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,777
for seven to eight years
to build this foundation?

507
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,739
There was uncertainty about
whether it was going to work out.

508
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:40,408
I repeatedly asked
if they didn't think it was unfair.

509
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:44,621
{\an8} We started at AX-KOREA.

510
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,374
We conquered the Olympic Gymnastics Arena

511
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,085
and came to Gocheok Sky Dome.

512
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:54,673
I feel very strange.
Today is a really good day.

513
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,008
We should be
talking about good things, but...

514
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,887
This all started with us
wanting to share our music.

515
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,641
But now, five years later,

516
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,017
those things...

517
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:14,567
It's like the moment
right before a couple breaks up.

518
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:17,654
Both of them know it's going to happen.

519
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:21,449
But no one wants to be the bad guy,

520
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,660
so it felt like we were
pushing the responsibility over.

521
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,287
We eventually had to make a choice.

522
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,915
If any one of us makes that choice,

523
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:31,793
that person becomes the bad guy.

524
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,462
It felt like that's why
we couldn't bring ourselves to do it.

525
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:51,146
The next song, <i>Fake Love,</i> came out.
And it was very meaningful in many ways.

526
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,856
It's a song full of desperation

527
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,774
with acting and masks.

528
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:58,153
I was really skinny at the time
because I was having a hard time.

529
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,823
There was no time to consider
and discuss any divided opinions.

530
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,701
I wasn't able to take care of myself,

531
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,411
so I could only focus on
my difficult situation.

532
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:09,456
I was affected by the flow
of things and had a hard time.

533
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,540
I got hurt too.

534
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,126
I think it was a difficult time
to be with one another.

535
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:22,177
I was so tired
of my work and everything,

536
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:25,180
so I think I wanted to stop for a moment.

537
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:30,226
I really wanted to quit
and just rest at the time.

538
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:33,271
We should destroy it ourselves
since we built it.

539
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,940
That's what we need to do to live.

540
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,443
That's how we'll be able to live.

541
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,998
<i>We experienced puberty
on how to face difficult situations.</i>

542
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,374
<i>From the plane to the hotel,</i>

543
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,543
<i>to the concert hall,
then back to the plane.</i>

544
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:56,628
I went outside for a bit,

545
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,505
but all I did was eat.
There was nothing to do.

546
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,590
<i>I know we can't do anything
about the situation we're in, but...</i>

547
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,634
<i>It wasn't satisfying,
mentally or emotionally.</i>

548
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,386
The global press conference for
<i>7.</i>

549
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:08,014
Since we're all gathered here,
I'll hurry up and give you the news.

550
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:11,434
We have a concert
this coming April.

551
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,144
This really is
beyond our control.

552
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:17,440
I'm sure ARMY is looking forward to it.

553
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,108
Due to COVID-19...

554
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:21,152
We look forward to it as well.

555
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,363
- The April concert has been canceled.

556
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:26,366
<i>It felt like I had lost
a really big part of something I enjoyed.</i>

557
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,993
<i>I guess I can say
it felt really unfair at first.</i>

558
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,501
