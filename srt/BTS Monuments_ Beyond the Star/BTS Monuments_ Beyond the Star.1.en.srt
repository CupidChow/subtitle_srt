1
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,314
Um...

2
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,151
Basically, we're very excited

3
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:29,029
and really happy for this project.

4
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,532
To be... to be part of this project, um...

5
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,243
So the interesting thing is that

6
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:38,121
this moment, today, now,

7
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,915
is the first connect for the big connect.

8
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,335
So I'm very happy and, um...

9
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:45,420
I've...

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,380
We've been hearing so many words that...

11
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,216
Many people still say, um,

12
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,427
"This world doesn't need art,"

13
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:55,680
and "Art cannot change the world at all."

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,683
Or you know,
some very bad words like that, but...

15
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,560
We, um...

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,270
I think this is very challenging,

17
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:06,066
and this is a big challenge
for, like, every one of us, um, we.

18
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,736
For the different genres
and different worlds of artists.

19
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,820
And...

20
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,199
But the same thing is that
we still believe

21
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:17,577
in the power of art
that it can help and change the world.

22
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:21,372
So, um, as we connect, as like, together,

23
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:26,044
I hope that even more and more people
could believe in the power of art,

24
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,756
any kinds or any genres of art,

25
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,509
that it could help
and still change the world.

26
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,778
What's the occasion?

27
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,279
We're making a comeback.

28
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,509
Why do you think this group of yours

29
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,636
is a global sensation?

30
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,639
Um, you know, there could be many reasons.

31
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,852
But, you know, all the members.
They're so cute and attractive.

32
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,689
But you know,
the most important thing is that,

33
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,525
you know,
music truly transcends languages,

34
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,611
- nationalities, and races, right?

35
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,613
And you guys know this, right?

36
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,574
- Yeah, you feel it.

37
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,879
<i>They have made</i>
TIME Magazine's <i>"Most Influential" list.</i>

38
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,757
<i>They're the first Korean act to reach
number one on the Billboard charts.</i>

39
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,177
And they just became the first group
since The Beatles

40
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,346
to earn three number-one albums
in less than a year.

41
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,848
BTS.

42
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,061
My name's V.

43
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,938
Um, I'm a good boy.

44
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,821
<i>We have great news
for all BTS fans across the world.</i>

45
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,157
<i>Kicking off in April, the K-pop superstars</i>

46
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,911
<i>have announced that they will be going
on another world tour.</i>

47
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,747
{\an8}<i>The</i> MAP OF THE SOUL <i>tour
will start in Seoul,</i>

48
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:29,209
{\an8}<i>followed by 17 cities across 7 countries</i>

49
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,045
{\an8}<i>in Asia, North America, and Europe.</i>

50
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:40,053
It's finally moving!

51
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,096
- Oh, my god!

52
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,306
Two! Two!

53
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,807
One! One! One! One!

54
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,517
Sit tight, we're securing
your Verified Tickets...

55
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,644
You Got 'Em.
Let the Anticipation Begin.

56
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,190
The April concert has been canceled.

57
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,399
- No way.

58
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,193
What about the people who got tickets?

59
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,486
Due to COVID-19...

60
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,570
Wait, really?

61
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,947
This really is beyond our control.

62
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,698
- There's no way around it.
-  Don't tell me...

63
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,033
After the COVID-19 outbreak,

64
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,744
there were only
very pessimistic articles at first.

65
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,080
"We don't know
how many years this will last."

66
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,123
"We need to go into lockdown."

67
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:13,253
"Concerts may never be held again.
People are unable to gather."

68
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:17,131
I was in despair
as I listened to such news.

69
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:21,761
I completely let go
of the thought of having a concert.

70
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,931
I began to wonder
if there was any point in releasing music.

71
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,891
To be honest, it was difficult.
Very difficult.

72
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,442
<i>The arts industry
has come to a complete stop</i>

73
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:39,112
<i>as the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases
hits a new high every day.</i>

74
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,739
<i>The theater visited
by a confirmed COVID-19 patient</i>

75
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,491
<i>has suspended operations.</i>

76
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,243
<i>The events of Korean Wave stars,</i>

77
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,870
<i>which attract great crowds,
were also directly affected.</i>

78
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,956
<i>There are signs
of the spread of infectious disease.</i>

79
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,834
<i>The entire arts industry
continues to be concerned.</i>

80
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,472
The last two years...

81
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,559
were really frustrating.

82
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,437
I lost myself in deep thought.

83
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,732
I couldn't organize my thoughts that well
during that time

84
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,568
because I was anxious about not knowing
when we'd be able to meet again.

85
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,238
In those two years,

86
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:25,158
my personality and thoughts

87
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,868
have changed a lot.

88
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,870
On one hand,

89
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,082
it was a time that allowed me
to change and grow as a person.

90
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,126
Nothing changed.

91
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:39,088
No matter how depressed I was
or how hard of a time I was having,

92
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,549
it didn't change reality.

93
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,302
In the end, time passes

94
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,928
and life continues.

95
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,014
That's how I lived on.

96
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,725
I told myself I had to do something
in the meantime,

97
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,394
so I worked on music or practiced dancing.

98
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,729
That's just...

99
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,898
how I lived on.

100
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,901
But in a way, that was the driving force.

101
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,871
We were all very sad.

102
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,458
But something good

103
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,544
still came with all the bad.

104
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:35,436
I guess I wasn't completely aware of
how important music and dancing was to me.

105
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:39,399
I realized
that I shouldn't take it all for granted.

106
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,236
- I think I would have been happy

107
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,029
even if I wasn't in this line of work,

108
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,406
but I think I would've failed.

109
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:50,368
You can develop yourself in this industry,

110
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:53,538
and we can create something
that'll satisfy the fans.

111
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:59,419
This work has thankfully allowed me
such opportunities.

112
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,046
I really hoped we can meet soon.

113
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:05,508
I wanted to perform,
and I missed ARMY too.

114
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,553
I wanted to go to the airport,
which I used to despise so much.

115
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,305
These things make me happy,

116
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:14,475
and I think
that's why I put in so much effort.

117
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:18,479
It was a difficult time globally,

118
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,483
but many people, including us,

119
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,610
were able to use that time
to look back on themselves.

120
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,446
I think it was

121
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:31,742
a time meant to study ourselves again.

122
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,327
Namjoon and I talked a lot

123
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:37,206
about how we needed to organize
our thoughts over the years

124
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,377
pertaining to our reasons
for doing what we do,

125
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:45,840
how we feel, and what we want to do.

126
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,136
This is the first time

127
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:54,015
I've affiliated myself with something

128
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,600
for 11 years of my life.

129
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,604
Some of the memories that I'd forgotten
come to mind during the interviews.

130
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,439
An exploration of myself?

131
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,026
I'm genuinely happy when I do this.

132
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:09,405
Music was so much fun for me back then.

133
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:13,868
It was something fun to do
instead of studying.

134
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,453
I realized that such a world exists.

135
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,791
- Is that it?
- Yes.

136
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,013
Let's huddle up and do our chant.

137
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,182
- Let's do it.
- Jung Kook.

138
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,725
- Don't be too loud.
- Stand up.

139
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:38,851
Stand up, Jung Kook.

140
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,603
We can't be loud?

141
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,729
We start at exactly eight o'clock, right?

142
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,314
Yes, that's right.

143
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,398
Bangtan, Bangtan.

144
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:45,566
Bang Bangtan!

145
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:48,861
A lot of people know this story,
but one day, our producer Pdogg

146
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,573
played a demo by Namjoon,
and I was really shocked.

147
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:57,662
I really believed that someone like him
needed to debut no matter what.

148
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,211
We originally weren't supposed to be
an idol group.

149
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,089
Si-Hyuk actually wanted
to make us into a crew.

150
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,800
A crew with rappers and producers.

151
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,219
RM was the first member of the team.

152
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,929
They said it was supposed to be a group

153
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:18,516
that only did hip-hop and rap
with RM as the center member.

154
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,937
<i>♪ What's the life
that you've been dreaming of ♪</i>

155
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:26,524
<i>♪ Who do you see now in the mirror
I gotta say ♪</i>

156
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,402
<i>♪ Find your own path

157
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,572
<i>♪ At least, do something
Put any weakness aside ♪</i>

158
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,199
I think they planned on
making a hip-hop team.

159
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:38,327
But they realized it wasn't the way to go
in the middle of the process.

160
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,538
And after countless member changes,

161
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,624
we became the current BTS.

162
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:48,045
<i>♪ Hey, man, what's your dream? ♪</i>

163
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,797
I guess

164
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,799
they needed someone like me
who could dance.

165
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,594
That's when everyone started to dance.

166
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,387
I came at the right time.

167
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,223
I practiced with everyone,
and we spent time together.

168
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:03,978
Jung Kook, Jimin, Taehyung, and I
were the last ones to join.

169
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,355
And that's how the final BTS came to be.

170
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:09,108
<i>♪ Is that all is that all all ♪</i>

171
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,780
<i>♪ To all the youth without dreams ♪</i>

172
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:19,035
In Namjoon's case,
I was surprised when I heard his demo.

173
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,244
But I was also surprised

174
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:25,416
by the depth of his character
and his knowledge base

175
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,001
when I met him.

176
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,670
As for Yoongi, I was drawn
to his unique sarcastic nature

177
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,505
and somewhat dark side.

178
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,466
And I still like this side of him.

179
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:38,387
I believed that it was essential
to have someone like him on the team.

180
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:41,766
And he wasn't someone who would
act out his nature in a negative way.

181
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,810
Hoseok was very memorable
in the practice room.

182
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,396
He can be considered
the personification of diligence.

183
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,483
He's a very sincere
and earnest individual.

184
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,901
As for Jin...

185
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,153
I mean, he calls himself
"worldwide handsome."

186
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,989
But I was really surprised
that such a handsome person could exist.

187
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:01,702
I believed that as a member
of a K-pop idol group,

188
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,747
he could at least help bring in
and create some kind of fandom.

189
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,083
In Jung Kook's case,

190
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,710
he wasn't very confident in himself.

191
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,631
So he wasn't able to show off
everything he had.

192
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:17,426
I had a strong conviction
that he had a lot of potential

193
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:21,347
but hadn't been able
to express it just yet.

194
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,890
Taehyung's charms,

195
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,352
talents, and looks were very different
when he was younger.

196
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:30,606
I had strong confidence
in his potential as well.

197
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,608
Jimin was a very interesting case.

198
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:36,320
He's a very charming individual
with a lot of talent,

199
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,449
but I was actually quite skeptical
because he seemed incomplete.

200
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:44,537
My team members strongly insisted
that someone like Jimin

201
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,539
needed to be on the team.

202
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,250
I also knew
that my hunches weren't always right.

203
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,212
So I accepted him because I believed
that there was a reason why

204
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,131
they insisted on it so strongly.

205
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,841
Thinking back, it was a close call.

206
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,926
If I had gone against them back then...

207
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:02,304
If I had to point out a difference,
it would be all the blood and sweat

208
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:05,891
we put into the three years
of preparing for our debut.

209
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,519
I'm not sure if you heard it,

210
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,813
- but one of Jimin's parts goes...

211
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:14,150
..."Throw that stone
if you've done as much as I have."

212
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,152
"We go hard."

213
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:19,613
Like that lyric, we worked really hard
preparing for our debut.

214
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,241
Hardship was an expectation at that time.

215
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,326
I wouldn't be able to do it again
if someone asked me to.

216
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:27,121
I would say,
"Let's just stop here for today."

217
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,833
Back then,

218
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,919
staying up all night, going on a diet,

219
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,131
and everything was very hard to do.

220
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:41,260
But they were such a given at the time.

221
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,014
We spent every moment in the practice room
when we weren't eating or sleeping.

222
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,933
Some people may think I'm exaggerating,

223
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,144
but we really lived like that
for about six months.

224
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,480
- Don't get confused.
- Where should we start?

225
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,856
Let's try to do the whole thing.

226
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,531
- That wasn't right.

227
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,494
We would point out our mistakes
frame by frame while monitoring,

228
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,537
so I got really stressed out.

229
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:09,997
I seriously tried to run away.

230
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,332
For real.

231
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:15,461
It was different
from what I had dreamed of.

232
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:19,507
We had to undergo
intense training to learn the dances,

233
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:23,052
which was different from how I had danced.

234
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,806
And I already had a lot of rigid habits.

235
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:31,018
Thankfully, Yoongi and Hoseok stayed

236
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:34,897
since they believed they could communicate
with the public and do their own music.

237
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:38,442
I think taking the form
of a K-pop idol group

238
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:42,863
was the reason why
we were able to come this far.

239
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,076
Do it again.

240
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,996
We filmed the dance for <i>No More Dream</i>
for the first time.

241
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,916
And I still remember
our choreographer telling me,

242
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,461
"I guarantee this moment
will never come again in your lives."

243
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,505
And it didn't.
No matter how hard we tried.

244
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,924
Nice to meet you!

245
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:07,388
These are the people
who will help you release albums

246
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,848
and with other things.

247
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,474
- Yes, sir.
-  There's no need

248
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:13,394
to worry or be too nervous.

249
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,522
Let's do our best
to show them your potential.

250
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,773
Yes, sir!

251
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,859
It was our first time
performing in front of people,

252
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:24,280
and we wanted to appeal to them.

253
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,991
So we'd think we needed
to jump higher and look cooler.

254
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,368
I think that was
all that we could think about at the time.

255
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,328
The album drops in one minute.

256
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,956
- At 12 o'clock.
- It's 12 o'clock!

257
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,250
-"The music video and album..."
-"And album will be released."

258
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,419
Let me see. It's up.

259
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,046
As someone who believed
I had fulfilled my dream

260
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,132
when I became a trainee,

261
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:48,429
I think I was just proud of being known
as "Kim Taehyung, the trainee."

262
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:52,182
First appearance on <i>M Countdown.</i>
The hot debut of BTS!

263
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:55,477
<i>♪ Everywhere I go, everything I do ♪</i>

264
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,771
-  <i>♪ I'll show you... ♪</i>
-  After we debuted

265
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,316
and I saw myself on TV,

266
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,859
I realized that I needed to prepare a lot.

267
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:02,943
Thank you!

268
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,445
Thank you. Thank you.

269
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,989
Good job on our first broadcast.

270
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,949
- Good job.
- An absolute success.

271
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,119
We're trending in first place
in real-time right now.

272
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,830
I'm currently messaging our fans.

273
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:19,960
We had fans who liked us
even when we weren't popular.

274
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,170
It was really nice.

275
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,591
We finally made our debut
on network TV today.

276
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:31,013
It wasn't about how happy I was
about my work.

277
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:34,683
There were people who liked us
for doing this work.

278
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,852
That alone was nice.

279
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,107
{\an8}This is all thanks to you, ARMY.

280
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,447
To... to be honest...

281
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:55,788
To be honest,
I didn't think this was fun in the past.

282
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:59,208
There were a lot of things
we couldn't get started

283
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,502
because we weren't sure
of the path we were on.

284
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:11,637
The days I spent anxious and lost
have passed.

285
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:15,432
And I now stand before you all.

286
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,769
I was happy because of these people,

287
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,855
regardless of whether or not
I was making money.

288
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,608
I thought it was enough just to be happy.

289
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:27,653
I believe I was able
to endure the hardships

290
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,947
because of the happiness
that came from the fans who liked us.

291
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,826
It's such a joy and a dream come true

292
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:38,330
to be able to dance,
make expressions, and act cool.

293
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,624
To be exact,
I met the other members,

294
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:44,753
and they were the ones
who made me want to do this with them.

295
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:49,550
They're the ones who made me realize

296
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,929
that I really wanted to do this
for a living

297
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:57,057
during the year I spent there
after leaving home in 2012.

298
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:00,352
Like one of my lyrics,
I want to etch "Bangtan" really big

299
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,604
on the blank page that is the world.

300
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,774
To my most beloved BTS members,

301
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,986
Rap Monster, SUGA, Jin, V,

302
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,988
Jimin, and Jung Kook,

303
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,783
I love you always. I love you all.

304
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:19,204
They're the people I've been with

305
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,583
and seen the most
in the 30 years of my life.

306
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,502
We've really become a family.

307
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,505
There's no other word
to describe our relationship.

308
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,798
We're family.

309
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:37,765
Can we zoom in more?

310
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,227
Our little Jung Kook is...

311
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,730
We're sending him off to school.

312
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,940
Look. He's over there.

313
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,819
He looks so cute

314
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,113
- standing there.
- Jung Kook, you're so adorable.

315
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,740
He's such an adult at home though.

316
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,789
I want to go to school.

317
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,541
Hey, talk to your friends.

318
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:08,003
-  They're your classmates.
-  Talk to your friends.

319
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,216
- He tried to come here earlier...

320
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,636
He's not talking to his classmates.

321
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,410
We're sorry for throwing a surprise party.

322
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,329
We're sorry for throwing it late too.

323
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,289
We love you, j-hope.

324
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,959
<i>Again, I wish you a happy birthday.</i>

325
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,086
<i>I will pray that all the effort</i>

326
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,171
<i>you put in for your debut will pay off.</i>

327
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:55,467
<i>I wish you a very happy 21st birthday.</i>

328
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,761
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪</i>

329
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,223
- All your makeup is coming off.

330
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,518
- Your tears are falling.

331
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,770
Hey, everyone is crying

332
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,690
- because you're crying.
-  Seriously.

333
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,151
- When will he cry if not today?

334
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,778
Cry as much as you want.
You can cry in my arms.

335
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,739
- I wasn't expecting any of this.

336
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,830
We spent so much time practicing together.

337
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,082
It had been almost two years then.

338
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,460
We had spent
over two years of our lives together.

339
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,047
I had worries
about being in that situation too.

340
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,508
I had my career path to think about.

341
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,553
"Should I look for another company
and debut?"

342
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:43,348
"Or should I go back to my old company

343
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,058
and debut with my friends?"

344
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,686
But the answer was right in front of me.

345
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,981
I trusted the members and went with them.

346
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:56,195
I think doing that made me
feel more comfortable and at ease.

347
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,740
I only thought about the members.

348
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,493
I stayed because of those six members.

349
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:06,747
I went with them,
and it felt like I had found my place.

350
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:13,378
I believe that was
the most fateful moment in my life.

351
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,671
Congratulations, Jung Kook.

352
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,131
Congratulations, Jung Kook.

353
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,883
Our "Golden Maknae," Jeon Jung Kook.

354
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,888
- Congratulations, Rap Monster!

355
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,348
Congratulations to you too.

356
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:31,313
We recalled a lot of special moments
we spent with our fans up until now.

357
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:35,108
Those moments truly are the most precious
and meaningful part of all of this.

358
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:38,987
But in between those moments,
our members would spend time in our van

359
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:43,283
or talk, laugh, and fight
in our living quarters.

360
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,911
I think I reminisce
about those moments more these days.

361
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,081
We've become more tight-knit
because of all that.

362
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,999
I'm so thankful for it all.

363
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,793
And I find it quite fascinating.

364
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,045
- This has been BTS.

365
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,171
One, two, three!

366
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,381
Thank you!

367
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:06,265
{\an8}A group is exiting the van as we speak.

368
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,350
{\an8}- Is it BTS?

369
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:13,480
{\an8}You can just feel the confidence
radiating off of BTS as they enter.

370
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,983
What an amazing appearance...

371
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:19,861
In 2013,
the year when BTS debuted,

372
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:26,660
{\an8}the so-called big agencies
were more influential than they are now.

373
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,955
HYBE wasn't what it is now.

374
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,208
BTS was a small company's idol group.

375
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,211
In other words,
they debuted in a very tough situation.

376
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,256
I don't know. Can we do it?

377
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,258
I might cry if we get it.

378
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,386
We had never received an award before,

379
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,680
so we weren't sure
about what to say if we did get one.

380
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,308
We'd get hopeful thinking,
"Are we getting one or not?"

381
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,268
I'm proud of Namjoon
for getting through the performance.

382
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:54,521
He was probably busy
memorizing people's names.

383
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:58,859
The New Artist of the Year
for the 2013 Melon Music Awards is...

384
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:02,946
BTS.

385
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,073
-  Congratulations.

386
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,784
<i>The New Artist of the Year
for the 2013 Melon Music Awards.</i>

387
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:12,497
<i>This year's new artist created a song
combining sophisticated emotions and...</i>

388
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,916
And BTS! And last but not least, ARMY!

389
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,252
We love you all.

390
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:20,589
We are really thankful
for all your help, patience, and support.

391
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,757
New Artist of the Year!

392
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,635
- New Artist of the Year!

393
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,892
I think we also thought

394
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,478
our lives were going to change somehow.

395
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,939
That's what we thought,
but receiving an award

396
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,400
didn't really change anything.

397
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,071
Today is January 1st,
my first day as an adult.

398
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,574
My life is the same as ever.

399
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,951
The same living quarters
with the same members.

400
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:53,872
The same daily life and schedule.

401
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:59,002
It didn't feel that much different,
so I guess this is...

402
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,338
...what it means to be an adult.

403
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,926
It's a bit bitter.

404
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,178
I'm responsible for everything I do,

405
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,013
and I have obligations now.

406
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,142
I thought I needed
to think for myself, but...

407
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:17,646
We experienced a lot of confusion
by entering society too early.

408
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,440
We could also see our friends
who were still at school

409
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,360
and the things we left behind
by no longer being students.

410
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,072
But we kept running forward.
We needed to do something.

411
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,156
After receiving an award,

412
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:32,119
we were always being compared
to big agencies.

413
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,830
I think we always felt inferior.

414
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,166
I think the beginning of our debut
was harder than before we debuted.

415
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,294
A really talented artist was singing,
and I could hear them

416
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,630
through my in-ear monitor.

417
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:46,842
And they were on another level
compared to me.

418
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:51,680
I felt so small as I listened
and made those comparisons.

419
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,765
We would become physically exhausted.

420
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:58,103
It wasn't a time
when you saw results right away.

421
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,980
But people would say,

422
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,567
"But you still got the New Artist award
at the start of your career."

423
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,027
I'm not sure if it was because
our ambitions were too big

424
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:11,074
or if we just couldn't face reality.

425
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,325
We were so confused.

426
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,915
Oh, <i>Danger?</i>

427
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:21,918
I think all seven of us

428
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:25,088
would pick that time to be
the most difficult time of our lives.

429
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:31,511
That was when we questioned our mindset
of just continuously pushing forward.

430
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:34,973
The traces of the collisions we made
as we pushed forward

431
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,975
suddenly became so clear.

432
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,530
Before that, <i>Boy In Luv</i> was released.

433
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,408
It was a first-place contender
on <i>SBS Inkigayo.</i>

434
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,952
{\an8} <i>This week's winner,
including all the live votes, are...</i>

435
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:57,704
{\an8} <i>Who will it be?</i>

436
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:00,207
We got a good public response.
We wanted to keep it going.

437
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:03,084
This time, we could pull in
some capital from the US.

438
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,128
We wanted to try
and get first place with <i>Danger</i>

439
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,755
since we couldn't do it with <i>Boy In Luv.</i>

440
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:08,632
It was a bold idea.

441
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,386
I'm stepping on US soil.

442
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,472
My goodness!

443
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,953
I'm going on a diet starting tomorrow.

444
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,037
Let's go eat.

445
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,622
You need to eat a lot of vegetables.

446
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,292
I want to go back to Korea.

447
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,377
Taehyung!

448
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,421
I don't want to dance anymore.

449
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,054
We'd film all day,

450
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,139
finish at 10 or 11 p.m.,
and go to the practice room

451
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,933
to practice <i>Danger</i> until 3 or 4 a.m.

452
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,685
We were about to die.

453
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,020
We really couldn't come up
with a melody for <i>Danger,</i>

454
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:08,400
so we spent every spare day
working on it with Si-Hyuk.

455
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,703
<i>♪ Why are you... ♪</i>

456
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:23,081
Ah. I can't come up with more lyrics.
It's stressing me out.

457
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,499
I guess being in LA doesn't guarantee

458
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,167
that I'd come up with the lyrics.

459
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,880
<i>♪ ...anymore ♪</i>

460
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:34,551
<i>♪ Even though I know ♪</i>

461
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,469
This is driving me insane.

462
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,514
<i>♪ You... You're so bold ♪</i>

463
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,099
-  It sounds good.
-  It's nice, right?

464
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,475
<i>♪ You're so bold ♪</i>

465
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,102
How about "Are you kidding me?"

466
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,270
<i>♪ Are you... ♪</i>

467
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,855
<i>♪ Are you kidding me? ♪</i>

468
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,732
- Try emphasizing the "you."

469
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,859
<i>♪ Are you kidding me? ♪</i>

470
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,444
Do it like this.

471
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,945
<i>♪ Are you kidding me? ♪</i>

472
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,614
<i>♪ And can you feel it tonight? ♪</i>

473
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:56,698
-  I got it.
-  It's nice, right?

474
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,950
- Yes, it's good.
-  Let's go with this.

475
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,869
Okay, dismissed.
Go continue brainstorming.

476
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,961
I'm sure a lot of money was spent
on the music video.

477
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:13,173
For the set and everything.
We wanted to succeed.

478
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,925
It felt like the final match
to claim victory.

479
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:18,178
I got the feeling that our company

480
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,889
would be negatively affected
if this didn't go well.

481
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,849
I didn't know
the exact situation at the time,

482
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,893
but I heard that we put our all
into this chance.

483
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,437
<i>♪ You are too bad to me! ♪</i>

484
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,856
<i>♪ Don't get me twisted ♪</i>

485
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,362
But as expected,
we didn't place first

486
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,155
and left the charts in a day.

487
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:40,283
As we plummeted with <i>Danger</i>
after <i>Boy In Luv,</i>

488
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:45,205
the company happened to be suffering
from financial difficulties as well.

489
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:48,541
Ah. It felt like it was the end for us.

490
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,633
The situation was such
that we kept making comparisons

491
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,135
between others and our group.

492
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,012
"How long will I have to live like this?"

493
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:06,935
There were graphs showing how long it took
for other groups to win first place.

494
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,853
It made us impatient.

495
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:20,073
To put it simply,
we were experiencing a burnout.

496
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:23,118
There was no way to explain
the situation back then.

497
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,662
We were just very frustrated.

498
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,969
It's been a while since we debuted,

499
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,012
but our performance dwindled.

500
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:46,433
Everyone was having a hard time
financially and whatnot,

501
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,017
so we had a lot of arguments.

502
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:50,562
Bad situations kept repeating.

503
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,856
I wasn't sure
if this was the music I wanted to do.

504
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:54,649
I was very confused.

505
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,819
This, combined with everything else,

506
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:02,866
led to <i>The Most Beautiful Moment in Life</i>
after much endurance.

507
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:09,289
BTS, The 3rd Mini Album
The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, pt.1

508
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,843
Again, the concept was youth.

509
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,595
I kept tearing up.

510
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:28,933
I cried the most during
<i>The Most Beautiful Moment in Life</i> Series.

511
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,143
I could really relate to it.

512
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,228
We became quite sad
after the School Series ended.

513
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:34,689
The timing just ended up like that.

514
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:38,568
The worries of youth showed up for real.

515
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:42,113
I think those songs do a great job
of explaining our times back then.

516
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,574
So they're very precious albums to me.

517
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,659
<i>I NEED U</i> was different.

518
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:48,745
When I first heard the song, I thought,

519
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,079
"This is it."

520
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,755
This trophy is pretty heavy.

521
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:01,633
We'll remember this weight
and continue to do our best

522
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,134
for the rest of our promotions.

523
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,844
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

524
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:07,180
I was really mentally distressed.

525
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,849
He's crying for everyone else.

526
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:12,977
After winning first place,
I gained a lot of confidence.

527
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,730
So I was able to go strong after that.

528
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:19,192
From the beginning,
they wrote their own stories

529
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:23,196
and revealed what they were going through
in an earnest way.

530
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:26,741
And from then on, they built their stories
through their songs.

531
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,122
Music Bank, 2nd week of January
1st Place, "RUN"

532
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:35,250
I don't think we could've filmed
something like this

533
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,837
if we had given up and just let ourselves
be consumed with dark thoughts.

534
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,047
We also wanted to overcome it.

535
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,132
{\an8}Music Bank, 2nd week of May
1st Place, "FIRE"

536
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,640
Wow.

537
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,100
We got first place!

538
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,519
I missed you. Have you been well?

539
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,357
Thank you!

540
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,278
It's a little embarrassing to say this,

541
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,573
but we have always worked hard,
whether there was a crisis or not.

542
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,325
We've always worked very hard.
Even now.

543
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:10,994
I don't think there was any change

544
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:15,206
in my behavior or my thoughts
just because we won first place.

545
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:18,376
I was just so happy in that moment.

546
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,628
I just wanted to keep moving forward.

547
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,450
