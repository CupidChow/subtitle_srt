1
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,386
You can't mark on money.

2
00:00:55,431 --> 00:00:56,849
<i>She was going to die anyway.</i>

3
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:59,185
<i>- What happens to us?</i>
<i>- Stop talking!</i>

4
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:08,319
<i>Marry...</i>

5
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,155
<i>my husband.</i>

6
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:20,080
Park Min-hwan must marry Jeong Su-min?

7
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:22,708
Yes.

8
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:25,586
If I don't,

9
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,298
I'll have to marry Park Min-hwan,

10
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:31,675
get cancer,

11
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:37,515
and get killed by my husband
and best friend.

12
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:43,020
"The inevitable will happen."

13
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:48,025
You didn't know?

14
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,989
I didn't. Maybe because
I haven't changed much.

15
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,408
Just a few things.

16
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:02,081
For example, sending Baek Eun-ho
to the reunion to clear the air.

17
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:06,585
So that's why Eun-ho came...

18
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,341
But how did you know about Goseuljung?

19
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:19,974
Because I went...

20
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,479
to your funeral.

21
00:02:33,863 --> 00:02:35,114
My funeral.

22
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,332
How was my funeral?

23
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:53,007
THE LATE KANG JI-WON

24
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:55,634
<i>It was sad.</i>

25
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:58,846
<i>A lot of people...</i>

26
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:02,850
had regrets.

27
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:07,271
You're lying.

28
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,149
I can just imagine it.

29
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,153
No one would be sad

30
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:16,655
or regret anything.

31
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,035
"I guess someone died."

32
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:25,956
"Right. I remember her now."

33
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,792
"She's gone now."

34
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:31,545
Something like that.

35
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,427
Shall we talk somewhere else?

36
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,347
It might take a while.

37
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,911
<i>Is this his house?</i>

38
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:09,667
Getting out?

39
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:11,961
Oh, yes.

40
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:28,769
Let's go in.

41
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:46,870
No, don't.

42
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,832
- No.
- You can put him down.

43
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,291
I love cats.

44
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,545
But he doesn't like people...

45
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,046
Hi.

46
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,840
Well, I thought he didn't.

47
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:02,052
You're so cute.

48
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:04,430
Do you want tea?

49
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,349
I have everything. Coffee too.

50
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,059
Anything is fine.

51
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,983
You know, I'm good with cheese tabby cats.

52
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:19,069
You're so pretty.

53
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,877
Can it be avoided?

54
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:37,254
What if you avoid it?

55
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:41,175
If you break up with Park Min-hwan
or cut ties with Jeong Su-min.

56
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,012
I tried.

57
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,138
But...

58
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:52,311
Min-hwan would have a fit
if I tried to break up with him.

59
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:56,982
If he kills me in ten years,
who's to say he wouldn't now?

60
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:00,069
What if you run away?

61
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,780
I wanted to.

62
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,742
When I came back, everything was scary.

63
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:10,496
I just wanted to forget everything
and run away somewhere.

64
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,040
But realistically, it was impossible.

65
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,335
You can pick up and leave

66
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:19,213
only when you have financial freedom.

67
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,966
But you can run away now. I can help you.

68
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:25,344
That's right.

69
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,971
But I found out.

70
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,851
That I can't evade anything
by running away.

71
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:40,359
You see, I used to have a scar here.

72
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,487
I was burned by a coffee pot.

73
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:52,204
You got hurt instead of me.

74
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,918
The shape of this scar is
exactly the same.

75
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,016
If I didn't get hurt,

76
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:16,145
eventually...

77
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,441
you would've gotten hurt?

78
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:26,697
Yes.

79
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,495
Avoiding it is not the answer.

80
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:38,458
Either way, the inevitable will happen.

81
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:43,213
If I don't give my fate to someone else.

82
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,049
A wound for a wound,

83
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,302
marriage for marriage,

84
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:52,848
and a death...

85
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:54,766
For a death.

86
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:07,821
So I'm not going to run away.

87
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,633
THE LATE KANG JI-WON

88
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:36,034
TAXI
VACANT

89
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:54,803
I don't usually come to this area
even if I got a call.

90
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,180
This is amazing.

91
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,057
I was about to call it a day,

92
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:00,809
but I got this feeling.

93
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,103
Thank you.

94
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:10,027
You must've lost something precious.

95
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,323
I don't even know if it was or not.

96
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,326
We barely knew each other.

97
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:20,078
Goodness.

98
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,122
Why, though?

99
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,999
A man should be daring!

100
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,877
You should've seen it to the end
no matter what.

101
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,004
I should have.

102
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:32,257
I'm regretting it.

103
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,720
I think I had a few chances.

104
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,515
Why did you miss them?

105
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,394
I didn't know it was my chance.

106
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,733
Other times, I thought it was wrong.

107
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,236
Honestly, I don't know.

108
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,574
I realized my feelings recently.

109
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,951
I was just living.

110
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:06,416
But when I heard that she had died...

111
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:19,471
If you get another chance,
what will you do?

112
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,391
There are no more chances.

113
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:23,558
No, if there was.

114
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,937
Will you take it?

115
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:32,818
Seeing as how you missed
all those chances,

116
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,403
maybe you just didn't.

117
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,447
Maybe something stopped you.

118
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:41,201
I...

119
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,912
So don't regret it.

120
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,791
I'm sure there's a reason for your choice.

121
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,835
Or...

122
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:54,714
Will you grab your true chance?

123
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,787
This might sound stupid,

124
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:29,749
but I didn't know how I felt.

125
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,548
If I had, I'd have protected her.

126
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,514
So if I get a chance,

127
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,105
I'll take it.

128
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:01,031
<i>By the way, how did you come back?</i>

129
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,783
<i>I thought I had died,</i>

130
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:06,161
<i>but I woke up to 2013.</i>

131
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,215
I fell asleep and woke up.

132
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,510
Then I was in 2013.

133
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:43,823
EPISODE 7

134
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:50,080
Did you hear?
Marketing Team 1 is about to explode.

135
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:53,833
I hope the meal kit project comes to us.

136
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:54,960
YEON-JI'S DAD

137
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,419
Another's misfortune...

138
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:57,504
Hey.

139
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:02,092
<i>I have an interview at seven today,</i>
<i>so I can't pick Yeon-ji up.</i>

140
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,969
That's such a lame lie.

141
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,596
What company schedules an interview
at 7:00 p.m.?

142
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,642
What, do you know everything?

143
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,352
I said it, so believe it.

144
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,772
<i>Besides, I heard your project has tanked.</i>

145
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,651
Daddy.

146
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:20,986
What?

147
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:23,697
You didn't take her to daycare?

148
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,700
Whatever. I'm hanging up.

149
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:31,496
What?

150
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,379
...will you join me?

151
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,214
<i>Shall I take you out instead?</i>

152
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:42,841
If it weren't for me,

153
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:46,928
who would get promoted for this?
You or Kang Ji-won?

154
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,853
Why is my life like this?

155
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,294
U&K HRD INSTITUTE JEJU

156
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,969
Personally, I hate people like you.

157
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,224
MOST BEAUTIFUL

158
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:50,283
What?

159
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,104
<i>Isn't he the head of Strategic Planning?</i>

160
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,731
<i>- If he's here, there will be blood.</i>
<i>- For sure.</i>

161
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,316
<i>What's going on?</i>

162
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,410
General Manager Yu Ji-hyuk.

163
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,746
I heard about you.

164
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,052
You transfer to HR now?

165
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,848
I'm just a salary man. I do what I'm told.

166
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,934
This isn't for the sake of the company--

167
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,477
At U&K, the chairman...

168
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,397
can do whatever he wants.

169
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,608
Whether it's for the company
or his family.

170
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:10,947
Did you

171
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,325
really think he'd do nothing?

172
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,997
I didn't think he'd send you.

173
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:24,085
PERSONNEL RECORD
KANG JI-WON

174
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:26,337
I didn't know she was your type.

175
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,175
I just meant it was unexpected.

176
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:31,843
More humble than expected.

177
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:34,763
She's not

178
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:36,723
humble.

179
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:38,683
Maybe.

180
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,602
A seven-year relationship.

181
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:44,022
But she started something with you.

182
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,273
It's not--

183
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:48,234
You left work together,
and you went to your house.

184
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:49,819
Was that overtime?

185
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,863
Are you tailing me?

186
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,448
Only when it's needed.

187
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,200
You would to.

188
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:59,329
You didn't have to up until now,
but you're capable of anything.

189
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,873
You might want to soon.

190
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,172
Were you going to give the project to her?

191
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:14,135
If so, it seems you decided that
after a very improper night.

192
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:20,600
General Manager Yu Ji-hyuk.

193
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:23,269
HR will investigate this properly.

194
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:26,314
It won't be swayed by public opinion.

195
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,984
Objectively and without
a woman's influence.

196
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:35,323
Until then, it seems inappropriate
that Ms. Kang leads this project.

197
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:38,952
Considering the circumstances,
she's directly involved too.

198
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,954
Until the results are clear,

199
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,087
you should leave it to Ms. Yang.

200
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,047
PERSONNEL RECORD
YANG JU-RAN

201
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:56,803
Kang Ji-won is allowed to join the team.

202
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,445
If you can be unswayed
by public opinion, objective,

203
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,365
and uninfluenced by a woman,

204
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:20,827
you'll decide that Kang Ji-won
is best for this project.

205
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:25,582
I'm saying nothing happened last night.

206
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:35,800
From now on,

207
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:38,219
the meal kit project will resume.

208
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,933
The leader...

209
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,063
will be Ms. Yang.

210
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:55,111
Kang Ji-won, Park Min-hwan,
and Jeong Su-min will assist.

211
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,197
That'll be all.

212
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,632
Mr. Yu.

213
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,885
Discuss the schedule with Ms. Yang.

214
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:23,181
You said Mr. Park and Su-min must marry.

215
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,725
Won't this be more comfortable?

216
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,978
But it means
three assistant managers are on it.

217
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:35,777
You know what I can do.

218
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:51,250
I knew it, but still, Ms. Yang.

219
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:52,543
Congratulations.

220
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:54,337
But am I just lucky?

221
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,965
I wasn't supposed to join this.

222
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:59,634
It's because the meal kit team is
the dream team.

223
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,010
It's our main project.

224
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:05,306
Maybe they formed the team this way
to keep it until next year.

225
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,393
It makes no sense.
Three assistant managers on it?

226
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:12,897
Will I be asked to leave?

227
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:15,024
That jerk... I mean...

228
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,403
Is Mr. Yu sick or something?

229
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,990
Thought it isn't like him,

230
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,118
I'm sure he has a reason.

231
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,663
Well, let's work hard.

232
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:36,879
Good luck.

233
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:40,049
Take this chance to get ahead of Hui-yeon.

234
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,176
Thank you.

235
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,057
This is good.

236
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:51,436
How did you know I like strawberry milk?

237
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,604
I just bought it because I like it.

238
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:55,231
I got it right.

239
00:21:56,774 --> 00:22:00,069
Oh, right.
I think we're going to a workshop.

240
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:01,779
A workshop?

241
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:05,158
I've never been to one.

242
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,118
We normally go twice a year.

243
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:11,873
But Mr. Yu is too individualistic.
He's so selfish.

244
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,291
I see...

245
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:16,127
This is delicious.

246
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,966
No, that's okay.

247
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:25,094
I'll grill meat for you deliciously
at the workshop.

248
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:27,764
And buy more milk.

249
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:00,838
<i>Whenever my dad gave me an allowance,</i>

250
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:03,216
<i>he always drew a heart on it.</i>

251
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,343
<i>Will you grab your true chance?</i>

252
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,930
<i>The inevitable will happen.</i>

253
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,431
And a death...

254
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,725
For a death.

255
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,459
I started to work here today.

256
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:40,753
I'll be scared if you're here for me.

257
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:44,799
And if it's a coincidence,
it'll feel like fate.

258
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:50,888
Do you know "Dynamite"?

259
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:02,233
You mean Nobel's invention?

260
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,863
And "Spring Day"?

261
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:15,955
I know spring is from March to May.

262
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:18,666
Though I don't know
if I need to know more.

263
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:24,005
You get to live
a smooth, long, happy life.

264
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,048
Congratulations.

265
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,514
I mean, I think
you have a lot of time left.

266
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:44,275
Chef?

267
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:46,360
I'm going home.

268
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:48,738
- Great job today.
- Thank you.

269
00:24:58,247 --> 00:24:59,248
Ji-hyuk!

270
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:04,295
Mr. Yu!

271
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:08,466
Mr. Yu, you can't do this here.
Yu Ji-hyuk!

272
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,512
Hello!

273
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:15,431
Oh, right.

274
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,933
Hello.

275
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:20,353
I pressed the call button,
and the call was made to you.

276
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:21,687
Right.

277
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:25,191
I called him like crazy.
I guess my number was at the top.

278
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,819
This is my crazy brother and boss.

279
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:32,740
He left me out of the team,
then I couldn't reach him all day.

280
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:36,160
But I don't know why he's wasted here.

281
00:25:36,244 --> 00:25:37,328
This is a first.

282
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:40,331
Maybe it's puberty...

283
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:42,833
Or a quarter-life crisis?

284
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:48,881
<i>Who's the person</i>
<i>that sent such a great cake?</i>

285
00:25:48,965 --> 00:25:51,550
<i>This is love itself!</i>

286
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:53,719
- What?
<i>- It means it's good.</i>

287
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:55,554
Really?

288
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:58,099
Get up, man in crisis.

289
00:25:58,182 --> 00:25:59,308
By any chance,

290
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,978
do you know Kang Ji-won?

291
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:03,688
What?

292
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,276
Oh, Werther!

293
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:10,653
The Basque cheesecake that was made

294
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:15,157
with the fresh milk from a mountain goat
in New Zealand that just gave birth

295
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:21,038
Unbelievable.

296
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,086
I really enjoyed it.

297
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:28,170
Thanks.

298
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:43,394
You know what I can do.

299
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:52,820
GENERAL MANAGER YU JI-HYUK

300
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:12,923
<i>The person you are calling...</i>

301
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:49,835
Hangover soup?

302
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,004
You came home on Hui-yeon's back.

303
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:54,840
Now you're drinking on an empty stomach.

304
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:02,932
Thank you.

305
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,934
Chairman Yu's asking for you.

306
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,993
You must've drank something nice.

307
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:25,913
I'm sure you gargled, but you still reek.

308
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,499
There's nothing cheap here.

309
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:36,799
Yu-ra took care
of Director Wang's incident very well.

310
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,175
She's good.

311
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:40,219
OH YU-RA
VICE PRESIDENT OF CLOUD AIR

312
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:42,888
I heard you had an argument with Mr. Lee.

313
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:44,849
That's not true.

314
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:47,685
Yes, it is. Though he denied it too.

315
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:52,523
It seems you have other eyes and ears
at the company.

316
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:58,904
I'm sure you'll cut off
my eyes and ears eventually,

317
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:00,781
but not Mr. Lee.

318
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,451
Make him your person at all cost.

319
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:05,327
He's worth it.

320
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,000
Goodness.

321
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,669
I spoke with Oh Gang-cheol.

322
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:15,713
You take care of Yu-ra.

323
00:29:16,714 --> 00:29:20,468
Gang-cheol can't complain
after everything I've done for him.

324
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,889
I thought you wanted me to marry Yu-ra.

325
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:27,600
What if that's what I want?

326
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:33,397
Look at yourself.

327
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:37,568
You even skipped puberty,
but now you clash with my person.

328
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,529
And you get carried home.

329
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:42,823
Now you're drinking in the morning.

330
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:46,744
But still,

331
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:51,290
I can't force you to do something
just because of what I want.

332
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:57,588
I know that you two
never wanted this marriage.

333
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,632
But it's a promise.

334
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:02,134
It's not right to call it off.

335
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:03,552
From our side at that.

336
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:09,808
So try your best to look sincere

337
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,769
and take care of it.

338
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,569
When can I see that girl?

339
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:26,534
Why won't you answer me?
You caused this mess.

340
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:32,540
I don't think you can.

341
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,293
I feel the same as you.

342
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:40,172
You want me to be happy,

343
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,676
and I want the same for her.

344
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,704
<i>My time already ended then.</i>

345
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,130
<i>But at least...</i>

346
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:24,883
<i>I can protect her this time.</i>

347
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:27,678
THE LATE KANG JI-WON

348
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:33,017
<i>I won't run away.</i>

349
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,271
<i>I won't regret not doing anything.</i>

350
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:43,986
<i>Even if I'm not in her happiness...</i>

351
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:04,089
Roijental! I wish I'd bought it.

352
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,760
I should have when it seemed too late.

353
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:10,012
Did you see Roijental?

354
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:13,974
I should've bought it.
I thought about it for six months!

355
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:16,602
Don't look at that. I sold it months ago.

356
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:19,146
I want to kill myself for it now.

357
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,398
Did you hear?

358
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:24,068
That's the stock I sold for you.

359
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:25,235
Do you even know?

360
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:30,699
I'm only with you
because I still have TKU.

361
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,623
ROIJENTAL

362
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,796
EARNINGS RATE
701%

363
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:48,801
Ji-won, come out for a bit.

364
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:03,524
What was she looking at?

365
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:10,864
ROIJENTAL

366
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:15,828
So Ji-won had this stock
without Min-hwan knowing?

367
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:19,581
She pretends to be busy all the time.
That sly fox.

368
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:25,045
Why hasn't she sold it, though?

369
00:33:27,131 --> 00:33:29,258
Does she think it'll increase more?

370
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:36,098
PURCHASE

371
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:40,018
Remember the restaurant I went with Su-min
with your credit card?

372
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:41,228
It was good.

373
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:43,439
I kept thinking about you.

374
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,316
I wanted to take you too.

375
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,068
And that's today.

376
00:33:51,155 --> 00:33:53,657
Did you think about me?

377
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56,076
I always

378
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:59,413
think about you.

379
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:03,000
Are you free tonight?

380
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:06,128
By the way,

381
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:08,839
you got money?

382
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:11,633
Yeah, that's right!

383
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:15,763
The money I gave you
after I sold the hot Roijental stocks.

384
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:17,556
Let's use that.

385
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:22,895
<i>Before we marry, I need to make something</i>
<i>happen with Su-min.</i>

386
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:26,356
<i>And I think I'll have to spend some money.</i>

387
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,817
<i>How could I not have known this?</i>

388
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:33,572
<i>He talked about going to fancy places,</i>
<i>but it was just a trick to get something.</i>

389
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:36,784
I'm such a dummy!

390
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:40,996
Why? Dummy?
Did you do something with that money?

391
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:46,126
I didn't tell you,
but I spent it all to take out insurance.

392
00:34:46,627 --> 00:34:47,586
What?

393
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:52,007
But I can't even get half of it
if I cancel it now.

394
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:56,720
But it'll increase by ten percent
in ten years.

395
00:34:56,804 --> 00:34:58,931
Hey, you dummy! Are you stupid?

396
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,182
Are you possessed?

397
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,976
It's all a scam!
It benefits insurance companies.

398
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:06,730
I thought you were smart. You're so dumb!

399
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:08,774
Damn it! I can't believe this!

400
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:14,363
Should I sell TKU?

401
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,827
<i>Ruling and opposing lawmakers</i>
<i>involved in the TKU...</i>

402
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,996
But I think it'll go up. This is nuts!

403
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:25,749
Still, I earned a lot.

404
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,085
This is driving me crazy!

405
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:30,170
How much do you need?

406
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:34,508
I have a savings plan that matures soon.

407
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:38,303
What savings?

408
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:43,559
You sold Roijental for me.
I'd feel so bad if you sold TKU too.

409
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:44,852
Right.

410
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:49,857
Don't sell it. I'll lend you the money.

411
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:53,110
Babe.

412
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:57,739
Also, instead of eating out tonight,

413
00:35:57,823 --> 00:36:00,701
let's go somewhere this weekend
with Su-min.

414
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:10,085
Look at the sky! It's so nice! So pretty!

415
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,795
I wish I had sunglasses!

416
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,509
The weather said it'd be cloudy.

417
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:19,595
I knew it'd be okay with you here.

418
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,930
Since you're a weather fairy.

419
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:24,683
You sure know me so well.

420
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:29,479
Ji-won, stop working so hard.

421
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:31,315
You got rid of your bosses.

422
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:32,691
You want to be CEO?

423
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,986
Everyone at work praises you,

424
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:38,614
but that's not charming to men.

425
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:40,324
You dummy!

426
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:44,119
Min-hwan, don't say things like that.
You'll get in trouble.

427
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:49,333
Su-min, why don't you have some cold beer?

428
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:57,466
You want one too?

429
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:00,093
I want snacks too!

430
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:01,178
Snacks!

431
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:15,359
When I think about it,
you're both precious to me.

432
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:20,072
I met Su-min in middle school,
and we're still close.

433
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:21,990
And Min-hwan...

434
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:26,328
We met at work
and have been together ever since.

435
00:37:28,622 --> 00:37:32,042
Our relationship is incredible.

436
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:34,753
Right?

437
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,176
We're a family.

438
00:37:42,636 --> 00:37:45,764
Maybe I'll take her out for some air
and push her off somewhere.

439
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:49,685
You and me...

440
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,062
And Min-hwan.

441
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:55,565
Let's be happy.

442
00:37:59,987 --> 00:38:02,948
I'll have to do a good job.

443
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:06,702
To keep two princesses happy, right?

444
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:11,957
Ji-won, well? How does it feel...

445
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:14,501
to have me?

446
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:20,590
Damn it!

447
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:24,886
- What is it?
- What's wrong?

448
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:27,014
What?

449
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:32,269
No, it was a bug.

450
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:34,187
What? A bug? Where?

451
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:35,522
- I'm scared!
- Come here.

452
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,274
- Where's the bug?
- Where's it?

453
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:38,442
Bugs scare me!

454
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:42,029
I'll chase it away! I'll do it.
Don't come near here!

455
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:44,531
- Min-hwan!
- Are you okay?

456
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:45,741
A bug! Bug!

457
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,993
I'll get it for you!

458
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,786
Are you okay?

459
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:53,999
It reminds me of when we were a thing.

460
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:57,794
You looked so cool
chasing the bug away for me.

461
00:38:58,587 --> 00:38:59,838
Did I do that?

462
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:02,883
When?

463
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:08,388
Su-min's scared of bugs too.

464
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:10,307
I'm glad you're here.

465
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,349
Right.

466
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:23,278
After riding this, let's go on a trip.

467
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:25,822
How's that?

468
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:27,407
Shall you go alone?

469
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:28,492
Go over there!

470
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:30,035
There you go! That's it.

471
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:40,295
Yes, Ms. Yang?

472
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:42,589
What?

473
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:44,549
I'm on my way.

474
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:47,302
What?

475
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,553
Work again?

476
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:55,268
Goodness. She's such a workaholic.

477
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:57,312
She's working on the weekend?

478
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,315
I only have her.

479
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:03,777
But she's too busy to hang out with me.

480
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,612
I can't see her often either.

481
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:08,323
She thinks it's her project. Jeez.

482
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:14,830
Su-min, do you know how to ride a bike?

483
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:17,082
I've never ridden one before.

484
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,667
I'm scared of it.

485
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,418
It's not scary!

486
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:22,045
I'll teach you. Let's go.

487
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:23,713
- Really?
- It's not scary.

488
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:26,258
<i>Hey, Ji-won.</i>

489
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:27,634
Sorry about that.

490
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,845
I wanted to leave here,

491
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,304
and you just called...

492
00:40:31,388 --> 00:40:32,806
- Did I startle you?
<i>- What?</i>

493
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:34,349
No.

494
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,977
So you're not coming?

495
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,520
I'm waiting for you.

496
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,021
What?

497
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:41,857
Where are you?

498
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,258
Here.

499
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:12,846
Wow, thanks.

500
00:41:15,724 --> 00:41:18,143
But shouldn't I be giving you flowers?

501
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:20,061
I heard you work near here now.

502
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,522
Yeah, it's really close.

503
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,484
So make sure to come by.

504
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:34,242
There's a dinner reservation today.

505
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,536
- So I should go.
- What?

506
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:38,997
Yeah, okay.

507
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,526
I have something to tell you.

508
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,487
That's good. So do I.

509
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:12,155
Take a seat.

510
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,662
Why did you come to work?

511
00:42:19,246 --> 00:42:22,540
I wanted to get Min-hwan and Su-min
on a date today.

512
00:42:22,624 --> 00:42:25,252
So we came out together,
and I ditched them.

513
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,925
I missed two things
during my succession process in 2021.

514
00:42:32,801 --> 00:42:35,553
One is the Cloud Air and Kelite Tour.

515
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:37,681
I remember.

516
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:41,810
They were affiliates of U&K
but became independent.

517
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:44,646
And the other is...

518
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:46,898
Mr. Lee Seok-jun.

519
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:51,820
My grandfather wanted him
to stay by my side,

520
00:42:52,404 --> 00:42:55,448
but he resigned
when I became the chairman.

521
00:42:56,992 --> 00:42:58,451
Why did he do that?

522
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,122
Either way, he's uncomfortable.

523
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:03,665
He can't be controlled.

524
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:09,296
It's why I couldn't make you
the leader of the project.

525
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,010
I'll help with everything.

526
00:43:16,386 --> 00:43:17,887
Whatever you need.

527
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:20,473
Everything.

528
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:39,743
You always arrived early
when you worked at the far branch.

529
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:42,078
But now you live close to work, but...

530
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:44,164
I wasn't late.

531
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:46,041
You arrived three minutes ago.

532
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:47,959
If you start acting out...

533
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:49,336
I wasn't late.

534
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:51,046
Okay.

535
00:43:52,464 --> 00:43:54,341
As long as you're on time.

536
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:55,508
Anyway,

537
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:57,886
that man came again.

538
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,276
I'm seeing you often.

539
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,070
I want to get to know you.

540
00:44:16,196 --> 00:44:18,031
To see if you're a player.

541
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:20,408
If you have qualities to be solid land.

542
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:27,624
I hope you drink in moderation today.

543
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:30,001
To see how desperate you are.

544
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:32,921
Why would you do that?

545
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:36,591
I think it's why I came.

546
00:44:38,468 --> 00:44:40,095
Stop the food show.

547
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:44,557
No need to attract women.
You're skilled enough to make money.

548
00:44:46,935 --> 00:44:48,395
What do you care?

549
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:55,777
I won't drink anymore.

550
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:58,196
There's something I must do.

551
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:13,545
There will be a marketing workshop
to improve teamwork.

552
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:15,964
Be careful not to get hurt, and...

553
00:45:21,845 --> 00:45:22,846
That'll be all.

554
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:39,195
Ms. Yang.

555
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:45,410
How about we get Hui-yeon to prepare
the workshop?

556
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:47,287
Sounds good.

557
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:48,621
Hui-yeon.

558
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:53,001
Do you want to prepare the workshop?

559
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:55,044
Me?

560
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:57,922
Prepare it myself?

561
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:06,639
U&K FOOD AUTUMN WORKSHOP

562
00:46:06,723 --> 00:46:09,684
WE ARE ONE! MARKETING TEAM!

563
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:35,793
It'll suck if we get this sleeping bag.

564
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:40,089
Why decide on accommodations
by a treasure hunt?

565
00:46:40,924 --> 00:46:43,218
I can't sleep in a place like this.

566
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,386
Just work hard in the game!

567
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:48,139
It's more fun than just drinking!

568
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:52,268
Also, when else
would we do something like this?

569
00:46:57,774 --> 00:46:58,900
Put it over there.

570
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:04,572
I was nervous when I heard Hui-yeon
will be the one planning the workshop.

571
00:47:04,656 --> 00:47:08,076
We have to play the name tag game too!
This is crazy.

572
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,536
Still, I'm glad.

573
00:47:09,619 --> 00:47:12,789
Her sense of loss from the project
must be gone.

574
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:17,085
Yes. And we're always sitting.
It's nice doing something new.

575
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:19,295
Don't get ahead of yourself.

576
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:21,005
You suck at treasure hunts.

577
00:47:21,673 --> 00:47:23,341
We'll see.

578
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:24,634
I'll try hard.

579
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:27,178
You can't do this after you die.

580
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:28,846
Die?

581
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:35,186
I mean,

582
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,398
everyone dies one day, right?

583
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:41,025
Women should just sit back for this.

584
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:43,236
Sit back and enjoy the ride.

585
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:44,654
Do you trust me?

586
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:46,614
I'll find the number one flag,

587
00:47:46,698 --> 00:47:48,366
and then find the rest for you all.

588
00:47:51,828 --> 00:47:52,829
Number one...

589
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:54,998
Let's do this.

590
00:47:56,416 --> 00:47:57,417
PARK MIN-HWAN

591
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,294
Hey, wait!

592
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:08,219
I screwed up.

593
00:48:08,303 --> 00:48:11,347
<i>If I remember correctly,</i>
<i>Min-hwan gets number five.</i>

594
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:13,266
<i>He sleeps in a sleeping bag.</i>

595
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:15,602
<i>I found number four and hid.</i>

596
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:17,186
<i>I ended up in a tent.</i>

597
00:48:20,148 --> 00:48:21,149
<i>Jeong Su-min...</i>

598
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:30,199
Here, Su-min.

599
00:48:30,867 --> 00:48:32,118
Anything else?

600
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:33,328
Let's take a photo.

601
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:34,746
Sounds good.

602
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:42,962
<i>Strangely,</i>
<i>Su-min always got the best things.</i>

603
00:48:43,713 --> 00:48:45,131
Hide!

604
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:51,095
Don't you think
we hid number one too well?

605
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:52,972
Well, I'm the one who hid it.

606
00:48:53,056 --> 00:48:55,058
Which means it can be found!

607
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:57,769
But you're completely wild.

608
00:48:57,852 --> 00:48:59,395
Who'd go in the water?

609
00:48:59,479 --> 00:49:02,440
Yeah, the water's so cold...

610
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:03,733
Water?

611
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,526
That's hard.

612
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,988
Mr. Kim would help if he was here.

613
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:11,783
Where's Min-hwan? Can he swim?

614
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:14,619
Why? Will you ask him to find it?

615
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:18,956
Of course! It must be
the stream up there. It's dangerous.

616
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:22,377
Just ask for help.
Don't take the hard way.

617
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:30,468
Why? Because he's your boyfriend?

618
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:33,596
No, it's not that.

619
00:49:34,263 --> 00:49:35,973
Then can I borrow him?

620
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:44,065
Ji-won, you need to do anything you can
to get what you want.

621
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:47,026
For me,
that's what it means to truly want it.

622
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:58,496
<i>Was that how she got</i>
<i>everything she wanted?</i>

623
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:09,382
<i>Jeong Su-min sure</i>
<i>got everything she wanted in 2023.</i>

624
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:23,479
I like you a lot.

625
00:50:23,563 --> 00:50:24,814
I'll help with everything.

626
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:27,900
Just ask for help.
Don't take the hard way.

627
00:50:30,445 --> 00:50:32,363
Did you find number one?

628
00:50:32,447 --> 00:50:36,033
- I'd find it for you if I knew--
- Hui-yeon hid it in the stream.

629
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:38,369
Can you help me?

630
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,788
- Of course.
- No.

631
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:42,874
Not that. Something else.

632
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:55,553
Can I just be honest with you?

633
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:03,561
Then don't think of me as someone strange,

634
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:06,063
don't hate me, and just listen to me.

635
00:51:09,192 --> 00:51:10,777
Be that person for me.

636
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:19,368
I know you're willing to do everything
to help me.

637
00:51:22,622 --> 00:51:24,415
But I want to do it on my own.

638
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:31,756
Until the media announced
that you would be the successor to U&K,

639
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:35,092
you always did the right thing.

640
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:37,512
I don't want you to do

641
00:51:40,515 --> 00:51:43,643
something you wouldn't because of me.

642
00:51:45,812 --> 00:51:46,813
I...

643
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:49,440
You said I was a competent person.

644
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:53,110
I can really do anything.

645
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,115
So...

646
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:02,620
just let me be honest with you

647
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:04,330
from time to time.

648
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:09,502
We're the only two people living

649
00:52:10,753 --> 00:52:12,129
these moments again.

650
00:52:12,964 --> 00:52:14,882
Things I can't say to others.

651
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,802
Let me confide in you.

652
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:34,235
Didn't you say your dad

653
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:37,113
drew a heart on your allowance?

654
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:56,215
Why is that...

655
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:05,558
Your dad's allowance.

656
00:53:10,313 --> 00:53:11,772
<i>I should listen to you.</i>

657
00:53:11,856 --> 00:53:13,316
I'll do everything you want.

658
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:26,454
So you can use me all you want.

659
00:53:29,457 --> 00:53:30,333
It's okay.

660
00:53:45,014 --> 00:53:47,266
I don't have to spend it, right?

661
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:52,396
I just want to talk with it.

662
00:53:55,066 --> 00:53:56,192
And...

663
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:01,447
I want my allowance to be happy.

664
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:08,162
Is there anything you want to do
in your second life?

665
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:12,708
- Ji-won...
- Mr. Yu.

666
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:14,627
Is there something you want?

667
00:54:20,132 --> 00:54:21,133
I want...

668
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:25,846
to be happy.

669
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:31,435
On my own.

670
00:54:32,812 --> 00:54:33,896
With my strength.

671
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:37,525
I am going to be happy.

672
00:55:10,266 --> 00:55:12,810
Did he spend all of his time working out?

673
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:16,313
This isn't good enough.

674
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:18,691
My back!

675
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:22,820
If it wasn't for my disc problems,
they'd all be dead.

676
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,780
My L4 and L5.

677
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:29,577
What?

678
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,829
Su-min, are you okay?

679
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:32,913
What's going on?

680
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:36,876
I got caught on a branch.

681
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:38,878
Let me see.

682
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:42,798
Oh, no. This is bad.

683
00:55:42,882 --> 00:55:44,341
That hurts.

684
00:55:57,188 --> 00:55:59,732
You should apply ointment.

685
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:01,192
Let's go to base camp.

686
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:03,069
It's okay. I put saliva on it.

687
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:09,408
By the way, can you help me
with something?

688
00:56:10,785 --> 00:56:11,702
With what?

689
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:15,456
I know where the stick for number one is.

690
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:17,583
But it's in the water.

691
00:56:18,084 --> 00:56:22,046
What if I go in the water
and this gets worse?

692
00:56:22,755 --> 00:56:24,423
Right. Okay.

693
00:56:29,929 --> 00:56:31,889
KANG JI-WON

694
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:47,446
That's far.

695
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:04,130
Ms. Yang, I just asked the master.

696
00:57:04,213 --> 00:57:07,842
He said the water's deep and to not go in.
There's moss too.

697
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:10,761
Let's get over there.

698
00:57:10,845 --> 00:57:13,556
Wait, let's call the safety officer first.

699
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:41,125
Are you insane?

700
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:43,711
You're not even prepared.

701
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:45,379
The water could be deep!

702
00:57:48,424 --> 00:57:50,384
Mr. Yu, I'm fine.

703
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,844
Nothing is fine!

704
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:54,972
You could just tell me.

705
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:57,016
Why is that so hard?

706
00:57:57,725 --> 00:58:00,227
Just ask for help! Why take the hard path?

707
00:58:03,564 --> 00:58:05,191
I'm not Su-min.

708
00:58:07,568 --> 00:58:10,154
Because she's wrong and I'm right.

709
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,366
I won't live like her.

710
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:18,037
I'm going to get everything on my own!

711
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:23,209
That's the right thing to do.

712
00:58:23,292 --> 00:58:25,377
That's what Kang Ji-won would do!

713
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:27,504
Because that's me.

714
00:58:58,994 --> 00:58:59,995
Mr. Yu.

715
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:06,877
Is there something you want?

716
00:59:10,923 --> 00:59:12,258
I want...

717
00:59:13,759 --> 00:59:15,219
Have you been on a boat?

718
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:18,847
After my dad died,

719
00:59:19,682 --> 00:59:22,643
it feels like I'm on a boat every day.

720
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:26,438
My feet are firmly planted,

721
00:59:26,522 --> 00:59:28,232
but the boat keeps rocking.

722
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:30,651
I feel anxious.

723
00:59:33,946 --> 00:59:35,948
I want stability.

724
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:41,870
I want to step on solid land.

725
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:01,015
I want to be solid land.

726
01:00:32,171 --> 01:00:34,757
<i>I won't let them marry.</i>

727
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,383
<i>It's all over now.</i>

728
01:00:36,467 --> 01:00:38,385
<i>Focus on one thing today.</i>

729
01:00:38,469 --> 01:00:39,928
<i>Kang Ji-won won.</i>

730
01:00:40,012 --> 01:00:41,430
<i>If we had more time,</i>

731
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:43,849
<i>I would've fallen for you completely.</i>

732
01:00:43,932 --> 01:00:45,851
<i>But this fate puts the brake down.</i>

733
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:47,311
You can't get a cent?

734
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:49,646
I even took out a private loan.

735
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:54,902
<i>But at this rate, I don't think</i>
<i>he'll give up marrying you.</i>

736
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:55,944
Shall we get married?

737
01:00:56,028 --> 01:00:59,990
<i>What a crappy way to say you'll sponge off</i>
<i>me for life. You call that family?</i>
