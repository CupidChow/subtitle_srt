1
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:38,873
All right.

2
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:43,002
Don't move.

3
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:46,172
Heave...

4
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:48,466
ho!

5
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:51,302
It's a delivery!

6
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:55,765
Who...

7
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:56,682
FRY ME

8
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:59,101
Hi! Did you order hot fried chicken,

9
00:00:59,185 --> 00:01:00,269
spicy chicken,

10
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,104
and salty soy sauce chicken?

11
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,315
No.

12
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:05,733
Did you order chicken?

13
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:07,485
How could I?

14
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:08,694
Come. Let's start over.

15
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:09,987
I got it wrong.

16
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,491
You got fried, spicy,
and soy sauce chicken.

17
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,285
And the large fries
and cola are on the house.

18
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,747
- I'm sorry, but--
- Mister.

19
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,916
We didn't order it. Okay? Just go.

20
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,335
Just a second.

21
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:27,004
Was it a cider, not cola?

22
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,840
Mister, we didn't order anything.

23
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:31,509
So just go.

24
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:33,552
You didn't order chicken?

25
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:35,888
But this is the address. Apartment 401.

26
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,515
I don't care. Just go.

27
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,725
I have to check first.

28
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:40,851
What's with you?

29
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,395
You're really pissing me off.

30
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,981
What do you want to do? Well?

31
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,569
I'm sure this is it.

32
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:52,655
I'll check, so just wait here.

33
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:57,159
Don't check, and don't come back!

34
00:01:57,243 --> 00:01:59,829
- I'll be right back.
- Don't come back!

35
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:01,205
Go! Hey!

36
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,498
Wait...

37
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,502
Hey, Ji-won. Hey!

38
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,631
What the heck?

39
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:15,761
Ji-won? Open the door.

40
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,557
I don't think we should be doing this.

41
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:24,144
What? What are you talking about? Hey!

42
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:28,023
I'm not the delivery man!
It's me. Open the door!

43
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,528
Come on. Hey!

44
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,701
<i>I'm flustered by how you're acting.</i>

45
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:41,120
<i>What do you think of our relationship?</i>

46
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,290
What is she talking about?

47
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:46,542
Are you sick or something?

48
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,878
This isn't like you. Hey!

49
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,963
Open the door. What's with you?

50
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:55,384
<i>I think I need some time.</i>
<i>Tell me if it's hard for you.</i>

51
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,553
<i>I'll accept whatever you say.</i>

52
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:02,433
Is she kidding?

53
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:20,034
<i>I'm leaving! You're being so mean.</i>

54
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:45,434
Ji-won?

55
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,519
You can hear me, right?

56
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,774
I don't think you're easy.

57
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,110
I love your soul more.

58
00:03:56,904 --> 00:04:00,199
Honestly, you're all skin and bones.
There's nothing to see.

59
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:03,994
Don't get me wrong.

60
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:05,829
Anyway...

61
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:08,832
Sorry about tonight.

62
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:11,460
Good night.

63
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:30,354
That could've been bad.

64
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,025
This little...

65
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:43,909
Damn it.

66
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:54,837
Goodness.

67
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,715
I was going to go back up
if he didn't come out.

68
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:00,634
Did I do a good job?

69
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:02,344
Yeah. Good job.

70
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:04,221
I felt like a spy. It was fun.

71
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,265
But what's going on?

72
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,147
So...

73
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,148
Shall I go now?

74
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,197
EPISODE 3

75
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:26,618
Hey!

76
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,328
I swear...

77
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,539
Where'd you go with all the chicken?

78
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:33,375
I had to do all the works alone until now!

79
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:35,335
Ji-hyuk urgently needed me.

80
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,337
You little...

81
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:39,631
Well...

82
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:40,674
Come on. Try me.

83
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:42,634
- You should've been faster!
- Do it!

84
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:44,970
- Try it!
- I thought you ran away.

85
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:46,055
Why you...

86
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,099
But why, all of a sudden?

87
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,101
I don't know.

88
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,562
He asked me to fake a misdelivery.

89
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,399
I think something's going on.

90
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:58,484
What do you mean?

91
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:01,361
This morning,
he suddenly asked me to find someone,

92
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:02,946
so I made over 100 calls.

93
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:05,032
- To find someone?
- Yeah.

94
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,242
- Why?
- I don't know.

95
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:09,870
He had this look on his face.

96
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,791
So I couldn't ask.

97
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,684
You should've been a celebrity instead.

98
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,104
I'm not good in front of people.

99
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,397
That's your problem.

100
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:38,649
You're too timid...

101
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:41,026
I mean, scrupulous.

102
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,696
We could've been huge
if you were a little shameless.

103
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,740
If you appear on TV and do...

104
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:48,242
a little of this

105
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,576
and a little of that,

106
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,704
our sales would be through the roof!

107
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,290
I almost forgot.

108
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:59,169
I can't come in this Sunday.
I already told the sous-chef.

109
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,088
What's up? Do you have a blind date?

110
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,800
Are you ready to start dating now?

111
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,802
No, it's not that.

112
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,638
I have a high school reunion.

113
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:10,973
What?

114
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:12,933
You're going?

115
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:17,396
Don't you avoid these events
since your first love broke your heart?

116
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,565
She turned you down harshly, right?

117
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:24,695
You're not the type
to be turned down that easily.

118
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,196
Come on.

119
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,575
By the way,
how did you know about the reunion?

120
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,035
You don't keep in touch.

121
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,413
Well...

122
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,005
U&K FOOD MARKETING
GENERAL MANAGER YU JI-HYUK

123
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,174
By any chance,

124
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,594
are you free this Sunday?

125
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,438
You seem like a decent person,

126
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,356
but I have a girlfriend.

127
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,275
- I'm sorry.
- Excuse me?

128
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:06,904
That's not what I mean.
What are you thinking?

129
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,323
It's not like that. Never.

130
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,786
There's a high school reunion.

131
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,915
A man showed up and told me about it.

132
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,834
But I don't know who he is.

133
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,420
He's not from my school.

134
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,173
That sounds suspicious.

135
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,717
It's best not to get involved.

136
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,720
Unless you want to see your first love,
don't go.

137
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:36,725
What did I do?

138
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:39,937
You shouldn't be like that.

139
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,691
I never want to speak to you again.

140
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:47,486
Do you miss her?

141
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,490
Since that traumatic event,
you didn't want to date anyone.

142
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,533
You even wear the fake ring around.

143
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:58,247
Right? I shouldn't go, should I?

144
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:03,126
If you're going to go,

145
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,544
dress to the nines.

146
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,075
No.

147
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,856
<i>To be honest, I was really upset today.</i>

148
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,109
<i>You'll pay the price for it</i>
<i>on Sunday at Goseuljung.</i>

149
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,235
<i>Don't be late.</i>

150
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,739
I can't make myself pretty overnight.

151
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:25,751
SUNDAY

152
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,720
<i>My other half, are you coming?</i>
<i>Our date's today!</i>

153
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,223
<i>Don't be late. Make yourself pretty!</i>

154
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:44,853
I don't know
how pretty you can get overnight,

155
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,023
but as long as you're pretty to me.

156
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:55,280
GOSEULJUNG

157
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:59,743
BUSAN TAEHA HIGH SCHOOL'S 37TH REUNION

158
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:03,747
Jeong Su-min, is that you?

159
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:09,711
You look so pretty!

160
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:11,380
She was always pretty.

161
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,466
You're so cute.
You haven't changed at all.

162
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,927
Everyone, Su-min's here. Let's drink!

163
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,011
Let's drink now!

164
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:19,096
Sit down.

165
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:23,016
Cheers to Busan Taeha High School!

166
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:33,443
Since you got the job at the big company,
your vibe feels a bit changed.

167
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,737
You feel like a classy city lady now.

168
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,532
I got lucky.

169
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,575
Ji-won supported me a lot.

170
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,953
Do you still see her?

171
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,081
She's my other half.

172
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:49,459
You're too soft. You're still a pushover.

173
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:50,961
What's she up to?

174
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,338
Does she still sponge off of you?

175
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:54,840
She's modest.

176
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,008
Still, she's gotten a lot prettier.

177
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:59,511
She's coming later actually. I called her.

178
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,305
Wait, she's coming here?

179
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,475
Be nice to her when she shows up.

180
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,437
She's going through a hard time.

181
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:09,813
Why is that?

182
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:17,946
Remember how I put in a referral
and got her a contract job at U&K?

183
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,615
Now, she has a crush on Mr. Park Min-hwan.

184
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:23,076
Park Min-hwan?
Isn't he the one you're into?

185
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,619
Is he the same person?

186
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,206
What?

187
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,334
Well...

188
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,088
No. It's not what you think.

189
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,258
Don't bring it up to her.

190
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,218
- Please, don't.
- Why not?

191
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,097
She's at it again!

192
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:46,975
OTHER HALF

193
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,021
Hey, Ji-won.

194
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,606
<i>Hey, where are you?</i>

195
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,615
I'll get you if you can't find your way.

196
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,626
I'm here. I'm behind you.

197
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:25,430
Ji-won...

198
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:26,765
What's going on?

199
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,558
It wasn't just us for dinner?

200
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:33,980
It's been a long time.

201
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,998
I can't make myself pretty overnight.

202
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:02,968
Ms. Kang!

203
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,345
You said you had plans on Sunday,

204
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,305
so how about we hang out tomorrow?

205
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,233
SATURDAY

206
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:26,700
STOCK BALANCE: 1,403,000 WON

207
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,952
It went up to 1.4 million won.

208
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:32,706
I invested 3 million,
so this means it's 6 million now.

209
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,959
Once my next paycheck comes in,

210
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,419
I'll invest it all.

211
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,451
What the heck?

212
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:12,954
It's a lot more different than I thought.

213
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:23,715
<i>That's why the general manager</i>
<i>told me to not wear it.</i>

214
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:26,843
I'm such a fool.

215
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:40,899
So pretty.

216
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,574
Ji-won!

217
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,871
Sorry I'm late!

218
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,122
No, it's fine.

219
00:15:56,706 --> 00:16:01,169
You look so pretty today!
You wore the clothes I bought you.

220
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:04,339
For today, ta-da!

221
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,549
Matching hats.

222
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,555
Here's yours.

223
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,017
It looks so great on you!

224
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,560
Thanks.

225
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,814
I wish glasses looked good on me too.

226
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,401
You'd look prettier without them.

227
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:29,030
Again with your lack of confidence.
You're pretty! So pretty!

228
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:31,616
Where's Min-hwan?

229
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:33,868
He'll be here soon.

230
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:39,541
The weather's great today. It's hot.

231
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,043
Give me the candy.

232
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,468
Sorry. I forgot to buy some more
since we finished it.

233
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:56,224
What? You know how much I like that candy.

234
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:00,103
Sorry.

235
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:05,358
What's up? Did Ji-won upset Su-min again?

236
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:10,280
Hi, Min-hwan.
She doesn't have my favorite candy today.

237
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,366
If she cared about me,
she would've prepared them.

238
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,617
I'm so upset.

239
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,829
Why did you do that?

240
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,332
That's why I bought some!

241
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,460
My favorite!

242
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,171
- You're the best!
- Great job!

243
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:30,759
- Shall we go see the flowers?
- Sounds good! Bring our stuff!

244
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:35,346
- Hurry up!
- Okay.

245
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:39,684
Wait!

246
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,483
Wow, it's so pretty.

247
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,402
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

248
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,781
- Look over there. Isn't it pretty?
- Yeah.

249
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,745
My long-awaited date with you!

250
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:00,580
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

251
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,333
No, that's okay.

252
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,003
Authentique...

253
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:13,343
Su-min gave it to me as a gift.

254
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:14,969
But this one's a knockoff.

255
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:16,679
I just learned that.

256
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:24,562
These are real, right?

257
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,272
Yes, they're real.

258
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,276
The shine's different, right?

259
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,111
They're beautiful.

260
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:34,197
Thank you. They're pretty, right?

261
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:41,204
Why haven't you been drinking?

262
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,164
It's so nice drinking together.

263
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,292
What do you mean? I drink a lot.

264
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,169
You said you didn't drink.

265
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:50,630
You said you quit drinking

266
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,424
since one big drunken mistake
you made before.

267
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,635
Me? A drunken mistake?

268
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:57,095
<i>Are you okay?</i>

269
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,607
I did quit drinking for a while.

270
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:12,527
But I started drinking again
because of Min-hwan...

271
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,238
Say what?

272
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,575
You started drinking again
because of Mr. Park?

273
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:22,453
<i>Not now, but five years from now.</i>

274
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:28,084
Drinking in moderation is fine.

275
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:32,255
Being scared of another mistake
seemed like a dumb idea to quit drinking.

276
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:36,092
- Do you want fried dumplings?
- Yeah!

277
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:40,263
- Can we get six more fried dumplings?
- Okay.

278
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:43,933
<i>Back then, the drunken mistake</i>
<i>felt like a huge deal to me.</i>

279
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,768
<i>I had completely forgotten.</i>

280
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:49,898
<i>Why did I reflect so much</i>
<i>and become so withdrawn?</i>

281
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:51,399
Here are your dumplings.

282
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:52,859
Thank you.

283
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:54,986
I really like you.

284
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,614
You're bright and healthy.

285
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,199
Is that where your name comes from?

286
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:01,576
That's right.

287
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:04,037
My name means "joyous connection."

288
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,372
"Be a joyous connection to anyone."

289
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:07,832
That's my motto.

290
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:09,959
I knew it.

291
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:11,628
Let's make a toast!

292
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,547
- To a joyous...
- Connection!

293
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,598
Try it. It's so good!

294
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,558
- Like right now?
- Yeah!

295
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:26,809
Eat it right now?

296
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,647
Isn't it good? It's so good!

297
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,607
Isn't it so good?

298
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,359
To be honest with you,

299
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:36,235
I'm glad we met today instead.

300
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:39,906
On Sundays, we can't drink so much
because we work the next day.

301
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,074
You're right.

302
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,410
Isn't your reunion tomorrow?

303
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:46,955
- Shall we drink in moderation?
- Oh, that.

304
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:50,291
I haven't decided to go yet.

305
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,965
To be honest,
I wasn't just an unpopular girl.

306
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:58,174
I've been bullied.

307
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,094
What? You were bullied?

308
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,304
But why?

309
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:05,807
I don't know.

310
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,976
Everyone suddenly hated me.

311
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:12,188
So that made me feel small

312
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,148
and make more mistakes.

313
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:17,443
And everyone hated me more for that.

314
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:20,363
You should've asked them why.

315
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,573
How could I?

316
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:25,827
How will you know if you don't ask?

317
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:30,206
Honestly, I'm the type to run away
when things get too hard,

318
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,917
but you should try
all you can before that.

319
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:37,463
I need to know
if these people are simply crazy

320
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:40,133
or have good reasons

321
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,135
so I won't have regrets later.

322
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,721
No regrets?

323
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:46,389
Yeah.

324
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:50,018
<i>It makes so much sense.</i>
<i>Why hasn't this occurred to me?</i>

325
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:54,939
Su-min is just too nice.

326
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:58,026
Ever since high school, Ji-won--

327
00:21:58,109 --> 00:21:59,527
Ye-ji, wait.

328
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,613
Ji-won wasn't at her seat earlier.

329
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:07,869
<i>I need to hear the rest.</i>

330
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:08,953
You're right.

331
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,999
I should go if I don't want to regret it.

332
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:20,590
What is it?

333
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,676
Turning a shameful past into history...

334
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,969
It sounds easy,

335
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:28,598
but it can't be done overnight
for someone like me.

336
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,433
That may be true.

337
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,810
But you can try.

338
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,939
- I can?
- A stitch in time saves nine!

339
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:40,526
Those who are prepared will not fail!

340
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:53,664
What are you doing?

341
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:55,124
I love dumplings.

342
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:58,169
I want to eat them at home later.

343
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:05,885
It's finally time for me
to repay your kindness!

344
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,199
Hello!

345
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,034
It's been a while, Hui-yeon.

346
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:33,538
This is my favorite superior at work.

347
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:34,664
Hello.

348
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,707
Hello, I'm Designer Song Jae-min.

349
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,459
Shall we go now?

350
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:40,336
Yeah, let's go.

351
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:48,803
I'm going to pay with my membership here.

352
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:51,222
- No, Hui-yeon.
- Hush!

353
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:52,306
My savior.

354
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,433
Focus.

355
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:56,727
The membership that expires today?

356
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,729
That's great news.

357
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:01,524
What would you have done
without her, Hui-yeon?

358
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:04,569
Your hair's so healthy.
Any style would look great.

359
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:06,404
Shall we do an S-curl perm?

360
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:07,905
How about a wavy perm?

361
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:11,701
A too radical change might make you

362
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,579
feel like
you're a completely different person.

363
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:18,541
Let's do a soft wavy perm.
She needs an eyelash perm too.

364
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:21,002
- Let's trim her eyebrows--
- Wait.

365
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,883
I do want to be a different person.

366
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:33,139
Okay, got it.

367
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:36,976
Then you'll be reborn today.

368
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:41,063
Also, grab a new hair part for her.

369
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,190
And...

370
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:43,357
Her makeup!

371
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:44,275
Is Ms. Nam here?

372
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:45,568
Yes. I'll call her.

373
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:50,364
I'm going to introduce you to a new you.

374
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:52,700
You'll meet her in front of a mirror.

375
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:15,306
<i>Those who aren't mentally mature like you</i>

376
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:17,850
<i>judge others by their looks.</i>

377
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:21,520
<i>If you want something, dress accordingly.</i>

378
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:22,897
<i>That's the start.</i>

379
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:05,731
You look incredible!

380
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:07,066
It looks good on you!

381
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,902
You're so pretty. Do you like it?

382
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:17,053
How's this?

383
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:22,266
So nice!

384
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,695
No, maybe next time.

385
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,323
Why? It's great!

386
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,494
This needs to go to someone else.

387
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:51,170
Dude, you're spitting all over the meat.

388
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,463
Is it a cold?

389
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:55,049
It's from the smoke! I'm not sick.

390
00:27:57,718 --> 00:28:00,513
What? Your girl didn't pick up
or call you back?

391
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,390
I don't call Ji-won.

392
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:06,185
Real players just let it be.

393
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:09,021
RECENT CALLS
KANG JI-WON

394
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:11,732
CALL FAILED

395
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:14,276
You let them be, and they start to think.

396
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,071
Once they start thinking, they'll give in.

397
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,408
- You don't know anything.
- Help me with this.

398
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,451
Watch.

399
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:24,370
Do you want some help?

400
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:27,581
The hammock!

401
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:29,375
I'm great with this.

402
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,502
Shall we open it? One, two, three.

403
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:39,135
Come by and have some BBQ later.

404
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:55,151
But this bitch is holding out longer
than I thought.

405
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:57,903
You're going to die anyway.

406
00:28:58,696 --> 00:28:59,697
Get lost!

407
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:44,116
The dumplings are cold now.

408
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:47,119
Excuse me. More dumplings...

409
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:57,755
Thanks, Hui-yeon.

410
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:08,849
<i>About the meal kit.</i>

411
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:10,768
<i>I'll look at your proposal.</i>

412
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:12,728
<i>Ju-ran and Su-min will be on the team.</i>

413
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,064
<i>They'll make up for what you lack.</i>

414
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:18,067
Did he read my proposal?

415
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,820
Jeong Su-min will be on the team?

416
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:25,574
Wait.

417
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,081
<i>You didn't forget about tomorrow, right?</i>
<i>Goseuljung, 5:30 p.m.</i>

418
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,543
OKAY

419
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:41,757
Hello?

420
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,634
Ji-won, it's me.

421
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:46,595
What did you do today?

422
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,891
I had <i>tteokbokki </i>with Hui-yeon today.

423
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:53,227
She's sleeping right now.

424
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:56,814
Yu Hui-yeon is
at your house right now? Why?

425
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:59,108
We were talking, and she fell asleep.

426
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,110
We had some drinks too.

427
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,491
Hello?

428
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:08,993
You should've called me.

429
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,623
Did I do something to upset you?

430
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:18,210
No. Did you do something
that might upset me?

431
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:19,545
No, nothing.

432
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:25,801
I called to ask for a favor.

433
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,014
What is it?

434
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:34,727
I was wondering...

435
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:36,395
This...

436
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:37,980
It's about your proposal.

437
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,690
...is great!

438
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,066
It's really great.

439
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,943
Can I fix it a little
and propose it again?

440
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:45,613
Can I fix it a little
and propose it again?

441
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:46,989
What do you think?

442
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:54,955
No, you can't. It's my proposal.

443
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,043
Why not? Yours was rejected.
I got a good feeling.

444
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,170
<i>I want to be a full-time employee.</i>

445
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,963
Let's succeed together, pal!

446
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:06,133
You should've told me.

447
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:08,302
<i>If I had known,</i>

448
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:10,179
I wouldn't have fixed it.

449
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:14,725
Sorry, I'll give you my next good idea.

450
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:17,478
<i>Also...</i>

451
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:23,275
Stop calling me by my name at work.

452
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,570
<i>We're friends,</i>
<i>but we have different positions</i>

453
00:32:26,654 --> 00:32:30,949
and I'm more experienced. You're crossing
the line by making me run coffee errands

454
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:32,284
and ordering me around.

455
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:36,580
Let's not mix business
with pleasure, okay?

456
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,335
- What?
- I've got to go. See you tomorrow.

457
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:50,636
What was that?

458
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:56,100
Ji-won, how dare you do this to me?

459
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:04,066
<i>I changed my reservations for you</i>
<i>to go to the reunion.</i>

460
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:06,151
<i>See you tomorrow, girl.</i>

461
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,363
<i>I love you. See you tomorrow.</i>

462
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:11,865
<i>I bought new earrings to show you, Ye-ji!</i>

463
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:16,870
I swear.

464
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:20,666
Just when I put my guard down,
she forgets what a loser she is.

465
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,252
It's okay.

466
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,504
I'll just have to teach her again.

467
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:28,924
<i>Make sure to wear the earrings I got you.</i>

468
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:35,347
MEAL KIT PROPOSAL FOR SINGLE HOUSEHOLDS

469
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:41,103
Over here! The chicken came out. Come on.

470
00:33:42,563 --> 00:33:43,897
What did your mom say?

471
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:46,942
I said I'd be with you, so she's okay.

472
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:50,612
My mom is so silly.

473
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:53,031
I'm 31. Why do I still have a curfew?

474
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:55,909
It's because you're so pretty.

475
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:57,119
She's just worried.

476
00:33:57,995 --> 00:33:59,663
Let me tell you about women.

477
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,127
They should grow up sheltered.

478
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:07,588
Here.

479
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,508
So what if my mom raised me like this?

480
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:15,596
I need to meet a reliable man like you
to continue a life like this.

481
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:25,564
That's right. Yeah.

482
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:28,400
We're done talking about work,

483
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:31,236
- so I can call you Gyeong-uk, right?
- Wait.

484
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,907
Of course.

485
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,700
From now on,

486
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:39,244
we're more than just coworkers.

487
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,248
PREPARED: ASSISTANT MANAGER KANG JI-WON

488
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:47,503
Here.

489
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:16,949
GOSEULJUNG

490
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:30,587
<i>Hey, Ji-won.</i>

491
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,631
Hey, where are you?

492
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:41,598
I'll get you if you can't find your way.

493
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:45,853
I'm here. I'm behind you.

494
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,114
Ji-won...

495
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:02,202
What's going on?
It wasn't just us for dinner?

496
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,130
It's been a long time.

497
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:20,637
Wow, what happened?

498
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:23,348
How did the loser Kang Ji-won
get so pretty?

499
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:28,353
I don't remember you,
so you're pretty much a stranger.

500
00:36:28,437 --> 00:36:29,438
You're very rude.

501
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,190
Was I? Sorry.

502
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:34,318
I'm so clueless.

503
00:36:35,152 --> 00:36:36,653
He hasn't changed.

504
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:38,071
He was clueless then.

505
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:40,073
- He's still clueless now.
- Wow.

506
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:43,493
You even copied Su-min's earrings.

507
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,954
And you want to talk about manners?

508
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:50,584
Earrings?

509
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:53,462
No, they're not the same.

510
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:56,590
These look really nice.

511
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:02,512
Those look a little cheap.

512
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,765
Are those knockoffs?

513
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:06,808
Wow, did you copy her?

514
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:09,645
Su-min,
you should've bought authentic ones.

515
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,772
There are so many great knockoffs.

516
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,691
Forget it. It can happen if you're broke.

517
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:19,154
FIVE HOURS AGO

518
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:30,415
Makeup is a skill.
You get better with practice.

519
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:46,598
When it comes to knockoffs...

520
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:48,350
No.

521
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:49,935
For copies,

522
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:53,313
there are different grades.
S grade, A grade, B grade.

523
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:55,899
Anyone can tell
these are super fake dupes.

524
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,068
They are?

525
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:02,406
They're knockoffs that don't have
the decency to pretend to look real.

526
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:08,370
There's only one reason
for a gift like this.

527
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:12,541
Humiliation.

528
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:18,880
- I...
- Let's have a drink.

529
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,590
<i>I'm sure you had one more.</i>

530
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,342
<i>To show that I copied you</i>

531
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:26,054
<i>so yours look real compared to mine.</i>

532
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,557
- I...
<i>- But...</i>

533
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,142
<i>too bad.</i>

534
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:31,935
Wear mine to dinner!

535
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:36,023
<i>I think I found a real friend.</i>

536
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:37,649
Excuse me.

537
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:14,895
Kang Ji-won is incredible.

538
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:17,272
Why did she come? She has no friends here.

539
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,024
She must be here to eat.

540
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:21,318
Did you see her? She looks so poor.

541
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,825
Kang Ji-won is incredible.

542
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:30,994
Why did she come? She has no friends here.

543
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:32,579
She must be here to brag.

544
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:34,915
Did you see her? Everything looked new.

545
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:38,335
Why are you talking like
you're from Seoul? It's weird.

546
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:41,338
Still, how is she still hanging out
with Su-min?

547
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:42,547
Isn't it obvious?

548
00:39:42,631 --> 00:39:46,134
Su-min, that softie is
just too nice to her.

549
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:48,553
She stays by her and steals everything!

550
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:50,514
I hate her.

551
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:52,224
She really is incredible.

552
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:56,728
Su-min is just too nice.

553
00:39:57,187 --> 00:39:58,814
We should take care of her.

554
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,983
Ever since high school, Ji-won--

555
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:03,443
Ye-ji, wait.

556
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:05,570
What?

557
00:40:05,654 --> 00:40:07,697
Ji-won wasn't at her seat earlier.

558
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,449
Were you here all this time?

559
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,911
- Why did you pretend like you weren't? I--
- Then...

560
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:56,997
I came in here first.

561
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,332
Do I have to come out to greet you?

562
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,721
Don't mind me and keep talking.

563
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,055
I'm curious too.

564
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:17,017
What did I do to Su-min in high school?

565
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:19,519
You don't know?

566
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:22,105
You coveted and copied everything of hers.

567
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:24,941
Didn't you copy Su-min
with those earrings?

568
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:29,863
These?

569
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,699
Su-min gave these to me as a gift.

570
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:41,541
But they were fake.

571
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,251
It was too obvious.

572
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:46,463
So I bought the authentic ones.

573
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:49,132
Still, they're matching earrings, right?

574
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:52,135
I'm still curious.

575
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:56,056
What else did I covet of hers?

576
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:58,350
A guy!

577
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:02,562
What's his name? Park Min-hwan!
I heard you were interested in her guy.

578
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:04,564
People don't change.

579
00:42:04,648 --> 00:42:08,443
Su-min dated Eun-ho in high school,
and you made them break up.

580
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:13,114
I told Su-min to break up with Eun-ho?

581
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:15,408
They were dating?

582
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,870
And Su-min has something going on
with Min-hwan?

583
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:21,122
She recommended you for a job

584
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:24,167
at a company like U&K,
and you stole her man.

585
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:25,752
That's crossing the line.

586
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:29,422
I can't even deal with this.

587
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,634
- What did you say?
- Hey.

588
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,514
If you're going to be mean
after hearing one side of the story,

589
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:40,308
at least try to fact-check first.

590
00:42:43,937 --> 00:42:44,938
Listen up.

591
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:48,775
U&K FOOD MARKETING
ASSISTANT MANAGER KANG JI-WON

592
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:50,735
I'm an assistant manager at U&K.

593
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:53,947
I hear contract workers get cards too.

594
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,991
What's this? How can we trust you?

595
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:59,494
I joined the company seven years ago.
When did Su-min join?

596
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:04,749
I remember recommending her
in my second year as assistant manager.

597
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:07,669
- About last year?
- That's right.

598
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:11,214
I asked about her cover letter,
so it was early last year.

599
00:43:13,008 --> 00:43:14,384
The strangest thing

600
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:16,261
is about Park Min-hwan.

601
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,555
He's my boyfriend.

602
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,978
PARK MIN-HWAN

603
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:25,895
SPEAKER

604
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:33,945
<i>Hey, babe.</i>

605
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:36,323
I'm at my school reunion. Did you call?

606
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,533
What?

607
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,369
I wanted you to have fun,
so I didn't call.

608
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:42,787
<i>I must've butt-dialed.</i>

609
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:47,125
I see. That's great.

610
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,586
Say hi to my friends.

611
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:52,422
Friends?

612
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,177
Hello.

613
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:01,264
Hi, we're Ji-won's friends.

614
00:44:01,348 --> 00:44:04,100
Are you really Ji-won's boyfriend?

615
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:07,437
Hello, I'm Ji-won's boyfriend.
Park Min-hwan.

616
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,482
I didn't know Ji-won had friends
other than Su-min.

617
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:12,901
Take care of Ji-won for me.

618
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:14,069
I should've said--

619
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:15,570
Hello? Hey?

620
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:19,407
What was that?

621
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:24,371
Good enough?

622
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,391
Ji-won!

623
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,645
- Where are you going?
- You...

624
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:49,979
Hey, Kang Ji-won!

625
00:44:53,233 --> 00:44:55,110
Yeah, fine.

626
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:56,653
But back in high school,

627
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:59,239
why did you tell her
to dump her boyfriend?

628
00:45:11,418 --> 00:45:13,128
Stop it, guys!

629
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:16,798
You shouldn't torment your friends. Don't!

630
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:17,882
So dirty!

631
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:22,303
I almost forgot.

632
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:25,098
That's so strange.

633
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:28,601
I did have feelings for Eun-ho.

634
00:45:28,685 --> 00:45:30,770
Su-min never dated him.

635
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:35,692
Did you date Eun-ho?

636
00:45:45,118 --> 00:45:46,119
Well...

637
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:54,919
I'm sorry, Ji-won.
I couldn't tell you back then.

638
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:57,213
I knew you liked Eun-ho.

639
00:45:57,797 --> 00:45:59,924
How could I tell you we were dating?

640
00:46:04,471 --> 00:46:08,016
What are you talking about?
You said I told you to dump him.

641
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,767
Then shouldn't I have known?

642
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:15,732
I made a mistake.

643
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:18,776
It was a secret relationship,
so I didn't tell you.

644
00:46:18,902 --> 00:46:21,196
Did I know or not?

645
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:27,160
How terrifying. Ji-won, you're scary!

646
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:29,746
You have no friends
because of your temper.

647
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:33,249
- Why are you nitpicking?
- You did the same, so I did too.

648
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,711
I didn't ask questions back then.

649
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,797
Did you forget how you tormented me
for three years?

650
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:44,302
Even now, I showed you my card
and explained everything.

651
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:46,346
And now you don't like my temper.

652
00:46:46,888 --> 00:46:48,640
What if your card is fake?

653
00:46:49,224 --> 00:46:51,476
Like the fake bag you brought tonight?

654
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:55,021
What the hell are you saying?

655
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:57,232
I went to the department store

656
00:46:57,315 --> 00:47:00,818
and bought this in 12 monthly installments
with my first paycheck!

657
00:47:01,236 --> 00:47:02,278
Or not.

658
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:05,406
You're a funny one.

659
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,368
You call it fake based on an assumption

660
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:10,537
and now what? "Or not?"

661
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,914
Then what more should I say?

662
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:15,959
You should apologize and say you're sorry!

663
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:17,794
You should apologize to me!

664
00:47:21,256 --> 00:47:22,465
You believed Su-min

665
00:47:22,549 --> 00:47:24,634
and bullied me for three years.

666
00:47:25,677 --> 00:47:28,638
Do you still want to do this
at a high school reunion?

667
00:47:32,392 --> 00:47:33,643
I understand.

668
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:37,855
You don't want to apologize because
you just wanted to bully me. Right?

669
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:39,482
What are you saying?

670
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:43,444
I'm a very honest person.

671
00:47:43,987 --> 00:47:47,615
So you're saying
Su-min and Eun-ho didn't date, right?

672
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:51,452
The parties involved said they did.
Who are you to say that?

673
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,416
I don't know about anything else...

674
00:48:12,932 --> 00:48:14,642
But I can tell you one thing.

675
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:21,274
Su-min and I

676
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:25,612
never dated.

677
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,464
It's been a long time, Ji-won.

678
00:48:50,011 --> 00:48:51,638
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

679
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:55,767
No need.

680
00:48:59,646 --> 00:49:01,856
- I'm sorry.
- Explain yourself.

681
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:03,733
This is a promise.

682
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:05,026
When you break it,

683
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:08,571
you must give a suitable reason.
I can't understand it,

684
00:49:09,781 --> 00:49:11,866
so how can I ask for understanding?

685
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:14,077
I can't explain.

686
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,079
It's not right,

687
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:18,831
so I can't do it.

688
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:22,627
Ji-hyuk,

689
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:26,047
you will inherit U&K Group.

690
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:29,092
As the CEO,
is that what you're going to say to people

691
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:31,886
when you make important decisions?

692
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,055
Is that how you'll run the company?

693
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:37,809
If I take over,
I'm sure no one will ask me to explain.

694
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:45,608
No matter how good you are,

695
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:50,029
you can't beat someone
who works hand-in-hand with another.

696
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:51,989
Traditionally, a great man

697
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:54,701
must have a partner.

698
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:56,744
A great partner.

699
00:49:58,454 --> 00:49:59,497
Do you think so?

700
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,124
Yes, even your father...

701
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:09,132
Young people these days

702
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:12,468
talk nonsense about
how it's better not to get married.

703
00:50:12,552 --> 00:50:13,803
Do you feel that way too?

704
00:50:14,554 --> 00:50:15,555
Marriage...

705
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:18,182
is what I want.

706
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:21,853
There's someone I like.

707
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:25,148
Anyway.

708
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:27,900
That's that.

709
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:35,908
Do I know her?

710
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:40,455
Which family is she from? What's her name?

711
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:45,042
It's one-sided.

712
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:50,590
What?

713
00:50:51,883 --> 00:50:54,260
I studied business as told.

714
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:56,262
I went to the US branch as told.

715
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:59,682
I joined the marketing team
after you asked me to return.

716
00:50:59,766 --> 00:51:02,143
I did everything you asked, Grandfather.

717
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:03,853
This time,

718
00:51:05,438 --> 00:51:06,606
just trust me.

719
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:08,608
How dare you?

720
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:10,568
Did you think I wouldn't know?

721
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:11,652
When have you

722
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:15,072
ever done anything you didn't want to?

723
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:18,534
You listened to me
because you didn't have your own dreams.

724
00:51:18,618 --> 00:51:20,036
It was always like that.

725
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,998
Then you should know
I'll go my way this time too.

726
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,333
What? You little...

727
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:39,889
I'm letting you know.

728
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:44,060
I like someone.

729
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,899
I don't want any issues with women.

730
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:18,261
Who is this woman he's fallen for?

731
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:20,179
Look into it.

732
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:24,392
He's never made a mistake before.

733
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:26,519
That's what scares me more.

734
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:30,356
People don't just turn over
a new leaf like that.

735
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:34,777
True. He's not the kind of man
who would be persistent

736
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:36,654
about women issues.

737
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:39,115
Then...

738
00:52:40,283 --> 00:52:41,701
What about Chairman Oh?

739
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:43,870
I can't control my own son.

740
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:46,163
How can I control my grandson?

741
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:49,792
Apart from that, if he can't, he can't.

742
00:52:51,586 --> 00:52:53,629
After his mother died,

743
00:52:54,714 --> 00:52:56,382
he never spoke for long.

744
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:00,386
Why is he suddenly like this?

745
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:04,056
- Then...
- Look into it.

746
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:07,643
The sooner we nip it in the bud,
the better.

747
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:21,449
This is hard.

748
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:24,076
<i>There's a high school reunion.</i>

749
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,494
A high school reunion?

750
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,582
By chance, do I know you?

751
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:32,585
No, I just thought
you should know about it.

752
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:35,212
Why would you tell me?

753
00:53:35,296 --> 00:53:36,797
Do you remember Kang Ji-won?

754
00:53:39,342 --> 00:53:42,053
I know there was
a misunderstanding back then.

755
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:45,389
If it's okay with you,
it'd be good to clear the air.

756
00:53:45,473 --> 00:53:46,891
Misunderstanding?

757
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:50,353
No, wait. Who would it be good for?

758
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,065
It will benefit Kang Ji-won.

759
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:56,567
Please.

760
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:10,915
GOSEULJUNG

761
00:54:18,631 --> 00:54:20,633
- Yes.
- <i>Sir, where are you?</i>

762
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:22,885
<i>- Are you on your way?</i>
<i>- </i>I'm on my way.

763
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:32,353
Isn't that Baek Eun-ho?

764
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:35,189
- It is him!
- He's completely fine.

765
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:37,733
Why didn't you answer my calls?

766
00:54:37,817 --> 00:54:39,944
Wait, what are you doing here?

767
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:41,404
Actually, never mind.

768
00:54:41,988 --> 00:54:42,989
Did you just say

769
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:46,409
you and Su-min never dated?

770
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:51,664
By the way,

771
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:55,376
did you like me?

772
00:54:57,336 --> 00:54:59,880
Then why did you do that back then?

773
00:55:13,436 --> 00:55:16,480
GOSEULJUNG

774
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,768
She dressed up like that

775
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,187
to go to the reunion?

776
00:56:18,793 --> 00:56:19,877
Wait.

777
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:23,964
Stop.

778
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:25,883
What I mean to say is...

779
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,016
Sorry about that.

780
00:56:35,935 --> 00:56:37,269
Let me wipe your hand.

781
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,488
What am I doing?

782
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:55,162
I have to go now.

783
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:00,042
Yeah. Okay.

784
00:57:01,252 --> 00:57:03,712
No.

785
00:57:03,796 --> 00:57:06,966
I want to say something.

786
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:08,467
I never liked you.

787
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:11,220
That was

788
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:14,014
just a slip of a tongue.

789
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:22,022
I...

790
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:25,276
had a crush on you!

791
00:58:19,205 --> 00:58:24,168
<i>From now on, I won't just foolishly</i>
<i>stick to formalities anymore.</i>

792
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:25,794
<i>You're so pretty.</i>

793
00:58:25,878 --> 00:58:27,671
- I'm sorry.
- It made him crazy.

794
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:29,215
You look really pretty.

795
00:58:29,298 --> 00:58:32,092
You bullied her on your own,
don't come at me!

796
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:35,804
<i>Don't worry, my other half.</i>
<i>This time, I really won't let it slide.</i>

797
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,934
<i>Mr. Yu. It's nice to see you smile.</i>

798
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:42,478
I think Yu Ji-hyuk likes you.

799
00:58:43,312 --> 00:58:45,564
Right. There was a scandal about them.

800
00:58:45,648 --> 00:58:46,982
<i>Shall I just tell Ji-won?</i>

801
00:58:47,066 --> 00:58:50,194
<i>That Min-hwan will cheat</i>
<i>on her with Su-min and hurt her.</i>
