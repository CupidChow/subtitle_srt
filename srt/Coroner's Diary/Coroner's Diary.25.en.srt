[Episode 25]

3
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,560
[Marquis of Zhongyong's Mansion]

4
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,110
Your Highness looks downcast.

5
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,530
Is there something bothering you?

6
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,520
Mr. Qin, you know my true desires.

7
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,009
But as the Crown Prince,

8
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,030
there are things I must give up...

9
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,200
and others I must fight for.

10
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,530
Is it because

11
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,880
His Majesty blamed you

12
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,110
for the Crown Prince of Beidai's
recent peril?

13
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,590
Fortunately, Lady Wan saved him

14
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,100
and helped Yan Chi capture
the true culprit.

15
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,510
My failure to protect him

16
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,330
has been offset by this merit.

17
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:10,490
However, Mother

18
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,110
fears that Lady Wan might be used
by someone with ulterior motives,

19
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,240
so she wants you to

20
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,100
recommend her

21
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,280
as a candidate to be my consort.

22
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,340
But Wan

23
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,860
has already been granted
the title of Princess Yongci.

24
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,190
How could she be made a secondary consort?

25
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,360
Could it be

26
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,670
that the Empress wants her to
be the primary consort?

27
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,810
Then what would become

28
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,140
of my daughter, Zhaoyu?

29
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,170
So in your view, Royal Guardian,

30
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,450
my primary consort can only be

31
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,079
Lady Yu?

32
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,800
Your Highness, please forgive me.

33
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,260
I never meant such a thing.

34
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,180
How could I not know

35
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,930
of your love for your daughter?

36
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,710
My mother is also

37
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,920
very fond of her.

38
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,710
It's only

39
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,990
because Lady Wan is from the same clan
as your family

40
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,240
that the difference in rank

41
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,100
wouldn't create family discord—

42
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,800
that's why Mother brought this up.

43
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,960
To be honest,

44
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,060
I have also considered

45
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,240
having Wan

46
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,680
marry alongside Yu as a secondary wife

47
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,760
and become

48
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,670
a great support for Your Highness.

49
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,829
But now...

50
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,060
This is merely my mother's idea.

51
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,240
In the end, we still need
my father's approval

52
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,150
to make it so.

53
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,040
Rest assured, Royal Guardian.

54
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,130
If Zhaoyu

55
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,360
is unwilling to suffer this indignity,

56
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,690
I will also ask my mother

57
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:35,079
to arrange

58
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,960
a good marriage for her...

59
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,320
ensuring her lifelong happiness.

60
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,540
Thank you, Your Highness,

61
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,070
for your thoughtfulness
toward my daughter.

62
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,850
Your Highness.

63
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,950
This way, Your Highness.

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Quickly call for an imperial physician!

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,790
Wait.

66
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,150
Mother,

67
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,680
there's no need to trouble an  physician
for such a minor injury.

68
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,790
If word reaches the palace,

69
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,030
people might misunderstand and think

70
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,350
that I'm displeased about Qin Wan
being granted the title of princess.

71
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,000
Moyi,

72
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,790
just fetch some medicine for the wound.

73
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,520
Yes, My Lady.

74
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:07,960
Does it hurt?

75
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,140
You've never suffered

76
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,510
like this since childhood.

77
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,800
It's all because of Qin Wan.

78
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,440
If she weren't always competing
and trying to outdo others,

79
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,560
how could you end up so wronged?

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,340
Mother, don't worry.

81
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,120
After venting my feelings,

82
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,320
I feel much relieved.

83
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,580
Qin Wan earned her title
through genuine merit

84
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,320
and has been of great help
to the Crown Prince.

85
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,030
The Empress favors her out of necessity.

86
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:39,909
I am

87
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,550
not feeling wronged.

88
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,640
If you're not feeling wronged,

89
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,810
why would you hurt yourself like this?

90
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,790
Mother.

91
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,300
What bothers me

92
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,680
isn't Qin Wan,

93
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,590
but the Crown Prince.

94
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,660
How could he so casually speak of

95
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,440
arranging another marriage for me?

96
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,680
Silly girl,

97
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,330
men are the least reliable creatures.

98
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,710
Even if they cherish you deeply now,

99
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,710
after a few years, the passion will fade.

100
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,120
Moreover,

101
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,120
if the Crown Prince ascends to the throne,

102
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,700
how could you be the only one
in his harem?

103
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,080
You must remember

104
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,830
to protect your own heart.

105
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,460
I understand, Mother.

106
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,050
But it's easier said than done.

107
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,390
Xiang?

108
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,830
What are you doing...

109
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,200
These two wretched girls.

110
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,710
How dare they eavesdrop!

111
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,840
We absolutely can't let them spread
what they've heard.

112
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,760
Xiang, why are you pulling me along
like this?

113
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,350
Did Aunt see us just now?

114
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,150
Aunt?

115
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,760
You were eavesdropping...

116
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,960
Keep your voice down.

117
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,920
Have you lost your mind?

118
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,640
You've already been grounded once.

119
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,050
If Aunt finds out
that you were eavesdropping on her,

120
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,790
do you think you'll have any peace?

121
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,400
How are our days good now?

122
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,270
We're all ladies of the Qin family,

123
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,410
yet the two youngest ones have risen
above us.

124
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,920
One is set to become Crown Princess,

125
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,270
while the other has been bestowed
the title of princess

126
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,640
and is about to enjoy the high life.

127
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,640
Who has ever cared about our future?

128
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,680
I only wish to marry into a decent,
honest family.

129
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,680
Aunt will find good matches for us.

130
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,680
What good match
could she possibly arrange for us?

131
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,830
Are you really content

132
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,680
to curtsy and kneel to our younger sisters
for the rest of your life?

133
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,010
What's there to resent?

134
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,680
If I must kneel, then I kneel.

135
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,320
Besides, I'm the daughter of a concubine.

136
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,320
I was never your equal to begin with.

137
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,280
But

138
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,350
I resent it.

139
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,440
Stop them.

140
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,350
Xiang.

141
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,409
I am the Fifth Lady, born of
the principal wife of the third branch.

142
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:58,340
What do you want?

143
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,560
The Madam says

144
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,470
there's too much pollen
and too many insects in spring

145
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,680
and requests that both of you

146
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,970
return to your quarters
and remain there for a while.

147
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,580
She wants to ground me again?

148
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,410
By what right?

149
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,000
Are you referring to me
when you say "she"?

150
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,880
Slap her!

151
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,210
Please calm down, Aunt!

152
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,640
Xiang spoke disrespectfully.

153
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,990
Please don't be mad.

154
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,550
Xiang,

155
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,820
apologize now.

156
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,060
I was wrong.

157
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Please, Aunt, forgive me this once.

158
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,950
I can forgive you,

159
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,150
but have you thought about this—

160
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,230
if word spreads in the capital
about your disrespect toward your elders

161
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,980
and your improper behavior,

162
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,470
even if I forgive you,

163
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,520
you will never

164
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,100
marry into a good family.

165
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,590
Aunt, I know I was wrong.

166
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,020
Good that you know.

167
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,320
From now on, don't listen to
what you shouldn't hear,

168
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,050
and especially don't say
what you shouldn't say.

169
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,550
Otherwise,

170
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,360
don't blame me for sending you to
a family temple for penance.

171
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,460
Please rest assured, Aunt.

172
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,230
I will never dare to do that again.

173
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,080
Good girl.

174
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,190
Escort the two young ladies back.

175
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:04,850
Yes, Madam.

176
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,280
Have those four maids

177
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,320
take turns guarding their quarters' doors
in two shifts.

178
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,520
Not even a scrap of paper should get out.

179
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,360
We cannot let that wretched girl
cause any more trouble.

180
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,560
Understood.

181
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,280
I'll see to it at once, Madam.

182
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,200
I'm not drunk.

183
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,630
Go where?

184
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,510
Isn't this my home?

185
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,820
Go home?

186
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,830
I'm the heir to Prince Yi!

187
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,590
Do any of you take me seriously?

188
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,430
Who should I talk to when I go back?

189
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,210
To myself?

190
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,230
Or to you?

191
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,350
I...

192
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,660
don't have a home anymore.

193
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,320
Where should I go now?

194
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,360
I don't have a home anymore.

195
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,040
I don't have a home anymore.

196
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,290
[Funing Palace]

197
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,080
You've finally come to see me.

198
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,260
If it weren't for
your adopted granddaughter saving my life,

199
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,960
you and I

200
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,600
would have been separated by death
long ago.

201
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,050
Sister-in-law,

202
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,560
you're blessed with
good health and longevity.

203
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,680
Surely, you'll live to a hundred.

204
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,090
That's just empty flattery.

205
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,590
At our age,

206
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,410
every day we meet might be the last.

207
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,280
Your Majesty,

208
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,510
Princess Yongci is waiting outside
for your summons.

209
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,870
Wan comes to see me

210
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,560
and still needs to await a summons?

211
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,830
Let her in at once.

212
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,470
Yes, Your Majesty.

213
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,930
Look at these servants,

214
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,990
making everything more and more rigid.

215
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,740
Your Majesty, may you enjoy
boundless fortune and peace.

216
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,860
Grandma, may you have good health
and happiness.

217
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,000
No need for formalities.

218
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,090
Get up, get up.

219
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,510
Thank you, Your Majesty.

220
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,110
Come here, let me take a closer look
at you.

221
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,800
After these days in the capital,

222
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
you've become even more beautiful.

223
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,760
How is it?

224
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,680
Has Ning

225
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,140
been good?

226
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,490
Has Chi been protecting you properly?

227
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,670
They've all been very good to me

228
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,870
and haven't neglected me in the slightest.

229
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,040
I can see that your spirit and complexion
are flourishing.

230
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,080
These past days,

231
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,470
I've often asked Ning how you're doing.

232
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,830
She said the family had sent word

233
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,830
that you were safe and sound.

234
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,230
Only then did I feel at ease.

235
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,360
That's because you're so thoughtful.

236
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,830
I knew

237
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,960
all those caring letters
inquiring about me

238
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,890
definitely didn't come from Ning.

239
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,760
Let me tell you, that little monkey,

240
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,300
once she's out of the mansion,

241
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,030
is like a bird

242
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,390
desperate for freedom.

243
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,310
She wouldn't spare a thought...

244
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,080
for her poor old grandmother.

245
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,290
Grandma.

246
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,790
I think of you every day too.

247
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,560
Those caring letters

248
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,340
are from both of us,
showing our filial devotion.

249
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,860
I know, I know.

250
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,380
They're all expressions
of your filial devotion.

251
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,740
Come, sit down.

252
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,310
Greetings, Grand Princess.

253
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,200
Your Majesty, it's time for your medicine.

254
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,280
You're all so filial.

255
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,940
Look, here comes
my dose of filial devotion too.

256
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,920
Little Wan'er

257
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,240
has always personally examined
Grandmother's medicine.

258
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,720
From the herbs to the brewing temperature,

259
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,590
she even examines the dregs each time.

260
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,800
She's extremely careful.

261
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,330
That's the way it should be.

262
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,200
With such attentiveness from Wan,

263
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,730
you'll surely recover soon, sister-in-law.

264
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,330
Here, Your Majesty.

265
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,860
I still think brown sugar tastes better.

266
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,560
You instructed Ma'am Chen
not to give me any—

267
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,690
you're deliberately being mean to me.

268
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,210
Sister-in-law,

269
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,560
please listen to Wan's advice.

270
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,320
Don't act like a child

271
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,450
throwing a tantrum.

272
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,870
Alright, alright.

273
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,040
When they were young,

274
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,590
we always told them to be good.

275
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,160
Now that we're old,

276
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,630
shouldn't we listen to them
and behave too?

277
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,280
That's right.

278
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,780
Sister-in-law, you've raised
His Majesty well.

279
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,990
His Majesty is truly
the most filial of sons.

280
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,980
He pays his respects to you daily,
rain or shine.

281
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,830
His Majesty is indeed filial,

282
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,830
but

283
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,710
he's busy with state affairs every day—

284
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,750
truly exhausting.

285
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,280
His Majesty is diligent
and loves his people.

286
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,710
It's a blessing for our country.

287
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,710
Your Highness? Your Highness?

288
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,420
Your Highness.

289
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,420
Sui.

290
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,510
What's wrong?

291
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,280
Your Majesty,

292
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,560
Prince Sui has accidentally spilled ink

293
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,520
on his robe.

294
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,310
It's all right now.

295
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,450
Sui,

296
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,940
how about I take you to get changed, hmm?

297
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:55,470
Come on.

298
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,800
I'll accompany Sui to change.

299
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,680
Go ahead.

300
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,730
Let's go.

301
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,350
Why hasn't Sui recovered yet?

302
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,350
It's really not easy

303
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,710
for princes and princesses

304
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,640
to grow up safely and peacefully
in the palace.

305
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,870
This little bird belongs to Your Highness?

306
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,320
It doesn't look like one
raised by bird sellers.

307
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,980
The eunuchs caught it for you?

308
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,550
I don't understand.

309
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,280
Someone else caught it for you?

310
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,350
But I still don't get it.

311
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,700
Why doesn't

312
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,320
Your Highness just tell me directly?

313
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,180
I promise not to tell anyone else.

314
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,020
It's okay.

315
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,440
If you don't want to talk, we won't.

316
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,100
I...

317
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,400
I caught it myself.

318
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,710
Then guess—

319
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,260
is this little bird happy

320
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,290
being in a cage?

321
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,630
No.

322
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,350
It's a wild bird.

323
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,870
Now it's separated from its mother

324
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,510
and cut off from the sky,

325
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,800
with no freedom—

326
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,890
of course, it's not happy in there.

327
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,440
It can't speak,

328
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,620
so how do you know it's unhappy?

329
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,320
It can't go anywhere.

330
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,970
How could it be happy?

331
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,020
Why don't we set it free?

332
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,510
Let it return to the sky,

333
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,369
okay?

334
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,010
Okay.

335
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,510
Greetings, Your Highness.

336
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,680
Sui has always been a good boy,

337
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,080
just not very talkative.

338
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,270
I didn't expect

339
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,870
that you'd actually get him to open up.

340
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,360
Prince Sui is very intelligent.

341
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,220
A little patience is all it takes.

342
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,040
Thank you for your trouble.

343
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,770
I'll go pay my respects
to the Empress Dowager first.

344
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,270
Your Highness,

345
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,020
why don't we go see where that little bird

346
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:19,770
flew?

347
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,440
Okay.

348
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:24,960
Okay.

349
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,550
Let's go.

350
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,030
You're finally back.

351
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,230
Her Majesty has just heard from
the Crown Prince

352
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,840
that Sui is willing to speak again.

353
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,250
She was so happy
that she couldn't sit still

354
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,780
and has been asking for you.

355
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,170
Hurry along.

356
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:45,130
Grand... mother.

357
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,600
You called me "Grandmother."

358
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,710
What a good child.

359
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,420
Sui,

360
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,470
why don't you

361
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,750
go play with Ning for a while?

362
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,210
I'll come find you in a bit.

363
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,200
Let's go.

364
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,310
Be careful.

365
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,380
Let's go.

366
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,570
Has Sui's condition

367
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,440
really improved?

368
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,550
Sui's condition stems from

369
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:16,200
extreme fright,
leading to psychological obstruction.

370
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,310
Massage and medicine can only provide
temporary relief.

371
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,600
There may be relapses.

372
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,510
Is there really no other way?

373
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,290
Unless the trauma is addressed,

374
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,150
I fear he may never fully recover.

375
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,510
This poor child.

376
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,020
He witnessed his mother

377
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,820
being murdered.

378
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,160
How could he not be traumatized?

379
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,100
Sui has grown close to you,

380
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,880
which shows you have a special connection.

381
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,030
If you're willing,

382
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,640
I'll entrust him to your care.

383
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,710
You must find a way to heal
his emotional wounds.

384
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,640
I'll not fail Your Majesty's trust.

385
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,660
Alright, alright,

386
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,510
Wan has already agreed.

387
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,440
Sister-in-law,

388
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,360
let's sit.

389
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,440
Sit.

390
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,170
Chi is here.

391
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,750
Grandmother, may you enjoy good health.

392
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,750
Greetings, Great Aunt.

393
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,900
Have you finished discussing
state matters with His Majesty?

394
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,630
Quickly, sit and have some tea.

395
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,440
I cannot stay for long this time.

396
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,070
I...

397
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,550
have come to escort Princess Yongci
out of the palace.

398
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,710
What happened?

399
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,600
There's been another murder
in the capital.

400
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,280
His Majesty has personally appointed
Princess Yongci

401
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,970
to assist the Ministry of Justice
with the case.

402
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,400
If this case has reached
His Majesty's attention,

403
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,060
it must be a significant case.

404
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,820
Wan...

405
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,470
won't be in any danger, will she?

406
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,710
Please rest assured, Grandmother.

407
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,440
I will protect her with my life.

408
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:42,930
Protect her?

409
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,960
If you could truly protect her,

410
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:48,760
how could that incident
with the Princess of Beidai have happened?

411
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,230
That was my fault.

412
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,310
I failed to foresee danger,

413
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,840
which put Wan in harm's way.

414
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,400
It will never happen again.

415
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,160
I don't believe you.

416
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,900
If... if by any chance something happens,

417
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,710
it'll be our Wan who suffers.

418
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,490
Grandma, I won't suffer.

419
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:07,940
"Won't suffer?"

420
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,030
Alright, alright.

421
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:19,510
Looks like we two old women
are just worrying too much again.

422
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,470
Alright, you may go.

423
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,440
Yes.

424
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,360
Wait, wait.

425
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,390
Chi,

426
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,360
you're taking Wan with you.

427
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,370
If she so much as has a scratch,

428
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,110
I'll hold you responsible.

429
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:34,990
You have my word, Grandmother.

430
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,650
Great Aunt, please rest easy.

431
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,100
See? Look at him.

432
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,470
Chi

433
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,510
just takes her away like that.

434
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,880
I was just planning

435
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,070
to find a man for Wan—

436
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:54,070
at least someone gentle,

437
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,270
who would love her tenderly.

438
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:55,930
Tell me,

439
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,440
with Chi's temperament,
can he ever love her tenderly?

440
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,710
Won't she suffer?

441
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,160
Alright, alright.

442
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,300
"The wisest elder knows
when to turn a blind eye."

443
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,310
Since those two

444
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,880
won't speak their hearts to us,

445
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,740
let's just pretend we don't know.

446
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,070
When they get anxious enough,

447
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,930
they'll come to us naturally.

448
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,120
Calm down.

449
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,120
Just listen to me.

450
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,120
Last night, the night watchman

451
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,920
discovered the body right here.

452
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,990
The body was completely naked,

453
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,850
and the death scene was gruesome.

454
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,770
However,

455
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,120
the perpetrator was extremely careful.

456
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,550
Apart from some bloodstains,

457
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,550
there are no other clues whatsoever.

458
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,750
When Mr. Fang conducted
the initial examination,

459
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,550
he found nothing of note either.

460
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,600
Although this alley is
far from the main street,

461
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,920
it connects to many small alleys
and residences.

462
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,160
Whoever did this

463
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,710
must have passed through
at least one of them.

464
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,550
Has anyone seen
any suspicious individuals?

465
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,920
I've already had people investigate,

466
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,470
but apart from
last night's night watchman,

467
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,400
no suspicious persons were found.

468
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,960
Human blood

469
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,220
wouldn't be this dark.

470
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,030
It appears to
be mixed with something else.

471
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,470
But the amount is too small

472
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,600
to tell if it's sand or something else.

473
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,100
With so little blood here,

474
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,310
the actual crime scene

475
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,370
must be elsewhere.

476
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,560
Let's look around the area.

477
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,180
What is this place?

478
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,350
Fengqi House,

479
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,440
a famous brothel in the capital.

480
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,390
That colorful banner is
the brothel's signature sign.

481
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,420
I've never been there.

482
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:38,550
I just recognized the place
the moment I saw that banner.

483
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,590
There's a tavern behind
and a brothel in front.

484
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,280
After getting drunk,

485
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,060
many unsavory men come to
relieve themselves in this alley.

486
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,720
Let's examine the body first.

487
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,780
Your Highness.

488
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,270
Greetings, Your Highness the Princess.

489
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,330
You should address her as Master Wan.

490
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,510
Wouldn't that be somewhat disrespectful?

491
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,160
Prefect Zheng, no need to worry.

492
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,920
I believe

493
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:15,920
Master Wan

494
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,050
is not someone who stands on ceremony.

495
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,230
Such a form of address

496
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,650
is simply more convenient for her

497
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:22,100
when working outside.

498
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,960
Then I shall respectfully comply.

499
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,060
Master Wan.

500
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,450
May I ask how to address you, sir?

501
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:31,690
This is

502
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:32,670
Minister Li.

503
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,200
Minister Li,

504
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,710
this is Master Wan.

505
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,790
I didn't get to introduce you properly
back in Yuzhou,

506
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,560
so let this

507
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,520
make up for that.

508
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,310
Minister Li, I've heard of
your accomplishments before,

509
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,790
and now meeting you in person,
I see your reputation is well-deserved.

510
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,860
Though we're meeting for the first time,

511
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,440
you already know
that I prefer informality.

512
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,640
I'm truly impressed.

513
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,580
Let's save these formalities, Master Wan.

514
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,160
The body is in a horrific condition
with severe decomposition.

515
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,680
Please hurry and take a look.

516
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,990
It's still early spring,

517
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,750
so why is the body so severely decomposed?

518
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,640
Because

519
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:01,010
the deceased's skin has been
completely peeled off.

520
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,060
Raise the curtains.

521
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,540
When this body was brought in,

522
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,070
I ordered it to be preserved
in an ice cabinet.

523
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,200
But as you can see,

524
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,680
it's still deteriorating rapidly.

525
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,300
The decomposition is indeed severe.

526
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,700
I've never seen
such a cruel method before.

527
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,400
You're right.

528
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,520
The crime scene must be elsewhere.

529
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,920
With such extensive external injuries,

530
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,550
the victim must have lost
a lot of blood before death.

531
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,950
I've never seen anything like this before.

532
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,620
Please enlighten me, Master Wan.

533
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,760
Skin is
the body's greatest protective barrier.

534
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,070
Without this layer of skin,

535
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,400
the underlying flesh is exposed,

536
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,060
which becomes susceptible to
infection and flies,

537
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,430
accelerating decomposition.

538
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:23,230
That's also why external wounds fester
so easily.

539
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:05,960
Note this:

540
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,120
second examination of the flaying case.

541
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,060
Victim:

542
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,000
Male corpse with skin peeled off.

543
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:21,980
You may go.

544
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,030
I'll handle this.

545
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,920
Prefect Zheng, where is Chi?

546
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,480
Note this:

547
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,860
the victim is male.

548
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,510
Height: approximately 1.6 meters.

549
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,580
The jaw has been dislocated,

550
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,840
likely to prevent the victim from
speaking or attempting suicide.

551
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,700
All body skin has been peeled off,

552
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,710
and the wounds have already festered,

553
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,770
rendering the face unrecognizable.

554
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,470
Based on the teeth

555
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,530
and the extent of joint development,

556
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:06,640
the victim appears to
have just recently come of age.

557
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,310
So young,

558
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,880
yet he met with such misfortune.

559
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,560
Seems like

560
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,840
retribution for frequenting brothels.

561
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,020
Minister Li,

562
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,840
I believe that as a judicial official,

563
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,440
you should understand the importance of
speaking with caution.

564
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,750
No traces of sedative smoke

565
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,480
or other foreign substances
in the mouth or nose.

566
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,340
There's a slight depression
on the back of the head,

567
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,400
apparently caused by a blunt object.

568
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,350
A blow of this impact

569
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:47,270
would only render someone unconscious,

570
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,270
likely the perpetrator's method

571
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,600
of subduing the victim.

572
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:50,710
Right.

573
00:28:59,050 --> 00:28:59,720
Note this:

574
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:01,590
the victim's upper thigh

575
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,450
shows a thin, elongated incision

576
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,880
approximately 2 millimeters deep,

577
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,010
not reaching any major blood vessels.

578
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,440
Judging by the direction of the cuts,

579
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,400
the perpetrator likely used

580
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,880
a thin, sharp knife

581
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,400
to make the initial incision here

582
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,260
before removing the entire skin.

583
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,230
Approximately every 60 centimeters,

584
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,890
there are
several overlapping shallow wounds.

585
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,160
As if multiple cuts were made

586
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,290
to remove one piece,

587
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,980
likely due to
the perpetrator's wrist fatigue.

588
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,140
This suggests the knife wielder

589
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,140
is likely a physically weak person.

590
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:44,130
Note this:

591
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,640
the entire body shows
no visible fatal external injuries,

592
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,790
and while there was
significant blood loss, it wasn't lethal.

593
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,310
It's suspected that death was caused
by heart failure

594
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:54,440
due to excessive pain
during the skin-peeling process.

595
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,410
Master Wan,

596
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,320
are you saying

597
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,710
the victim was still alive

598
00:29:58,730 --> 00:29:59,930
while being skinned?

599
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,400
The wounds on the victim's body

600
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,870
all exhibit signs of contraction.

601
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,000
Only when a person is alive and injured

602
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,820
does the flesh react in this way.

603
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:08,840
Then...

604
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,640
then, the victim was
literally tortured to death?

605
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,100
Could the victim be Yan Li?

606
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,330
Impossible.

607
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:14,960
No,

608
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,690
it's similar to
the lingchi execution in history.

609
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,200
As long as the executioner's technique is
sufficiently skillful,

610
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,160
they could prolong the victim's suffering

611
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,370
without delivering the final fatal blow,

612
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:26,550
and might even use cardiac stimulants
to keep the victim conscious.

613
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,360
In this case,

614
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,400
whether the victim was given drugs

615
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,730
will only be determined after an autopsy.

616
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,360
But the color of the body's wounds

617
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,120
matches the level of decomposition,

618
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,200
suggesting the skinning process

619
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,360
lasted between 30 minutes and an hour.

620
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,640
During this period,

621
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,840
continuous skinning

622
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,270
would cause the victim
the most intense suffering.

623
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,550
The perpetrator must have
a secluded location

624
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,120
where they can work undisturbed

625
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,780
to complete the entire crime.

626
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,990
In all my years,

627
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,470
I've never witnessed such cruel methods

628
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,710
until now.

629
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,840
The perpetrator tortured the victim
by flaying him alive.

630
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,310
The method is utterly brutal,

631
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,510
causing extreme suffering to the victim.

632
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,960
Afterward, the perpetrator could still

633
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,020
meticulously clean up the dump site.

634
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,450
This shows he has a cruel nature,
different from ordinary people.

635
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,050
Mr. Fang.

636
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,650
A mercury bead?

637
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,330
Is there any cinnabar on the body?

638
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,680
There should be cinnabar
where the victim was

639
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,140
lying when being skinned.

640
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:26,970
Bai Feng!

641
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,730
Yes, Master!

642
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,350
Constable Zhan, please go invite

643
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,360
an artist to draw the victim's portrait

644
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,020
to help with identification.

645
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:44,540
But...

646
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:47,690
how could anyone portray
someone without skin?

647
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,470
A skilled artist can reconstruct a face

648
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,120
by analyzing the bone structure

649
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,550
and facial contours.

650
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:56,510
There is an artist in the capital
called Ning Buyi,

651
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,310
whose skills are quite good.

652
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,470
He often helps at the prefect's office.

653
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:00,200
I'll send for him immediately.

654
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,720
What did you send Bai Feng to do?

655
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,880
Is there something wrong
with the cinnabar?

656
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,200
In the case files left behind
by Lord Shen,

657
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,030
there is a murder case in Guanyin Town
six years ago.

658
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,990
That murder case had
three victims in total,

659
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,720
and around each victim's body,

660
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,230
there was cinnabar scattered everywhere,

661
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:37,030
along with the Black Unrighteous Flower
drawn with lead chalk.

662
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,560
Black Unrighteous Flower?

663
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:40,560
Master.

664
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,220
Your Highness.

665
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,230
Found it.

666
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,420
You may go now.

667
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,610
Yes, Master.

668
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,360
These are the postmortem reports
of the three victims from back then.

669
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,240
Though crude,

670
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,160
they still provide some information.

671
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,080
The suspect in that case was
eventually apprehended.

672
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,800
But after Lord Shen's incident,

673
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,060
all files with his annotations were
confiscated,

674
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,320
so we cannot determine

675
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,260
why exactly

676
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,150
the Guanyin Town murder case

677
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,110
was designated as a doubtful case.

678
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,570
[Postmortem Report]

679
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:10,460
Death by skin peeling.

680
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,030
Death by tongue extraction.

681
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:20,500
Death by finger amputation and freezing.

682
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,320
Skin peeling...

683
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,840
cinnabar...

684
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,630
My father wouldn't have classified

685
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,719
the case in Guanyin Town as suspicious
without reason.

686
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,469
It seems

687
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:32,150
the arrested perpetrator might not be
the real culprit.

688
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:34,230
If this case is truly connected to
the case in Guanyin Town,

689
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,590
could it be that the real culprit

690
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,420
has returned to strike again
in the capital?

691
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,610
But we can't rule out the possibility

692
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:41,760
that someone might be using that case
to incite public panic.

693
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,219
Whatever the truth may be,

694
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,630
if we don't catch the real killer of

695
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,960
this flaying case soon,

696
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,719
I'm afraid there will be more victims.

697
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,239
Is that suspect still alive?

698
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,150
Yes, he is.

699
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,900
But he refuses to confess.

700
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,840
And because this case was classified
as suspicious,

701
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,360
he's been detained in prison
awaiting execution.

702
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,560
I want you to meet him.

703
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,340

717
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,300
have never seen

718
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,330
such a gruesome sight before.

before you both.

to feel uncomfortable

00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:49,070
Someone important wants to speak with you!

741
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,150
Still pretending to be dead?

742
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,100
I'll give you something to scream about!

743
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,780
I'll...

744
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,240
Mercy, sir! I was wrong!

745
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:02,720
Get out.

746
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,110
Yes, sir.

747
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,590
If Lord Shen

748
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,670
hadn't classified your case as
questionable,

749
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,290
you'd have been beheaded in public

750
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,200
five years ago,

751
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,000
even without a confession.

752
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:23,080
Now,

753
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,680
do you still want to live?

754
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,630
Minister Shen is already dead.

755
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,950
How many more days do I have left to live?

756
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,190
If there's someone

757
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,510
as capable as Lord Shen

758
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,760
who could prove your innocence,

759
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,290
would you take that chance?

760
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,840
With a flick of my fingers, I divined

761
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,920
that the person is definitely not you.

762
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,120
You just need to know
that someone can help you.

763
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,920
Clean yourself up a bit tonight.

764
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,470
Another divination tells me

765
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:49,760
that the person is actually a woman.

766
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,860
In this prison,

767
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:01,460
I eat rotten and cold food

768
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,920
and wear tattered clothes.

769
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,960
Even if I wanted to help that noble lady,

770
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,240
I'm too weak to speak.

771
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,410
Are you asking me for favors?

772
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,160
If you truly want to live,

773
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,510
you'd better drop the tricks.

774
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:15,200
"If I want to live?"

775
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,000
You're not an heir to a prince.

776
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,270
How could you possibly save me?

777
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,170
How do you know he's not
an heir to a prince?

778
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,800
I heard it.

779
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,840
When the two of you walked in just now,

780
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,420
he was asking questions

781
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:37,120
while Your Highness was pacing around.

782
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,970
If he were an heir to a prince

783
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,190
and you were his subordinate,

784
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,840
how could he dare to walk around

785
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,570
while you were questioning me?

786
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,780
Do you know why we're here?

787
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,020
Your Highness

788
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:54,230
cares more about my life than I do myself.

789
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,280
Could it be that I

790
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,210
have finally caught a lucky break?

791
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:59,700
Mind your tongue!

792
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,860
Boss, can we drink tomorrow instead?

793
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,700
Xiaocui at Tianxiang House is
waiting for me.

794
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,180
Things haven't been peaceful lately.

795
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,380
Be careful,
or you might get skinned alive too.

796
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,180
No... that can't happen, right?

797
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,360
No wonder you can be so cheeky.

798
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,780
Even locked away in this prison,

799
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,380
you can stay well-informed.

800
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,110
During these five years in prison,

801
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,590
I've heard these rumors

802
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:26,210
and bits of gossip every day.

803
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:28,970
It's just that it's cold and damp here,

804
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:30,540
with spoiled rice and cold food...

805
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,350
Then tell me,

806
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,850
what do you want?

807
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,110
I want

808
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,480
rock sugar-braised pork knuckle.

809
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,320
Do you think you're in any position

810
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,050
to negotiate with me right now?

811
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,280
I heard that in the capital,

812
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,560
there's been a case identical to the one
in Guanyin Town.

813
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,360
Your Highness is probably even more

814
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,800
anxious than I am, right?

815
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:57,180
Fine then.

816
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,470
You can just wait here.

817
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,510
Your Highness,

818
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:04,320
the rock sugar-braised pork knuckle
must be eaten while hot!

819
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,980
That's when it's fragrant, tender,
and fall-off-the-bone soft!

820
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,670
Rock sugar-braised pork knuckle!

821
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:23,090
Rock sugar-braised pork knuckle...

822
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,320
Miss,

823
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,670
have you seen this person?

824
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,530
Never seen him.

825
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,920
Is this...

826
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,250
supposed to be a person?

827
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,070
Is it not?

828
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,100
Don't know him.

829
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,010
Never seen him.

830
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,360
Yan Li will be fine.

831
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:55,850
He will definitely be.

832
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,360
He has nine lives.

833
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,410
I will definitely find him.

834
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:02,180
Have you seen this person?

835
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:02,840
Never seen him.

836
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,770
Have you seen him?

837
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:04,630
Never seen him.

838
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:05,440
Have you seen him?

839
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,300
Never seen him.

840
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,560
Note this:

841
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,010
no obvious foreign objects
in the deceased's chest,

842
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,010
abdomen, nasal cavity, or trachea.

843
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,440
The liver and kidneys show
no signs of toxins.

844
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,880
However, the victim had consumed
a large amount of alcohol

845
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,280
prior to being abducted.

846
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,440
The heart shows no damage

847
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,570
but is pale in color,

848
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,190
consistent with syncope
caused by extreme pain,

849
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:28,280
followed by cardiac failure
due to insufficient blood flow.

850
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,540
Indeed, he was tortured to death in pain.

851
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:45,650
Note this:

852
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,450
food remnants are still present
in the stomach.

853
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:49,380
The last meal

854
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,530
was about four hours

855
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,550
before death.

856
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,960
Judging by the food remnants,

857
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:55,750
the last meal included crab.

858
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:57,230
Crab's hard to come by this season,

859
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,340
but some upscale restaurants

860
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,030
reserve it for wealthy families.

861
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:02,070
Shall we search all the restaurants
in the city?

862
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:02,630
We can't.

863
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,630
His Majesty has specifically instructed

864
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,890
that this matter concerns
the capital's security,

865
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:08,320
and we must not disturb the citizens

866
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,280
or incite panic.

867
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,230
Can you determine whether the crab was
stir-fried or steamed?

868
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,550
What's the difference?

869
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:17,880
When the body was discovered,

870
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,900
the time of death was estimated to be
within four hours,

871
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,490
indicating that the location
where the killer skinned the victim

872
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:24,310
is likely close to where the body was
dumped and where the kidnapping occurred.

873
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:25,570
And that alley where the body was dumped

874
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:27,410
has a restaurant in front
and Fengqi House behind.

875
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:28,990
That restaurant specializes in
stir-fried crab,

876
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:30,070
whereas Fengqi House

877
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,800
is famous for its steamed crab.

878
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:35,870
So young, yet already leading
a dissolute life.

879
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:45,380
What's wrong with friends
having social gatherings at a restaurant?

880
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,170
Besides,

881
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,600
Yan Li told me about that steamed crab.

882
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,410
Then you're all leading dissolute lives
at such a young age.

883
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,990
There are no heavy seasoning residues
in the stomach,

884
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,250
so it was steamed crab.

885
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:03,100
Okay...

886
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,840
Constable Zhan!

887
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,960
Go to Fengqi House immediately

888
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,240
and check which customers ordered

889
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,960
steamed crab during the afternoon

890
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,440
and evening of the day of the incident.

891
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:10,970
Yes, sir.

892
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,840
Master Wan, your deduction is
precise and thorough,

893
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,780
which reminds me of someone.

894
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:26,290
Who?

895
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,260
None other than my mentor,

896
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,820
the late Lord Shen Yi.

897
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,150
The solemnity in your expression
during the autopsy

898
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:36,400
mirrors that of

899
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,650
my mentor's demeanor

900
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,800
during autopsies.

901
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,450
I used to believe

902
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:48,200
Master Wan's autopsy skills were
unmatched.

903
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,550
If Lord Shen were still alive,

904
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:53,280
perhaps they could have learned from
each other.

905
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:55,520
I've spoken out of turn.

906
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,250
His Majesty is waiting for my report.

907
00:43:58,590 --> 00:43:59,720
I must take my leave.

908
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,760
Get there safely, Lord Li.

909
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,110
Let's go to
the Ministry of Justice prison.

910
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:17,960
Why the rush?

911
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,300
Since he said I resemble
Lord Shen somewhat,

912
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:22,470
I must quickly

913
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:24,580
resolve the suspicious case he left behind

914
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,150
to live up to this honor.
