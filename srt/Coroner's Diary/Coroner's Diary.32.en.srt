[Coroner's Diary]

2
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,840
[Episode 32]

3
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:51,360
I, daughter-in-law Shen Wan,
pay my respects to you, Father.

4
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,229
Chief General.

5
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:53,960
I, Bai Feng,

6
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,970
kowtow to you.

7
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,450
His Majesty has decreed

8
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,009
that tomorrow at 6 a.m.,

9
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,060
we shall leave the city for burial.

10
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,009
No wake

11
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,250
and no mourning?

12
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,680
His Majesty said that

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,320
Father died at the hands of
the nomadic enemies,

14
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,450
so holding a wake or mourning rite
would be a breach of propriety.

15
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,050
How could His Majesty
speak such absurd words?

16
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,370
Wan.

17
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,010
Help me.

18
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,640
Father.

19
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,290
This is Shen Wan,

20
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,840
the woman I've chosen as my wife.

21
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,970
If you suffered any injustice,

22
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,130
the two of us will definitely
seek justice for you.

23
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,640
Father, you've tragically passed away,

24
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,850
and I, Shen Wan, your daughter-in-law,

25
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,500
have to perform an autopsy.

26
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,970
If there's any offense,

27
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,500
please forgive me, Father.

28
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:14,930
Wan.

29
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,480
We only have six hours.

30
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,420
Time is tight.

31
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,380
Just tell me

32
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,930
what you need me to examine.

33
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,290
I want to know

34
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,360
whether Father was truly killed
by the nomadic enemies.

35
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:24,920
Okay.

36
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,320
I'll focus on examining the murder weapon

37
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,780
and the method of killing.

38
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,800
There're a total of

39
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,329
17 wounds on Father's body.

40
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,290
There are seven abrasions

41
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,079
on the left shoulder,

42
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,120
back,

43
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,290
right wrist bone,

44
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,570
and right calf.

45
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,730
There're four impact or collision injuries

46
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,570
on the chest and abdomen.

47
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,420
The fatal wound is on the chest,

48
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,820
caused by a sharp arrow
piercing the heart.

49
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,420
Where was Father attacked?

50
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,970
Father was attacked
while on a border patrol,

51
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,900
during a brief rest at a posthouse.

52
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,800
These are the grain husks I found

53
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,930
in Father's hair, used for horse feeding.

54
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,080
Father's limbs

55
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,960
all have groove-shaped blood stains.

56
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,610
It appears that during the fight,

57
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,960
someone threw bran in his face,

58
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,050
blocking his vision,

59
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,400
then bound his limbs.

60
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,159
This method of restraint

61
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:35,130
could even control a bull.

62
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,480
At that time,
Father was preparing to depart

63
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,740
and had sent his personal guard, Fan Xin,
to lead his horse from the backyard.

64
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,400
Father practiced martial arts continuously
throughout his life.

65
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,840
If it weren't for such a vicious method,

66
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,760
it would have been impossible
to subdue him.

67
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,960
Since the killer wanted to kill Father,

68
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,610
they could have simply used
a rope to choke him.

69
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,200
Why go to the trouble

70
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,370
to bind his limbs?

71
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,200
Unless...

72
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,580
Why is this arrow wound

73
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,560
different from ordinary ones?

74
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,480
It's a four-edged arrow.

75
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,810
This is a weapon unique to
the nomadic enemies.

76
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,760
Since the arrowhead is heavy

77
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,760
and has barbs,

78
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,680
regular bows cannot shoot them.

79
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,880
This kind of arrow can only be fired
using a hand crossbow.

80
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,960
Since they had already bound

81
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,440
Father's limbs with rope,

82
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,550
wouldn't using a hand crossbow

83
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,080
seem too deliberate?

84
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,940
Could it be that

85
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,720
they wanted to...

86
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,640
They wanted to trap Father

87
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,130
and then create the illusion of
him being shot through the heart.

88
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,159
How could they act so boldly

89
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,000
without anyone noticing?

90
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,679
By the time Fan Xin arrived,

91
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:45,610
Father had already been shot
with the arrow and died.

92
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,100
G-General...

93
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,130
General!

94
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:05,930
When the killer left,

95
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:06,890
they deliberately took the ropes

96
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,750
that bound Father's limbs

97
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,370
and left behind the four-edged arrow,

98
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,680
as if to make it known that

99
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,450
it was done by the nomadic enemies.

100
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,150
Was that a provocation against
the Shuoxi Army?

101
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,040
The nomadic enemies have harbored a deep
and long-standing hatred for Father,

102
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,760
and they reward deeds with decapitation.

103
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,320
If it was really a provocation
from the nomadic enemies,

104
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,370
Father's body would certainly
not be intact.

105
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,850
If it wasn't the nomadic enemies,

106
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,320
then someone's trying to frame them.

107
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,490
The killer must be familiar with
the nomadic enemies' weapons.

108
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,400
And they're also familiar with Father's
border patrol routes.

109
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,440
If that's the case,

110
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,210
those within the Shuoxi Army
are the most suspicious.

111
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,730
It's time to meet Fan Xin.

112
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,970
When you passed through the posthouse,

113
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,230
did you notice any traces of foreigners?

114
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,040
No.

115
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,800
After the Crown Prince of Beidai
had an accident,

116
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,260
His Lordship had already ordered
strict border inspections.

117
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,250
Then, General,

118
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,560
did you get a good look at
the assassinator's appearance?

119
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,250
No.

120
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:52,920
By the time I arrived,

121
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,180
the villains had already fled,

122
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,640
and His Lordship and our men
were already...

123
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,330
General Fan, you've followed His Lordship
for many years.

124
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,760
Have you ever seen the nomadic enemies
use rope formations

125
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,250
to encircle our soldiers and civilians?

126
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,640
Rope formations?

127
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,680
How does Your Highness know about this?

128
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,010
What do you mean by that?

129
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,160
Young Marshal, you may not know this,

130
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,560
but after you entered the capital,

131
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,960
His Lordship ordered the Tianshu Camp

132
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,280
to adapt our Zhou's meteor hammer

133
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,630
into a rope formation,

134
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,010
specifically to force
the nomadic enemies to surrender.

135
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,470
Besides the Tianshu Camp,

136
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,250
who else knows about this formation?

137
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,090
No one.

138
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,130
Such a confidential formation

139
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,970
is known only to His Lordship

140
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,650
and the soldiers of the Tianshu Camp.

141
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,000
The Tianshu Camp?

142
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,340
The Tianshu Camp

143
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,850
is a special unit within the Shuoxi Army

144
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,250
dedicated to assassinating enemy generals.

145
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,110
Could it be that

146
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,370
there really is a traitor
within the Shuoxi Army?

147
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,830
I never thought Father would die
at the hands of our own people.

148
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:12,930
Father.

149
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,180
I, Shen Wan, hereby swear that

150
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,640
no matter who killed you,

151
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,890
I will do everything in my power,

152
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,590
together with Yan Chi,

153
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,640
to avenge your bloodshed.

154
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,050
[Funing Palace]

155
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,440
I want to see my son.

156
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,040
Your Majesty, you cannot go!

157
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,850
I want to see him.

158
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,640
I beg Your Majesty
to prioritize your health above all else!

159
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,840
My son...

160
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,890
His Majesty arrives!

161
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:54,220
-I need to see him.
-Mother!

162
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,940
Mother, what are you trying to do?

163
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:00,090
-What is this for, Mother?
-I want to see my son.

164
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,730
Mother...

165
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,880
All of you, step back.

166
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,160
Quick.

167
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:08,580
Mother.

168
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,130
Please listen to me.

169
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,640
Once you've

170
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,520
fully recovered,

171
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,400
I'll

172
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,040
personally accompany you

173
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,400
to pay respects to Lin.
How does that sound?

174
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,890
By then,

175
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,040
I will only be able to see a tomb.

176
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,280
Don't stop me. Let me go!

177
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,130
Mother. Mother.

178
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:31,760
I had no choice in this matter, either.

179
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,890
I am not only his elder brother,

180
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,210
but also the ruler of this country.

181
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,920
I have to prioritize state affairs.

182
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,670
What does that matter?

183
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,850
Lin was

184
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,250
always loyal to you.

185
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,670
Since your coronation,

186
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,330
he guarded the border for over 20 years.

187
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,810
Without your orders,

188
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:00,120
he would never step a foot
beyond the Shuoxi border,

189
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,890
yet you always treated him
as a grave threat.

190
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,970
Even after his death,

191
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,980
you were stingy
in handling his funeral matters.

192
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,370
What kind of emperor are you?

193
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,630
What kind of elder brother are you?

194
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,640
Mother, it's all my fault

195
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,640
for making you so heartbroken.

196
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,250
But Mother,

197
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,800
Lin's sudden death

198
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,680
will surely cause turmoil
at the border and in court.

199
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,210
I

200
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:36,520
have no choice but
to simplify the funeral ceremonies.

201
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,280
It's also to stabilize the border

202
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,880
and ensure a smooth transfer

203
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:43,370
of the Shuoxi Army's command.

204
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,920
For the sake of your court,

205
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,890
I've compromised again and again.

206
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,210
Am I supposed to compromise to the point
where I can't even

207
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,970
see my son one last time?

208
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,620
I might as well

209
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,640
not serve as Empress Dowager anymore!

210
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,130
Mother!

211
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,350
Is it that

212
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,440
you only

213
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,040
care about Lin?

214
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,180
Then what about me?

215
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,090
I am

216
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,230
also your

217
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,130
own flesh and blood.

218
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,370
Are you saying the victim

219
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,230
was Prince Jin's personal guard,

220
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,640
Song Xiwen?

221
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,890
A man who should have been imprisoned
in the Imperial Punishment Department

222
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,620
ended up dead
at the Disgraced Prince's mansion.

223
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,290
This matter

224
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,160
is indeed suspicious.

225
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,680
Your Majesty.

226
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,130
The case of the Disgraced Prince
has long been concluded.

227
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,470
Even if the deceased is truly Song Xiwen,

228
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,520
he's merely a guard of no consequence
to the bigger picture,

229
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,160
and escaping prison
is itself a capital offense.

230
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,800
If we investigate this case further,

231
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,250
stirring up settled matters

232
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,370
and muddying clear waters,

233
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,560
it would be unwise.

234
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:45,810
Your Majesty.

235
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:48,250
Marquis of Zhongyong makes a valid point.

236
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,440
However, there are many rumors about
the male corpse found

237
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,160
at the Disgraced Prince's mansion,
and if we neglect to investigate,

238
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,680
I fear it will only
increase public suspicion

239
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,480
and create new complications over
the Disgraced Prince's old case.

240
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,520
Li Muyun.

241
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,860
Yes, Your Majesty.

242
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,010
This case was to be supervised
by your Supreme Court.

243
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,660
How do you plan to handle it?

244
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,890
Your Majesty.

245
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,110
I believe

246
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,970
this case must be investigated.

247
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,370
For the reputation of the Supreme Court,
it must be investigated.

248
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,850
For the peace of the court,
it must be investigated even more.

249
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,210
I am willing to thoroughly
investigate this case,

250
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,400
so as to provide Your Majesty,

251
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,490
the court,

252
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,770
and the people of Zhou
with a proper explanation.

253
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,950
Since Prince Rui has recently passed away,

254
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,710
his son, Yan Chi, is in mourning.

255
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,130
Thus, this case shall be

256
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,680
handled by Prince Cheng, Yan Qi,
as the acting official.

257
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,160
The Supreme Court shall assist
Prince Cheng in supervising this case.

258
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,090
-Yes, Father.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

259
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:59,260
[Funing Palace]

260
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:12,480
Why have you returned so soon?

261
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,079
Is everything taken care of?

262
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:16,230
Father has been properly buried.

263
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,400
Given the current situation,

264
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,530
the sooner I return,

265
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,530
the more at ease His Majesty will be.

266
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:22,460
Do you know that

267
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,480
His Majesty has assigned Song Xiwen's case

268
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,770
to Prince Cheng?

269
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:26,800
I do.

270
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:29,960
Wan.

271
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,480
If I lose my position
at the Ministry of Justice

272
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,210
and fail to inherit the throne,

273
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,770
would you still be willing to marry me?

274
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,480
I could open a medical clinic

275
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,530
and support you quite comfortably.

276
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:47,630
Yan Chi.

277
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,240
I don't want to wait for
some auspicious date anymore.

278
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,530
I'll go ask the Empress Dowager
to grant us permission to marry.

279
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,790
It's just I don't know if you're willing.

280
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:56,960
Wan...

281
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,220
Your Highness, Princess Yongci.

282
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,130
The Empress Dowager has risen.

283
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,200
Thank you, Madam.

284
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,480
Your Majesty.

285
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,660
Your father, he...

286
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,610
Grandmother.

287
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,610
Father spent his entire life
on the battlefield.

288
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,010
He had long been prepared
for this outcome.

289
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,640
I've arranged everything for his funeral.

290
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,500
Please take good care of yourself

291
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,700
and try to accept this loss.

292
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,290
Your Majesty.

293
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,020
Please let me check your pulse.

294
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,970
This is a heart ailment.

295
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,250
Once I come to terms with it,

296
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,260
I will be fine.

297
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,850
Grandmother.

298
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,090
Father spent his entire life
on the battlefield,

299
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,020
never having a single day of peace.

300
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,070
Before he passed away,

301
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,640
I failed to let him see me get married
or establish a career.

302
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,720
I wish to wed Princess Yongci
as soon as possible

303
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,400
during the mourning period

304
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,550
to comfort Father's spirit,

305
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,860
so he may rest in peace.

306
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,970
I hope you will grant this wish,
Grandmother.

307
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,630
Marrying during the mourning period

308
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,370
will surely invite criticism.

309
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,120
If the ceremony has to be simple,

310
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,690
I fear it would be unfair to you.

311
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:42,650
Your Majesty.

312
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,610
This is what I originally wanted
to ask of you,

313
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:45,960
but Yan Chi beat me to it.

314
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,380
I've even worked as a coroner,

315
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,740
so why would I fear others' criticism?

316
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,460
As long as Yan Chi and I are of one mind,

317
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,680
I won't feel wronged.

318
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,430
Heaven took away one of my sons,

319
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:20,950
but in return, it gave me
such a wonderful granddaughter-in-law.

320
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,530
So be it.

321
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,440
I'll have the Imperial Astronomical Bureau
select an auspicious date

322
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,850
for your wedding.

323
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,650
-Thank you, Grandmother.
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

324
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,890
Royal Guardian, Madam.

325
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,640
Prince Cheng

326
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,040
wishes to take Lady Xiang
as his concubine.

327
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,480
He hopes you will accept
these betrothal gifts

328
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,080
and make preparations soon.

329
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,560
Our Qin family tradition

330
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,480
forbids legitimate daughters
from becoming concubines.

331
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,920
There must be some misunderstanding
on Prince Cheng's part.

332
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,290
Prince Cheng specifically emphasized that

333
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,640
Lady Xiang volunteered
to be his concubine.

334
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,400
If Your Grace has any doubts,

335
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,720
why not ask Lady Xiang to come out
and confirm it with her yourself?

336
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,850
That's impossible!

337
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,200
A daughter of our Qin family

338
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,440
could never serve as someone's attendant!

339
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,200
I am willing.

340
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,680
Don't talk nonsense!

341
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,900
Zhaoyu will soon marry into
the Eastern Palace.

342
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,890
If you become Prince Cheng's concubine,

343
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,090
where will the reputation of the Empress,
the Crown Prince,

344
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,440
and the Qin family

345
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,480
stand?

346
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,920
I'm the eldest legitimate daughter
of the third branch.

347
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,550
What does it have to do with Zhaoyu

348
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,420
whether I become a consort or concubine?

349
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,350
-Honey.
-You...

350
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,780
Please go back and tell Prince Cheng that

351
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,770
this matter has come up suddenly.

352
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,290
After I get to understand
the full situation,

353
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,220
I will give His Highness my answer.

354
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,430
I, Xiang, have been unfilial.

355
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:01,060
I've already been intimate
with Prince Cheng.

356
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,000
Prince Cheng promised

357
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,640
he would treat me well for life.

358
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,120
I beg you to offer your blessings,
Uncle and Aunt.

359
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,130
You wretch!

360
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:09,230
Your Grace.

361
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:10,770
Lady Xiang

362
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:13,090
is now Prince Cheng's concubine.

363
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,380
Even if you wish to discipline her,

364
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,200
you should show some restraint.

365
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,330
Get out of here.

366
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,130
Our Qin family

367
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,100
will not tolerate a disgrace like you!

368
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,350
Get out!

369
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,480
Wanhe, let's go.

370
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,370
Lady Xiang.

371
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,470
I...

372
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,810
I wish to stay and serve Lady Shuang.

373
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,480
So even you're betraying me now?

374
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,290
Since Lady Xiang
has made her thoughts clear,

375
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,160
I shall take my leave now.

376
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,120
Lady Xiang.

377
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:02,570
Please.

378
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,660
The humiliation I suffered today,

379
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,370
I will remember all of it.

380
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,120
When I rise to power in the future,

381
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,890
don't you regret it!

382
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,880
I'm Qi Yu, strategist under Chief General.

383
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,710
[Prince Rui's Mansion]

384
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:40,130
I pay my respects to you,
Young Marshal and Princess Yongci,

385
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,730
on behalf of the Shuoxi Army.

386
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,930
No need for such formality, Sir.

387
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,640
How are things with the Shuoxi Army?

388
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,530
His Majesty ordered

389
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:51,260
the Ministry of War to directly take over
the Shuoxi Army's command

390
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,860
and reassigned Chief General's deputies
away from Shuoxi.

391
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:57,160
Since the cause of Chief General's death
remains unclear,

392
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,440
our men are filled with anger

393
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,160
and refused to obey the transfer orders.

394
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,430
Now, they've been detained
for disobeying military orders.

395
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,290
The Crown Prince and Prince Cheng

396
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:07,570
have taken this opportunity
to place their men in position.

397
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:08,440
So soon.

398
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:12,090
They're finally going
to reveal their true colors.

399
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,810
This reassignment from the Ministry of War

400
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,000
is the escape route
I've arranged for our men.

401
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,130
It can at least ensure everyone's safety.

402
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,370
As long as we're still alive,

403
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,830
the spirit of the Shuoxi Army
will never die.

404
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,330
As long as I still have a breath left,

405
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,210
I'll seek justice for Father

406
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,150
and avenge him.

407
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:28,890
I, Qi,

408
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,030
on behalf of all Shuoxi soldiers,

409
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,510
thank you, Young Marshal.

410
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:37,970
Please rise.

411
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,290
This is what I should do.

412
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,480
In Chief General's entire life,

413
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,480
he only sought to have no shame
before Heaven

414
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,810
and the people of Zhou.

415
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,440
I found this

416
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,770
while sorting through
Chief General's belongings.

417
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:01,090
It was clearly something he treasured,

418
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,260
so I came personally

419
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,410
to return it to you, Young Marshal.

420
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:18,430
Thank you, Sir.

421
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,690
My condolences, Young Marshal.

422
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,000
Could this be...

423
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,810
This is a portrait of Mother

424
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,240
specially commissioned by Father.

425
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,990
It's exactly the same as the one
in his study.

426
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,720
Father and Mother

427
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,350
truly shared a deep and devoted love.

428
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,600
Why is there blood

429
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:40,000
on this hair ribbon?

430
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:43,230
This is the hair ribbon
that the Empress Dowager

431
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,810
personally made for me
when I went to Shuoxi at age eight.

432
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,020
I didn't expect Father to have kept it
all this time.

433
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:19,770
Sadly, my beloved wife
passed away too soon;

434
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:22,500
I pity my son, left motherless
and awaiting care.

435
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:25,130
Yet I have a duty to guard our land,

436
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:27,210
and His Majesty's orders cannot be defied.

437
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,070
Despite countless reluctances,

438
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:31,050

524
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,590
So Father always knew that

525
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,830
His Majesty was wary of him all along.

526
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:10,410
He trusted me.

527
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,720
Father understood
your loyalty and sincerity.

528
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,240
He had never doubted you.

529
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:20,680

00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,440
you did it for him,

531
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,050

532
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:45,980
Get out.

533
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,280
As the crown prince of a country,

534
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,920
acting so flustered and panicked,

535
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,130
how inappropriate.

536
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,330
Mother, have you heard?

537
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,770
Father has assigned the Song Xiwen case

538
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,170

539
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:01,130
So what?

540
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,090
Yan Qi has been eager

541
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,810

for a long time.

542
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:04,370

543
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,290
If he finds out that

544
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,160
it was you
who secretly released Song Xiwen,

545
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,610
he will certainly use it to cause trouble.

546
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:11,540
Shut your mouth!

547
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:13,440

has nothing to do with us.

549
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,680
Let them investigate all they want.

550
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,400
It won't implicate us.

551
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:23,190
Just focus on being the Crown Prince
without worry.

552
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:33,610
Father.

553
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,180
The attendants responsible for
guarding Song Xiwen

554
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,160
all refused to confess.

555
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,920
I had no choice but
to use severe punishment,

556
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,650
and finally one attendant confessed.

557
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:42,380
The one who took Song Xiwen away

558
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:45,530
was the Empress's personal attendant,

559
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,240
Wan Xi.

560
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,760
Then where is

561
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,090
Wan Xi's confession statement?

562
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,960
Since this matter involves the Empress,

563
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,370
without your permission, Father,

564
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,040
I

565
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:06,530
dare not act on my own.

566
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,290
Stop putting on

567
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:12,070
that act in front of me.

568
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,580
Convey my order:

569
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:16,820
bring Wan Xi in for interrogation.

570
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:19,889
As you command, Father.

571
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:35,750
Wan Xi.

572
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,210
Yes, Your Majesty.

573
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,250
I will take good care of your family.

574
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,290
Go with peace of mind.

575
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:49,880
Thank you for your kindness, Your Majesty.

576
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,750
[Prince Rui's Mansion]

577
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:10,660
Sir, do you know

578
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,040
if there's anyone

579
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,040
in the Tianshu Camp

580
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,170
who was promoted to officer
without military merit?

581
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:18,080
Only the former training officer
of the Tianshu Camp,

582
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,740
Jiang Heying. A few years ago,

583
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,650
he said he wanted to return home
to care for his elderly mother.

584
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,170
Chief General appreciated
his filial piety,

585
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:27,170
so he recommended him for the position of
Chief Commander in his hometown, Qianzhou.

586
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,890
Why are you asking about this,
Young Marshal?

587
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,960
Because the method used
to assassinate my Father

588
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,000
is consistent with
Tianshu Camp's techniques.

589
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,850
Only those involved in developing

590
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,810
the Tianshu Camp's combat formations

591
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:37,670
would know the critical details.

592
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,210
The soldiers of the Shuoxi Army

593
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:41,210
all revere Chief General like a god.

594
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,690
How could they commit
such a treasonous act?

595
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,960
I personally performed the autopsy
on Prince Rui.

596
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,120
The wounds on his body don't lie.

597
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:50,220
Jiang Heying

598
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:53,700
owes everything he has today
to Chief General's promotion.

599
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,120
How could he dare to kill Chief General

600
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,960
and turn against the Shuoxi Army?

601
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,890
What if there was someone with power
greater than Father

602
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,220
who ordered him to do so?

603
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:05,690
What if he believed that person
could protect him

604
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,690
and offer him a better future?

605
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,890
Chief General already held
such high position and power.

606
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:15,080
The only ones with greater power
than Chief General are...

607
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:15,890
His Majesty,

608
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,230
or the future emperor.

609
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,370
Young Marshal, are you referring to...

610
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:21,370
The Crown Prince?

611
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:24,670
The Empress's father and brothers
command the Northern Palace Army.

612
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:27,290
There's no need for them
to win over the Shuoxi Army as well.

613
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:28,730
Besides, His Majesty has already
expressed dissatisfaction

614
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,370
with the Crown Prince's obsession
with literature

615
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:32,250
and lack of interest in state affairs.

616
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,810
Everyone at court knows this.

617
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:35,420
His Majesty's always turned a blind eye
to Prince Cheng's

618
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,000
open and covert suppression
of the Crown Prince.

619
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,770
If Jiang Heying wanted to earn merit
by supporting the future emperor,

620
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:41,000
of course he would choose

621
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,400
the currently ascendant

622
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,320
Prince Cheng.

623
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,730
So it's him.

624
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,170
Besides, Jiang Heying

625
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,650
was deeply trusted by Father,

626
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:50,400
and he knows
Father's fighting skills well.

627
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,710
He also knows the border patrol routes

628
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,840
better than anyone.

629
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,930
As well as your whereabouts.

630
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:57,120
If Jiang Heying has been colluding with
Prince Cheng for long, then the mastermind

631
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,440
behind the assassination attempt
on you and Father

632
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,500
was very likely Prince Cheng, Yan Qi.

633
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,370
If it was Prince Cheng,

634
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:05,300
we still have ways to deal with him.

635
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:07,400
But if the one who ordered Jiang Heying

636
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,920
is His Majesty himself,

637
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,120
what should we do then?

638
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,210
Whether it's His Majesty or Prince Cheng,

639
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:14,870
we must proceed with caution.

640
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,370
The top priority now

641
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:19,250
is to protect the current strength
of the Shuoxi Army.

642
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,850
I have to trouble you, Sir, to return
to Shuoxi

643
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:21,920
and tell our men

644
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,920
to lie low for now,

645
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,480
until I uncover the truth.

646
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,140
Then we'll plan our next move.

647
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,250
As you command, Young Marshal.

648
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,890
This time,
we might be stirring up a hornet's nest.

649
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:35,750
Are you afraid?

650
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,520
No.

651
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,710
Master, Princess Yongci.

652
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:45,480
His Majesty has ordered Prince Cheng
to interrogate Wan Xi from Fengyi Palace.

653
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,040
Did the Empress not intervene?

654
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:47,690
No.

655
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,440
This Wan Xi seemed prepared.

656
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,040
He went obediently with Prince Cheng.

657
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,890
How could someone as dominant
as the Empress

658
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:55,350
allow Wan Xi to be taken away
by Prince Cheng?

659
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,170
She was just cutting her losses.

660
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,370
I wasn't certain before

661
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:59,810
whether Song Xiwen's death

662
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,560
had anything to do with the Empress.

663
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,720
But now it seems

664
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,600
it was indeed her doing.

665
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,140
Wan Xi was so compliant,

666
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,600
as if he'd already resigned to his fate.

667
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,850
This time, Prince Cheng

668
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,780
will likely come up empty-handed.

669
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,140
Your Highness.

670
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,170
Attendant Wan is not a murder suspect.

671
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:48,330
Such torture

672
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:49,920
seems rather inappropriate.

673
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,520
If he had confessed earlier,

674
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:54,060
he would have been spared such suffering,

675
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:55,990
but he refuses to talk.

676
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,290
But confessions obtained through torture

677
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:00,150
are bound to contain falsehoods,

678
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,210
and it violates the law as well.

679
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:04,250
Prefect Zheng, you seem
to have forgotten that

680
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,850
this is the Supreme Court,

681
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,850
not the capital prefecture.

682
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,960
If you find this distasteful,
Prefect Zheng,

683
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,520
the exit is right over there.

684
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,370
Feel free to leave.

685
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:14,960
Your Highness.

686
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,820
Your Highness.

687
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,600
His Majesty ordered me and Prefect Zheng
to oversee the interrogation.

688
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,310
If he

689
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,000
dies under torture,

690
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,190
and His Majesty inquires about it,

691
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:25,790
I'm afraid I would have to
report the truth.

692
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:30,560
Your Highness.

693
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,750
Wan Xi's heart and lungs
are already damaged.

694
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,500
I'm afraid he won't survive another round.

695
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,360
Send Wan Xi back to Fengyi Palace.

696
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:36,960
Whether to save him or not

697
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,400
is entirely up to Her Majesty.

698
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,530
Yes, Your Highness.

699
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,780
[Funing Palace]

700
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,370
Ze.

701
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,650
Please let my grandma win this time.

702
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:10,650
If she loses,

703
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,650
she'll make me practice Go
with her again.

704
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,170
Don't you mock me.

705
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,600
My Go skills
have improved greatly lately.

706
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,460
I've beaten His Majesty
three times in a row.

707
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,890
I'm about to win this game.

708
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:21,850
Grand Princess,

709
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,370
you actually beat His Majesty?

710
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:24,970
His Majesty is a master of Go.

711
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:26,650
Before I went out to seek a doctor,

712
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:27,960
I played Go with His Majesty

713
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,290
and never won even once.

714
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:32,370
His Majesty is busy with court affairs.

715
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,940
Not to mention playing Go,

716
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,110
he hasn't had

717
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,180
any leisure time these years.

718
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,920
His Majesty is diligent in his governance.

719
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,250
It's truly exhausting.

720
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,120
Please.

721
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,380
Little Wan'er, come here.

722
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,600
If my grandma wins this Go game,

723
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,200
she'll give us some rewards.

724
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,770
Greetings, Your Majesty.

725
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:54,440
Grandma.

726
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,860
Why are you here alone?

727
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,730
Didn't Chi come with you?

728
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,560
He...

729
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:04,070
He asked me to come
check Your Majesty's pulse.

730
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,370
Chi is always so thoughtful.

731
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,440
I'm feeling tired anyway.

732
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,810
You can continue

733
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:13,770
this Go game another day.

734
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:14,960
Indeed.

735
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,170
We've been bothering you for too long.

736
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:17,960
Wan.

737
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,090
After checking her pulse,
let Sister-in-law rest well.

738
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:22,790
Ning, let's go.

739
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,450
See Grand Princess out.

740
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,250
Yes.

741
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,290
What is it?

742
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,410
Nothing too serious.

743
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,040
It's just Yan Chi and I have
some questions about the Song Xiwen case,

744
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,900
on which we would like your guidance,
Your Majesty.

745
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:52,730
Song Xiwen?

746
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,890
Is Song Xiwen that guard
from Prince Jin's residence?

747
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:56,560
Yes.

748
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:58,690
An attendant from
the Imperial Punishment Department

749
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:00,650
confessed that it was Wan Xi,
the Empress's personal attendant,

750
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,050
who took Song Xiwen away.

751
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,520
Therefore, Prince Cheng arrested Wan Xi

752
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,890
and tortured him severely,

753
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:06,690
but he didn't confess anything.

754
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,460
Wan Xi once served me in the palace.

755
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,680
He's extremely loyal,

756
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:14,200
but also very stubborn.

757
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,170
If he doesn't want to talk,

758
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:17,650
no one can make him.

759
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:19,560
But there's no smoke without fire.

760
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,330
For this attendant
to specifically bring Wan Xi's name up,

761
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,790
even if he said nothing,

762
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,690
there must be some connection.

763
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:27,690
Since it involves Prince Jin,

764
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,220
Yan Chi is quite concerned.

765
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,560
Chi always refuses to believe

766
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,730
that Prince Jin would do such a thing.

767
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:35,440
So he wants to find out

768
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,370
what exactly happened that night.

769
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:40,220
Prince Jin is a good boy
and a good brother.

770
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,090
Among all the princes,
he's closest to Chi.

771
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,400
Make sure to investigate this case
thoroughly,

772
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,920
so that we can give Prince Jin
an explanation.

773
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,380
Whatever you want to know,

774
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,980
I'll tell you everything.

775
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,290
Years ago,

776
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,610
I heard that Wan Xi adopted

777
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:57,870
a godson

778
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,330
named Wang Han in the Imperial Guard,

779
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:00,960
who earned Wan Xi's complete trust.

780
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,670
Master.

781
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,290
To catch this guy,

782
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,960
it took several of our men to tie him up.

783
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,020
Who is your master?

784
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,170
Who are you people?

785
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:11,110
Why is he so terrified?

786
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,300
I hear a woman's voice.

787
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,400
Are you from the palace?

788
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:14,950
I...

789
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:16,700
I won't betray Her Majesty!

790
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:18,710
I don't want the money or

791
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:20,960
my position in the Imperial Guard anymore!

792
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:21,960
Please, let me go!

793
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:22,960
And let... Let...

794
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,770
Let my family go!

795
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,400
Don't let him talk nonsense.

796
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,960
Gag him and bury him now.

797
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:29,210
Yes.

798
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:30,920
No, please don't!

799
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:31,700
I... I...

800
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,780
Stop talking nonsense here. Shut up!

801
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:36,380
Don't worry, Madam.

802
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,590
Once this pit is dug,

803
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:40,040
we'll make sure he dies

804
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,400
without a sound.

805
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,030
As you command.

806
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,210
You fool.

807
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,580
Did you really think
you'd make it out alive?

808
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,060
Her Majesty already said

809
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:58,430
you shouldn't be left any way
to survive.

810
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,600
Don't run! Stop right there!

811
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:14,810
Stop right there!

812
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:15,600
Stop!

813
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,170
Don't run!

814
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:28,250
Help!
Someone's trying to kill and silence me!

815
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,390
Help!

816
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,560
Sir, please help me!

817
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,480
Gentler, okay?

818
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,730
Sir, they're trying to kill
and silence me!

819
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:36,400
Help me, Sir!
