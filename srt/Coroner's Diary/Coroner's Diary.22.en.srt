[Coroner's Diary]

2
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,940
[Episode 22]

3
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,120
Your Majesty.

4
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:36,820
Your Majesty.

5
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:37,950
At the beginning of the new year,

6
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,479
if the people don't see the Emperor,
Empress, and Crown Prince,

7
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,350
it may cause unrest.

8
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,759
Your Majesty,

9
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,160
please put the welfare
of the nation first.

10
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,000
The Empress Dowager is gravely ill.

11
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,940
I'm in no mood to celebrate
with the people.

12
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,509
Your Majesty,

13
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,039
the Empress Dowager's condition

14
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,000
is still unclear and critical.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,950
I believe

16
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,970
you should first visit her
at Funing Palace,

17
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,210
then go to Zhenghua Gate

18
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,920
once her condition stabilizes.

19
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,120
The people will surely understand
your filial devotion.

20
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,740
Your Highness, do you remember
that medical fairy?

21
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,230
What medical fairy?

22
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,160
Please be careful with your words.

23
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,120
Why?

24
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,770
Didn't Miss Qin earn that title

25
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,390
after saving the Grand Princess?

26
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,920
That can't be false, can it?

27
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,410
What's all the noise over there?

28
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,510
Father,

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,310
Miss Qin from the Qin family is known as
the "medical fairy."

30
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,240
She must have a way to save Grandma.

31
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,510
Your Majesty,

32
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,730
my ninth sister's
so-called title of "medical fairy"

33
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,800
is just local gossip from Jingzhou.

34
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,510
She's still young—

35
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,270
hardly worthy of such a title.

36
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,920
Whether it's gossip or not,

37
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,920
she did cure Great Aunt, didn't she?

38
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:51,600
Chi.

39
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:52,750
Yes.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,960
Is what they say

41
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,250
about Miss Qin being the "medical fairy"

42
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,590
true?

43
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,660
Miss Qin

44
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,960
did treat the Grand Princess.

45
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,750
Greetings, Your Majesty.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,860
Are you confident you can cure
the Empress Dowager?

47
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,470
Your Majesty,

48
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,770
I am willing to try my best.

49
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,070
This concerns the Empress Dowager's life.

50
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,030
How can I let you just "try"?

51
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,000
Your Majesty,

52
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,579
when I said I'd try my best,

53
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,920
I meant I haven't yet examined
Her Majesty.

54
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,360
Doctors are not gods.

55
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,040
Without seeing the patient,

56
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,470
I cannot say for sure.

57
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,840
So whether I should try or not

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,360
is for you to decide.

59
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,600
So you're saying

60
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,290
if you cure her, it's your skill;

61
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,870
if you don't,

62
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,420
it's His Majesty's fault for choosing you?

63
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,060
You're quite calculating

64
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,050
for someone so young.

65
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,840
It's just a child's foolish words.

66
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,770
Please forgive her, Your Majesty.

67
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,310
Your Majesty,

68
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,490
Miss Qin is still young.

69
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,900
Though talented,

70
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,350
her experience is limited.

71
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,350
It's better to let
the imperial physicians handle it.

72
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,300
Empress, Crown Prince,

73
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,150
go to Zhenghua Gate immediately.

74
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,750
I will join you shortly.

75
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,700
This concerns the Empress Dowager's
safety.

76
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,950
I will personally take you
to Funing Palace.

77
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,880
Get in the carriage!

78
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,560
Your Majesty.

79
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,540
Your Majesty.

80
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,500
Your Majesty, please wake up.

81
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,990
Your Majesty, please wake up.

82
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,570
-Your Majesty.
-Ma'am Chen.

83
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,720
At this point,

84
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,680
it's better to report to His Majesty

85
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,270
and make early...

86
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,070
What?

87
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,220
Your Majesty, please forgive us.

88
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,180
Her Majesty's pulse indicates danger.

89
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,440
And yesterday, Chief Physician Hu
suddenly fell ill and is unable to come.

90
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,400
I've tried every method,

91
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,270
but...

92
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,100
Miss Qin,

93
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,170
come.

94
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,830
How is the Empress Dowager?

95
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,800
There's no external injury on her head.

96
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,170
There is blood in her nasal cavity,

97
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,770
but none on her lips or mouth.

98
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,430
She has dark bruising around her eyes,

99
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,510
purple lips,

100
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,730
swollen internal organs,

101
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,990
and rigid, paralyzed limbs.

102
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,630
This is caused by cold invading
her liver and spleen,

103
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,630
leading to ulcers
from prolonged accumulation.

104
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,730
Cold penetrated the muscles of her limbs.

105
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:21,550
She should often feel numbness
and coldness in her legs, making sleep difficult.

106
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,340
Ma'am Chen,

107
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,130
did Her Majesty vomit during the day?

108
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,390
Tell the truth. Do not hide anything.

109
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:29,870
Yes.

110
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,970
Besides numbness in her legs,

111
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,870
does Her Majesty also feel stabbing pain?

112
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,110
Has she been unable to speak

113
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,670
since she fell?

114
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,240
My Lady, you're right.

115
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,190
During the day,

116
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,860
after lunch, Her Majesty did vomit.

117
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,140
While resting,
she felt numbness and pain in her legs,

118
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,940
so she ate very little at dinner.

119
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:47,920
After she fell,

120
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,250
there was blood in her nose.

121
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,220
Afterwards,
she not only lost the ability to speak

122
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,880
but also became unconscious.

123
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,220
Were you by her side

124
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,650
when she fell?

125
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,440
Yes.

126
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,570
I tried to hold her,

127
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,860
but couldn't support her fully,

128
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,060
so she fell onto me.

129
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,690
Ma'am Chen held Her Majesty just in time.

130
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:08,020
The nosebleed and unconsciousness
are likely unrelated to external injury.

131
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,810
Your Majesty, I can confirm

132
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,100
Her Majesty's coma is caused
by wind evil invading the brain,

133
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,450
resulting in pressure on the vessels.

134
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,210
Well...

135
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,520
can you save her?

136
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,270
Has it been two hours

137
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,430
since Her Majesty fell ill?

138
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,290
It will be two hours in 45 minutes.

139
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,860
Your Majesty, the first two hours

140
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,080
are the optimal time
for treating wind symptoms.

141
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,310
If you trust me,

142
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,870
I'll try my best.

143
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,070
Very well.

144
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,860
Whatever you need,

145
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,530
they will cooperate fully.

146
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,150
Thank you, Your Majesty.

147
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,450
Ma'am Chen, please bring me
Her Majesty's prescription.

148
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,210
Here.

149
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,590
This prescription is excellent.

150
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,870
It just needs two mace

151
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,400
each of Tianlong and Dilong.

152
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,480
These two herbs

153
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,930
promote blood circulation
and remove stasis

154
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,200
but are toxic.

155
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,410
Her Majesty's Qi and blood are weak.

156
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,010
How could she withstand
such strong medicine?

157
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,480
If it harms her lifespan...

158
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,460
Strong medicine cures disease;

159
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,550
harsh measures
are for critical conditions.

160
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,870
If she dies,

161
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,270
what use are Qi and blood?

162
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,600
Let alone her lifespan.

163
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,810
But Her Majesty cannot swallow.

164
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,090
If the decoction can't be administered,

165
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,290
it's useless.

166
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,640
Wait until she regains consciousness
to give her the decoction,

167
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,820
so it doesn't enter her airway

168
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,280
and cause further danger.

169
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,770
Since it's dangerous,

170
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,680
why did you force
the medicine on her earlier?

171
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,020
Your Majesty, please forgive us.

172
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,750
We tried everything to wake Her Majesty,

173
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,350
but nothing worked.

174
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,549
We had no choice
but to try this last resort.

175
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,140
You...

176
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,200
Your Majesty,

177
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,909
before administering the medicine,

178
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,179
the imperial physicians
have bled her philtrum

179
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,919
and the twelve jing points.

180
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,510
The treatment itself was proper,

181
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,710
but it was too cautious to be effective.

182
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,080
Too cautious?

183
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,540
They were more concerned
with avoiding blame

184
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,940
than achieving results.

185
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,030
Your Majesty, physicians are not gods.

186
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,500
It's impossible for us
to cure every illness instantly.

187
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,890
If they're punished for every failure,

188
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,480
how could they not hesitate

189
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,230
and worry about consequences?

190
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,160
Your Majesty,

191
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,690
please forgive Miss Qin.
She is still young.

192
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,520
Since Miss Qin

193
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,030
has spoken on your behalf,

194
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,420
you may all rise.

195
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,180
Thank you, Your Majesty.

196
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,200
What are you waiting for?

197
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,720
Go prepare the medicine!

198
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,200
Okay. The medicine.

199
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,490
Ma'am Chen,

200
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,990
please boil a strong pot of water
with Atractylodes, mugwort,

201
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,530
and sweet flag added, for external use.

202
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:41,990
-Yes.
-Yes.

203
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,680
Your Majesty,

204
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,870
it's about time.

205
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,610
Many citizens are waiting at Zhenghua Gate

206
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,900
for a glimpse of Your Majesty.

207
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,780
Will you still be going?

208
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,720
Miss Qin,

209
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:57,730
I

210
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,200
only have one question for you—

211
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,200
can you save the Empress Dowager?

212
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,630
I will remain calm and focused,

213
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,180
treat Her Majesty like my family,

214
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,120
and dedicate all my knowledge

215
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,850
wholeheartedly to saving her.

216
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:22,070
[Funing Palace]

217
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,560
Chi,

218
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,240
I entrust your grandmother

219
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,670
to you and Miss Qin.

220
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,200
Uncle, please don't worry.

221
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,100
Since Miss Qin said

222
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,830
there's still a chance for her,

223
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,520
she will surely recover.

224
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,040
Let's hope so.

225
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,870
Tomorrow is the New Year's Court Assembly.

226
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,670
Envoys from Beidai and Xihan

227
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,070
will attend to pay respects.

228
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,910
These two countries
have always been at odds.

229
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,960
If not for the internal rebellions
they both experienced last year,

230
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,960
they might have already gone to war.

231
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,080
While the envoys are in the capital,

232
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
you must keep a close watch

233
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,290
and ensure they don't cause

234
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,700
any incidents within our borders.

235
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,130
Yes, Your Majesty.

236
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,450
How is it going?

237
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,510
Please wait a moment, Your Highness.

238
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,200
The eighth techniques of the Golden Needle
from Medicine King Valley

239
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,370
require acupuncture at times that correspond
with the flow of Qi and blood.

240
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,870
The calculations are very complex.

241
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,530
Miss Qin cannot be disturbed.

242
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,290
Alright.

243
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,960
Chi, how is Grandmother?

244
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,270
No news yet.

245
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,810
His Majesty is here!

246
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,270
How is the Empress Dowager?

247
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,730
No news has been reported.

248
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,390
Your Majesty!

249
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,660
Wait here, you all!

250
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,430
Chi.

251
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,480
What are we going to do?

252
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,720
What should we do now?

253
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,130
The medicine needs time to take effect.

254
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:06,580
Please be patient.

255
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,100
Greetings, Your Majesty.

256
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,160
Mother.

257
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,520
Mother!

258
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,500
I'm here.

259
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,240
Thank you for your efforts.

260
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:51,970
Mother.

261
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:54,960
Miss Qin,

262
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:55,560
this...

263
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,800
What happened to the Empress Dowager?

264
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,270
Your Majesty, please rest assured.

265
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,080
Her Majesty has fallen asleep again.

266
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,510
When she wakes, she will need another
dose of the life-sustaining decoction,

267
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,900
and a third dose at noon.

268
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,270
If she can take all doses without issue,

269
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,600
her condition will be considered stable.

270
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,310
Father, is Grandmother alright?

271
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,220
Your Majesty, is Her Majesty...

272
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,480
Heaven has blessed us.

273
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,900
The Empress Dowager is out of danger now.

274
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,590
Alright, in three hours

275
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,560
is the New Year's Court Assembly.

276
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,200
You all should head back and rest.

277
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,360
Yes, Father.

278
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,040
I shall take my leave.

279
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,240
Your Majesty, although Her Majesty
is no longer in danger,

280
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,840
she still requires careful treatment.

281
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,030
I'd like to discuss
the recovery prescription

282
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,270
with Physician Zhang

283
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,800
and leave the palace later.

284
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:02,920
Leave?

285
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,540
For what?

286
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:05,550
Yuan Qing.

287
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,580
I'm here, Your Majesty.

288
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,220
Prepare the side chamber.

289
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,280
Tonight, have Miss Qin

290
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,490
stay in the Empress Dowager's palace.

291
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:12,970
Yes.

292
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,830
Your Majesty, Her Majesty's condition
is gradually improving.

293
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,180
It might be best not to confine Miss Qin
within the palace.

294
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,650
She grew up in Medicine King Valley

295
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,150
and fears restrictions the most.

296
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:27,080
She might feel uncomfortable
staying in the palace.

297
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,000
I don't fully trust
those imperial physicians.

298
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,620
The imperial physicians
are quite experienced and prudent.

299
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,200
They were simply concerned
about Her Majesty's frailty

300
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,860
and thus hesitated
to use strong medicines.

301
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,840
With Physician Zhang's
excellent pulse diagnosis,

302
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,510
she will surely recover.

303
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,190
Yuan Qing,

304
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,990
bring me my jade token.

305
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,770
Well, Miss Qin, you'll need to

306
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,130
travel back and forth to the palace daily.

307
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,670
With this jade token,

308
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,470
your access

309
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:02,450
will be easier.

310
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,390
Thank you, Your Majesty.

311
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,960
I will enter the palace at 9 a.m.
every morning

312
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,620
to check Her Majesty's pulse.

313
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,600
Very well.

314
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,310
No need to trouble
two people for one thing.

315
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,240
Chi,

316
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,320
escort Miss Qin home now.

317
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,450
Yes, Your Majesty.

318
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,130
Thank you for speaking up for me today.

319
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,030
Otherwise, I would have opposed
His Majesty again.

320
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,270
I really fear being confined
in the palace,

321
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,240
as then I wouldn't be able
to investigate my father's case.

322
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,520
His Majesty is stern

323
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,020
and decisive.

324
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,800
Today, you stood up to him
for the imperial physicians.

325
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,960
I was truly frightened.

326
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,870
At that moment, I was only worried that

327
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:53,150
Physician Zhang would be severely punished
by His Majesty because of my words,

328
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,150
forgetting that times have changed

329
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,840
and I must be cautious in the palace.

330
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,790
I'm sorry.

331
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,680
Why do you need to apologize to me?

332
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:04,910
Remember,

333
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:06,540
as long as I'm around,

334
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,660
leave any dangerous matters to me.

335
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:13,000
Today was lucky.

336
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,670
Her Majesty's condition
was truly critical.

337
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,329
If delayed another hour or so,

338
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,800
I'm afraid no medicine
could have saved her.

339
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,240
Thank you.

340
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,020
You won't let me say sorry,

341
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,480
then why did you thank me?

342
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:28,850
Grandmother

343
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,280
loves me dearly.

344
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,200
Today is New Year's,

345
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,920
and I saved your grandmother.

346
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,120
How will you thank me?

347
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,450
With this.

348
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,990
I wish you safety
and good health in the new year.

349
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,480
What's inscribed here?

350
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,640
"Guard Your Heart."

351
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,320
This was a token of affection
my father gave to my mother.

352
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,790
Wearing it

353
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,170
can ward off misfortune and evil,

354
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,930
and it also represents
my promise to protect you.

355
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:28,540
Then we can say

356
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,990
we stayed up together on New Year's Eve.

357
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,780
Do you know

358
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,680
whether the person who tried to
assassinate you back in Jingzhou

359
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,010
is in the capital or not?

360
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,390
I don't think the Crown Prince
and Prince Cheng

361
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,910
are magnanimous.

362
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,300
You need not worry about this.

363
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,740
I'll handle it myself.

364
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,000
But you—

365
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,360
today you saved the Empress Dowager,

366
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,020
so you will surely become favored
by His Majesty.

367
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,630
From now on in the palace,

368
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:05,880
remember

369
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,830
not to get involved in the conflicts

370
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:09,160
between Noble Consort Su and the Empress.

371
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,690
Self-preservation comes first.

372
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,850
I never wanted to attract attention,

373
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,330
but on second thought,

374
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,260
I must get His Majesty's attention

375
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,190
so I can stay by your side.

376
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,240
If you're really worried,

377
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,000
why not give me a case to work on?

378
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,990
As a coroner,

379
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,550
those consorts and noble ladies

380
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,270
won't be paying attention to me anymore.

381
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,510
It's not just the consorts
and noble ladies;

382
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,660
those princes and young nobles

383
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,790
won't dare set their sights on you too.

384
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,070
Excellent idea.

385
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,030
I was so scared today.

386
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,220
Thankfully Grandmother
is blessed by heaven.

387
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,000
Indeed.

388
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,510
Mother, that Miss Qin's medical skills

389
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,770
are truly impressive.

390
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,920
How come we've never

391
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,200
heard of her before?

392
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,310
Brother, has Qin Zhaoyu ever mentioned

393
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,920
her ninth sister to you?

394
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,590
What?

395
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,570
Why are you so distracted, Brother?

396
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,920
Don't tell me

397
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,900
you've taken a fancy to Miss Qin?

398
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,750
You're not a kid anymore.

399
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,240
You must be more mindful of what you say.

400
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,320
I only act like this
in front of you, Mother.

401
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,350
Alright.

402
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,300
It's getting late.

403
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,920
You should go rest now,

404
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,240
There's the court assembly today.

405
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,510
You're trying to sideline me so you can
talk to Brother in private.

406
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,970
Don't think I don't know
what he's thinking.

407
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,480
He's clearly pleased

408
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,270
Miss Qin has won Father's favor

409
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,210
and also likes Zhaoyu
for her beauty and talents.

410
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,560
Stop talking nonsense.

411
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,310
What's wrong?

412
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,270
Don't tell me Zhen was right.

413
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,130
In terms of talent and abilities,

414
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,310
Lady Wan is indeed impressive.

415
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:08,660
It's a pity

416
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,240
that she's not from the same branch
as the Marquis of Zhongyong.

417
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,770
She won't be able to support you
in the future.

418
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,680
Father showed her special favor today.

419
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,070
No matter how special,

420
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,890
she's still just one person.

421
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,920
The Marquis of Zhongyong
runs the Ministry of Personnel

422
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,590
and has deep roots in court.

423
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,350
If you reject his daughter for Lady Wan,

424
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,650
Noble Consort Su will immediately
arrange for Zhaoyu to marry her son.

425
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,310
Then the Marquis's full support

426
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,880
will likely go to Prince Cheng, Yan Qi.

427
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,880
Mother, please rest assured.

428
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,880
I won't make such a foolish mistake.

429
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,930
If you really like Lady Wan,

430
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,790
why not take her
as your secondary consort?

431
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,850
Zhaoyu is virtuous and magnanimous.

432
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,330
She surely won't go against your wishes.

433
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:58,350
Wouldn't that be killing two birds
with one stone?

434
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,220
I've only met her once.

435
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,010
How could I like her?

436
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,750
But since you favor Zhaoyu
as the Crown Princess,

437
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,800
why haven't you given her
a definite answer?

438
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,860
The Marquis of Zhongyong
has approached me many times.

439
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,110
What comes too easily

440
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,690
won't be treasured.

441
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,050
If she really becomes the Crown Princess,

442
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,550
the Qin family might be harder to control.

443
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,310
Alright.

444
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,370
You should also go and rest now.

445
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,510
There can't be any slip-ups
in today's court assembly.

446
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,110
Don't let Prince Cheng
steal the spotlight again.

447
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:28,980
I see.

448
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,360
Go now.

449
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,720
If I had even a third
of Yan Chi's strategic mind,

450
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,850
I wouldn't need to do so much planning.

451
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,200
I didn't expect

452
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,430
Zhao Shuhua to be so quick.

453
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,990
Miss Qin hasn't even
arrived at the residence,

454
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,440
and the rewards have already
gone ahead of her.

455
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,400
I'd say

456
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,000
she's trying to win Miss Qin over
because His Majesty

457
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,400
has taken a liking to her.

458
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,240
Empress of the Nation?

459
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,680
Even the women in brothels
aren't as good at flattering as she is.

460
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,510
Today,

461
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,690
I'll find an excuse

462
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,660
to send something to Miss Qin too,

463
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,950
just to annoy her.

464
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,160
Mother, why are you even doing all this?

465
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:22,110
I'm doing it for you.

466
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,680
Mother.

467
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,460
If you truly care about me,

468
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,270
then keep a closer eye

469
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,800
on Feng Chenbi.

470
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,310
What's wrong with Chenbi?

471
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,620
In the entire capital,

472
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,930
aside from Qin Zhaoyu,

473
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,270
who among the noble ladies

474
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:41,000
can even compare to her?

475
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,750
If she still wants to become
the Crown Princess,

476
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,870
she should make fewer foolish mistakes.

477
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:47,200
She's always coming up with petty tricks.

478
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,010
Does she really think everyone

479
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,270
in the palace is a fool?

480
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,530
She did all those things for you.

481
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:57,050
If you hadn't insisted
on rejecting the Duke of Zhong,

482
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:00,110
would she even need to fight for
the Crown Princess position?

483
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,100
Don't forget,

484
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,000
the Duke of Zhong is the only one
truly capable

485
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
of helping you fight for the throne.

486
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,800
And now you're turning your nose up
at Chenbi.

487
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,180
You couldn't possibly

488
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,900
have taken a fancy to that Qin Wan,
could you?

489
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,610
Let me tell you,

490
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,820
the Marquis of Zhongyong is
the Crown Prince's royal guardian.

491
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,830
He's not going to support you

492
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,230
just for a distant niece.

493
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,710
No matter how skilled Qin Wan's

494
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,800
medical abilities are,

495
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,870
she still isn't worthy of me.

496
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,800
There's no one in the capital who is.

497
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,140
His Majesty and the the Empress
are being far too generous.

498
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,220
Why isn't Wan here?

499
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,330
All these rewards are for her.

500
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,220
Our lady exhausted herself
saving the Empress Dowager.

501
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,480
She's still sleeping.

502
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,590
I heard from the eunuch
delivering the rewards

503
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,920
that His Majesty specifically ordered
not to wake our lady.

504
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,060
When we were in Jingzhou,

505
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,790
who would have thought that
Wan would come this far?

506
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,970
His Majesty favors Wan so much.

507
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,440
I'm afraid she's about to

508
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,640
fly high and become someone important.

509
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,130
You should get slapped

510
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,690
for talking such nonsense.

511
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,210
Lady Xiang must be possessed
by some evil spirit

512
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,540
to spout such nonsense.

513
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,430
Let her starve for a few days to calm down

514
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,550
and copy "The Virtues of Women" 100 times.

515
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,330
Only when she understands the rules

516
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,860
can she leave the quarters.

517
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:30,900
Xiang.

518
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,200
Mother,

519
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,240
Qin Xiang's character is twisted.

520
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,090
Perhaps...

521
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,840
we should find her a match soon.

522
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,840
Yu is right.

523
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,180
Someone like Qin Xiang

524
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,270
will only bring trouble
to the family sooner or later.

525
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,480
We should marry her off early.

526
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,480
Honey.

527
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:48,610
look.

528
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,900
None of them give me any peace.

529
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,090
Qin Xiang is like that,

530
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:52,930
and Qin Wan…

531
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,540
Just look at all these things.

532
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:59,040
They were all given by the Empress
and His Majesty to Qin Wan.

533
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,550
Qin Wan saved the Empress Dowager—

534
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,200
that's a huge merit.

535
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,400
These rewards are nothing in comparison.

536
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,780
This is a whole box of eastern pearls.

537
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,970
Even our Yu
has never received such fine things.

538
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,030
Can Yu and Qin Wan be compared?

539
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,120
Yu's status is still uncertain,

540
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,000
while Qin Wan is truly

541
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,640
the Empress Dowager's lifesaver.

542
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,030
According to etiquette,
the Empress should favor Qin Wan more.

543
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,040
Honey,

544
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,400
if the Empress changes her mind,

545
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,150
what about the marriage between
Yu and the Crown Prince?

546
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:32,720
Mother.

547
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,360
Wan gaining the favor
of the Emperor and Empress

548
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,970
is an honor to our household

549
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,590
and will also become a support for Father.

550
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,720
Yu truly understands things clearly.

551
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,600
Don't worry.

552
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,190
Qin Wan has her own destiny.

553
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,010
In any case,

554
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:50,010
I won't let anyone stand in the way

555
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,940
of Yu becoming the Crown Princess.

556
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,310
Gentlemen,

557
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,530
please help me place these in this room.

558
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,110
My Lady?

559
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,440
Where are you going, My Lady?

560
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,840
I'm going to diagnose the Empress Dowager.

561
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,320
After this,

562
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,350
have we finally secured our footing

563
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,550
in the Marquis Mansion and the capital?

564
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,880
Silly girl.

565
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,500
You're thinking too simply.

566
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,400
No matter how much favor I enjoy now,

567
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,210
once I start investigating
Prince Jin's case,

568
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,240
I'm afraid His Majesty

569
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,280
will be the first to want me gone.

570
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,440
Well...

571
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,650
The palace is full of
complicated relationships.

572
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:27,980
I won't take you with me.

573
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,880
But without anyone looking after you,

574
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,750
what if you encounter

575
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,270
some trouble in the palace?

576
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,680
Ning has been staying in the palace these days
to accompany the Empress Dowager.

577
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,790
Nothing will happen to me.

578
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,920
You must be careful too.

579
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,720
Don't let anyone into our quarters.

580
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,550
Don't worry, I won't even

581
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,550
let a fly in.

582
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,760
I'm leaving now.

583
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,790
Be careful.

584
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,600
Yu,

585
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:53,440
I know you've cared about
your reputation since childhood,

586
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,750
but you saw the gifts the Empress

587
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,910
sent today.

588
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:58,960
We have to

589
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,600
be wary of Qin Wan.

590
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:02,950
Mother,

591
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,110
Wan doesn't chase after wealth and status.

592
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,440
Even if Qin Wan has no intention

593
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,270
of seducing the Crown Prince,

594
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,060
what if he's just looking
for a fleeting thrill,

595
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:13,790
wanting to have his cake and eat it too?

596
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,850
That won't happen.

597
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,410
Your father intends to match
the Heir of Prince Rui with Qin Wan.

598
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,690
We might as well

599
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,780
push this marriage along quickly.

600
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,250
That way, we'll have fewer worries later.

601
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,330
But Yan Chi is highly favored
by His Majesty.

602
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,790
Many noble ladies
in the capital admire him.

603
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,130
But do you know
why no one has dared to form

604
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:35,460
a marriage alliance
with Prince Rui's household until now?

605
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,000
Because the former Princess Consort Rui

606
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,460
was poisoned to death
by Prince Rui himself.

607
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,030
Didn't Princess Consort Rui die
of massive bleeding during childbirth

608
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,690
while giving birth to Yan Chi?

609
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,750
That's just the official excuse.

610
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:51,090
Rumor has it that Yan Chi
wasn't Prince Rui's biological son,

611
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,320
and in a fit of rage,
Prince Rui killed his wife.

612
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,220
Keeping the child was only to save face.

613
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:59,400
Otherwise, why would
Prince Rui abandon his newborn son

614
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,190
and leave for Shuoxi

615
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:02,620
right after Princess Consort Rui's death?

616
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,060
If this ever got out,

617
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,090
how could Yan Chi inherit the title?

618
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:09,130
What family would dare
marry their daughter to him?

619
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,530
"Guard Your Heart."

620
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:22,260
This was a token of affection
my father gave to my mother.

621
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,590
Wearing it

622
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,830
can ward off misfortune and evil,

623
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,690
and it also represents
my promise to protect you.

624
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,110
Prince Rui gave this jade pendant
to the Princess Consort himself,

625
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,160
clearly showing
their deep affection for each other.

626
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,240
So how could such

627
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:50,400
an absurd rumor spread in the capital?

628
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,430
Prince Rui is extremely harsh
with Yan Chi.

629
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,500
If he truly believes the rumor,

630
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,500
I'm afraid he might turn on his own son,

631
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:00,760
and Shuoxi Army would fall apart.

632
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,260
Who could be so malicious

633
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,080
to have set up such a scheme?

634
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:29,270
No matter how dangerous
the road ahead may be,

635
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,110
Yan Chi,

636
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,780
it's my turn to protect you this time.

637
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,790
[Funing Palace]

638
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,180
Ma'am Chen,
Her Majesty is no longer in danger.

639
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,630
From now on, she just needs prescriptions
for treating wind symptoms.

640
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,690
That's wonderful.

641
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:12,930
Thank you,

642
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,000
Miss Qin.

643
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,890
Please, there's no need for that.

644
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:20,520
Ma'am, does Her Majesty
often suffer from pain in her back

645
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,040
and ringing in the ears?

646
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:22,920
Yes.

647
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,600
Sometimes there's no one speaking,

648
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,310
but Her Majesty thinks someone
is talking to her.

649
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:31,040
When we ask,
she says she hears sounds in her ears.

650
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,170
For now,
the wind symptoms is the priority.

651
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,710
As for the ear problem,
it can be treated gradually.

652
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:35,320
Alright.

653
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,210
Little Wan'er,

654
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:38,520
Her Majesty's health
has been weakening in recent years.

655
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,390
Why don't you treat
all her conditions at once?

656
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,880
Treating illness isn't like cooking,

657
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,480
where everything needs
to be stewed together.

658
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,990
Once Her Majesty can eat,

659
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,540
I'll prepare a tonic recipe

660
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,750
to help strengthen her.

661
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,480
Don't worry.

662
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,180
She's not near the end yet.

663
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,640
With a year of care, she'll recover.

664
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,200
Okay.

665
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,970
His Majesty is here!

666
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:04,220
Greetings, Your Majesty, Your Highness.

667
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,760
Everyone may rise.

668
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,390
Thank you, Your Majesty.

669
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,480
Your Majesty,

670
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,900
Her Majesty just woke up again.

671
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,330
She's able to drink some broth now.

672
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,860
Miss Qin truly lives up
to the title of the "medical fairy".

673
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,180
If I entrust you with

674
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,270
the Empress Dowager's care from now on,

675
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,200
will you accept?

676
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,400
If you trust me,

677
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,930
I will do my best.

678
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,660
Your Majesty is quite calculating.

679
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:34,990
The Grand Princess

680
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:37,750
entrusted her adopted granddaughter
to your care.

681
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,410
You just gave her some rewards

682
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,610
and now want to use her as a physician.

683
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:44,440
Aren't you afraid the Grand Princess
will take her whip to you?

684
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,870
Miss Qin is

685
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:48,650
the Grand Princess's most treasured one.

686
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,680
How dare I mistreat her?

687
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,640
Miss Qin saved the Empress Dowager's life
this time,

688
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,610
and that must be recorded
as the primary merit.

689
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:59,050
If she can restore

690
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,630
the Empress Dowager's health,

691
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,010
that will be an even greater achievement,

692
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,270
and I will reward her handsomely.

693
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,510
Thank you, Your Majesty.

694
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,490
Yesterday was your first time
entering the palace,

695
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,060
and you worked hard until midnight.

696
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:17,040
Today, there's a banquet to entertain
foreign envoys in the palace.

697
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,830
You should sit with Zhen and Ning.

698
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,310
Now, I'll go see the Empress Dowager.

699
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,740
Miss Qin, don't worry about
formal dresses and protocol.

700
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,020
Zhen has a few dresses she hasn't worn.

701
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,830
You two are similar in size.

702
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:37,090
With some adjustments, they'll fit you.

703
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,660
Thank you, Your Highness.

704
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,690
Little Wan'er, this is wonderful.

705
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:45,070
Today's palace banquet will feature martial contests
among warriors from various countries.

706
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:48,470
It's much more entertaining
than the New Year's Eve banquet.

707
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,030
I heard that.

708
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:52,270
Ning, if you keep talking nonsense,

709
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:55,000
I'll have you sent back to Jingzhou.

710
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,190
I won't dare, Uncle.

711
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,489
Royal Guardian.

712
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,480
Little Wan'er, just you wait.

713
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,199
Today will definitely be fun.

714
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,500
I really envy Lady Wan.

715
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:49,250
It's only her second time at the palace,

716
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,730
yet she's already sitting
at the same table as the princesses.

717
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:53,600
Miss Qin saved my grandmother.

718
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:56,330
She deserves the honor Father gave her.

719
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,540
These people's faces sure change fast.

720
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,700
In just one night,

721
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,720
they've all become so attentive to you.

722
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:15,040
They must have forgotten how they

723
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,800
treated you like poison yesterday.

724
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,440
I don't care what they say.

725
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,490
I'm just here to enjoy the food and drink.

726
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,530
Why hasn't Chi arrived yet?

727
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,660
He wouldn't be off hanging out

728
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,190
with Yan Li again, would he?

729
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,880
This Yan Li—

730
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,920
he didn't come on New Year's Eve,
which was fine,

731
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,880
but he won't show up
on New Year's Day either.

732
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,750
Without him,

733
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,440
the palace banquet food
just isn't as good.

734
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,370
What are you looking at?

735
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,510
Why isn't he coming over?

736
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,070
Don't push him.

737
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,440
He's just like Yan Chi—

738
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,550
despite all their honors,

739
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,970
life in the capital
is still tough for them.

740
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,660
Little Wan'er,

741
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,230
why do I feel

742
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,630
you're rather sympathetic
toward those two?

743
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,430
The longer I live in the capital,

744
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,960
the more I understand their difficulties.

745
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,030
You have a point.

746
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,470
But

747
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,630
being stuck in the palace every day

748
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,110
isn't easy for me either.

749
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,880
You should pity me too.

750
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,440
Yes.

751
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,030
I should feel sorry for you.

752
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,880
I'm sorry that you can't run around

753
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,430
drinking and racing horses
with Yan Li all day,

754
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:47,360
and instead have to pretend to be obedient here
—it must be exhausting.

755
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:51,480
His Majesty is here!

756
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,330
On this auspicious New Year's Day,

757
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:32,040
we celebrate with great joy.

758
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:35,200
We wish Your Majesty
longevity and eternal prosperity.

759
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,050
I wish to share the good fortune
of the New Year

760
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,780
with all of you.

761
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,290
[Yuan Hong, Crown Prince of Beidai]

762
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,640
[Liu Bin, Prince of Xihan]

763
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,630
We pay our respects to Your Majesty.

764
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:06,820
Please rise.

765
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,560
Guests from afar,

766
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,430
please take your seats.

767
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,650
Thank you, Your Majesty.

768
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,560
Before the New Year,
heavy snow blocked the roads in the north.

769
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,560
I thought we would have to wait

770
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,030
until spring to meet,

771
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,740
but unexpectedly,

772
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:31,660
we have this chance
to gather on New Year's Day.

773
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:33,800
Come,

774
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,610
everyone, raise your cups together.

775
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:40,660
Let us drink this New Year's wine

776
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,320
and wish for peace among the people

777
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,840
and abundance throughout the land!

778
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,950
Peace for the people

779
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,040
and abundance for the land!

780
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:00,920
Your Majesty,

781
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,760
I've long heard that

782
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,140
Beidai and Xihan
produce exceptional talents.

783
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,540
Seeing them today,

784
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,410
they truly are outstanding.

785
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,190
Especially Princess Yuanwu,

786
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,630
whose beauty

787
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,210
outshines even our Zhen.

788
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,570
Though Princess Yuanwu is beautiful,

789
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:21,150
Mother, your praise in front of everyone

790
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,840
embarrasses me.

791
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,240
Your Highness, you flatter us.

792
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,000
Princess Zhen is lively and charming,

793
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,280
with unparalleled grace.

794
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,000
How can my sister
compare to Princess Zhen?

795
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,220
Though my brother's
not very good with words,

796
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,300
he has prepared a gift
for Her Highness the Princess.

797
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,420
[Yuan Rui, Prince of Beidai]
[Yuan Wu, Princess of Beidai]

798
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,510
What a coincidence.

799
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,400
I have also prepared a gift

800
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,450
for Her Highness.

801
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:42,920
Why don't we all present our gifts

802
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,420
and let the Princess decide

803
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,540
which she prefers?

804
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,820
What do you say?

805
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,470
How thoughtful of you both.

806
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,340
Let's take advantage
of Princess Zhen's presence

807
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:57,520
to see the treasures.

808
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,320
Everyone, please look.

809
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,110
This gem is hidden deep

810
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,040
in our Beidai's Cangyu Mountains.

811
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,620
Its color is as fiery red as flame,

812
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,090
shining brighter than the sun and moon.

813
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:18,350
It is truly the finest pigeon blood ruby.

814
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,230
I believe only such a unique treasure

815
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,680
is worthy of the noble Princess Zhen
of your esteemed country.

816
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,820
Crown Prince Yuan Hong,

817
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:30,110
finding such a rare ruby

818
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:33,550
truly shows your sincerity.

819
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:35,990
Your Majesty, if I may.

820
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,110
this little snow fox
is highly intelligent.

821
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,220
Princess,

822
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,920
you only need to wear this taming bell
for three days,

823
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,000
and the little snow fox will regard you

824
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,410
as its one and only master

825
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,960
and will never harm you.

826
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,460
Your Highness,

827
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:57,600
please try it on.

828
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,190
Father, Mother,

829
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:34,470
I want this little fox.

830
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,150
Very well.

831
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,800
Since you like it,

832
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,420
you shall be this fox's master.

833
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,940
Thank you, Father.

834
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,920
Good neighborliness brings
lasting happiness for generations.

835
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:50,170
I heard that the Beidai Crown Prince

836
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,550
and the Third Prince of Xihan

837
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:56,330
are both outstanding
in both literature and martial arts.

838
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,840
You have traveled far.

839
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,080
Please rest well first.

840
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,210
Ten days from now,

841
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:05,550
we will hold an archery contest
at the Southern Court.

842
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,240
I specially appointed Yan Chi,
the Heir of Prince Rui,

843
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,010
to accompany you in the competition.

844
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:12,150
Here,

845
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:16,190
I wish you success in taking first place.

846
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,430
Your Majesty,

847
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,450
if I win the archery contest in ten days,

848
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,450
will there be a reward for me as well?

849
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:24,760
Of course.

850
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:30,310
Your Majesty,

851
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,560
if I win, I don't want anything else—

852
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,750
I only want

853
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,920
Young Commander Yan as my consort.
