00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,930
[Episode 35]

3
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,930
What Ms. Qin has said

4
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,000
matches your investigation results
completely.

5
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,039
Yes.

6
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,800
Why isn't Wan speaking?

7
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,090
Your Majesty,

8
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,460
Princess Zhaoyu is my elder sister.

9
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,050
I should avoid speaking on the matter.

10
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,080
Besides, she has caused such a disaster,

11
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,140
I am too ashamed to face Your Majesty.

12
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,570
If Your Majesty wishes to punish someone,

13
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,030
please punish me instead.

14
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,550
Why would I punish you?

15
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,080
You have nothing to do with this matter.

16
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,960
Get up, get up.

17
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,130
Thank you, Your Majesty.

18
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,050
The Prince Yan Che's escape

19
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,550
has nothing to do with Ms. Qin.

20
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,520
As for the fire incident,

21
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,520
I...

22
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,770
cannot bear to blame her any further.

23
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,240
However,

24
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,450
it would be inappropriate for Ms. Qin

25
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,960
to remain in the restricted quarters.

26
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,210
Considering she was newly married

27
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,530
when she became implicated
in Prince Yan Che's affairs.

28
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,160
Here's what we'll do.

29
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,079
I

30
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,360
graciously permit her to return

31
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,450
to the Marquis of Zhongyong's Mansion,

32
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,250
to rest and recover peacefully.

33
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,350
She must not leave without my decree.

34
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,000
And a royal physician
will attend to her daily.

35
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,470
Wan.

36
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,390
I show her such mercy

37
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,680
partly because you and she

38
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,450
come from the same family.

39
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,840
However, this matter

40
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,360
should not be publicized

41
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,280
to avoid

42
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,800
further complications.

43
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,360
Yes.

44
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,170
Thank you for Your Majesty's benevolence.

45
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,210
Thank you for Your Majesty's benevolence.

46
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,410
Recently,

47
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,480
the Empress Dowager has been unwell.

48
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,270
When you have time,
come to the palace more often

49
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,870
to keep Her Majesty company.

50
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,329
Yes.

51
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:27,770
You may go now.

52
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,510
Your Highness, please wait a moment.

53
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,510
I'll go inform them of your arrival.

54
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,420
Why were you distracted earlier?

55
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,320
I just find it strange

56
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,400
that His Majesty acts so coldly
towards Yan Che.

57
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,150
He is his only legitimate son.

58
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,240
Even if he despises his lack of ambition,

59
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,010
he shouldn't be so indifferent
to his whereabouts.

60
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,340
His Majesty could let Zhaoyu return home,

61
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,730
yet why does he show no affection

62
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,290
toward his only legitimate son?

63
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,290
His Majesty isn't necessarily
showing affection to Qin Zhaoyu,

64
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,170
but rather bestowing favour on

65
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,770
those officials
who once served Prince Yan Che

66
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,050
to win their loyalty

67
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,240
and stabilise the court.

68
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,950
If he truly wanted stability,

69
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,930
he wouldn't make a bastard like Yan Qi
the crown prince.

70
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,159
His Majesty might not actually think this,

71
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:36,210
after all, there's still Sui.

72
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,950
But His Majesty is cold towards Sui
as well.

73
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,380
This is truly strange.

74
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,230
His Majesty is distant and cold

75
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,360
toward his own sons,

76
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,490
yet only in front of Yan Li,

77
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,530
does he act like a loving father.

78
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,770
According to Grandmother,

79
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,170
this change happened
after Consort Jin's tragedy.

80
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,040
Before that,

81
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,540
His Majesty was quite fond

82
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,860
of Sui as well.

83
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,760
Could Consort Jin's death

84
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,360
have changed his temperament
so drastically?

85
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,010
I rarely returned to the capital before.

86
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,140
If you have such questions,

87
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,120
you could ask Grandmother about them.

88
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,950
However,

89
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,210
it is true that

90
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,150
after Prince Jin's incident,

91
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,200
His Majesty became increasingly suspicious
of Father.

92
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,800
It seems Consort Jin's death

93
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,080
is more complicated than we thought.

94
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,770
After we capture Yan Qi,

95
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,390
I'll investigate this matter with you.

96
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,810
For now, we don't know

97
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,000
how far this conspiracy extends.

98
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,820
While you're in the palace,

99
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,270
be extremely careful.

100
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,180
Alright.

101
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,110
Grandmother's pulse is stable and healthy,

102
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,900
she's just not sleeping well,

103
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,620
which is why she feels somewhat fatigued.

104
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,680
Since I entered the palace as a consort
in my teens,

105
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,290
and the palace intrigues

106
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,409
have never ceased.

107
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,560
It's just a fire,

108
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,650
it won't frighten me.

109
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:58,560
Grandmother.

110
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,050
If you could follow your heart

111
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,510
and make the choice again,

112
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,360
would you still be willing
to enter the palace as a consort?

113
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,160
Everyone living in this world

114
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,630
has their own troubles.

115
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,440
In my entire life,

116
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,930
there were only two times

117
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,490
when I followed my own heart,

118
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,420
and to this day

119
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,410
I still don't know
if they were right or wrong.

120
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,050
But since they were my own decisions,

121
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,170
I have no regrets.

122
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,970
Even when we make our own decisions,

123
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,530
the outcome may not be

124
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,170
what we truly wanted.

125
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,490
That, as well, is the irony of fate.

126
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,560
Take Zhaoyu for example,

127
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,290
if not for His Majesty's mercy,

128
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,960
she would likely be spending

129
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:43,340
the rest of her life alone
in the forbidden quarters.

130
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,360
Wan.

131
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,220
Let me tell you something.

132
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,120
Don't get too involved in palace affairs.

133
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,680
You and Chi

134
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,120
should live your own life
behind closed doors.

135
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,200
Your Father has

136
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,320
only Chi as his flesh and blood.

137
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,240
Stay as far away from trouble as possible.

138
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,290
I will keep that in mind.

139
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,170
Sui is playing outside.

140
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,940
Go find him.

141
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,000
He's been looking forward to your visit
every day.

142
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,650
Yes.

143
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,940
Any news of Che?

144
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,470
Will His Majesty...

145
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,440
A young eunuch saw Prince Yan Che
leaving the palace,

146
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,360
accompanied by

147
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,360
what appeared to be Lord Zhao's men.

148
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,050
His Majesty promised you

149
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,850
he wouldn't harm Prince Yan Che,

150
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,810
so please don't worry yourself.

151
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,409
Since the fire last night,

152
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,610
he hasn't come to see me once.

153
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:56,610
He resents me

154
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,390
for pleading on Che's behalf, doesn't he?

155
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,660
If I had known he would be

156
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,850
so cold-hearted,

157
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:05,240
I...

158
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,210
Empress Dowager,

159
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,540
His Majesty has reached the age of wisdom.

160
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,530
Managing such a vast court,

161
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,240
how could he still be like before,

162
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,440
coming to pay respects to you every day?

163
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,800
-If my Huai...
-Your Majesty.

164
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,320
Alright.

165
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,710
Let's not speak of it.

166
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,870
Let's not.

167
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,080
[Marquis of Zhongyong's Mansion]

168
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,020
Father.

169
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,409
His Majesty has actually allowed Yu
to return home to recover.

170
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:38,970
What could be his intention?

171
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:39,730
Silence!

172
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,650
Yan, is Yu coming home?

173
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,460
Go and tidy up

174
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,760
Yu's quarters.

175
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,700
Your Grace, when Yu returns,

176
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,230
will she still be the Crown Princess?

177
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,630
The deposed Crown Prince has already fled,

178
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,920
how can there still be a Crown Princess.

179
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,890
My poor daughter!

180
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,010
Quickly,

181
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,340
bring Madam back to her room.

182
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:00,980
Yes.

183
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,850
Madam, let's go.

184
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,360
You're not so young anymore,

185
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,430
why do you still

186
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,210
lose your composure so easily?

187
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,110
I was just worried and confused.

188
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,910
But Father,

189
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,410
the honour of
the Marquis of Zhongyong's Mansion

190
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,840
depends entirely on the Eastern Palace.

191
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,590
Nonsense!

192
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,260
The lives of everyone in our household

193
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,790
are in His Majesty's hands.

194
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,180
His Majesty allowing Yu to return

195
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,840
is a warning to us

196
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,770
not to get involved in this matter.

197
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,930
If we harbour any disloyalty again,

198
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,390
His Majesty will execute
our entire family.

199
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,130
Father, are you really willing
to just sit and wait for death?

200
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,170
Everyone in court knows

201
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,960
you're the leader
of Crown Prince's faction,

202
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,620
and that His Majesty
will never trust you again.

203
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,800
Father,

204
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,960
are you just going to watch

205
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,840
as our titles

206
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,240
and everything we've worked for slip away?

207
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,790
While there's still time,

208
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,340
let's immediately send a message
to the Northern Army

209
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,940
and help His Highness rebel.

210
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,700
What a traitor!

211
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,180
The Qin family's titles

212
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,010
were all earned through
loyalty and bravery.

213
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:02,840
Without loyalty,

214
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,440
how could we still stand
in the imperial court?

215
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,390
No matter how valuable the titles are,

216
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,720
they're not worth

217
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,650
the lives of everyone in our household.

218
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,080
Sui.

219
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,410
Wan.

220
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,650
What's wrong?

221
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:40,580
Are you unhappy?

222
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,880
I miss Mother.

223
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:45,560
Come.

224
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,480
Sui,

225
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,080
my mom and dad

226
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,340
have also passed away.

227
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,690
When I miss them,

228
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,750
I talk to the stars in the sky,

229
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,090
and it makes me feel much better.

230
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,770
Do you believe they've gone to heaven?

231
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,680
I do believe so.

232
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,840
I don't know
if there are immortals in heaven,

233
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,480
and my mom used to
scold me and my dad

234
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,440
quite fiercely,

235
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,320
but I know

236
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,130
they were the people who loved me most
in this world.

237
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,730
No matter where they are now,

238
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,200
they would want me to be just like before,

239
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,410
safe and happy.

240
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,450
But I don't have a dad.

241
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,250
I only have Father.

242
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,130
What's that?

243
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,050
Bring us some snacks.

244
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:42,840
Yes.

245
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,800
Wan, do you trust me?

246
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,320
I trust you.

247
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,830
Then, let me tell you.

248
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,080
I was pretending

249
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,280
to not be able to speak

250
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,360
nor write.

251
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,420
What happened?

252
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,010
Why did you have to pretend?

253
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,900
Because I saw

254
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,130
Father killing Mother.

255
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,240
It was Father,

256
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,540
not Prince Jin.

257
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,980
I saw it with my own eyes.

258
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,200
You were afraid
His Majesty would find out,

259
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,330
so you pretended to be simple-minded?

260
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,440
Father used to treat me as well as
he treats Li.

261
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,210
But since that day,

262
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,230
when Father looks at me,

263
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,270
his eyes are always dark and cold.

264
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,960
Father's temper has gotten worse,

265
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,110
if he finds out, he will surely kill me.

266
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,930
Wan, please believe me.

267
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,170
I believe you.

268
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,500
Don't worry, Sui,

269
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,420
Chi and I will protect you.

270
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,530
Grandmother says you're the best coroner
in Zhou,

271
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,990
I've told you everything,

272
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,170
can you and Chi help me?

273
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,730
I don't want Mother and Prince Jin

274
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,370
to have died in vain.

275
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,160
I promise you.

276
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,440
That day,

277
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,260
I was supposed to join my brothers

278
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,840
at the book appreciation banquet
in the rear garden.

279
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,630
Prince Jin promised me

280
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,450
that he would give me a gift,

281
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,170
but I don't like those adult banquets,

282
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,700
so I pretended to be sick and didn't go.

283
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,030
Instead, I sneaked into Hanguang Hall
to look through Mother's collections.

284
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:27,640
To my surprise,

285
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,250
Father and Mother returned early,

286
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,950
so I quickly hid behind the curtains.

287
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,880
I ask you,

288
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,940
where did you get this book?

289
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,070
What are you plotting?

290
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,510
Your Majesty might as well tell me,

291
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,530
[Consort Jin]

292
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,870
why is Your Majesty's handwriting

293
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:45,680
completely different from
that in the book?

294
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,170
Haven't I told you before?

295
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,820
I was once injured.

296
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,330
I hurt my waist, back, and arms,

297
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,780
so naturally my handwriting changed.

298
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,940
I had never seen Father so angry.

299
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,820
I was so scared, I covered my ears.

300
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:14,930
Sui.

301
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,850
Prince Jin is here.

302
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,950
[Prince Jin]

303
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,810
Quickly, call the imperial physician.

304
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,820
You know nothing,

305
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,210
don't tell anyone,

306
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,780
don't say anything.

307
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,060
Your Highness.

308
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,240
It's all my fault.

309
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,520
If I had dared to rush out then,

310
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,110
Mother wouldn't have died.

311
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,290
If I hadn't forgotten my promise
with Prince Jin,

312
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,880
he wouldn't have suffered this injustice.

313
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,790
Don't think like that.

314
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,320
Sui,

315
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,510
remember this,

316
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,730
your mother's death
has nothing to do with you,

317
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,180
and Prince Jin's suffering
isn't because of you either.

318
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,260
I promise you,

319
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,930
Chi and I

320
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:27,800
will definitely find out

321
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,800
why His Majesty killed your mother.

322
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,200
Thank you, Wan.

323
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:33,530
Good child.

324
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,170
Steward Duoshou,

325
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,390
[Xuanji Pavilion]

326
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,350
airing out chess manuals again?

327
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,130
Welcome Prince Rui

328
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,320
Princess Consort Rui,

329
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,840
and Prince Yan Sui.

330
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,580
As Prince Rui said,

331
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,140
I can only do
these minor tasks now.

332
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,790
May I ask what calligraphy samples
Prince Rui is looking for?

333
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,030
I'll just...

334
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,580
No need,

335
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,870
give me the key,

336
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,020
I'll go myself.

337
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,160
Then I'll trouble Prince Rui.

338
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,860
With those old bones of yours,

339
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,060
you should rest well.

340
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,540
Thank you for your concern, Prince Rui.

341
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,530
These chess manuals are just
some beginner's guides,

342
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,350
why does you need to
manage them personally?

343
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,080
Princess Consort Rui may not know,

344
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,130
these few chess manuals,

345
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,170
though not works of masters,

346
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:26,570
are His Majesty's treasured possessions.

347
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,130
Why would His Majesty

348
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,600
like these books meant for children?

349
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,320
His Majesty is a genius at chess,

350
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,800
often saying that the essence of chess

351
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,960
lies in the simplest principles,

352
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,720
and that all variations
come from the same origin.

353
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,320
These beginner's books

354
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,650
have helped His Majesty
become nearly unbeatable.

355
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,440
Could it be that His Majesty

356
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,800
deliberately loses to the Empress Dowager
and Grand Princess?

357
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,600
It must be due to
His Majesty's filial piety.

358
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,450
Unfortunately, His Majesty
is now busy with state affairs,

359
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,230
and has no time to study chess manuals,

360
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,010
nor express himself
through calligraphy anymore.

361
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,990
Since I have been assigned here,

362
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,490
the Xuanji Pavilion

363
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,730
has not been collecting

364
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:08,000
any of His Majesty's calligraphy works.

365
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,130
Thank you, Steward.

366
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,490
Please.

367
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:16,420
Chi.

368
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,480
What is it?

369
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:21,970
Help me get the one at the top.

370
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,780
The scroll up there.

371
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,540
Which one?

372
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:25,810
The one in the corner.

373
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,650
This one?

374
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,040
It seems His Majesty
indeed hasn't visited for a long time.

375
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,300
Otherwise, the servants wouldn't dare
to be so negligent.

376
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,610
This was the scroll I saw Mother hiding

377
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,570
the last time I accompanied her

378
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,850
to the Xuanji Pavilion.

379
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,090
Sui,

380
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,990
do you know who wrote this?

381
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,290
Mother said

382
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:56,230
this is Father's calligraphy
from before he ascended the throne,

383
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,630
which she had found with great difficulty.

384
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,090
These two handwritings
are indeed identical.

385
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,190
The seal on this,

386
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,590
although is His Majesty's personal seal,

387
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,480
differs greatly from the handwriting
in His Majesty's vermilion rescript.

388
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,040
The handwriting on His Majesty's rescripts

389
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,300
is vigorous and sharp,

390
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,660
powerful and forceful,

391
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,940
with none of this harmonious quality.

392
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:17,890
Chi,

393
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,660
this is what I found
in Mother's calligraphy notes

394
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,880
on the day she died.

395
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,420
Seems like

396
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,500
it was also written
before Father ascended the throne.

397
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,050
The handwriting is identical.

398
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:40,960
Sui,

399
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,340
does His Majesty know you have this note?

400
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,130
No, he doesn't.

401
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,480
I've never told anyone.

402
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,170
Sui,

403
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,680
go play over there for a while,

404
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,170
I need to speak with Chi.

405
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,960
Those pages and scrolls

406
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,470
that led to Consort Jin's death

407
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,670
must have been disposed by His Majesty.

408
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,850
I still need to carefully compare

409
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,960
His Majesty's calligraphy
from before his ascension,

410
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,930
to better deduce

411
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,790
the true reason why His Majesty
killed Consort Jin.

412
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,300
If what Sui said is true,

413
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,610
then we can confirm

414
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,090
that Prince Jin was framed

415
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,690
for trying to cover up

416
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,950
His Majesty's murder of Consort Jin.

417
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,400
Throughout history,

418
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:27,890
whenever rulers disregard the law
and kill indiscriminately,

419
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,950
it inevitably leads to public unrest

420
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,280
and gives the disloyal

421
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,280
a justification to fight for the throne.

422
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,130
Therefore,

423
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,330
throughout the ages,

424
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,040
such actions have been seen
as omens of a dynasty's downfall.

425
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,170
But His Majesty prides himself on
being an enlightened ruler

426
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,440
and has always encouraged open criticism.

427
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,170
If news of him killing Consort Jin
were to spread,

428
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,040
it would likely cause court officials

429
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,410
to impeach His Majesty
for breaking laws and moral codes,

430
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,440
leading to turmoil throughout the court.

431
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,210
Therefore,

432
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,760
His Majesty would certainly

433
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,960
try to conceal it by all means.

434
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,680
Prince Jin only knew
that His Majesty killed Consort Jin,

435
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,140
not the reasons behind it.

436
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,410
My father and he never revealed a word
about it,

437
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,170
surely fearing it would cause chaos
in the palace

438
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,900
and even disaster in the court.

439
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,810
Whoever moved Song Xiwen's carcass

440
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,270
to Prince Jin's residence

441
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,400
must know the truth

442
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,090
and intends to make it public.

443
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,890
I fear it's all for the throne.

444
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,020
Then, the Empress must know the truth.

445
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,570
To secure the throne,

446
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,480
she silenced Song Xiwen

447
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,850
to eliminate future troubles
for His Majesty.

448
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,140
No wonder Yan Che

449
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,130
was titled Crown Prince by His Majesty
after this incident.

450
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,200
The Empress and His Majesty

451
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,060
had already reached a concensus.

452
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:34,340
Everything the Empress did

453
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,960
was likely to ensure Yan Che

454
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,850
could smoothly inherit the throne.

455
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,050
But she did not expect

456
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,200
that His Majesty hates being manipulated
the most.

457
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,040
Eventually, His Majesty
found an opportunity

458
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,240
to remove both her and her son's titles.

459
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,460
How pitiful and tragic.

460
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,160
After Yan Che escaped,

461
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,450
what if he tries to make a comeback?

462
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,580
If our suspicions are correct,

463
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:54,890
then Yan Che

464
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,720
was deliberately allowed to escape
by His Majesty.

465
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,960
I just hope he doesn't fall into
Prince Cheng's hands,

466
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,560
or his life will be in danger.

467
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,680
What about Sui?

468
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,190
Don't worry, Chi,

469
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,610
I didn't hear anything.

470
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,940
Just like before,

471
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,870
don't say a single word.

472
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,590
Keep playing dumb.

473
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,240
Ambush! Protect His Highness!

474
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,340
I am Yan Che, Crown Prince of Zhou.

475
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,810
How dare you!

476
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,280
Crown Prince of Zhou?

477
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,890
Do you deserve that title?

478
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:19,810
Yan Qi,

479
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,880
what are you trying to do?

480
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,680
Brother,

481
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,440
this is Mount Beimang,

482
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:26,930
where all members of our Yan royal family

483
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,930
come to their final rest.

484
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,340
Prince Rui met his end here,

485
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,760
and you

486
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,490
will too.

487
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,960
Uncle died by your hand?

488
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,720
And now, you want to
kill your elder brother?

489
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,460
This place has beautiful mountains
and waters.

490
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,290
This precious spot

491
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,110
is indeed perfect for you.

492
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,990
Am I not being kind enough

493
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,680
as your younger brother?

494
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,570
Shameless!

495
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,930
You think killing Uncle and I

496
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,440
will secure you the Crown Prince position?

497
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,280
Delusional!

498
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,810
Yan Qi!

499
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:01,680
So talkative.

500
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,170
You've betrayed all morality,

501
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,830
how could Father possibly...

502
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,320
The deposed Crown Prince Yan Che

503
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,570
fled the palace

504
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:29,770
and secretly contacted the Northern Army
to plot rebellion.

505
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:31,170
Upon being captured,

506
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,170
knowing he couldn't face the Emperor,

507
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,330
he

508
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,170
took his own life

509
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,550
by slitting his own throat.

510
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:48,900
All hail Prince Cheng!

511
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,400
So what

512
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,200
if you're the legitimate son?

513
00:25:54,230 --> 00:26:01,630
All hail Prince Cheng!
All hail Prince Cheng!

514
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:28,610
Empress Dowager!

515
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:29,960
His Highness

516
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,370
has passed away.

517
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,300
My son!

518
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:14,820
I am to blame for Che's death.

519
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:19,050
I shouldn't have been so harsh on him,

520
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,950
nor should I have let him flee the palace.

521
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,400
I only wanted him to live freely.

522
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:37,810
Now I have to bury my own child.

523
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:43,960
Your Majesty, please restrain your grief.

524
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,360
Take care of your health.

525
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,480
Che

526
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,700
would be troubled in the afterlife.

527
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,210
My son...

528
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,550
My dear son!

529
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:04,370
Father.

530
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,890
Father, please don't blame yourself
too much.

531
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,290
It was all my negligence.

532
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,520
I failed to stop Che
from taking such a desperate path.

533
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,540
I am willing to bear all responsibility,

534
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,270
I only ask that
you take care of yourself, Father.

535
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,410
How is this your concern?

536
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,460
If Che

537
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:25,720
had already decided to end his life,

538
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,650
what could you have done?

539
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:29,520
Rise.

540
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,730
My son...

541
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,820
Thank you, Father.

542
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,660
My child...

543
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,410
Then I shall take my leave first

544
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:41,870
and not disturb your rest.

545
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:48,440
My son...

546
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,840
Prince Rui, please wait.

547
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,620
I have something to report.

548
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,720
That hairpin is truly beautiful.

549
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,810
I've found it.

550
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,960
It was always meant as a gift for you.

551
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,810
Chi.

552
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,090
Chi.

553
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,000
Tell me the truth.

554
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,490
Do you believe

555
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,240
that Che...

556
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,130
Took his own life?

557
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,410
If Your Majesty doesn't believe it,

558
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:24,170
then neither do I.

559
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,970
Of course I don't believe it.

560
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,410
Che was gentle by nature.

561
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,660
If he wasn't forced by someone,

562
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,570
how could he take his own life?

563
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,280
I

564
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,870
command you

565
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:42,900
and Wan

566
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:46,090
quickly investigate
the cause of Che's death.

567
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:51,570
You must uncover the whole truth for me

568
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:52,570
and clear

569
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:55,590
my son's name.

570
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,690
I obey Your Majesty's command.

571
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:17,300
My son...

572
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,000
Madam.

573
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,720
We should return to our quarters.

574
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,320
Her Highness never allowed us
into the garden.

575
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:32,850
Act smart.

576
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,280
A neglected Princess Consort like her

577
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,280
has no right to control me.

578
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,210
You little tramp, what did you say?

579
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,250
Guards!

580
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,200
Throw this tramp into the water!

581
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,000
Do you dare to?

582
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,610
-Let go of me!
-Why wouldn’t I dare?

583
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,470
Remember this.

584
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:48,040
No matter how neglected I am,

585
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,140
I am still Princess Consort Cheng's wife
appointed by His Majesty.

586
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,900
You...

587
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:54,320
You're nothing but a lowly woman

588
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,570
who serves with her body.

589
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:57,170
Do it!

590
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,370
Let me go!

591
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,410
She is indeed a tramp.

592
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,190
But in my eyes,

593
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,180
you're even worse than her.

594
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,130
Prince.

595
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,930
You actually hit me because of her.

596
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:17,720
Feng Chenbi,

597
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,610
I can spare your life,

598
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,300
but I'm divorcing you.

599
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,620
Go back and tell your father

600
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,810
that from today on,

601
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,960
your family should abandon

602
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,820
any thoughts of manipulating me.

603
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:30,860
Understand?

604
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:35,960
Prince.

605
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,480
There's nothing to see here,

606
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,200
let's go.

607
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,240
Your Highness.

608
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,890
Your Highness Prince Cheng,

609
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,000
I, the Duke of Zhong,

610
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,960
am the foremost noble in the capital.

611
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,610
Your maternal family and mine
have been close for generations.

612
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:18,360
We rise and fall together.

613
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,810
Why cause such embarrassment?

614
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:23,200
Who's rising and falling with you?

615
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,190
The Duke's mansion today

616
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,910
could enjoy wealth and glory

617
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,130
all because of what my mother and I

618
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:30,990
have earned for you in the palace.

619
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,000
I am now His Majesty's

620
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,590
only son of age.

621
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,960
Being appointed as Crown Prince

622
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,640
is only a matter of time.

623
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:42,960
But this Ms. Feng

624
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,880
has none of the dignity
of a future empress.

625
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,000
Duke,

626
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:56,680
if you still want future prosperity,

627
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,910
then quietly accept this divorce decree

628
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:02,410
and send your daughter to a nunnery.

629
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,350
If you insist on making trouble,

630
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:06,700
it wouldn't be difficult for my household

631
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,520
to have a woman die of illness.

632
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,290
Yan Qi, you bastard!

633
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:24,250
Father.

634
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,840
Go to the palace and ask the Noble Consort
to help us!

635
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,760
Silence!

636
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,200
Haven't we been humiliated enough?

637
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:36,440
Daughter,

638
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,930
the Noble Consort does care for you,

639
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,480
but she is Prince Cheng's mother first.

640
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,520
Who do you think she'll side with?

641
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,520
So Mother will just let me be divorced
by Prince Cheng?

642
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,940
It's your own fault for not being fertile.

643
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,590
If you had gotten pregnant earlier,

644
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,090
that little tramp wouldn't have
gained the advantage,

645
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:54,750
causing such embarrassment.

646
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:58,130
Getting pregnant isn't something
I can just make happen.

647
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:01,510
The Noble Consort may be favoured
in the palace,

648
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:03,440
but she only has Yan Qi, doesn't she?

649
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,570
You know nothing about palace affairs.

650
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:06,500
All these years,

651
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:09,370
His Majesty has been
giving the Noble Consort beauty pills,

652
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:11,300
supposedly to preserve her youth.

653
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:14,770
The Noble Consort has indeed
maintained her beauty,

654
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:17,210
but consuming too many medicinal compounds

655
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:19,639
has made it impossible for her
to bear more children.

656
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:23,570
Why would His Majesty prevent Her Highness
from having more children?

657
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:26,389
You only need to remember

658
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,800
that royal favour has always been
as thin as paper.

659
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:32,510
Preserving your own wealth and status

660
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,560
is what matters most.

661
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:40,600
[Morgue]

662
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:54,110
Prince Yan Che's limbs were bound,

663
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,159
yet no blood stains were formed.

664
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,490
It suggests that he was bound after death.

665
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:02,330
There are multiple bruises
on his chest and limbs.

666
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,890
The wound on his neck

667
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,290
is the only fatal injury.

668
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,770
When someone commits suicide
by slitting their throat,

669
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:32,370
they would experience pain, fear,

670
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:34,930
and even suffocation
when cutting the throat.

671
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:37,000
So, their hand strength would weaken

672
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:40,460
and the wound
would gradually become shallower.

673
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:44,530
But Prince Yan Che's wound is uniform
in depth.

674
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,410
It's clear the murderer acted swiftly

675
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,820
without any hesitation,

676
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,810
taking away his life with a single stroke.

677
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,890
Prince Yan Che would rather live in prison

678
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:54,120
than choose such a brutal death,

679
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,400
especially with such a small knife.

680
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,360
What do you plan to do?

681
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:05,890
Go with the flow.

682
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,060
Follow His Majesty's will.

683
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,760
I have an urgent matter to report.

684
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,540
Minister Li, please speak.

685
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:25,370
Prince Yan Che's death is a matter
of state importance

686
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,250
and cannot be settled with such haste

687
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,960
based solely on Prince Cheng's testimony.

688
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,480
I humbly request Your Majesty

689
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,410
to have this case

690
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,540
thoroughly investigated
by the Court of Judicial Review.

691
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,400
Li Muyun, what do you mean by this?

692
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,410
There were dozens of soldiers present
at the scene,

693
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,340
what do you mean by "my testimony"?

694
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,880
Your Majesty,

695
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,890
I am Zheng Baishi,
Prefect of the capital prefecture,

696
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:46,020
and I support Minister Li's proposal.

697
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:47,140
Zheng Baishi,

698
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:49,210
are you conspiring with Li Muyun

699
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,740
to falsely accuse me?

700
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:52,810
Your Highness, you have mistaken.

701
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,560
I merely agreed with Minister Li's
ruling according to the law.

702
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,960
how is that conspiracy?

703
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,960
Prince Rui requests to have an audience.

704
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,260
I have important evidence to present.

705
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,770
Your Majesty.

706
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,250
According to Princess Yongci's
examination,

707
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,600
Prince Yan Che

708
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,970
did not commit suicide,

709
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,640
but had his throat cut by someone else,

710
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,910
killed with a single stroke.

711
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:22,730
Nonsense!

712
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,340
Che had clearly

713
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,250
took his own life with a dagger.

714
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,770
Based on the wound analysis,

715
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:28,770
the murder weapon

716
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,180
was a long sword,

717
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:32,740
not the dagger presented by Prince Cheng.

718
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,420
I have secretly compared

719
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,250
the shape of the Prince Yan Che's wound

720
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,730
with the blade of Prince Cheng's sword,

721
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,160
and they match perfectly.

722
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,120
Absurd!

723
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,960
Utter nonsense!

724
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,560
Father,

725
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,050
he's falsely accusing me!

726
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,550
I...

727
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,190
I ordered you to find Prince Yan Che.

728
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,750
Why did you

729
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:01,580
bind your brother's limbs

730
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,960
and slit

731
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,120
his throat?

732
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,980
Father...

733
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:10,210
Because...

734
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:12,520
Because he...

735
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,960
Because he refused to return with me,

736
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,650
so I ordered him to be bound.

737
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,870
Driven by his anger,

738
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:19,450
he collided with my sword.

739
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,960
Lies!

740
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:24,730
Your Majesty!

741
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,160
Prince Yan Che

742
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,480
have died unjustly!

743
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,240
Your Majesty!

744
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:32,420
Prince Cheng

745
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:35,440
has long harbored ambitions
to replace the Crown Prince.

746
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,130
He relies on being Your Majesty's
only adult son

747
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,840
and already considers the throne
his for the taking.

748
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,050
He even declared arrogantly

749
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:44,600
that Ms. Feng is unworthy to be empress,

750
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:47,440
insisting on divorcing his wife
from my Duke of Zhongguo Residence.

751
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,200
The evidence of Prince Cheng's fratricide
is conclusive.

752
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,500
Your Majesty must not be lenient anymore!

753
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,470
Your Majesty!

754
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,000
Prince...

755
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,770
Prince Cheng, Yan Qi.

756
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,180
You are truly

757
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,210
cruel by nature.

758
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,750
For plotting to seize the crown,

759
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,540
you murdered your own brother.

760
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,400
Court of Judicial Review,

761
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:09,930
detain and interrogate him!

762
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:10,690
Your Majesty is wise.

763
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:11,890
Your Majesty is wise.

764
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,440
I'd like to see who dares.

765
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,120
Who dares.

766
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,160
All of you.

767
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,280
Every single one of you.

768
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:27,620
No.

769
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,460
So it was you, Father.

770
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,620
You've been deceiving me all along.

771
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:44,340
You were the one
who ordered me to kill Prince Yan Che.

772
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,160
Now you blame me for fratricide?

773
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,560
Blame me for fratricide?

774
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:49,920
Why did you lie to me?

775
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,290
Why did you lie to me?

776
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,960
-Why did you lie to me?
-Protect His Majesty!

777
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,960
Treason!

778
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,290
From this day forward,

779
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:58,120
Yan Qi is stripped of his royal status.

780
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,250
He shall be confined to
the Imperial Clan Court for life.

781
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,160
Go!

782
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:05,250
Father, why did you deceive me?

783
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,690
I am your only adult son!

784
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:08,530
Treason!

785
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,120
Father!

786
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:11,630
Your Majesty!

787
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:12,610
Your Majesty!

788
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,460
Please calm your anger, Your Majesty.

789
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,980
Che...

790
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:22,450
My dear Che...

791
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:37,400
Chi.

792
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,770
How is His Majesty's condition?

793
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,930
The imperial physician says
His Majesty has suffered too many shocks,

794
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:44,930
he's overwhelmed

795
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,250
and needs more rest.

796
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:49,820
Chi.

797
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:51,480
Why don't we ask His Majesty

798
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,640
to let us leave the capital?

799
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,300
I'm truly tired of this court.

800
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,120
People get executed at the drop of a hat.

801
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,250
It's too stressful.

802
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,000
You can leave if you want.

803
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,330
I still have unfinished business.

804
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:02,210
What business?

805
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,640
Why don't I know about it?

806
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:05,810
I'll tell you after I've handled it.

807
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:07,570
That won't do.

808
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,560
You don't have to tell me your business.

809
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,600
But if you don't leave, neither will I.

810
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,430
As Prince Yi, I may lack in other areas,

811
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,370
but I value loyalty.

812
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:16,830
I truly live up to my title.

813
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:23,550
Our brotherhood

814
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:26,030
far exceeds blood relations.

815
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,940
Let us in this life

816
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:29,990
share our fortunes together,

817
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,540
steadfast until the end.

818
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,080
Yan Qi.

819
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,570
You've committed many evil deeds.

820
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,250
Must His Majesty spell everything out?

821
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,980
Having me escort you

822
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,530
is already merciful to you.

823
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:52,490
Just make it easier on yourself.

824
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,770
What are you watching for? Seize him!

825
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,050
Greetings, Prince Rui.

826
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,210
I would appreciate
if Steward Yuan could be accommodating.

827
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,420
I have a few words

828
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:24,900
to speak privately with commoner Yan Qi.
