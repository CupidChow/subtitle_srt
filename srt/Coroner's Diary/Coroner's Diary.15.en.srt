00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,920
[Episode 15]

3
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,330
Young Marshal.

4
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,470
I found no trace of carriages or horses
along the way.

5
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,270
Could they have crossed Mount Yunwu?

6
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,640
They're not fleeting for their lives,

7
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,440
so they wouldn't have come to this.

8
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,640
But we've searched the entire forest.

9
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,080
How could there be no trace at all?

10
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,930
Could it be that

11
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,330
they've really grown wings and flown away?

12
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,270
We need to return
to Herbal Garden immediately!

13
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,660
Ning.

14
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,400
Wake up.

15
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,290
Ning.

16
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,960
Where is this?

17
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,440
This is an underground secret chamber.

18
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,800
I didn't touch anything.

19
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,820
How did Sun Haoyue manage to do this?

20
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,750
He must have drugged Senior first,

21
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,550
then lured us toward his
specially made medicinal incense.

22
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,170
It was my fault. I let my guard down.

23
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,630
He actually went as far as to
use his own junior.

24
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,890
You don't think your senior has...

25
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,290
My senior wouldn't know.

26
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,870
He shouldn't be in any mortal danger now.

27
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,920
Who knows how long we've been here.

28
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,500
Chi should be looking for us by now.

29
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,290
But

30
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,210
no one knows where this secret chamber is.

31
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,960
Even if he wants to rescue us, he can't.

32
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,400
So we need to quickly figure out a way

33
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,530
to get out on our own.

34
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:43,260
Can you stand up?

35
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,450
I can.

36
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,940
I still have great ambitions to
roam the martial world.

37
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,270
I can't be trapped here.

38
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,260
Let's go.

39
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:02,730
This way.

40
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:58,350
[Liver]

41
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,610

[Heart]

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,610
[Tongue]

44
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,040
[Nose]

45
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,120
So he is

46
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,310
the demon of Sanyuan Village?

47
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,690
We can't let him do evil again.

48
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,560
She woke up too early.

49
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,320
The dosage was insufficient.

50
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,650
How much more should we add?

51
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,300
Sun Haoyue and Bai Feijue?

52
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,530
Add one more mace.

53
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,050
Any more would damage her heart meridian.

54
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,450
Let me know in four hours.

55
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,320
Yes.

56
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,340
Young...

57
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,240
Young Master Bai.

58
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:38,680
Qin Xiang?

59
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,200
Why?

60
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,460
I had no choice. Your heart

61
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,090
could prolong Madam's life.

62
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,440
Your Highness!

63
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,690
Your Highness!

64
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:02,710
Something terrible has happened!

65
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,310
What is it?

66
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,260
Her Ladyship asked you to go to
Renxin Clinic immediately.

67
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,120
She also said no one should be allowed
to leave Herbal Garden.

68
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,800
Where is she?

69
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,610
Her Ladyship and Her Highness
went to Renxin Clinic

70
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,210
and still haven't come back!

71
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,050
Bai Feng.

72
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,000
Lead a team to seal Herbal Garden

73
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,380
and take everyone here to Renxin Clinic.

74
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,450
No one is allowed to enter or leave.

75
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,650
The rest of you, come with me!

76
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,290
Yes!

77
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,710
Come on.

78
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:40,680
Xiang.

79
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,760
Come on, help her up.

80
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,250
W... Wan?

81
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,760
Young Master Bai...

82
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,530
I know.

83
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,620
We'll take you out of here right away.

84
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,610
Those bastards

85
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,820
didn't even leave her
a single piece of clothing.

86
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,390
Xiang, hang in there a little longer.

87
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,490
Here.

88
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,780
Xiang was given a higher dosage than us.

89
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,400
I'm afraid she can't walk for a while.

90
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,600
Let's carry her then.

91
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,370
Let's go.

92
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:32,840
Let's go.

93
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,150
Are you okay?

94
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,170
I'm okay.

95
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,470
Who would've thought

96
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,070
there'd be a hidden mechanism
under the floor?

97
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,480
There must be an underground river here.

98
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,410
Let's turn back.

99
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,600
Okay.

100
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:41,990
Let's go.

101
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,110
[Benevolent Heart]

102
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:01,890
Master.

103
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,490
Only these few people are left
in Herbal Garden.

104
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,530
Why don't I see Mr. Dong?

105
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,540
Young Marshal.

106
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:17,850
Young Marshal.

107
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,800
We found this person
outside the inner quarters alone,

108
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,200
lying in the corridor
outside a stone wall.

109
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,400
He's still alive.

110
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,080
Fuling,

111
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,800
stay here and look after him.

112
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,410
Yes.

113
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,950
The rest of you, search the backyard!

114
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,200
Yes!

115
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,160
Hang in there.

116
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,840
I'm feeling better.

117
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,010
Let me walk on my own.

118
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,170
Thank you.

119
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,000
Nobody is going anywhere.

120
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,670
All of you, get back.

121
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:55,710
Not a chance!

122
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,480
With your hand shaking like that,

123
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,250
do you think your blade can be faster
than my arrow?

124
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,080
Killing you

125
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,260
would be more than easy.

126
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,580
Still overestimating yourself even now.

127
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,080
How amusing.

128
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,480
Why would you do this to me?

129
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:16,790
Why shouldn't I?

130
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,530
Don't tell me

131
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,920
you really believed
I was deeply in love with you,

132
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,690
and that I would marry no one but you.

133
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,750
But my feelings for you were genuine.

134
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,710
Genuine?

135
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,170
I think what you have genuine feelings for
is the Bai family's status.

136
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,830
You didn't even know who I was,

137
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,500
yet you dared to elope with me.

138
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,050
Your so-called genuine feelings
come rather cheaply.

139
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,480
Seeing how close you three sisters are,

140
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,720
which one should I start with?

141
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,480
You,

142
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:47,680
you,

143
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,740
or you?

144
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,700
The tea garden has been closed
for so long.

145
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,850
It must be hard to find Senior's
heart source now, right?

146
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,360
Who knows how much longer
Feiyan can hold on?

147
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,750
We may not be able to defeat you,

148
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:11,330
but harming our own heart meridians
isn't difficult.

149
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,070
If all three of us commit suicide
right in front of you,

150
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,310
I wonder how Senior would punish you.

151
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,330
Suicide?

152
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,290
I don't believe Qin Xiang would dare
to commit suicide!

153
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,430
I just need to wear you down
until you're exhausted,

154
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,830
then I can drag you away.

155
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:36,600
Stop!

156
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,440
If you dare take one more step forward,

157
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,740
I'll kill Qin Xiang!

158
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,630
Let's see what's faster,

159
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,100
your arrow or my dagger?

160
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,080
I'm sure she's told you

161
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,570
how much I can't stand her!

162
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,440
Qin Wan.

163
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,280
And me too.

164
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,210
If Qin Xiang dies,

165
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,580
we'll all die together.

166
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,330
You crazy women!

167
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,800
Have you all lost your minds?

168
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,330
Let her go!

169
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,770
Is... Is he dead?

170
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,890
Dead as he can be.

171
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,530
Even 100 hearts can't bring him back.

172
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,920
He came from that direction,

173
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,570
so the exit must be over there.

174
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,120
Let's go.

175
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:50,680
Be careful.

176
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,130
Young Marshal.

177
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,410
There's no other way out anywhere.

178
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,010
This stone door must be opened
from the inside.

179
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,760
Such massive rocks can't possibly
be moved by human strength alone.

180
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,960
There's no wind here.

181
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,020
It must be hydraulically powered.

182
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,150
But there's no running water around.

183
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,120
Not on the surface,

184
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,790
but that doesn't mean
there isn't any underground.

185
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,790
Start digging!

186
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,240
Someone's coming.

187
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,100
It must be Chi coming to rescue us.

00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,350
Yes!

374
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,020
Bai Feng.

375
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,720
When will they find the mechanism?

376
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,990
Why don't you guys go into the water
and save them first?

377
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,080
Except for Master,

378
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,380
none of us are good at swimming.

379
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,630
Wait.

380
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,130
Isn't the Shuoxi Army supposed
to be formidable?

381
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,040
How come you can't even swim?

382
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,120
What are you doing?

383
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,260
Going in the water.

384
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,500
Calm down.

385
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,140
Chi is such a good swimmer,

386
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,680
yet he hasn't surfaced,

387
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,760
What good would it do if you go in?

388
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,190
We have no idea

389
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,550
how bad the collapse is down there.

390
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:19,000
If you recklessly jump in like that,

391
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,130
are you trying to get yourself killed?

392
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,070
General Bai grew up in Shuoxi,

393
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,180
which is the driest
and most water-scarce place.

394
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,180
Where would he have learned to swim?

395
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,200
General Bai.

396
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,890
I spoke thoughtlessly just now.

397
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,660
Please don't take it to heart.

398
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,480
I'm just worried—

399
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:56,570
they've been down there for so long
and still haven't come up.

400
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:57,900
Could it be that they...

401
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,680
Could it be that they...

402
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,540
No, they won't!

403
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:02,860
Little Wan'er and Chi

404
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,370
are both blessed with great fortune.

405
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:07,070
I'm sure they'll survive.

406
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:40,970
Wan.

407
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,000
Wan.

408
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:03,960
Wan.

409
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,680
Wan.

410
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,770
Stay calm, Yan Chi.

411
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,980
You'll find a way.

412
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,700
You'll definitely find a way.

413
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:39,920
Wan.

414
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:44,440
Wan, wake up.

415
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,660
Spit it out!

416
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:49,840
Don't you want to help the villagers
of Sanyuan Village

417
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,160
get justice?

418
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,370
Don't you want to right all wrongs
in the world?

419
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:53,890
Wake up!

420
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,050
Wake up!

421
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,930
Wake up!

422
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,030
Come on.

423
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,230
Wake up!

424
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,370
You're awake.

425
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,490
It really is you.

426
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,280
It's all my fault for
not thinking things through

427
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,210
and letting you face danger alone.

428
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,330
I can't believe we're back here again.

429
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,030
Your wounds got wet.

430
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,470
Let me take care of them for you.

431
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,690
Get some good rest yourself.

432
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,090
Don't worry about me.

433
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,810
If you act recklessly again,

434
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:30,240
if anything were to happen to you,

435
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,570
where should I find you?

436
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,840
Your Highness, don't worry.

437
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,770
Xu He has mastered his skills.

438
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,150
I'm talking about you.

439
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,280
In this life,

440
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,900
I only want you.

441
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,250
I'll go change your dressing.

442
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,050
You know what I'm talking about.

443
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,700
Once I've said it,

444
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,410
I won't take it back.

445
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,760
Well...

446
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,110
Let go of me first.

447
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,050
It's hard to talk like this.

448
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,010
It's too cold here.

449
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,940
Let me sit up.

450
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:39,630
What are you doing?

451
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,250
Now that you're sitting up,

452
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,490
I can't let your feet get cold.

453
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,890
Your Highness, you're such a rare talent
among people.

454
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,290
Treated like this by you,

455
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,680
how could I not be moved?

456
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:06,850
But I

457
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,440
have no desire for love in this life.

458
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,460
I've been surrounded by soldiers
since childhood,

459
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,880
never knowing what love is in this world.

460
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,790
At first, I merely admired you.

461
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,330
Then gradually, I came to trust you.

462
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,420
I don't know when it was,

463
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,930
but suddenly I realized.

464
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,890
I feel joy when I'm with you.

465
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,280
I want to be with you every day,

466
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:39,880
even examining corpses together
would be a pleasure.

467
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,010
When you're sad,

468
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:44,000
my heart aches.

469
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,890
I don't want you
to suffer even the slightest pain.

470
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:51,480
Before rushing here,

471
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,280
all I could think about was seeing you

472
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,410
and protecting you.

473
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,480
Just now,

474
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,520
when I saw you lying there lifeless,

475
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,370
it was the first time in my life

476
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:02,370
I truly understood what fear means.

477
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,720
If we can make it out of here today,

478
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,300
in this life,

479
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,220
I wish to grow old with you.

480
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,070
To receive

481
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:38,670
Your Highness's deep affection
in this lifetime,

482
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,040
I'm blessed beyond measure.

483
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:44,760
But

484
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:46,760
I...

485
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:51,590
But

486
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,820
I

487
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:58,100
am not a suitable match for Your Highness.

488
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:11,030
Shen Wan.

489
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,409
I have deep feelings for you.

490
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,580
We once made a promise

491
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:26,590
to keep each other's secrets.

492
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,330
But I should at least know

493
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:30,659
who exactly made that pact with me, right?

494
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,170
How did you find out?

495
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:38,130
I didn't actually find out much.

496
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:42,060
Your father hid your traces very well,

497
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,570
and my men couldn't even enter
Medicine King Valley.

498
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:47,030
But you and the real Qin Wan

499
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:49,730
were once both at Medicine King Valley.

500
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,020
The time of your disappearance

501
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,550
exactly matches
when Qin Wan was in Jingzhou.

502
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,880
Though they say
illness makes one a doctor,

503
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,290
your medical skills

504
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,540
clearly come from years of practice.

505
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,370
Talent alone

506
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,220
couldn't reach such mastery.

507
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,320
There's something else though,

508
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:13,740
that is your unwavering loyalty
to Lord Shen.

509
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,060
None of what you said

510
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,120
can prove who I am.

511
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:26,080
As you know,

512
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,710
I never solve cases
based on evidence alone,

513
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,870
and this is enough for me.

514
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,840
Then you should also know

515
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,290
that my purpose for coming to the capital

516
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:37,690
is extremely dangerous.

517
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,820
You want to clear Lord Shen's name,

518
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,700
and I want to overturn Prince Jin's case.

519
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:44,570
Our goals are actually the same.

520
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:47,210
Since you already knew,

521
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:49,560
why do you still...

522
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,840
Because there's only one you
in this world.

523
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,620
Whether you're Shen Wan

524
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,640
or Qin Wan,

525
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,360
you are the one and only,

526
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,920
irreplaceable person in this world.

527
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,040
If I miss you,

528
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,870
I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

529
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,890
Master! Master!

530
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:03,970
Master.

531
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:04,820
I

532
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,610
can't see anything.

533
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,960
Hurry up and come help!

534
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:13,920
Yes.

535
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:23,750
Little Wan'er.

536
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,040
From now on,

537
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,040
this life of mine belongs to you.

538
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,210
Even if I never marry,

539
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,960
I'll protect you for a lifetime.

540
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,380
If you don't get married,

541
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,570
Godmother might just eat me alive.

542
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,560
Stop crying.

543
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:39,880
How can a mighty heroine
be shedding tears?

544
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,810
It's all because you scared me.

545
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,250
Thank you, Your Highness,
for saving my sister.

546
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:48,350
Otherwise, the consequences
would have been unimaginable.

547
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,930
It's what I should do.
Think nothing of it.

548
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:50,780
My Lady.

549
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,780
The medicine is here.

550
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:54,680
Let me.

551
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,930
Perhaps I should do it...

552
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:57,390
Fuling.

553
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,140
I'll go wash my face first.

554
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,340
I'll come back to keep you company soon.

555
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:18,700
Let's go.

556
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,210
It's hot.

557
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:30,630
Well, Wan,

558
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,740
I'll leave you to rest then.

559
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,420
Wan, you've turned misfortune
into blessing.

560
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,930
As long as you recuperate peacefully,

561
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:38,990
I'm sure you'll completely recover.

562
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:40,950
Thank you, Cousin Yan.

563
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:47,770
Here.

564
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,760
What's wrong?

565
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,300
Qin Yan must have discovered something.

566
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:55,480
We'd better keep our distance from now on.

567
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,410
There's no need to keep it a secret.

568
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,340
They'll find out sooner or later.

569
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,710
You wouldn't want them to be in the dark

570
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:04,120
when I come to propose in the future,
would you?

571
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,320
Don't talk nonsense.

572
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,920
I'm not talking nonsense.

573
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,120
Though that basement wasn't a nice place,

574
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,850
I meant every word I said there.

575
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,910
But I'm not romantic,

576
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:18,890
and my temperament is hardly gentle.

577
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,560
If it weren't for my current identity,

578
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,370
I would never want to live

579
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:23,430
as a proper noble lady bound by rules.

580
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,570
But that's exactly what I love about you,
your defiance.

581
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,180
The woman who can be my wife

582
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,350
should be someone who can

583
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:31,150
fight alongside me as a heroine,

584
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,210
not someone confined to
the inner chambers,

585
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,670
who only knows to put on makeup
and rely on me.

586
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,560
What wife?

587
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,210
It's still a bit too early
to use that word.

588
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,370
So you're

589
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,210
planning to love me and leave me now?

590
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,170
Love you?

591
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,920
I haven't done anything to you.

592
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,410
Don't talk nonsense.

593
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:57,670
You've disturbed my peace of mind,
and that counts.

594
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,060
Listen carefully.

595
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,370
Until my Father's name is cleared,

596
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,710
I don't want to discuss marriage.

597
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,850
Because once I become a housewife,

598
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:10,110
I'll be bound by even more restrictions.

599
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:14,730
I'm sorry.

600
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:16,560
If you can't accept this,

601
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,120
we can still go back to
the way things were.

602
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:18,850
No, we can't.

603
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:20,960
Why not?

604
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:25,770
Because my heart
can't go back to how it was,

605
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,090
and also because

606
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:30,020
I've always intended for you to be

607
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:32,950
my Crown Prince openly
with your true identity.

608
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,440
Yan Chi.

609
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:44,480
However...

610
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,010
However, you'll need to give me
something in return.

611
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,160
What do you want?

612
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:55,930
In Jingzhou, there's Yue Qing;

613
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:57,730
and at Medicine King Valley, there are
your fellow disciples.

614
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:58,690
Once you go to the capital,

615
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:01,160
what if you encounter people
with ill intentions?

616
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,770
To prevent any unexpected troubles,

617
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:04,570
shouldn't you give me something

618
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,160
to put my mind at ease?

619
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,690
But I have nothing of value.

620
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:11,740
Even Hanyue and the Nine Needles
were gifts from you.

621
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:34,040
Then you must promise me,

622
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,040
no concubines, no secondary wives.

623
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:37,710
Whether we're married or not,

624
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,300
if you cannot be faithful to me alone,

625
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,730
then vast as the mountains and seas are,

626
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,190
I can go anywhere I please.

627
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,290
Qin Wan.

628
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:53,550
I, Yan Chi, am not a fickle person.

629
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,560
It was on the battlefield

630
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,640
that I learned what it means
to face life and death together

631
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,000
and to make a lifelong promise.

632
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,570
The path we've chosen is long
and full of obstacles.

633
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:02,590
Aside from you,

634
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:05,240
no other woman can walk it alongside me.

635
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:09,890
To have you in this lifetime
is all I could ever ask for.

Master, I have something to report...

What's wrong with my eyes?

646
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:07,580
Why can't I see anything all of a sudden?
