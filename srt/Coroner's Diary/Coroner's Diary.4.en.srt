[Coroner's Diary]

2
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,970
[Episode 4]

3
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,380
Teeth marks.

4
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,660
Before Miss Song got married,

5
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,460
she might've had a secret lover.

6
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,020
Xu He.

7
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,330
Shut up. Get out!

8
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,680
A secret lover?

9
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,770
Are you sure about that?

10
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,710
Miss Qin,

11
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,250
you can't make up things like that.

12
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,560
Please take a look.

13
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,420
This is an old wound.

14
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,410
On the skin that hasn't rotted,

15
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,700
you can see
two symmetrical crescents of black dots.

16
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,100
The upper dots are longer and darker

17
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,850
because upper teeth are bigger

18
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,990
and more widely spaced.

19
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,780
They leave deeper marks.

20
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,340
This is a bite.

21
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,470
A contusion caused by human teeth.

22
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,960
Even if it was a bite,

23
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,570
couldn't it have come from a fight

24
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,780
between women?

25
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,390
Men and women have different jaw widths.

26
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,850
If this had happened in a fight,

27
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,850
the victim would've struggled or dodged.

28
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,780
The wound and its location
would've been different.

29
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,250
Yes.

30
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,380
Besides, Song Rou was the daughter
of the Duke of Song.

31
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,100
No one would've dared offend her,

32
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,700
let alone bite her like this.

33
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,690
But you can't conclude

34
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,290
she had an affair

35
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,820
based solely on a bite mark.

36
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,320
There were also the termites.

37
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,810
They feed on rotting wood

38
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,829
and rarely attack living things.

39
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,940
The only reason
they appeared near her private parts

40
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,510
is because she once
lay naked near their nest.

41
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,570
Do you think she was sexually assaulted?

42
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,500
If she were, why didn't she cry out?

43
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,860
The escort guards could've heard her.

44
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,440
On the wedding day,

45
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,510
she was carried into Jingzhou
in her bridal palanquin.

46
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,290
The only chance
would've been the night before.

47
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,780
If it hadn't been someone close to her,

48
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,880
why would she have gone
to the banyan woods alone at night?

49
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,510
Miss Song died so horribly.

50
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,380
Why did no one
in the huge escort team notice a thing?

51
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,090
Even worse,

52
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,350
someone tried to play tricks
at the Marquis Mansion

53
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,590
to mess with my head.

54
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,730
It must have been someone
from the escort team.

55
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,829
Do you think the servants

56
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,510
were trying to cover things up
to avoid punishment

57
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,040
for failing to protect her?

58
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,650
That's understandable.

59
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,900
You have a point.

60
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,060
Prefect Huo, please authorize an autopsy

61
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,660
so I can find solid evidence.

62
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:40,620
What?

63
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,940
An autopsy?

64
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,180
Absolutely not.

65
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,170
Absolutely not.

66
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,380
The Duke of Song would never agree to it.

67
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,130
Prefect Huo,

68
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,620
Song Rou was supposed to stay home

69
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,570
for marriage preparations
these past few months.

70
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,600
If she had lost her virginity
before the wedding

71
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,250
yet still planned
to marry into the Yue family,

72
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,130
that would mean the Duke

73
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,329
had no respect for either the Yue family

74
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,820
or His Majesty.

75
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,850
This is a serious matter.

76
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,730
You've been a prefect for years.

77
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,190
You surely know what to do.

78
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,560
I'll reinvestigate everyone
in the escort team

79
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,220
and convince Wei Yanzhi
to approve the autopsy.

80
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,810
I'll take my leave.

81
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,450
Things are bound to turn ugly

82
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,250
between the Duke of Song
and the Yue family.

83
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,380
Before the autopsy,

84
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,940
please don't tell anyone about

85
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,140
Song Rou's possible loss of virginity.

86
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,770
Coroners who leak examination details

87
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:25,860
will be whipped 100 times.

88
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,190
I may not be an official,

89
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,970
but I know the rules of postmortems.

90
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,570
Don't worry, Your Highness.

91
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,060
Coroner Xu,

92
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,890
place the body with the table
it lies on into the empty coffin.

93
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,180
Surround the body

94
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,159
with peppercorns and charcoal
before sealing the coffin.

95
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,130
Place extra ice basins around the coffin

96
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,450
to slow down decomposition

97
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,740
for the third examination.

98
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,400
Yes.

99
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,600
One more thing.

100
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,970
Have our men in the capital carefully
check the Song family's inner quarters.

101
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,100
The inner quarters?

102
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,060
You mean

103
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,660
Song Rou was misbehaving?

104
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,450
Looks like I have to
send you back to boot camp

105
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,780
to relearn discipline.

106
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,130
Forgive me, Master.

107
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,210
I'd rather run ten laps around Jingzhou

108
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,740
than be apart from you.

109
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,450
You get it, don't you?

110
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,110
Miss Qin, take care.

111
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,140
General Bai has urgent matters to report.

112
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,470
Let's not disturb them.

113
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,120
What a surprise. Besides me,

114
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,180
there's actually someone else
the sweet-talking,

115
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,580
tough General Bai fears.

116
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,890
Master, stop calling me General.

117
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:54,810
When you call me that,

118
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,210
it makes my knees go weak.

119
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,080
Autopsy?

120
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:01,910
Prefect Huo,

121
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,810
you know the position I'm in.

122
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,010
I really

123
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,980
can't explain this to the Duke.

124
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,750
If this case remains unsolved,

125
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,170
the Duke,

126
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,210
the Marquis,

127
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,370
and even you and I—

128
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,050
none of us
will be able to answer to His Majesty.

129
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,860
You're right.

130
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,720
-But…
-Father!

131
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,510
I found the crime scene.

132
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:22,500
Where?

133
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,010
At the posthouse at Shili Temple.

134
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,340
Just like Miss Qin said,

135
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,380
there really are banyan woods beside it.

136
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,060
We found traces of blood
next to some dry branches

137
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,120
in a secluded spot.

138
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,460
Did you find Rou's head?

139
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:32,820
No.

140
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,390
We searched the entire woods

141
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,380
but couldn't find it.

142
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,640
Could it have been taken by a wild animal?

143
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,390
Shili Temple is the closest posthouse
to Jingzhou,

144
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,860
with lots of people coming and going.

145
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,060
Unless it's the dead of winter
when food is scarce,

146
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,830
wild animals wouldn't come near.

147
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,190
It's also possible
that the killer took it.

148
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,550
But why would they want her head?

149
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,710
Maybe

150
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,610
to cover up the evidence.

151
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,220
I failed at my job.

152
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:58,970
Vice Commandant Wei,

153
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,620
please have the Duke of Song write me

154
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,220
a letter as soon as possible.

155
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,060
After all, whether he agrees
to the autopsy or not,

156
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,570
I have to report to His Majesty

157
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,130
and the Yue family.

158
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,150
I'll take my leave.

159
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,690
Your Highness,

160
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,770
this is such a smart move.

161
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,450
With the Duke of Song's letter,

162
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,780
I won't be blamed for
not performing the necessary autopsy.

163
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,960
The blame falls entirely on him now.

164
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,250
According to criminal law,

165
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,650
not performing an autopsy when necessary
is a violation of imperial protocol.

166
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:34,930
It's meant to prevent coroners

167
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,850
from being lazy or evasive.

168
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,950
Finding a scapegoat
isn't something to celebrate.

169
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,770
It's just how things played out.

170
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:44,140
I'm not trying to dodge responsibility.

171
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,670
Miss Qin said that

172
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,090
out of a sense of justice.

173
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,090
Prefect Huo, don't take it to heart.

174
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,060
I've dealt with the Duke of Song for you.

175
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,450
But you have to handle
the Marquis of Anyang yourself.

176
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,250
After all,

177
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,090
what the Yue family wants

178
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,130
is just the truth.

179
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:58,860
Alright.

180
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,560
I'll go question
the escort team right away.

181
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:02,780
Farewell.

182
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,170
Take care.

183
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,950
Son,

184
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,580
you should focus on your studies.

185
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,050
Qin Wan is too far above us.

186
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,680
She's out of your league.

187
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,070
Fu Ling.

188
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,760
Get in. We're going back
to the Marquis Mansion.

189
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,420
You upset Miss Qin?

190
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,970
She looks furious.

191
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:43,490
You can start running ten laps

192
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,690
around Jingzhou now!

193
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,180
Wait, Master.

194
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:46,820
I...

195
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,420
Well...

196
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,790
I know it's hard to hear,

197
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,020
but when you upset a girl,

198
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,260
you have to win her back fast.

199
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,920
If you wait until the next day,
it'll be too late!

200
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,350
[Marquis of Anyang's Mansion]

201
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,690
Miss Qin!

202
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,060
Miss Qin.

203
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,020
Are you upset that

204
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,750
I used the Duke of Song's letter

205
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,020
to let Huo Huaixin off the hook?

206
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,620
Yes.

207
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,820
Even if Prefect Huo
fears the Duke's power,

208
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,300
with a little pressure from you,

209
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,700
he might've had the courage
to take responsibility.

210
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,730
Do you think he's
only afraid of approving the autopsy?

211
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,100
What he truly fears is that
you'll uncover evidence

212
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,790
that Song Rou had an affair

213
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,610
and the Duke of Song
will take it out on him.

214
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,660
Then why did Your Highness

215
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,720
still let Prefect Huo shirk his duty?

216
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,970
Is a human life

217
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,940
worth less than his official title?

218
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,740
Because you found the bite mark.

219
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,530
His Majesty has paid attention
to this case.

220
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,660
Even if the bite mark

221
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,190
isn't definitive proof
of Song Rou's affair,

222
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,590
it's enough to raise suspicion.

223
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,730
If I submit the re-examination report

224
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,610
along with the Duke's letter…

225
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,950
His Majesty will suspect

226
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,940
the Duke wants to
obstruct the investigation.

227
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,540
If His Majesty
orders a thorough investigation,

228
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,200
what can the Duke possibly do?

229
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,120
I've wronged you, Your Highness.

230
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,430
Please punish me.

231
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,210
No need.

232
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,180
I only acted according to the situation.

233
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,020
It's nothing.

234
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,160
But

235
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,500
I do hope, from now on,

236
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,180
you can be honest

237
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,550
and open with me.

238
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,540
I can't shake the feeling

239
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,260
that Wei Yanzhi is suspicious.

240
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,030
He acted heartbroken just now,

241
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,550
but he couldn't even look me in the eye.

242
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,230
I'll have someone watch him—

243
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,020
see if he'll really
send a letter to the Duke.

244
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,250
Tomorrow is the 15th.
There will be a lantern fair.

245
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,420
He doesn't know I've found out

246
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,020
Miss Song had a secret lover.

247
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,550
Your Highness, please spread the word

248
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,690
that I plan to do
a third examination in a few days.

249
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,540
At the fair tomorrow,

250
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,510
I'll lure him out

251
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,550
and see if he wants to get rid of me.

252
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,860
Why risk yourself like this?

253
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,260
Find a martial maid
from the Marquis Mansion…

254
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,730
If Wei Yanzhi really is the killer,

255
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:49,770
he won't take the bait

256
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:50,770
unless it's real.

257
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,850
Your Highness,

258
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,200
just have someone follow me tomorrow.

259
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,260
I'll take my leave.

260
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,830
Young Master,
here's a letter from the capital.

261
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,280
It says Young Master Qizhi

262
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,490
and his attendant disappeared
the day after we left.

263
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,010
Why didn't you report this sooner?

264
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,190
The guards searched the entire capital

265
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,450
but couldn't find him.

266
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,280
Only then did the Duke send word.

267
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,330
Send men to search along the road we took.

268
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,120
I'm afraid…

269
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,610
my brother is on his way here.

270
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,290
Then…

271
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,250
could it be him who killed…

272
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:36,890
Shut up!

273
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,610
Don't you think
the Duke's already in enough trouble?

274
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,330
But I heard from His Highness's men

275
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,280
that they'll do a third examination.

276
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,920
If they really find something,

277
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,920
how will we explain that to the Duke?

278
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,970
If the coroner disappears,

279
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:00,690
the Duke

280
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,020
can rest easy.

281
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,430
[Silence]

282
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,210
Grand Princess,
your condition has stabilized.

283
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,260
You just need medicine and rest now.

284
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,390
I'll come check on you every other day.

285
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:21,970
Once again,

286
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,060
you saved

287
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,540
my life, Miss Qin.

288
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,780
Miss Qin,

289
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,630
if only you could stay here with Ning.

290
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,400
Yes, Little Wan'er,

291
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,130
please stay.

292
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,090
Thank you for your kindness,

293
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,710
but the Qin Mansion isn't far from here.

294
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,370
It's easy for me to come and go.

295
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,050
Why do you have to go home every night?

296
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,910
Miss Qin hasn't married yet.

297
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,670
If she stays out overnight,

298
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,240
people will gossip.

299
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:51,770
Chi.

300
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,750
You look troubled.

301
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,090
Is it because the case isn't going well?

302
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,730
No.

303
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,560
Miss Qin has confirmed
the murder happened at Shili Temple.

304
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,930
The escort team
hadn't entered Jingzhou by then.

305
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,390
No one can implicate the Yue family.

306
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,820
So, Jia,

307
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,800
you're cleared of suspicion.

308
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,070
Thank goodness.

309
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,490
Thank goodness.

310
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,570
Wan,

311
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,950
you really are our lucky star.

312
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,660
We don't even know how to thank you.

313
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,660
Since I arrived in Jingzhou,

314
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,550
I haven't gone out to have fun yet.

315
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,850
There's a lantern fair tonight
for the Autumn Festival.

316
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:27,950
I really want to go.

317
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,540
Grand Princess, could you

318
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,250
talk to my grandma on my behalf?

319
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,490
No problem.

320
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,630
I'll send someone
to inform your grandma right away.

321
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,370
And don't go home tonight.

322
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,780
Let Chi

323
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,860
go with you

324
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,210
and Ning and have some fun.

325
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,730
Yes. I'll make sure Little Wan'er

326
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,970
enjoys herself.

327
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,090
And Vice Commandant Wei.

328
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,040
He's looked gloomy all day.

329
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,820
Maybe he's still worried about the case.

330
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,370
Can I let him join us?

331
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:55,660
Yeah.

332
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,170
That illegitimate son of the Wei family

333
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,990
unfortunately got dragged into this mess.

334
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,110
Poor guy.

335
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:05,020
He definitely has no idea
how to face the Song family now.

336
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,780
He really is quite pitiful.

337
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,020
Let him go.

338
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,300
Let him join you.

339
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,750
As you wish, Great Aunt.

340
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,230
I'll go too.

341
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,640
Sure.

342
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,180
You all go play.

343
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,300
My Lady,

344
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,370
look, so many gifts.

345
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,660
Your Ladyship, this is too much.

346
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,570
Mother and Grandma
prepared them for you.

347
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,660
If you don't want them,

348
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,660
go tell my mother.

349
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,730
Come on, get in the carriage.

350
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,900
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

351
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,600
What's this?

352
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,020
The most popular storybook right now.

353
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,780
Miss Qin will surely like it.

354
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,140
You're giving a storybook
to an unmarried lady?

355
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,940
Aren't you worried
it'll tarnish her reputation?

356
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,660
Even if it's about a heroine
fighting injustice?

357
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,420
If you give her a medical book,

358
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,570
she may like it more.

359
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:11,600
Go back.

360
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,760
Then you take it.

361
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,180
Chi.

362
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,040
This...

363
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,850
This is for you.

364
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,150
It's a story about heroes.

365
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,070
By the way,

366
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,850
I'll be the one to walk Miss Qin out

367
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,920
from now on.

368
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,490
Why?

369
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,170
Because

370
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,060
you can't beat me.

371
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,230
I...

372
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,020
I'll beat you someday!

373
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,900
I'll wait.

374
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,380
Let's go!

375
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,860
My bunny.

376
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,670
Look.

377
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:13,490
So beautiful.

378
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:16,940
Little Wan'er,

379
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,550
this whole street is packed
with food and games.

380
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,010
Where do you want to start?

381
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,020
Where are my brother and Chi?

382
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,380
I haven't seen them
since we got off the carriage.

383
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,360
Forget about them.

384
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,690
Let's enjoy ourselves.

385
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,950
Your Ladyship, look at that lantern.

386
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:34,950
So beautiful.

387
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,820
That little rabbit is so cute.

388
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:42,910
My Lady, look!

389
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,200
There's a shadow play!

390
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,980
Come on. Let's give it a try.

391
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:47,720
Hurry up.

392
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,700
You try it too.

393
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:33,740
No, thanks.

394
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,540
"Seagulls and Egrets in Serenity."

395
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,400
Seagulls what?

396
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,140
It's the name of a zither piece,
"Seagulls and Egrets in Serenity."

397
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,330
In all this noise,

398
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,140
you can still recognize a tune.

399
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,960
You must've been good at the zither
since you were young.

400
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,770
Not at all.

401
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,850
That piece is my older brother's favorite.

402
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,690
I've heard him play it so many times

403
00:17:58,690 --> 00:17:59,890
that it stuck with me.

404
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,060
So your brother studied the zither
from a young age?

405
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,590
He's the Wei family's
eldest legitimate son,

406
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,620
highly valued
by both Mother and the Duke of Song.

407
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,060
The Duke even hired

408
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,020
the best zither teacher in the capital
to teach him and Rou.

409
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,700
If he hadn't broken his leg taming a horse

410
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,050
before the trip,

411
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,540
he would've been the one
escorting the bride.

412
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,160
There are thick calluses
on the second joint

413
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,020
of her left middle finger
and the joint of her thumb.

414
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,920
The Song family's servants said

415
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,250
Miss Song was quite skilled at the zither.

416
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,890
Then why didn't you
learn to play the zither?

417
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,750
Because when my mother was alive,

418
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:35,070
she didn't want me
to trouble the Duke too often.

419
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,130
Come on,

420
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,850
we're out to have fun.

421
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,730
Let's not talk about sad things.

422
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:44,270
His Highness will be worried
if he can't find us.

423
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,340
Vice Commandant Wei and I
will go over there.

424
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,470
You two go look for them

425
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,470
and meet us later.

426
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,850
No way.

427
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,540
It's better if Miss Qin

428
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,270
and Your Ladyship stay here for a bit.

429
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,930
I'll go look for His Highness.

430
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,780
It's just that

431
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,040
I want to find that zither player first,

432
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,650
so I'm afraid you'll have to

433
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,850
wait a little longer.

434
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:01,570
Go on, go.

435
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,780
Just don't get lost.

436
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,260
Anyone who doesn't know
he's an illegitimate son

437
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,110
would take him

438
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,020
for some young master

439
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,820
from a prestigious family.

440
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,590
Let's go.

441
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,220
Lanterns.

442
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,810
Beautiful lanterns.

443
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,260
Lanterns.

444
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:40,600
Fu Ling,

445
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,080
go lead Her Ladyship away.

446
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:43,650
No,

447
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,250
I need to stay and protect you.

448
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,680
I talked with His Highness.

449
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,250
He'll be watching over me in secret.

450
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,580
You don't have to worry.

451
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:51,180
Go.

452
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,780
I like this one.

453
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,370
Your Ladyship, look.

454
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,780
That butterfly is so beautiful.

455
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,820
Let's go to the second floor.

456
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,020
Sure. Little Wan'er.

457
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,460
Where is she?

458
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,890
She went to find His Highness.

459
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:04,650
Don't worry.

460
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:05,910
But...

461
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,260
Come on, let's go.

462
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,000
Sir, this float is so fun!

463
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:11,900
Get on it.

464
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,700
Goodbye, sir. Goodbye.

465
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,500
Miss Qin.

466
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,930
She's so beautiful.

467
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,020
She really is.

468
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,610
The Shuoxi Army guards the borders,

469
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,020
fighting by day
and sleeping in cold mountains by night,

470
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,410
so that the cities can be brightly lit

471
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,260
every night

472
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,330
and the people can live in peace.

473
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,260
Miss, you're so beautiful.

474
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,290
I'm not as noble as you, Chi.

475
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,800
I just want the one I love

476
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,220
to stay safe.

477
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,850
Only when our country is prosperous

478
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,410
can the people be safe and thriving.

479
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,090
Right?

480
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,310
Miss…

481
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:36,980
Sorry.

482
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,830
Who are you looking for?

483
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,130
Sorry.

484
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,500
I mistook you for someone else.

485
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,700
Who is he looking for?

486
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,460
All kinds of masks!

487
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,020
Come and take a look.

488
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:39,540
Wei Yanzhi.

489
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,980
Is that you?

490
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:44,930
Miss,

491
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:45,840
do you want a mask?

492
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,610
We've got everything.

493
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,540
Take a look.

494
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,400
I want this one.

495
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,130
Okay.

496
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:54,570
Come on.

497
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,510
Come and take a look.

498
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:57,850
Lantern riddles!

499
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:59,350
Come and try your luck.

500
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:00,650
If you get them all right,

501
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:03,020
you'll win a special prize

502
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,460
prepared by our shop!

503
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,500
Come and give it a shot!

504
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,020
Take a look.

505
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,260
Lantern riddles!

506
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,280
Hurry up.

507
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,260
Are you alright?

508
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,330
I'm fine.

509
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:49,780
Why are you here?

510
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:52,990
I saw Wei Yanzhi
getting off the lantern float,

511
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:53,990
so I followed him.

512
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,260
I was afraid he'd see me,

513
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,300
so I bought a mask.

514
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,300
But then I realized

515
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,700
it wasn't Wei Yanzhi.

516
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,380
It wasn't.

517
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,740
He's still there listening to music.

518
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,880
It was bold of you to take a risk

519
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,170
on such a crowded street.

520
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:33,650
Luckily,

521
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,980
someone mentioned a girl in a xiezhi mask.

522
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,320
That's how I found you.

523
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:41,010
How did you know
I was the one in the xiezhi mask?

524
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,820
The xiezhi can tell right from wrong.

525
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,020
In this world,

526
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,090
what other girl

527
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,370
would wear such a fierce-looking mask?

528
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,320
You're hurt?

529
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,370
It's nothing.

530
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,320
Don't tell anyone.

531
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:01,930
Let's go.

532
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,860
How did you get hurt so badly?

533
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,460
It's inevitable when you fight in battles.

534
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,410
But this blade wound

535
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,480
is clearly recent.

536
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,480
But there's no battlefield

537
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,470
between the capital and Jingzhou.

538
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,080
This is why they say
smart women are dangerous.

539
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,460
I think only inept people believe that.

540
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:47,250
I didn't expect Your Highness
to be one of them.

541
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:48,780
I'm just afraid that knowing too much

542
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,040
may get you in trouble.

543
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,370
However,

544
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,010
if you want to know,

545
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,720
I can tell you.

546
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,500
I don't want to uncover military secrets.

547
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,360
What if it's not a military secret

548
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,740
but a wrongful conviction in the capital?

549
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,030
You still don't need to tell me.

550
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:11,020
If that wound had gone

551
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,330
half an inch deeper,
you'd have become a cripple.

552
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:14,310
Why didn't you

553
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,230
say anything or get treatment?

554
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,990
The wound is already infected.

555
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,280
I have medicine with me.

556
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,480
I can treat it myself.

557
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,120
Have some numbing decoction.

558
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:28,060
No need.

559
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:29,710
I can take it.

560
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,360
That wound goes across your spine.

561
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,300
I need to remove
the infected tissue before stitching.

562
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,500
If you move even slightly,
the nerves could be damaged.

563
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,300
By then, it'll be beyond fixing.

564
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,900
I joined the army when I was ten.

565
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,130
I've gotten through worse without help.

566
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,390
Using things like that

567
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:46,770
only makes a man soft.

568
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:48,370
Fine.

569
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:51,020
If it becomes too much, tell me.

570
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,710
Don't worry.

571
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,330
Miss Qin,

572
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,660
please make me a wound medicine

573
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,430
for battlefield emergencies.

574
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,500
I want it to work fast.

575
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,610
Anything that works fast is fierce.

576
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,260
Most people wouldn't be able to handle it.

577
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,590
The Shuoxi Army is known for being fierce.

578
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,780
A fierce medicine suits us just fine.

579
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:46,220
All done.

580
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,260
Master, I have something to report.

581
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:54,750
Come in.

582
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,020
Master,

583
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,050
someone deliberately cut off

584
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:04,080
the beam at the base of the lantern tower.

585
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,610
But it wasn't Wei Yanzhi
who lured Miss Qin out.

586
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:07,660
At the time of the incident,

587
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,260
he was at Tianyin Pavilion
listening to music.

588
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,090
The musician and the shopkeeper
both confirmed it.

589
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,190
The Song family has 20 martial guards.

590
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,350
They're all at the Song Mansion now.

591
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,080
But

592
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,920
they went
to the lantern fair together earlier.

593
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,810
It's a small guard team,

594
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,540
but they're more disciplined
than actual soldiers.

595
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,570
Even when they're off duty,
they stick together.

596
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:25,630
That's not common.

597
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,650
I'll go deal with them right away.

598
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:28,460
-Stop.
-Stop.

599
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,220
You can't act without just cause.

600
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,590
They did all this

601
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,410
to stop me from performing the autopsy.

602
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:39,650
The sooner we get it done,

603
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,850
the less chance they have to interfere.

604
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:43,930
Bai Feng,

605
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,330
tomorrow you're allowed
to spar with the Song family's guards.

606
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,460
Make it a narrow win.

607
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,150
Don't end it too quickly.

608
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,670
Keep it going until Huo Huaixin steps in.

609
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:53,820
Yes.

610
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:56,980
Miss Qin,

611
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,540
please conduct the autopsy tomorrow.

612
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,130
Okay.

613
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,430
[Fair and Just]

614
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,740
General Bai,

615
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:36,430
you said you fought
with the Song family's guards

616
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,700
because they slandered His Highness.

617
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,260
What exactly did they say?

618
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,450
They said His Highness
is highly skilled in martial arts

619
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,540
and arrived in Jingzhou just after them.

620
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,670
They claimed he used

621
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:46,780
the investigation

622
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,130
as a pretext to sexually assault Miss Song

623
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,790
and killed her when it failed.

624
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,610
Nonsense!

625
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,300
Your Highness,

626
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,820
I swear on my life,

627
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:01,190
no one in the Song Mansion

628
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,100
would dare harbor

629
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,700
such an outrageous thought.

630
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:07,740
Prefect Huo.

631
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:12,060
Rumors may die in the minds of the wise,

632
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:14,060
but there's no smoke without fire.

633
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,280
If word like that gets out,

634
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,500
how can I still call myself

635
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:20,950
the Young Marshal of the Shuoxi Army?

636
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,160
I'll issue an immediate gag order.

637
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:26,150
I…

638
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,780
I'm ashamed.

639
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,420
Since someone's stirring the pot,

640
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,800
there's no need for me to hold back.

641
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,400
Miss Song's autopsy
must be done immediately.

642
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,500
If we can't find the real killer
and clear my name,

643
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,290
the two of you

644
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,820
can take a trip with me to Shuoxi.

645
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,810
Calm down, Your Highness.

646
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,880
I'll arrange the autopsy right away.

647
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,080
[Grace and Purity]

648
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,540
My Lady, is something on your mind?

649
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,470
You've been zoning out for a while.

650
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,070
There's something I can't figure out.

651
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,470
Why would Lord Yan
willingly tarnish his own name

652
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,200
to help me conduct the autopsy?

653
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,540
This case has nothing to do
with the Yue family,

654
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,400
and it's not his responsibility.

655
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,750
He has no personal grudge
against the Song family either.

656
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,740
My Lady,

657
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,540
how do you think His Highness treats you?

658
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,130
Very well.

659
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,650
Then why do you think

660
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,700
His Highness treats you differently

661
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,430
from everyone else?

662
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,600
He said

663
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,420
I saved the Grand Princess,

664
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,680
so he's indebted to me.

665
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:02,310
And that only I can help him
do what he wants to do.

666
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:05,370
Maybe he values my forensic skills

667
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:06,520
and wants my help.

668
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,890
My Lady, have you never considered that

669
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,960
maybe His Highness…

670
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,660
has feelings for you?

671
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,680
My identity is fake,

672
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,120
but it's true that I'm using him.

673
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,670
I need his power

674
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,500
to escape the Qin family.

675
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,980
I can't afford to let my guard down.

676
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,340
If I can't be honest with him,

677
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,830
how could I possibly return his feelings?

678
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,350
But…

679
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,900
but can't he be carrying a torch for you?

680
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,540
He…

681
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,150
he doesn't seem like that kind of man.

682
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,100
Fire! Hurry!

683
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,220
Get more water!

684
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,170
Quick!

685
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,890
We need more hands!

686
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,760
Get more water.

687
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,520
[Qin Mansion]

688
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,370
Miss Qin,

689
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:14,580
the morgue caught fire last night.

690
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,830
The east wing was burned down.

691
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:16,889
I'm afraid the body

692
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:18,710
can't be examined anymore.

693
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:23,050
Does His Highness know?

694
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,219
As soon as Master heard,
he rushed to the morgue overnight.

695
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:26,449
He asked me to wait here for you

696
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:28,050
so you wouldn't waste a trip.

697
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:31,530
Then why is the Yue family's carriage
still here?

698
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,170
Master thought

699
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:35,159
you might insist on going.

700
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,810
Get in. Let's go to the morgue.

701
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:39,889
Miss Qin,

702
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:42,370
the body's been burned beyond recognition.

703
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:43,929
Can it still be examined?

704
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:46,460
Whether it can be examined
is for me to decide.

705
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,470
My forensic box!

706
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,920
That's a forensic box!

707
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,920
There's no money inside. Don't run!

708
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,370
I knew you'd come.

709
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:25,340
The paper offerings and candles
in the morgue catch fire easily,

710
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,150
but there were plenty of ice basins here.

711
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,410
As the ice melted into water,

712
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:30,050
it should've dampened the fire.

713
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:32,410
There's no way this whole place
could've burned down.

714
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:33,410
Where's the body?

715
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:34,340
In the main hall.

716
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,550
But first, come take a look at this.

717
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,410
What's that smell?

718
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,100
Tung oil.

719
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,490
The morgue usually uses butter lamps.

720
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:06,260
Someone set this fire on purpose.

721
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,410
Huo Huaixin has sent men to check

722
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,090
who bought tung oil last night.

723
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,050
If I guess right…

724
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,980
It's someone from the Song family.

725
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:15,300
[Fortune Inn]

726
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:23,580
Young Master Qizhi.

727
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,390
[Wei Qizhi]

728
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,490
You got it?

729
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:32,160
Yes.

730
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:53,750
Can you still examine it?

731
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,740
The body's surface is completely charred,

732
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,250
with no skin texture visible.

733
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,740
But an autopsy focuses
on the internal organs.

734
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,340
I look for signs in the body.

735
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,370
So yes, it can still be examined.

736
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:04,700
But Xu He isn't here yet,

737
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,200
and the tools are with him.

738
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,230
Bai Feng!

739
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:14,330
This is...

740
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,260
I prepared this ahead of time.

741
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,010
It's inappropriate as a gift for a girl,

742
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:19,660
so I kept it at the morgue,

743
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,390
just in case you'd ever need it.

744
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:22,220
Bring it in.

745
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,680
Thank you, Your Highness.

746
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,030
If you want to thank me,
do a proper examination.

747
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,960
I'll write the postmortem report.

748
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,590
Write this down.

749
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,660
Due to extensive burns on the body,

750
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,720
the third examination is an autopsy.

751
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,330
The victim has been dead
for nearly nine days.

752
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:45,190
So only a small amount
of stomach contents remains.

753
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:00,980
What's wrong?

754
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:02,340
Write this down.

755
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,010
The pelvis is wide

756
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,940
and tilted backward.

757
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,220
The pubic bone is broader than average.

758
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,230
The uterus sits lower than normal.

759
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,830
What does that mean?

760
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,890
It suggests the deceased

761
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,220
had once been pregnant.

762
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,630
Could you be mistaken?

763
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,330
Based on the width

764
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,300
and backward tilt of the pelvis,

765
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:33,620
she was likely

766
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:35,290
about five to six months along.

767
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,490
Her uterus had returned
to normal size,

768
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:40,380
which means the miscarriage
happened about two months ago.

769
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,050
When she left for Jingzhou,

770
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,490
she must've just recovered.

771
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:44,660
Then how could the Song family

772
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,220
still have sent her off
to be married after that?

773
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,950
That's deceiving His Majesty!

774
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,060
If the Duke of Song dared do that,

775
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,980
he must've had a foolproof plan.

776
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,570
Your Highness.

777
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:00,180
This is a sketch from the oil shop owner

778
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:05,450
of the man who bought tung oil yesterday.

779
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:16,180
Isn't this Wei Cheng,
the Song Mansion's guard captain?

780
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,410
There's no way a lowly guard captain

781
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,410
would've dared destroy the corpse.

782
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:24,410
I'm afraid Wei Yanzhi ordered it.

783
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,610
He owes everything to the Duke of Song.

784
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,890
Of course he'd do everything
he could to help the Duke out.

785
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:30,890
Wei Yanzhi said

786
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:34,160
his older brother
and Miss Song grew up together.

787
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,620
If not for the broken leg,

788
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,100
he would've been the one
escorting the bride.

789
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,890
Could his brother be

790
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:41,300
the one Song Rou had an affair…

791
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:42,780
with?

792
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,210
That's a matter of the inner chambers.

793
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,280
The Duke must've
picked someone loyal and discreet

794
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,430
to guide Song Rou

795
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,520
and ensure everything went smoothly

796
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,580
on the wedding day.

797
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,600
The female servant in charge of her dowry

798
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,640
was likely placed there by the Duke.

799
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,110
Right. I'll have someone
question her right away.
