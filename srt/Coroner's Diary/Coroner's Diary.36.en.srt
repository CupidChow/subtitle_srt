00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,940
[Episode 36]

3
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,039
When you conspired with Jiang Heying

4
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:55,950
to fake an attack from foreign enemies
and murder my father,

5
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,210
did you ever think
you'd end up like this?

6
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,590
It wasn't me.

7
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,360
It was Jiang Heying.

8
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:09,940
He was the one

9
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,190
who planned everything.

10
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,940
He was the one

11
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,240
who harbored resentment
against you and your father.

12
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,570
He was the ruthless one.

13
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,810
I had nothing to do with it.

14
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,640
Still making excuses
when death is at your doorstep.

15
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,040
Do you really think you'll leave
the Imperial Clan Court alive?

16
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,690
Every one of your crimes

17
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,250
has irrefutable evidence,

18
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,660
all punishable by execution
according to law.

19
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,390
His Majesty only arranged this

20
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,070
to save the royal family some dignity.

21
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,980
You've always schemed in the shadows.

22
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:41,190
Before you die,

23
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,420
I'll give you a chance
to act like a decent man.

24
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:45,980
I was wrong.

25
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,020
I was wrong.

26
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,900
I kowtow

27
00:02:58,329 --> 00:02:59,370
to your father

28
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,900
and admit my guilt.

29
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,110
Every wound you inflicted on my father,

30
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,190
I'll make you, a viper,

31
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,820
feel it yourself.

32
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,409
You call me a viper,

33
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,060
but in this palace,

34
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,260
who isn't driven by wild ambition?

35
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,580
I only did what I had to do.

36
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,270
I did nothing wrong.

37
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,260
I did nothing wrong!

38
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,900
The victor writes history. That's all.

39
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,020
Father taught me that.

40
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,460
You dare say he was wrong?

41
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,620
Do you dare?

42
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,330
Yan Chi, if you want revenge,

43
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,580
you should take Wan

44
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,460
to your father's grave

45
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,860
and end your lives there.

46
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,140
Because it was you two

47
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,420
who truly caused your father's death.

48
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,740
What are you talking about?

49
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,060
Yan Chi,

50
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,060
you humiliated me

51
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,680
for a woman.

52
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,260
You humiliated me.

53
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,330
How could I tolerate that?

54
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,770
That's why I resolved

55
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,990
to kill your father

56
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,940
and get back at you.

57
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,460
Yan Chi, you got your own father killed

58
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,860
because of a woman.

59
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,770
You're the unfilial son

60
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:06,650
who betrayed your father and ancestors.

61
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,920
You betrayed them!

62
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,460
Kill me.

63
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,770
Kill me.

64
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,200
Kill me!

65
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,610
Your Highness must not act out of anger

66
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,580
and disregard the law.

67
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,020
Our ancestor established
the Yan family law:

68
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,900
no matter the crime,

69
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,590
no descendant of the Yan family

70
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,770
shall suffer corporal punishment.

71
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,380
Even in treason,

72
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,630
they're to be granted
a death sentence in prison,

73
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,260
not executed in public.

74
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,770
Whoever breaks

75
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,090
this law…

76
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,560
shall be punished by Heaven.

77
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,620
Today,

78
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,570
I die by your sword.

79
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,159
I wonder…

80
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,140
how you'll explain this to Father.

81
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,650
Outrageous!

82
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,170
As a secretary in the Ministry of Justice,

83
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,450
you brutally killed a prince.

84
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,450
If this gets out,

85
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,220
how am I…

86
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,490
how am I supposed to handle this?

87
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:32,330
I

88
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,220
can turn myself in
to the Court of Judicial Review.

89
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,620
I'll confess everything

90
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,930
and accept my punishment.

91
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,260
You'll confess?

92
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,790
That's easy enough for you,

93
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,820
but what position does that put me

94
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,540
and the royal family in?

95
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,050
The commoner Yan Qi

96
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,050
conspired with Jiang Heying

97
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,570
to assassinate his uncle,
the late Prince Rui.

98
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,030
He committed the most heinous crimes

99
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,380
and abandoned all human decency.

100
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,710
He deserved execution.

101
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,100
It was precisely because I considered

102
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,500
the royal family's dignity

103
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,630
that I didn't make this matter public.

104
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,810
You fool.

105
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,290
You've already known

106
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,900
who murdered your father,

107
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:12,980
and you've seen

108
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,480
how Yuan Qing handled things just now.

109
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,140
So you should understand

110
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,260
how I intend to deal with this.

111
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,020
Why entangle yourself with Yan Qi further

112
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,740
and give others something to talk about?

113
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,290
I

114
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,540
had to make Yan Qi confess

115
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,020
and punish him myself

116
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,980
so my father could rest in peace.

117
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,630
Otherwise,

118
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,670
I'd be unworthy as a son.

119
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:48,980
Forget it.

120
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,450
Yuan Qing,

121
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,840
those attendants you took with you,

122
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,740
did they see

123
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,220
how Yan Qi died?

124
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,570
Your Majesty,

125
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,650
my boys

126
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,860
are quite dim-witted

127
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,050
and didn't

128
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,180
see anything at all.

129
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,680
What about you?

130
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,600
You didn't see

131
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,290
anything either?

132
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,010
My eyesight is poor.

133
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,720
I only vaguely saw the commoner Yan Qi

134
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,260
acting like a madman,

135
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,880
grabbing Prince Rui's sword

136
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,770
and stabbing himself in the chest.

137
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:24,710
Yan Qi

138
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,900
had always been unruly and defiant.

139
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,730
In the end,

140
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,280
his madness took over,

141
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,930
leading him to take his own life.

142
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:33,820
But you

143
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,440
failed to stop him in time,

144
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,830
which was negligence on your part.

145
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,860
From today onward,

146
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,860
you're removed from your post
in the Ministry of Justice

147
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,100
and demoted to a commandant
in the Imperial Security Bureau,

148
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,100
assigned to guard

149
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,680
the inner palace gates.

150
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,320
Your Highness,
hurry and thank His Majesty.

151
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,810
What?

152
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,900
Do you take issue

153
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,770
with my decision?

154
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,070
I wouldn't dare.

155
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,300
Your Majesty,

156
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,930
thank you for your mercy.

157
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,810
Enough.

158
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,020
Spend the next few days

159
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,880
reflecting behind closed doors.

160
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,460
Don't stir up more trouble.

161
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,090
You may go now.

162
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:21,620
Yes.

163
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,170
Che,

164
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,700
did you hear that?

165
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,210
Yan Qi is dead.

166
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,380
That bastard is finally dead.

167
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,480
My dear Che,

168
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,930
just wait a little longer.

169
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,770
Mother will make sure

170
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,240
his entire household goes down with him.

171
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,580
[Prince Rui's Mansion]

172
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,450
Hurry!

173
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,420
Stand down.

174
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,370
Put away your swords.

175
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,550
Don't you trust the Young Marshal?

176
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,410
I was being reckless.

177
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,590
Please forgive me.

178
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,820
It's alright, Young Marshal.

179
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,380
I no longer serve in the Shuoxi Army,

180
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,500
so don't ever call me

181
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,700
Young Marshal again.

182
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,680
From now on,

183
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,860
just call me Commandant Yan.

184
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,960
We've admired you for a long time.

185
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,140
It's a pity that we never got a chance

186
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,170
to fight by your side

187
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,170
in battle.

188
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,850
No matter where you serve in the future,

189
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:05,900
in our hearts,

190
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,900
you'll always be the Young Marshal.

191
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,420
Xue Qingshan,

192
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,860
for what you just said,

193
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,260
I'll see you as a brother!

194
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:22,980
Bai Feng.

195
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,840
We're both colleagues and brothers-in-law.

196
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,900
Though we never
fought battles together before,

197
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,560
from now on,

198
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,900
we shall protect the capital together.

199
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,760
Young Marshal,

200
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,340
I'm at your service.

201
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,580
For the next few days,

202
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,770
you'll need to guard the city without me.

203
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,630
After I finish self-reflection,

204
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,810
I'll join you all

205
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,800
in defending the capital!

206
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,260
Yes!

207
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,810
Yan Qi is dead.

208
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,270
He threw himself onto my sword
and took his own life.

209
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,140
I didn't get to avenge my father
with my own hands.

210
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,610
Do you think he'd blame me?

211
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,050
He wouldn't.

212
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,220
Father certainly wouldn't want to see

213
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,070
the son he was most proud of

214
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,570
become a murderer.

215
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,430
Seeing you not consumed by hatred,

216
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,690
Father can rest in peace.

217
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,760
Are you hurt?

218
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:27,980
No.

219
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,100
It's all Qi's blood.

220
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,520
Did His Majesty blame you?

221
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,750
Not only did he not blame me,

222
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,180
but he didn't doubt for a second
that Yan Qi killed himself

223
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,180
and even covered it up for me.

224
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,940
He just said I was negligent

225
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:55,820
and demoted me to a commandant
in the Imperial Security Bureau.

226
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,050
I'm glad you're alright.

227
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,410
Father died so brutally,

228
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,000
and yet I couldn't let the world know
he was wronged.

229
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,430
I can't make peace with it.

230
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,010
I know.

231
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,900
But I must do this.

232
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,980
I must make the person on the throne

233
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,829
believe in me,

234
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:16,630
believe I acted impulsively,

235
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,250
and believe I never doubted him.

236
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,380
Only when he stops guarding against me

237
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,619
will we have a chance

238
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,130
to uncover the truth.

239
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:28,490
Up in heaven, Father will surely

240
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,150
understand your intentions.

241
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,040
If Father were still alive

242
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,740
and knew the suspect we're investigating

243
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,520
was the very emperor he swore loyalty to,

244
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,360
he'd probably be furious.

245
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,200
Your father,

246
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,380
my father,

247
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,520
and Prince Jin—

248
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,340
none of them were blindly loyal.

249
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,510
They weren't loyal to Yan Huai,

250
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,580
but to a wise ruler who could bring

251
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,410
lasting peace to Zhou's people.

252
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,550
As long as we tread carefully

253
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,300
and don't stir up political unrest,

254
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,820
they'll all support us.

255
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:00,490
Come.

256
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,210
I just

257
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,820
compared these writings.

258
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,540
The annotations on the go manual,

259
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,800
Sui's letters,

260
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,210
and the notes on the scroll
from the Xuanji Pavilion—

261
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,170
they were all written by the same person.

262
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,970
So Consort Jin wasn't mistaken.

263
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,100
These are indeed

264
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,160
His Majesty's writings
from before he took the throne.

265
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,860
"Che

266
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,260
spat on the zither to clean it.

267
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,510
What a naughty boy.

268
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,160
He's truly my son."

269
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,970
This is His Majesty's record

270
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,780
of Yan Che's childhood antics.

271
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,520
Back then,
we only focused on the handwriting.

272
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,050
But reading it closely now,

273
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,500
you can find
that His Majesty and Her Majesty

274
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,700
were so close before he took the throne.

275
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,520
Yan Che was also
deeply loved by His Majesty.

276
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:45,520
No.

277
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,140
For as long as I can remember,

278
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,710
His Majesty never once
spent the night at the Fengyi Palace.

279
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,820
He only treats the Empress with courtesy.

280
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,820
As for Yan Che,

281
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,650
he always called him an unworthy son.

282
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,580
When did he ever show him affection?

283
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,340
Calligraphy reflects the heart.

284
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,930
What's in the mind
shows through the brush.

285
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,790
If His Majesty's personality
changed drastically

286
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,620
after being injured in battle,
it could explain

287
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,990
the change in his handwriting.

288
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,140
But Sui said

289
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,210
Consort Jin refused
to accept that explanation,

290
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,730
suggesting the changes in handwriting

291
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,730
weren't due to personality changes.

292
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:14,650
If we could find

293
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,250
His Majesty's writing
from after the battle for comparison,

294
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:17,900
perhaps

295
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,250
we could discover the true reason
why His Majesty killed Consort Jin.

296
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,250
There's a memorial of mine

297
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,900
with a handwritten comment
from His Majesty.

298
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,620
You only returned to the capital
after Consort Jin died.

299
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,580
If that person wanted to cover this up,

300
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,010
he might not have written that comment

301
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,750
on the memorial himself.

302
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,820
Then we need to find his writing

303
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,210
from after the battle

304
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,480
but before Consort Jin's death.

305
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:37,930
Got it.

306
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,750
This is a private letter

307
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,110
from His Majesty to my father.

308
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,110
Father kept it safe all these years.

309
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,830
This handwriting

310
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,900
somehow looks familiar.

311
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,690
It's nothing like

312
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,140
His Majesty's handwriting

313
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,170
from before he took the throne,

314
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,100
but it's identical

315
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,100
to the carving on the wooden hairpin

316
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,350
Princess Yi gave me.

317
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,620
Are you saying

318
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:45,100
that the current emperor is
actually Prince Yi, Yan Han?

319
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,640
How is that possible?

320
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:47,900
I once

321
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,610
heard of the face-changing technique,

322
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,430
but I've never seen it myself.

323
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,090
I don't know if it's even real.

324
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,910
Even if it were,

325
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,100
there's no way Grandmother

326
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,770
couldn't recognize her own son.

327
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,580
And Noble Consort Su and the Empress—

328
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,340
they've been with His Majesty
since before he ascended the throne.

329
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,780
They couldn't possibly have been fooled.

330
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,250
The more you think about it,

331
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,450
the stranger it gets.

332
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,620
But this concerns the throne itself,

333
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,550
so we can't ask around recklessly.

334
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:12,350
This matter

335
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,490
concerns the stability of the court.

336
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,220
Before a new heir is appointed,

337
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,070
we can't let a single word leak.

338
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,820
We cannot let

339
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,320
our fathers'

340
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,750
and Prince Jin's sacrifices go to waste.

341
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,900
Let's keep

342
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,830
investigating Prince Jin's case.

343
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,830
With the clues we already have,

344
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,460
we can definitely vindicate my father

345
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,330
and Prince Jin.

346
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:55,860
You bitch!

347
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,300
Prince Cheng just died,

348
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,860
and you're already fleeing
with stolen money.

349
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,590
You truly are a venomous woman!

350
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,700
Just because he preferred you,

351
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,890
you humiliated me

352
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,430
and trampled all over me.

353
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,510
I'll make you join him in death today!

354
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,060
How dare you!

355
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,340
My uncle is the Marquis of Zhongyong.

356
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,010
My cousin is Princess Rui.

357
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,140
If you kill me,

358
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,900
they won't let you get away with it!

359
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,620
Is that so?

360
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,620
Then let's give it a try

361
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,340
and see if anyone will avenge you

362
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,450
after I kill you.

363
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,620
Go to hell!

364
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,490
Stop!

365
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,380
The traitor's accomplices and relatives

366
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,640
shall all be executed!

367
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,450
I'm the daughter of the Feng family.

368
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,730
Prince Cheng and I

369
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:39,550
have already divorced.

370
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,580
Wan.

371
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,900
Xiang is dead.

372
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,010
Qin Xiang is dead.

373
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,620
Chi asked me

374
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,620
to get Xiang out as soon as possible,

375
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,650
but before I could, His Majesty
summoned me for court business,

376
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:01,910
so I got there too late.

377
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:03,460
Why are you saying all this?

378
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,680
Little Wan'er,

379
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,310
he could never have made it.

380
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,900
All of Prince Cheng's wives and concubines

381
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,970
were executed on the spot

382
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:09,970
when the household was raided.

383
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:10,650
Don't cry.

384
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,450
The Empress hates Prince Cheng the most.

385
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,650
Some Imperial Guards

386
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:16,550
were definitely sent by Lord Zhao
to take revenge during the raid.

387
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,140
Prince Cheng deserved it,

388
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,780
but what did those concubines do wrong?

389
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,310
What did Qin Xiang do wrong?

390
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,050
I'll go to Chi.

391
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,250
He's still confined for reflection

392
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,540
and probably doesn't know yet.

393
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,070
Let's go.

394
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,380
After Uncle received the news,

395
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,650
he sent people to Prince Cheng's Mansion
to collect Xiang's body.

396
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,440
Wan,

397
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,060
do you think I stole

398
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,620
Xiang's good fortune?

399
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,720
If she had married Xue Qingshan back then,

400
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,450
she wouldn't…

401
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,970
Shuang, don't say that.

402
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:47,580
Come.

403
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,520
We all chose our own paths.

404
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,320
There's no right or wrong.

405
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,540
Wan,

406
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,170
I want to bring Mother to the capital.

407
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,970
Now that Xiang's gone,

408
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:01,450
she only has me to rely on.

409
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:04,540
It's a good idea.

410
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,540
I can also fulfill my filial duties.

411
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,580
Shuang, you're pregnant now.

412
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,250
Remember,

413
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,820
you mustn't cry so hard anymore.

414
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,060
Really?

415
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:14,970
Yes.

416
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,380
You mustn't let yourself get upset
in the coming days.

417
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,000
Noble Consort?

418
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:31,450
Noble Consort Su?

419
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,160
Noble Consort.

420
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,730
This is the tonic specially sent
by His Majesty.

421
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,620
It's good for your health.

422
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,680
Noble Consort?

423
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,340
Noble Consort Su.

424
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,550
What do you want?

425
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:54,860
Get out!

426
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,780
Get out of here!

427
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,580
Don't ever come back!

428
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,170
He's trying to kill me.

429
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,700
He killed the Crown Prince.

430
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,710
He killed Qi.

431
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,900
My Qi.

432
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:18,170
My Qi!

433
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,450
So this is where you and your father
used to hide things.

434
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,050
It really is well concealed.

435
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,900
If I hadn't looked carefully,

436
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,760
I wouldn't have noticed it at all.

437
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,210
What is that?

438
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,350
It's my father's handwriting.

439
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,860
"Jin" means Consort Jin.

440
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,380
Only His Majesty can use
the five-clawed golden dragon pattern.

441
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,970
This dagger is enough to prove

442
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:30,030
that His Majesty killed Consort Jin.

443
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:33,250
My father really risked his life
to hide the key evidence.

444
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,040
I have to go to Li Muyun.

445
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:35,930
Once my confinement is lifted…

446
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,190
I can't wait that long.

447
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,560
I want to hear what he has to say

448
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,150
about my father hiding the murder weapon.

449
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,510
Your Highness,

450
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,350
why did you ask to meet me here?

451
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,210
The innocent don't act in the shadows.

452
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:18,140
I want to reopen Prince Jin's case.

453
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,250
Your Highness, you should know

454
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,650
that according to Zhou's law,

455
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:25,490
without new evidence sufficient
to overturn the previous verdict,

456
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:26,530
a closed case

457
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,030
cannot be reopened.

458
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:29,170
I know,

459
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,690
but I'm more interested in your reason

460
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,350
for accusing Prince Jin and Lord Shen

461
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,350
of conspiring to cover up the crime.

462
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,340
Shen Yi hid the real murder weapon

463
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,640
to make Prince Jin

464
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,890
look innocent.

465
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,790
Since you never found the weapon,

466
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,950
what made you so sure

467
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,520
Prince Jin was the killer?

468
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,860
Prince Jin was caught at the scene.

469
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,080
If not him,

470
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,580
then who?
Prince Sui, who was just a little boy?

471
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,490
So you used a dagger

472
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,140
with a blunt edge as the murder weapon

473
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,300
to close the case?

474
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,260
So that day,

475
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,650
you did read Prince Jin's case file.

476
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,640
That dagger

477
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,320
was a gift from Prince Jin to Prince Sui.

478
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:10,100
Prince Jin never confessed,

479
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,930
and you never found any evidence.

480
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,340
But to earn a promotion,

481
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:15,590
you falsely accused Lord Shen
of hiding the murder weapon

482
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,540
and used a dagger that couldn't even kill

483
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,740
to convict Prince Jin.

484
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,540
I never falsely accused Shen Yi.

485
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,110
He really did help the real murderer

486
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,620
hide the weapon.

487
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,550
He was the one

488
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,380
who had no respect for the law.

489
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,450
He was a sycophant.

490
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,010
So,

491
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,010
you know who really killed Consort Jin.

492
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,110
Why would you say that, Your Highness?

493
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,450
You'd only call Lord Shen a sycophant

494
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,120
if you knew

495
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,050
who he was protecting.

496
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,660
I heard Lord Shen always
thought highly of you,

497
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,510
so I assume

498
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,530
he must have told you

499
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,350
about the murder weapon he hid.

500
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,620
You're so sharp, Your Highness.

501
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:04,490
Since you know the truth,

502
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,990
you should also know

503
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:08,310
that I made no false accusations.

504
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,100
Do you really not know

505
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,250
why Lord Shen hid the murder weapon?

506
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,010
You stepped over the bones
of Prince Jin and Lord Shen

507
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,970
to reach your third-rank position,

508
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:17,580
and now you just turn around

509
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,140
and call Lord Shen a sycophant.

510
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,570
Do you truly feel no shame?

511
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,030
I have a clear conscience!

512
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,780
Shen Yi claimed he did it
for the stability of the court,

513
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,300
but that was just an excuse

514
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,360
for his cowardice!

515
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,580
If I had known
where the real murder weapon was hidden,

516
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,410
I would've made it public long ago.

517
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:32,820
The law makes no exception

518
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,880
for royals. That's the Heavenly Way!

519
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,170
Shen Yi and Prince Jin

520
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,410
deserved to be my stepping stones!

521
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,700
If Heaven truly sees all,

522
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,140
someone like you
who betrayed your own mentor

523
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,600
will not come to a good end.

524
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,530
The Heavenly Way favors no one—

525
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,840
only those who are truly sincere.

526
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,690
I just hit Li Muyun.

527
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,140
Did he hurt you?

528
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,130
No.

529
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,170
So he knew all along

530
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,270
that the real killer of Consort Jin
was His Majesty.

531
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,620
My father told him

532
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,900
when he hid that dagger.

533
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,630
He didn't show an ounce of guilt

534
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:27,850
and actually believes
he was following the Heavenly Way.

535
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,170
The way he looked when he said that

536
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,300
reminded me exactly of Ning Buyi.

537
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,170
You suspect

538
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,080
Li Muyun is a member
of the Heavenly Way Society?

539
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,170
I wouldn't say they're totally unrelated.

540
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:41,100
But he's already a third-rank official.

541
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,490
His obsession with the Heavenly Way

542
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:43,930
doesn't make any sense.

543
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,950
If Li Muyun really is a member
of the Heavenly Way Society,

544
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,420
its influence and ambition

545
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,750
are truly frightening.

546
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,580
Leave this to me.

547
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,430
You must not see him again.

548
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:57,980
I really wish I could strip him
of his official position myself.

549
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:04,790
Don't worry.

550
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,930
Whether he is or not,

551
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,060
I won’t let him off easy.

552
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,620
-Prefect Zheng, forgive me.
-General Bai.

553
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,780
Master, Your Highness,

554
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,840
I'll take my leave.

555
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,150
Prince Rui?

556
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:43,450
Princess Yongci?

557
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:45,210
Prefect Zheng, I've heard

558
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,780
you're a renowned gourmet.

559
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,140
So I've invited you to my place

560
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,280
to taste some Shuoxi cuisine.

561
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,680
I hope you'll like it.

562
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,520
Your Highness,
you didn't go to such trouble

563
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:56,760
to get me here

564
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:59,250
just to treat me to breakfast, did you?

565
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,860
Please don't take offense, Prefect Zheng.

566
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,650
His Lordship is currently
confined for reflection.

567
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:03,780
He got you here that way

568
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,100
simply to avoid any whispers

569
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,730
about you having private dealings
with Prince Rui.

570
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,590
Prefect Zheng.

571
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:10,410
Take a seat.

572
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,050
Go on then.

573
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,270
What can I do for you?

574
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,890
I heard that back in the day,

575
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:21,490
you and Li Muyun took the imperial exam
in the same year.

576
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:22,890
You ranked second-tier,

577
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,260
while Li Muyun only ranked third-tier.

578
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,500
In terms of learning,

579
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:29,210
Li Muyun and I were evenly matched.

580
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,490
He was proud and aloof.

581
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,210
At the palace exam, he spoke too boldly.

582
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,690
His Majesty found him too defiant

583
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:34,690
to serve in court

584
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,380
and downgraded his paper
to the lowest rank.

585
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,780
He came from a poor family

586
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,580
and only managed to become the governor
of a remote county.

587
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,690
He spent a few hard years

588
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:44,220
in that godforsaken place.

589
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,280
Thank you, Your Highness.

590
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,710
Despite his rank in the imperial exam,

591
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,760
Li Muyun got promoted so quickly.

592
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,720
He must

593
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,820
understand the ways of officialdom
better than you do.

594
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,220
Speaking of promotions,

595
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,380
Li Muyun got promoted on his own merit.

596
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,930
He was quite accomplished
in criminal investigations,

597
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:05,410
helping his superiors
solve several major cases.

598
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,100
With Lord Shen's support,

599
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,960
he finally got his chance to rise.

600
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:11,380
Why are you asking about Li Muyun?

601
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,570
I'd like to ask you
to visit the Ministry of Justice

602
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:15,699
and check the places

603
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:17,219
where Li Muyun once served—

604
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:20,219
see if there were any murder cases
similar to the Heavenly Way Society's.

605
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:21,370
You suspect

606
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:24,780
Li Muyun is secretly working
with the Heavenly Way Society?

607
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:25,820
Perhaps

608
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:29,420
Li Muyun is actually a member
of the Heavenly Way Society.

609
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,630
After seeing the files,

610
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:34,449
I'll explain everything to you.

611
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:36,850
But I can't tell you about it now.

612
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,739
If I hadn't been demoted
to the Imperial Security Bureau

613
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:40,530
and lost access to the archives,

614
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:42,389
I wouldn't trouble you with this.

615
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:44,860
It's not ideal,
but I have no other choice.

616
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,179
I hope you'll lend me a hand.

617
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:57,100
I'll do it.

618
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,420
Your Majesty,

619
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,710
the scarcity of heirs is not a good omen.

620
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,490
Please take more consorts
to continue the royal lineage.

621
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,380
Only when a proper
crown prince is selected

622
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,900
can the nation stay stable

623
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,620
and the dynasty endure.

624
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:11,490
Your Majesty,

625
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:13,430
you're still in your prime.

626
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,830
There's no urgent need to name an heir.

627
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,610
Why not observe a bit longer

628
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,840
before selecting the crown prince?

629
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,700
Your Majesty,

630
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,160
since Prince Rui's passing,

631
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,490
the princes have died one after another.

632
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:30,520
Please consult the Imperial
Astronomical Bureau for guidance

633
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,410
and issue a Self-reproach Edict

634
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:33,900
to calm the spirits above.

635
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,050
How dare you!

636
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,740
My sons...

637
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,530
My sons

638
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,700
died before their time, one after another.

639
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,610
And you,

640
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,410
instead of easing my grief,

641
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,890
want me

642
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,510
to issue a Self-reproach Edict?

643
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,740
What are you after?

644
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:55,570
What

645
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,380
have I done wrong?

646
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,740
Tell me,

647
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,090
what have I done wrong?

648
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,970
Even if

649
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,180
every last one of my sons dies,

650
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,130
I still have brothers

651
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,780
and nephews.

652
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:16,140
Yan Li, Yan Chi, and Yan Ze

653
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:20,230
are all upright, loyal men.

654
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:25,700
Today,

655
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,700
I'll make it known

656
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,320
to all civil and military officials:

657
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,740
Even if one day

658
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,390
I pass from this world,

659
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:37,180
there will still be a worthy ruler
to take my place.

660
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:40,650
I don't need
a bunch of useless fools like you

661
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,110
to tell me
to issue a Self-reproach Edict.

662
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,340
Come here.

663
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:56,990
What are you doing here?

664
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,310
The palace isn't peaceful right now.

665
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:00,220
If you've got nothing important,
stay away.

666
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,300
Word about what happened in the palace
has already spread.

667
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,230
His Majesty said

668
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,660
all royal kinsmen

669
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,220
are eligible to be named heir.

670
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,050
Is that true?

671
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:08,900
Yes.

672
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:11,070
It's like a bolt from the blue.

673
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,500
It's a chance to be named heir

674
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,740
and even ascend the throne someday.

675
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,260
It's incredible news,

676
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:19,310
and you're not thrilled about it?

677
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,800
What's incredible
about sitting on the throne?

678
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,180
His Majesty stays up late and rises early,

679
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,180
goes to court
to listen to bickering ministers,

680
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,660
and then reviews memorials after that.

681
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,320
He can't even eat
without attendants watching,

682
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,250
and forget about drinking wine.

683
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:36,660
Living like that

684
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,060
sounds worse than death.

685
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:41,530
His Majesty is diligent and disciplined
because he's a good ruler.

686
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:42,990
You could just be a bad one.

687
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,050
I doubt I'd live to be a bad ruler.

688
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,740
Prince Cheng
and the Crown Prince are both dead.

689
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,530
With my abilities,

690
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,380
how long do you think I'd last in court?

691
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:52,910
Besides,

692
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,860
I'm only His Majesty's godson.

693
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:57,880
I don't have a single drop of royal blood.

694
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,860
As long as there are still royals alive,

695
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,390
I'm not even in the running.

696
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,630
That's true.

697
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,760
Looks like you'll just have to be

698
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,290
a prince who holds my horse.

699
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:12,940
I'd rather be your stable boy

700
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,640
than be a prince.

701
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,200
Whoever wants that title can take it.

702
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:20,210
What should I do then?

703
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:22,380
Ze's eyes are almost healed,

704
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:24,090
and I'm planning to return to Jingzhou.

705
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,610
Maybe I'll just sneak you
into the carriage

706
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:28,070
and take you with me
when I leave the capital.

707
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,830
His eyes are almost healed?

708
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,260
Of course.

709
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,740
Why else would I be waiting for you?

710
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,700
I just want to ask

711
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,030
if our previous agreement is still valid.

712
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:36,950
Of course it is.

713
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:45,300
Ning, I always keep my word.

714
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,490
Wait for me.

715
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:50,070
[Fengyi Palace]

716
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,510
Letting nephews inherit the throne?

717
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,450
That's absolutely ridiculous.

718
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,610
Your Majesty,

719
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:58,300
please lower your voice.

720
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,780
Someone might hear you.

721
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,180
So what if they heard?

722
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,760
I'm just a deposed empress.

723
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:06,570
What do I have to be afraid of?

724
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,780
Give this

725
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:11,260
to Princess Yongci.

726
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,350
Yes.

727
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,820
That's his throne.

728
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:24,230
I'll die before I let you have your way.

729
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,490
Sorry for making you wait,
Your Highness.

730
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:31,010
The Empress Dowager is still asleep.

731
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,940
I didn't have the heart to wake her.

732
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,900
How is Grandmother's health?

733
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,900
She's doing well.

734
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,970
You needn't worry, Your Highness.

735
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:38,970
What about Sui?

736
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,880
Maybe I can take him out for a bit?

737
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:44,180
The Empress Dowager has been
keeping him busy with lessons lately.

738
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:44,980
I'm afraid...

739
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,130
Then I won't bother him.

740
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:50,530
I'll come back in a few days
to pay my respects to Grandmother.

741
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:52,990
Your Highness.

742
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,320
Unless the Empress Dowager summons you,

743
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,190
it's best

744
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,390
not to visit the palace for now.

745
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,120
Understood. Thank you, Ma'am Chen.

746
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:17,490
Give me the medicine box.

747
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:17,970
Yes.

748
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:19,730
Thank you.

749
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,920
Your Highness.

750
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,550
You dropped something.

751
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,490
The Empress.

752
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,260
Shuhua.

753
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,260
It really is the Empress.

754
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,260
Bai Feng, go get some lye water.

755
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:24,900
Yes.

756
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,190
I never thought

757
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:29,140
the Empress would know how to carve
a Nine-Fold Script stamp.

758
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,610
Judging by the depth of the carving,

759
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:32,660
it looks like it was done with a hairpin.

760
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,250
With this kind of cleverness,

761
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,830
it's no wonder
she and His Majesty were so close

762
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,310
before he took the throne.

763
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:38,500
The Empress now

764
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,870
isn't the same woman who used to get mad

765
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,450
when her son wiped spit on a zither.

766
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:45,220
Her allies in the palace
haven't shown themselves yet.

767
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,620
Her sending you a message

768
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,930
may not be a good thing.

769
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,240
Master, the lye water's here.

770
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,360
South of the city.

771
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:58,800
Anmin.

772
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,100
Zhang.

773
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:00,740
Qian.

774
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,870
What does this mean?

775
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:06,970
Bai Feng, go check

776
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,140
if there's a street or alley named Zhang

777
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,400
in the Anmin District, south of the city.

778
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:14,190
Master,

779
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,960
there is a Zhang Alley.

780
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,660
Zhang Alley…

781
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:19,530
Then "Qian"

782
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,260
might refer to someone
with the surname Qian.

783
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:22,780
Master,

784
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,140
I'll go check it out.

785
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:28,980
Could this be a trap for you?

786
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:30,950
Not entirely impossible.

787
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,010
But given the Empress's current situation,

788
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,480
she needs us

789
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:35,650
to avenge Che.

790
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,600
There's only one Qian family

791
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,060
in the entire Zhang Alley.

792
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:05,490
Is this Madam Qian's home?

793
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:17,740
I'm Qian.

794
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:20,410
Are you the ones the Empress sent?

795
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:23,970
We are.

796
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:25,340
Madam Qian,

797
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,680
are you a former palace servant?

798
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:30,850
I was once the head matron
serving the Empress Dowager.

799
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:38,810
If you once served the Empress Dowager,

800
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:42,460
why did you leave the palace
to seek refuge with the Empress?

801
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,180
I've never betrayed the Empress Dowager,

802
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:46,660
but to survive,

803
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:50,660
I have no choice but to live
under the Empress's protection.

804
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,590
What do you mean?

805
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:56,720
If the Empress has sent you to me,

806
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:59,080
she must be prepared to risk everything.

807
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:01,470
I'm not a coward who fears death.

808
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:03,380
But if I were to die now,

809
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,410
the secret I carry would die with me.

810
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:08,420
And if this secret never comes to light,

811
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:11,130
it'll eventually
throw the court into chaos.

812
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:12,130
If that happened,

813
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:15,240
how could I ever face the Empress Dowager?

814
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:17,860
Come.

815
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:20,260
Get up and tell us.

816
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:27,050
What kind of secret
could threaten the court

817
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:28,820
and involve the Empress Dowager?

818
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:29,610
Because

819
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,810
when the Empress Dowager first gave birth,

820
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:37,850
she bore twins.
