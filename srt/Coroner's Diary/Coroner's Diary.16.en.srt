00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:33,920
[Episode 16]

3
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,120
I should have known better.

4
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,979
I had it coming.

5
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,560
Master,

6
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,460
sorry.

7
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:42,890
I forgot you and Miss Qin
just made things official.

8
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,490
You're all lovey-dovey now.

9
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:45,720
I swear,

10
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,460
from now on, as long as she's around,

11
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,539
I'll keep my distance.

12
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:49,259
No.

13
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,310
I won't barge in again.

14
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,810
Alright, alright.

15
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,220
You sure talk a lot.

16
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,220
So,

17
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,920
what's the urgent news?

18
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,550
The Marquis of Zhongyong
got an invitation from Prince Yu.

19
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,180
He's sending Qin Yan
and the others to Yuzhou

20
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,290
for Prince Yu's birthday.

21
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,290
I'm afraid

22
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,320
we can't stay with Miss Qin anymore.

23
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,870
He's actually trying
to win over Prince Yu,

24
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,800
who only cares about
drinking, gambling, and women.

25
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,410
The Marquis of Zhongyong is
getting more and more desperate for power.

26
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,810
Prince Yu is the Emperor's only uncle.

27
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,940
He's got seniority, after all.

28
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,180
If it's really just a birthday banquet,

29
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,810
why bring women along?

30
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,600
There are three unmarried girls
in that convoy.

31
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,829
You mean

32
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,630
the Marquis wants to offer his nieces

33
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,160
as concubines to Prince Yu?

34
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,480
That's just shameless!

35
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,400
Whether that's the case or not,

36
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,800
we should stay vigilant.

37
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,620
Who else in the capital
is going to the banquet?

38
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,690
I was just getting to that.

39
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:44,960
To show how much he cares,

40
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,360
His Majesty put the charming

41
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,680
and dashing Heir of Prince Yi

42
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,280
in charge of the whole event.

43
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:51,460
Yan Li?

44
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,650
That's perfect.

45
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,810
Wan, you've suffered greatly.

46
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,080
Fortunately, I brought some old ginseng.

47
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,070
It's perfect for restoring strength.

48
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:07,950
Wan,

49
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,640
you definitely know about its benefits
better than I do.

50
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,200
Here,

51
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,710
drink it while it's hot.

52
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,830
Thank you for your concern, Cousin Yan.

53
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,210
Don't mention it.

54
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,570
His Highness risked his life

55
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:20,940
to save you.

56
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,240
Compared to that,

57
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,710
what I did was nothing.

58
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,600
His Highness is as righteous as they come.

59
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,510
And you treat me like your own sister.

60
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,040
I'll never forget any of it.

61
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,450
You really are insightful, Wan.

62
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,780
No wonder His Highness trusts you so much.

63
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,360
He even entrusted you

64
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,070
with his Heir's Token.

65
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,590
You flatter me, Cousin Yan.

66
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,800
His Highness only gave me the token

67
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,470
because the Grand Princess
asked him to look after me.

68
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,310
He was on official duty
and couldn't come with us,

69
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,170
so he gave it to me for protection.

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,880
Protection?

71
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,400
So you don't know

72
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,770
how powerful that token is?

73
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,570
No, I don't.

74
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,570
That token

75
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,890
carries the authority
of the Heir of Prince Rui.

76
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,020
You can use it to command local troops.

77
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,860
If it fell into the wrong hands,

78
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,190
they could raise an army

79
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,640
and start a rebellion with ease.

80
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,000
It's that powerful?

81
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,020
I have to return it
to His Highness as soon as possible.

82
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,300
No need to rush, Wan.

83
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,990
If Lord Yan trusts you so much,

84
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,630
then I'd say
your future holds great things.

85
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,880
If you have ambitions,

86
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,040
the Qin family

87
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,510
will do everything we can

88
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,320
to help you achieve them.

89
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,320
What do you mean, Cousin Yan?

90
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,920
I don't understand.

91
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,750
Don't play shy with me.

92
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,960
His Highness
personally fed you ginger tea just now.

93
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,450
I saw it with my own eyes.

94
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,000
You've got it wrong, Cousin Yan.

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
After what happened to me,
His Highness was worried

96
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,840
Ning would go complain
to the Grand Princess,

97
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,780
so he fed me the tea as an apology.

98
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,390
Really?

99
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,260
Yes.

100
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,160
Since the Marquis of Anyang and his wife
took me as their foster daughter,

101
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,600
His Highness has treated me like family.

102
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,080
But I'd never dare forget my place.

103
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,550
Wan, you're right.

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,530
I was just overthinking it.

105
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,750
Just now,

106
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,310
I received a letter from Father.

107
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,920
He's ordering us to go to Yuzhou.

108
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,880
If you're well enough to travel,

109
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,440
we'll set off tomorrow.

110
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,690
Why are we going to Yuzhou?

111
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,390
It's Prince Yu's 60th birthday,

112
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,650
and he's just had a son.

113
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,450
He specifically sent an invitation to us.

114
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,720
Father is serving as Minister of Personnel
and can't leave the capital.

115
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,600
As it happens,

116
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,310
Yuzhou isn't far from here.

117
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,550
We'll just stop by
and offer our congratulations.

118
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,010
I see.

119
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,030
Understood.

120
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,340
We've talked for quite a while.
You must be tired.

121
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,270
Go get some rest.

122
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,920
I'll go make arrangements
for our departure.

123
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,520
Alright.

124
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,390
Why bring the girls along?

125
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,790
Is it really just a stopover?

126
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,200
Master,

127
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,880
are we really going to Yuzhou?

128
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,270
Should we send a letter

129
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,850
to inform His Majesty first?

130
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,570
No need.

131
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,910
Isn't there a record
about the southeastern salt transport

132
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,910
in the Qingyuan Pawnshop's ledger?

133
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,280
I've long wanted to look into

134
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,300
whether their backer is connected

135
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,540
to the southeastern salt transport.

136
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,580
I'm just doing it
a bit earlier than planned.

137
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,190
I've already mentioned the reason

138
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,730
in the letter I just wrote to Yan Li.

139
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,130
He'll definitely report it to His Majesty.

140
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,830
If I, as a surveillance commissioner,
can expose the corruption

141
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,410
behind the southeastern salt transport
in Yuzhou,

142
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,540
His Majesty will only be more pleased.

143
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,780
That's a brilliant plan, Master.

144
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,460
Is everything for the Yuzhou trip ready?

145
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,010
Young Master Yan,

146
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,500
everything is ready.

147
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,250
Now

148
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,350
you'll get to reunite with Miss Qin,

149
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,270
catch up with Lord Li,

150
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,690
and on top of that,

151
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,750
catch a few corrupt officials.

152
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,110
Three birds with one stone.

153
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,970
I'm impressed.

154
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,530
Young Master Yan.

155
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,050
Your Highness.

156
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,310
Young Master Yan,

157
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,200
I just received word.

158
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,190
I'll be heading to Yuzhou tomorrow.

159
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:04,920
As for Ning,

160
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,810
I'll have to entrust her

161
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,190
to your care.

162
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,330
What a coincidence.

163
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,800
We're changing course to Yuzhou as well

164
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,900
to celebrate Prince Yu's birthday.

165
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,030
So we'll be traveling together again.

166
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,980
I was just about to arrange the carriages.

167
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,620
If Your Highness needs anything,

168
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,770
just say the word.

169
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,220
Will you be sending a convoy tomorrow?

170
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,210
Your Highness,

171
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,580
all the carriages have been fully repaired

172
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,110
and are ready to go anytime.

173
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,090
Good.

174
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,140
Then we leave tomorrow

175
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,240
at 8 AM.

176
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,050
Your Highness, wait.

177
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,250
What is it?

178
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,860
Steward Zhou, go make the arrangements.

179
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,120
What's it?

180
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:51,650
Your Highness,

181
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,600
Wan said you gave her your Heir's Token

182
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,650
to protect her along the way.

183
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,130
While I'm grateful,

184
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,560
I can't help but worry for Your Highness.

185
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,510
With that token, someone could
mobilize troops all over the country.

186
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,000
If something that valuable

187
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,460
fell into the wrong hands,

188
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,910
have you considered the consequences?

189
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,090
If a token alone
could cause that much chaos,

190
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,250
then what am I here for?

191
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,960
That was shortsighted of me.

192
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,070
I've long admired Your Highness.

193
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,950
I have a lot to learn from you.

194
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,350
I hope you'll be generous

195
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,480
with your guidance.

196
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,380
Though I serve in the capital,

197
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,610
I still hold my post in the Shuoxi Army.

198
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,730
If I get too close
to the noble families in the capital,

199
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,690
His Majesty may not take it well.

200
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,070
That wouldn't be good

201
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,490
for the Qin family either.

202
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,280
Indeed.

203
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,630
I was reckless.

204
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,440
I advise you

205
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,450
to keep your mouth shut.

206
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,970
If word gets out about the elopement,

207
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,030
you'll be as good as dead.

208
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,240
I didn't know he was an impostor.

209
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,920
-If I had known…
-That's because you're stupid.

210
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,300
If you stay in line from now on,

211
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,430
the Qin family will keep you fed.

212
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,040
But if you dare mess around again,

213
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,250
you'll be done for.

214
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,720
Got it?

215
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,910
Got it.

216
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,470
Good.

217
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,890
No wonder they want us to come along.

218
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,630
The Marquis of Zhongyong

219
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,650
is actually plotting
something so despicable.

220
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,400
The Marquis earned his title
through military merit,

221
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,660
but Qin Yan is just riding his coattails.

222
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,360
To earn merit
by backing the future emperor

223
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,270
and pass down
the title to future generations,

224
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,270
the father and son

225
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,890
would even risk their lives.

226
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,690
Prince Yu is such a dirty old man,

227
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,110
still so lecherous at his advanced age.

228
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,160
How else do you think

229
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,080
he got a newborn at sixty?

230
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,450
Who knows if that child's really his?

231
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,630
Anyway,

232
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,110
whatever tricks they try,

233
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,130
we're not letting them succeed.

234
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,080
Take it back.

235
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,160
If I'd known how powerful this token was,

236
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,620
I never would've shown it.

237
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,840
Whatever Qin Yan's plan is,

238
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,800
he's right that
I can't get you into trouble.

239
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,650
If I dared to give it to you,

240
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,110
I'm not afraid of trouble.

241
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,460
Besides, from now on, I'll protect you.

242
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,390
I'm way more powerful than a token.

243
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,750
My Lady, we've got
a long road ahead tomorrow.

244
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,870
Don't stay up late.

245
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,750
Bai Feng and Fuling

246
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,480
really are made for each other.

247
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,360
I've made it up to you.

248
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,200
Go back now.

249
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,190
I'm off.

250
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,670
Senior,

251
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,410
are you really staying
at the Herbal Garden?

252
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,460
The people of the Sanyuan Village
have suffered so much.

253
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,460
Things won't be easy for you either.

254
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,590
Senior lost his sanity due to obsession

255
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,510
and committed unforgivable sins.

256
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,400
But medicine itself

257
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,570
isn't good or evil.

258
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,550
Since he passed everything he knew

259
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,370
on to me,

260
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,720
I'll make up

261
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,970
for the mistakes he made.

262
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,410
Take care, Senior.

263
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,370
Your Highness,

264
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,770
I'm entrusting

265
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,590
my junior sister to you.

266
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,420
I'll respect

267
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,130
and protect her.

268
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,700
[Herbal Garden]

269
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,170
[Yuzhou]

270
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,060
Those on the city wall, listen!

271
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,960
Open the gates!

272
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,080
Is anyone there?

273
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,270
Open the gates now!

274
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,910
Is anybody there?

275
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,910
Young Master Yan.

276
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:42,890
Young Master Yan,

277
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,070
I've been shouting forever,

278
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,000
but no one's answering at the gate.

279
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,810
My Lady,

280
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:51,530
why are the gates shut tight
in broad daylight?

281
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,120
Has something happened again?

282
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,800
The Heir of Prince Rui is here!

283
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,710
All guards,

284
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,280
open the gates now!

285
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,910
[Yan Li, the Heir of Prince Yi]

286
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,600
It's Lord Li.

287
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:52,810
Why is he here too?

288
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,320
Who is he?

289
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,020
His Majesty's godson.

290
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,650
Chi's tag-along.

291
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,220
A notorious rake in the capital.

292
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,150
The dream guy of every girl.

293
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,820
Prince Yi's heir, Yan Li.

294
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:04,850
Chi.

295
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,880
No wonder Chi is
smiling so brightly at him.

296
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,860
Lord Yan Li

297
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,720
is so good-looking.

298
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,740
Is he aiming for third place
in the imperial exams?

299
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,910
Wan, you be the judge—

300
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,360
isn't Lord Li

301
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,220
way better looking than Huo Ning?

302
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,310
There's no man in this world

303
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,730
better looking than him.

304
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,840
What does a real man need good looks for?

305
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,870
Besides, to Little Wan'er,

306
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,960
Chi is the most handsome of all.

307
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,460
I do think he's the most handsome.

308
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,650
I didn't expect you to admit it.

309
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:44,730
Great.

310
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,870
That kind of honesty

311
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,280
is what makes a true heroine.

312
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,560
I'm really impressed.

313
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,120
Lord Yan's stare is scary.

314
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,310
Chi, you're finally here.

315
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,870
I missed you terribly.

316
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,150
So you're the one who shut the city gates

317
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,010
and wouldn't let anyone in or out?

318
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,140
How else was I supposed
to clear a space for you?

319
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,340
I knew you were coming,

320
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,660
so I cleared enough space

321
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,060
to welcome you properly.

322
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,630
Ridiculous.

323
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,530
If I'm not ridiculous,

324
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,870
then I'm not me.

325
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,770
Greetings, Your Highness.

326
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:41,870
Young Master Qin,

327
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,320
it's only been a few days,

328
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,250
and you've become so frail

329
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,660
that you travel by carriage like women do.

330
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,730
How could I ever compare to Your Highness?

331
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,790
Greetings to both Your Highnesses.

332
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,210
Young Master Yan,

333
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,820
the steward from the Pang family
has been waiting at the gate for a while.

334
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,750
The Pang family?

335
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,300
No wonder
the Qin family is never short on money.

336
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,940
So you've got ties with Pang Fuliang,

337
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,840
the richest merchant in the northwest.

338
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,200
You're overstating it, Your Highness.

339
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,260
Mr. Pang and my father

340
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,450
go way back.

341
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,000
Back then,

342
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,000
Mr. Pang hadn't built his fortune yet.

343
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,240
I...

344
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,510
It's getting late.

345
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,240
There are ladies in the carriage.

346
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,160
If you're staying at the Pang Mansion,

347
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,360
you'd best get going.

348
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,620
Then excuse me. I'll take my leave.

349
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,070
Goodbye.

350
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,840
After all these years,

351
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,880
you still haven't changed a bit.

352
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,150
He's always been so pretentious.

353
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,480
It's annoying to just look at him.

354
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,680
Then what's the point of all your barbs?

355
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,040
There's a point.

356
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,990
I love watching
those self-righteous people

357
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,450
get all riled up
and still lose the argument.

358
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,080
Where are you going?

359
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,080
You just arrived.

360
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,960
I...

361
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,480
I'm going to let Ning know.

362
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,140
She's here too?

363
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,500
If she finds out I'm with you,

364
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,180
she'll definitely tag along.

365
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,640
It was not easy for me to get you

366
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,640
out of Prince Yu's welcome banquet.

367
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,810
Tonight,

368
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,240
I'm taking you out for some real fun.

369
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,089
Let's go.

370
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,670
This is the Pang family's Shifang Inn?

371
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,080
It's so luxurious.

372
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,060
I heard in every major city
across the northwest,

373
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,680
you'll find a Shifang Inn
owned by the Pang family.

374
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,570
How do they have so much money?

375
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,450
[Shifang Inn]

376
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,530
If I could marry into such a family,

377
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,060
I'd be fine being a merchant's wife.

378
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,210
Miss Qin,
are you looking for His Highness?

379
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,510
I'm just taking in the view.

380
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,440
Lord Li has urgent business with Master.

381
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,330
Master said

382
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,350
if you need anything,

383
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,290
you can tell me.

384
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:17,880
I'm fine.

385
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:26,610
[Qinghui Manor]

386
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,510
Eldest Young Master.

387
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:31,090
[Pang Yiwen,
the eldest son of the Pang family]

388
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,510
Young Master Qin is here.

389
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,410
Young Master Pang.

390
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,110
Let's stop here.

391
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,720
Steward Zhou, come here.

392
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,480
I'll help you unload the luggage.

393
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,540
Young Marquis Qin,

394
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,400
your reputation doesn't do you justice.

395
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,760
I'm Pang Yiwen.

396
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,030
I've been busy preparing
for Prince Yu's birthday banquet,

397
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,750
so I didn't welcome you at the gate.

398
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,240
If I've been rude in any way,

399
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,790
please forgive me.

400
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,070
So you're Young Master Yiwen.

401
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,070
I've heard much about you.

402
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,000
You're too kind.

403
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,380
My father has been looking forward
to your arrival, Young Marquis.

404
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,550
He's been waiting for you

405
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,680
in the study for a while.

406
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,890
I'm not the Young Marquis.

407
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,220
Please mind your words.

408
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,720
Why not?

409
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:10,110
You'll be named heir sooner or later.

410
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,810
This is Princess Yongning.

411
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,360
And these are my cousins, Qin Wan

412
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,520
and Qin Shuang.

413
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,490
I'm a princess after all,

414
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,520
yet this rich merchant Pang Fuliang

415
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,520
didn't come to welcome me in person.

416
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,790
Instead, he sent

417
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:40,480
this disgusting lecher.

418
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,320
This is unbelievable.

419
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,110
This is my cousin, Xiang.

420
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,940
Greetings, Young Master Pang.

421
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,430
Young Master Pang.

422
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,340
Please, everyone, come in.

423
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,120
What kind of reception is this?

424
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,260
If they were regular merchants,

425
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,250
they wouldn't dare be so insolent.

426
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,560
Looks like Cousin Yan is used to it.

427
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,880
So I guess this is just
how the Pang family rolls.

428
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,880
Let's figure out who's behind them

429
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,610
before making a scene.

430
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,240
Master.

431
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,990
I've done all I can.

432
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,940
Don't let it slip.

433
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,520
Be careful.

434
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,710
Ladies,

435
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,300
we've arrived at the women's quarters.

436
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,500
That is the main room.

437
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,730
Since I'm the oldest among us,

438
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,320
I'll take the main room.

439
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,430
Xiang.

440
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,680
Stop!

441
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,740
We haven't picked yet.

442
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,430
I outrank you as a princess.

443
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,250
Why should you get the main room?

444
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:14,380
You…

445
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,640
Let her have it.

446
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,740
How about this?

447
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:19,880
You take the east wing,

448
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,510
and I'll take the small room
next to yours.

449
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,040
Shuang takes the west wing,

450
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:27,240
and Wanhe and Fuling
can share the smaller room next to hers.

451
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,230
What am I gonna do with you?

452
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,020
You're so sharp
when it comes to cases and medicine,

453
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,160
but completely clueless
about everyday things.

454
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,000
She's walking all over you,

455
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,890
and you're not even mad.

456
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:38,270
Getting upset
over such a trivial matter is pointless.

457
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,720
Besides, you'll be right next door to me.

458
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,090
Knock on the wall, and I'll come over.

459
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,160
Isn't that better?

460
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,730
Sounds good.

461
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:44,440
Let's go.

462
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,510
Xiang doesn't even care to pretend now.

463
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,370
Has she forgotten we're sisters?

464
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,280
The Shuangqing Troupe's here!

465
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,610
Isn't that the Shuangqing Troupe?

466
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:12,160
Yes, it is.

467
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,550
The troupe leader is here too.

468
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,270
Yang Ying,

469
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,070
don't waste time here.

470
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,450
Let them know who we are.

471
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,410
Yes, Chief.

472
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,040
Everyone, please excuse us!

473
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,110
I'm Yang Ying,

474
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,310
deputy

475
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:27,890
to Leader Qing Li.

476
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,620
The Shuangqing Troupe is here

477
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,080
to perform
in honor of Prince Yu's birthday.

478
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,130
We kindly ask everyone to make way.

479
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:35,790
Thank you.

480
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,050
-Thank you.
-I've heard Leader Qing Li

481
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,420
is the real deal.

482
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,500
Her "Mulian Rescues His Mother" is

483
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,910
one of the best in Zhou.

484
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,400
Folks, make some room!

485
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,400
Let them through!

486
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,600
Thank you, everyone!

487
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,120
The Pang family
has no taste and no manners,

488
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,790
but their guest rooms are quite nice.

489
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,350
Little Wan'er.

490
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,880
You're not thinking about Chi, are you?

491
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,450
You've been ignoring me.

492
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,440
I'm listening.

493
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,980
I was just wondering

494
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,060
what was so urgent that Lord Yi

495
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,920
had to meet him in such a rush.

496
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,590
Yan Li acts all devil-may-care.

497
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,030
What urgent business can he have?

498
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,150
He must have taken Chi to some brothel.

499
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,660
Wh…

500
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,410
What?

501
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,300
He's the most infamous rake
in the capital.

502
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,450
When men hang out,

503
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,540
pleasure-seeking
and casual affairs are inevitable.

504
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,610
Don't take it too seriously.

505
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,110
How can I not take it seriously?

506
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,310
Why is it inevitable?

507
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:41,930
Well,

508
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,400
we need to attend
the birthday banquet tomorrow.

509
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,360
You should rest early.

510
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,190
I'll go now.

511
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,050
Don't tell Chi I told you that.

512
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,680
[Tianxiang House]

513
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,710
Sir, slow down.

514
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,390
Watch the steps.

515
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,300
Sir, please have a drink.

516
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,280
Come on,

517
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,570
bring Chi a drink.

518
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,560
Keep him entertained,

519
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,390
and I'll reward you handsomely!

520
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,710
Sir, please have a drink.

521
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,350
Is this how you welcome me?

522
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,530
Go, go, get out.

523
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,470
You too, get out.

524
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,570
Go!

525
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,520
Chi, don't be angry.

526
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,480
Since you're not into it,
I've sent them away.

527
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,920
If you want to welcome me
with singing and dancing,

528
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,580
why don't you dance yourself?

529
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,630
You're not going home
until I'm entertained.

530
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,080
I won't do it again.

531
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:26,330
Chi, it's been years since we last met,

532
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,460
and you've only gotten more uptight.

533
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:31,010
Don't tell me
you're still saving yourself.

534
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,000
That's none of your business.

535
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,930
I'm just concerned about you, Chi.

536
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:37,760
So what if I am?

537
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,240
No way.

538
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,810
Are you seriously planning to get married?

539
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,950
That smile...

540
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,420
so gentle and affectionate.

541
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,430
You're in love, aren't you?

542
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,740
When did it happen?

543
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,790
Who is she?

544
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:01,860
No, no, no.

545
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,720
Don't tell me. Let me guess.

546
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,920
You're not interested

547
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,180
in any of the noble ladies in the capital.

548
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,680
Someone from Jingzhou?

549
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,320
Yue Ning?

550
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,110
No, no, no.

551
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,780
Even I can't stand that crazy girl,

552
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,380
and there's no way you could.

553
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,050
Who could it be?

554
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,480
Don't tell me it's that plain-dressed girl

555
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,080
from the Qin family.

556
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,200
It's really her?

557
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,290
You actually like the plain type.

558
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,200
If you bad-mouth her again,

559
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,060
don't blame me for getting rough.

560
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:45,030
Chi, you can't put a woman
before your own cousin!

561
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,430
I treat you like a brother

562
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,380
and won't let anyone insult you
or mess with you.

563
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,010
I see her as my wife for life,

564
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,970
so no one gets to disrespect her.

565
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,030
That includes you.

566
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,530
Chi,

567
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,170
don't be angry.

568
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,830
You know me, my mouth runs faster

569
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,750
than my brain.

570
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,010
From now on,

571
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,350
I'll be on my best behavior around her.

572
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,570
I'd let her ride me like a horse
if she wanted.

573
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:05,200
Get lost.

574
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,350
She doesn't need you for that.

575
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,110
Fair point.

576
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,490
She won't need to ride me

577
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,860
with you around.

578
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,040
Get lost.

579
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:14,910
I'm leaving.

580
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,780
Chi,

581
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:19,230
I have something important to tell you.

582
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,690
Here's the guest list
for the birthday banquet.

583
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:22,830
Prince Yu knows you're coming

584
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,030
and wants me to make sure

585
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,360
no one you dislike
will be seated near you.

586
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,380
That's a little too thoughtful.

587
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,380
I'm afraid he has something to hide.

588
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,030
I heard you're looking into the corruption
in salt transport.

589
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:36,120
Almost all local officials will be shaking
in their boots at the sight of you.

590
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:37,190
[Li Muyun, Minister of the Supreme Court]

591
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:38,970
Li Muyun?

592
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:41,200
He is
the new Minister of the Supreme Court.

593
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,600
Ever since Prince Jin...

594
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,670
Anyway,

595
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,140
after that happened,

596
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,440
Li became one of His Majesty's favorites.

597
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,430
I told His Majesty
about the corruption in salt transport,

598
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,820
and he sent Li as well.

599
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,920
Maybe it's to put pressure

600
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,710
on Prince Yu

601
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,740
or the local officials in Yuzhou.

602
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,880
Prince Jin died unjustly in prison.

603
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,390
It was largely because Li accused
Minister Shen Yi

604
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,950
of conspiring with Prince Jin
and covering up his crimes.

605
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,750
Without Minister Shen Yi's support,

606
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,880
Li would still be a fifth-rank official

607
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,210
in some prefecture.

608
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,570
Yet to climb the ladder,

609
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,020
he betrayed his mentor.

610
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:18,230
I don't deal with people
who bite the hand that fed them.

611
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:18,830
Fine.

612
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,660
I'll let him sit in the corner.

613
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:21,640
No need for that.

614
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,130
Seat him according to his rank.

615
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,540
Just keep him far from me.

616
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:34,400
Liu Renli, the transport commissioner
of Jianghuai, is coming too.

617
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,680
I can send him away too.

618
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:38,930
Keep him.

619
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:42,760
Chi,

620
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,350
this man's hands are anything but clean.

621
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,370
Even I can see that.

622
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,230
Why are you still tolerating him?

623
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,870
It took Liu Renli

624
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,990
only 10 years to climb from

625
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,030
a low-ranking, pay-to-play vice magistrate

626
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,280
[Liu Renli]

627
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,170
to Jianghuai's transport commissioner,

628
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:59,000
and he also holds the lucrative position
of tea-and-salt commissioner.

629
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,600
He must have pulled strings.

630
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,820
He and Pang Fuliang are
from the same hometown.

631
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,570
Every New Year, he stays
at the Pang Mansion for a few days.

632
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,030
Coming so early this year,

633
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,480
he's probably heard about
His Majesty's probe

634
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,120
into the southeastern salt transport

635
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,120
and rushed over to scope things out.

636
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,620
They say
when he reported back to the capital,

637
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,010
his gifts arrived

638
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:17,960
at the doors of the ministers

639
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,820
before he even reached Tongzhou.

640
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,160
It's almost the end of the year now.

641
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,590
Why is he coming to Yuzhou

642
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,080
instead of rushing back to the capital?

643
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:55,680
That wench Qing Li…

644
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,080
Is the Shuangqing Troupe
not earning enough for her?

645
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,940
Now she's trying to blackmail us!

646
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,870
[Madam Qin]

647
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:03,950
If you give in to her this time,

648
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,530
she'll just hold it over your head again.

649
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,460
Are you planning
to provide for her for life?

650
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,210
If I can take this opportunity

651
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,370
to get my hands on the Shifang Inns,

652
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:15,150
those few taels of silver she wants

653
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,300
would be nothing.

654
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,000
You're dreaming.

655
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:21,440
The Shifang Inns are
Pang Fuliang's bread and butter.

656
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,770
He'd never let anyone
lay a finger on them.

657
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,730
How would you know if you don't try?

658
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,390
By rights,

659
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,600
we should have a share in it.

660
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,680
If back then...

661
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,170
You...

662
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,750
Watch your mouth.

663
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,290
The Shuangqing Troupe is right next door.

664
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,920
Walls have ears.

665
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,450
Qinghui Manor is huge.

666
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,550
The backyard is far away from here.

667
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,210
Besides,

668
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,850
I've got nothing to do
with the Shuangqing Troupe anymore.

669
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,840
It's been ages.

670
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,550
Why are you so cautious?

671
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,010
You don't understand how politics works.

672
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,880
Times have changed.

673
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,840
We absolutely cannot anger Pang Fuliang.

674
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,740
What about our share?

675
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,200
Don't bring that up again!

676
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:34,270
Yan Chi and Li Muyun,
the new Minister of the Supreme Court,

677
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,930
have suddenly come to Yuzhou.

678
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,830
They're not just here

679
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,410
to celebrate some idle prince's birthday.

680
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,670
For the time being, Pang Fuliang and I

681
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,730
have to avoid associating publicly.

682
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,160
I'll come to see you in a few days.

683
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,790
Be careful.

684
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,690
I'm leaving.

685
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,630
That wretched Qing Li…

686
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,220
She has to die.

687
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,360
Let me think.

688
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,100
She has to die.

689
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:43,550
I'm off.

690
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,560
Mr. Pang, your place truly is magnificent.

691
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:58,210
It might even outshine

692
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,700
the Crown Prince's study.

693
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,440
I'm nothing more than a merchant.

694
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:04,630
[Pang Fuliang]

695
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,100
I wouldn't dare compare myself
to His Highness.

696
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,510
The Crown Prince may have noble status,

697
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,240
but the higher the perch,

698
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,620
the stronger the wind.

699
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,610
If he wants stability,

700
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,010
he'll need to plan carefully.

701
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,720
Please.

702
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,250
We merchants

703
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,150
succeed by reading the winds.

704
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,880
If I ever have the honor

705
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,030
of helping His Highness,

706
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,610
I'll do so without hesitation.

707
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,150
You're truly straightforward.

708
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,840
No wonder my father

709
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,900
has trusted you all these years.

710
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,730
Without the Marquis of Zhongyong's help,

711
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:43,730
the Shifang Inns
wouldn't have reached such success.

712
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,480
Unfortunately,

713
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:51,040
the inn business is
drawing too much attention.

714
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,660
If we want to take it to the next level,

715
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,480
we'll need a different approach.

716
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:05,400
That's exactly why I came here.

717
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,290
Mr. Pang, you can speak your mind.

718
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,730
[Salt Transport]

719
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,010
Salt transport?

720
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,080
It's a serious matter.

721
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,760
Once I've discussed it with my father,

722
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,210
I'll come back to you.

723
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,230
As it should be.

724
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:46,900
To be frank with you,

725
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,670
Liu Renli, the transport commissioner
and tea-and-salt commissioner

726
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,800
of Jianghuai, is an old friend of mine.

727
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:54,270
He's generous with his money

728
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,690
and loyal to his friends.

729
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,930
He's here in Yuzhou
for Prince Yu's birthday.

730
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,990
You might want to meet him

731
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,240
to learn more about him.

732
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,290
I'd appreciate it

733
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,090
if you could introduce us.

734
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,160
Have some tea.

735
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:10,970
Please.

736
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,470
If I had pushed the dagger
one inch further,

737
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,530
you'd be bleeding.

738
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,440
Then...

739
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,740
I suppose I should thank you
for showing mercy, Master Wan.

740
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,870
Don't do that again.

741
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:33,110
Why do you smell of rouge and powder?

742
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,080
I...

743
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,310
I... I...

744
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:39,250
I got it at the...

745
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,530
at the…

746
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,070
Tianxiang House.

747
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,200
What is that place?

748
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,180
The Tianxiang House is...

749
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:53,970
a brothel.

750
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,280
But it was my first time there.

751
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,230
The decor looked really classy.

752
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,800
I thought
it was just a restaurant at first.

753
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,220
If you had never been there,

754
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,550
how would you know
what the decor was like?

755
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,350
I heard it from someone else.

756
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:08,170
Someone else?

757
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:10,680
Who would dare talk about
that kind of thing in front of you?

758
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,460
Well, you know, soldiers joke around

759
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,190
to pass the time after a battle.

760
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,100
If you had never tried it,

761
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,360
how would you know it helps pass the time?

762
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,800
Because I don't need to try.

763
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:25,620
And the soldiers aren't the type
to indulge in that kind of thing.

764
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,200
Every time we returned from battle,

765
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,290
we'd be missing a few men—

766
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,980
guys who fought by my side

767
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,380
for years through life and death.

768
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,820
I'd rather the survivors joke around

769
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,640
than drown in grief.

770
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,800
I only asked

771
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,160
because I wanted to know the truth.

772
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,880
It's not that
I don't trust you or your soldiers.

773
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,000
Once I realized what kind of place it was,

774
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,930
I sent those women away right away.

775
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:54,930
Believe me,

776
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,900
if I'd known from the start,

777
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,100
I wouldn't have gone.

778
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,250
I'm sorry.

779
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,630
But when I think about

780
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,280
you flirting with those women,

781
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,510
I feel annoyed,

782
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:07,930
even if I know it was just for show.

783
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,450
Call me possessive.

784
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:10,450
Call me jealous.

785
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,390
This is who I am—not gentle, not virtuous,

786
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,190
and I get to the bottom of things.

787
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,930
Do you regret choosing me?

788
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:16,660
Not at all.

789
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,400
I like that you get jealous.

790
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,320
And you're fierce, too.

791
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:25,810
Good that you know.

792
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,700
I forgive you.

793
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,310
Don't worry.

794
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,970
It won't happen again.

795
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,850
Why is someone singing opera so late?

796
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,710
Pang Fuliang hired

797
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,230
the Shuangqing Troupe
to perform for Prince Yu's birthday.

798
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,440
They're in the backyard of Qinghui Manor.

799
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,900
What are they performing?

800
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,710
Their signature play—

801
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,470
"Mulian Rescues His Mother."

802
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,930
It's about a man, Mulian, who went to hell
to rescue his mother

803
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,860
because he couldn't bear
to see her suffering there.

804
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,380
If one could save their parents,

805
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:18,500
going through hell is worth it.

806
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:25,940
Wan,

807
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,670
we will definitely
clear your parents' names.

808
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,010
Tomorrow…

809
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:36,390
Li Muyun will be there too.

810
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,950
His Majesty values him greatly now.

811
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,350
We can't act recklessly.

812
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,960
Don't worry.

813
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,500
I won't do anything reckless.

814
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,360
I know this is difficult for you.

815
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,930
After returning to the capital,

816
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,330
I'll find a way
to reopen Prince Jin's case.

817
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,220
I won't make you wait too long.

818
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:55,960
Really?

819
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,560
Whatever you wish for,

820
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:00,260
I'll do everything I can
to make it happen.

821
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,880
Little Wan'er,

822
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,680
can I sleep with you?

823
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,930
Someone's singing opera
in the middle of the night.

824
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:17,850
I'm scared.

825
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,810
Little Wan'er, open the door.

826
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,070
I'm freezing.

827
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,860
Fine.

828
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:27,000
Prince Yu's Mansion is
just on the other side of the wall.

829
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,130
No way she sleeps with you every night.

830
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,320
Little Wan'er, Little Wan'er,

831
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,840
open the door.

832
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,510
I'm freezing.

833
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,510
Coming.

834
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:38,990
[Prince Yu's Mansion]

835
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,510
[Longevity]

836
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,000
Come on.

837
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,090
Thank you.

838
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:55,670
Here, congratulations.

839
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:57,760
Congratulations, Prince Yu.

840
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,880
Fill it.

841
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,280
Yongning, you're so beautiful.

842
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,480
I have a nephew.

843
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,670
He's 18 and still unmarried.

844
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,900
You two would be a perfect match.

845
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,760
Princess Yu…

846
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,940
Your Highness, my nephew

847
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:23,380
is handsome

848
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,400
and debonair.

849
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,590
You must come by

850
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,910
our house sometime.

851
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,750
I must introduce him to you.

852
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:30,820
Your Highness,

853
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,860
you're so pretty.

854
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:33,870
When choosing a husband,

855
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:36,730
you've got to find someone
who matches your status.

856
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:37,760
Your Highness,

857
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,320
-since you're free today,
-What should I do?

858
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,510
let's settle it now.

859
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,890
She's my guest.

860
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:46,880
Very good.

861
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,960
This performance

862
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,030
was specially prepared for you
by the Shuangqing Troupe.

863
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:52,000
Qing Li knew it was for your birthday,

864
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,810
so she stayed up several nights

865
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,200
working on this show.

866
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,150
Minister Li, my father often says

867
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:00,530
you're a man of both talent and virtue.

868
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,400
Allow me to finish this cup of wine

869
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,660
to show my admiration.

870
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:05,580
It's so kind of your father.

871
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:07,420
I can't hold my liquor.

872
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:09,110
[Li Muyun, Minister of the Supreme Court]

873
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,800
Please forgive me, Young Master Yan.

874
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,670
Not at all.

875
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,980
No pressure, no pressure.

876
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:16,480
Chi.

877
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,550
No, thanks.

878
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:41,630
Li Muyun?
