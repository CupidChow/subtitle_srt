[Coroner's Diary]

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,940
[Episode 19]

3
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,490
Thank you.

4
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,050
You're welcome.

5
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,479
It's all Qing's fault for overreacting.

6
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,009
It's just a minor chill. How could I
trouble you with this, Miss Qin?

7
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:50,009
As a physician, it's my duty
to heal and save lives.

8
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,210
There's no need to overthink it, Madam.

9
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,320
If you don't mind, Miss Qin,

10
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,510
[Mrs. Pang]

11
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,950
just take my pulse like this.

12
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,020
Come on.

13
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,370
Have another bite.

14
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,050
Madam, you truly care about Miss Jia Yun.

15
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,510
With such kindness in your heart,

16
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,360
you're sure to be rewarded with blessings
in the future.

17
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,520
Thank you, Miss Qin.

18
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,840
Yun and Yan are both well-behaved.

19
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,180
Madam, please give me your other hand.

20
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,240
Who did this to you?

21
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,650
I bumped it myself.

22
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,360
Mother is lying.

23
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,950
It was Father who hit her.

24
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,950
Don't cry, Yan.

25
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,800
Be good.

26
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,660
Go play in the courtyard for a while.

27
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,700
Be careful.

28
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,380
Madam, these external injuries

29
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,710
only need some ointment

30
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,020
and a few days of rest to heal completely.

31
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,880
Thank you, Miss Qin.

32
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,470
However, Madam, you're mentally drained

33
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,730
and have lost all hope.

34
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,480
That is the true root
of your physical weakness.

35
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,440
Miss Qin.

36
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,000
Please help Madam.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,520
Qing.

38
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,370
-Please get up, Qing.
-Please listen to me.

39
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,530
Master has become
increasingly irritable lately,

40
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,370
taking his frustration out on Madam
at the slightest provocation.

41
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,370
A few days ago,

42
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,190
he called Madam to his study
and tormented her.

43
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,180
The day before yesterday,
Young Master Yan got beaten,

44
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,180
and Master blamed it on Madam again.

45
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,360
You wretch!

46
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,680
If you hadn't been so permissive,

47
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,240
would he have stayed out all night?

48
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,400
If you weren't so incompetent,

49
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,360
would he have fallen into someone's trap?

50
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
I'll beat you to death!

51
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,470
Don't hit my mother!

52
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,980
Mother!

53
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,840
Don't hit Mother!

54
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,590
Mother!

55
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,840
Mother!

56
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,910
Stop!

57
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,700
Don't hit Mother!

58
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,000
Mother!

59
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,620
Madam cries every day

60
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,180
and can't eat a thing.

61
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,890
How could she not feel utterly hopeless?

62
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,710
Qing.

63
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,860
-Miss Qin.
-Come on.

64
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,560
Please help Madam.

65
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,700
I beg you.

66
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,000
Mother, I'm hungry.

67
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:10,790
Qing.

68
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,810
Don't make things hard for Miss Qin.

69
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,020
Go feed Yun.

70
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:17,930
Come on.

71
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,330
Come on.

72
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,370
When I first met Yun,

73
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,850
she was like this—

74
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,870
always acting like
a four or five-year-old child.

75
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,330
Madam, with your two children,

76
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,490
what do you plan to do in the future?

77
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,670
Though my husband treats me indifferently,

78
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,480
he dotes on Yan greatly.

79
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,590
When Yan grows up a bit,

80
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,100
he can help his father
uphold the family name,

81
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,120
and perhaps things will get better then.

82
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,170
Madam,
please don't harbor any more illusions.

83
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,840
If a man can hit you once,

84
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:56,430
he will do it countless times.

85
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,070
He'll only become
more and more comfortable

86
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,360
and reckless with it.

87
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,480
Men who raise their hands against women

88
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,560
are all of corrupt character,

89
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,160
complete and utter cowards.

90
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,180
How could they possibly have

91
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,840
the willpower and determination
to change themselves?

92
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,440
I don't expect him to change.

93
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,570
I just hope Yan can grow up quickly.

94
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,360
What difference will it make
when he grows up?

95
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,910
Watching his mother be humiliated

96
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,940
and abused every day,
powerless to do anything.

97
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,150
Over time,

98
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,300
that will only leave him full of
resentment and repression.

99
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,360
How could he possibly grow into

100
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,040
someone strong and responsible?

101
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,970
Madam, please stop
using your children as an excuse.

102
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,470
Miss Qin, everything you said

103
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,630
is wise and kind.

104
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,190
It's just that for now,

105
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,560
I can still manage.

106
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,420
I think I'll endure it for the time being.

107
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,240
Madam, if you don't want
to live in this hell forever,

108
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,510
you have no choice but to risk everything
and leave this all behind.

109
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,240
Only then will you and your children
have a chance for a better life.

110
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,880
I, Qin Wan, have said all I can.

111
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,409
I hope you will consider it carefully,
Madam.

112
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,360
Miss Qin.

113
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,990
Please don't blame Madam
for being indecisive.

114
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,140
Her family is also in business.

115
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,220
Years ago,

116
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,300
to acquire Madam's family's assets,

117
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,830
Master conspired with others,

118
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,680
forcing her family

119
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,190
to the brink of ruin.

120
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,190
To protect her family business,

121
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:23,180
Madam reluctantly became
Master's second wife.

122
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,720
So Madam's family was willing

123
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,330
to sacrifice their daughter's life

124
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,930
just to save their business?

125
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,720
If her family business collapsed,

126
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,580
Madam would have no way out at all.

127
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,240
Besides, she has two children.

128
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,370
If she really left the Pang family
for her own sake,

129
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,750
Young Master Jia Yan
would lose everything,

130
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,170
and all these years of her endurance
would be for nothing.

131
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,900
Miss Qin, you're a nice person,

132
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,360
but

133
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,830
if you haven't experienced
someone else's pain,

134
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,390
perhaps don't be too quick to judge.

135
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,120
Madam is not like you, Miss Qin.

136
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,000
She doesn't have skills to rely on,

137
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,659
so she can only submit to fate.

138
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,680
In this world,

139
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,420
facing injustice,

140
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,690
what can a powerless woman do

141
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,040
but endure it quietly?

142
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,660
The relationship
between Qing Yun, Liu Renli,

143
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,990
and Pang Fuliang is truly extraordinary.

144
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,920
The Shuangqing Troupe travels
far and wide,

145
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,200
making the world their home.

146
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,010
But Qing Yun, just to see them,

147
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,570
travels thousands of miles

148
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,070
to Yuzhou almost every year

149
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,040
for a reunion.

150
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,930
Even ordinary relatives

151
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,930
aren't this close.

152
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,430
Pang Fuliang is quite generous too.

153
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,390
Wherever there's a Shifang Inn,

154
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,159
it's always available
for the Shuangqing Troupe.

155
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,120
The Shuangqing Troupe's fame
across the land

156
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,280
owes much to

157
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,150
Pang Fuliang's support.

158
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,020
What special talent do you think
Qing Yun has

159
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,600
that makes Pang Fuliang
so generous to her?

160
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,150
Chi.

161
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,560
You've hit on something important.

162
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,530
Do you know
why Liu Renli remains unmarried?

163
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,270
As they say,
the falling flower has feelings,

164
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:59,190
-but the flowing water is indifferent.
-Just say it.

165
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,200
Look at you,

166
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,340
you have no sense of romance at all.

167
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,990
Liu Renli is deeply in love with Qing Yun,

168
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,950
but she doesn't care for him at all.

169
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,960
Are you saying

170
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,310
Pang Fuliang is only
being nice to Qing Yun

171
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,690
to win Liu Renli over?

172
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,510
Exactly.

173
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,210
Master,

174
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,100
there's new information.

175
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,640
Qing Yun, Liu Renli, and Pang Fuliang

176
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,870
are indeed all from Dingzhou.

177
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,530
Liu Renli used to run
a martial arts school in Dingzhou.

178
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,780
Later, the three of them left together,

179
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,690
and only Qing Yun returned

180
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,120
to Dingzhou to retire
under the name Madam Qin.

181
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,870
When they left Dingzhou,

182
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:33,070
a major gold heist
had just occurred there.

183
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,240
A gold heist?

184
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:36,919
How much gold was stolen?

185
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,280
Was it real gold or paper money?

186
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,549
Have they caught the bandits?

187
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:42,280
How come I never heard of
such a sensational case?

188
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,360
It was an unsolved case from 15 years ago.

189
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,880
Since it involved stolen military funds,

190
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,400
His Majesty had it covered up.

191
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,670
I only know because I overheard Father

192
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,800
discussing it with his subordinates.

193
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,410
I never expected Qing Yun's death

194
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,670
would be connected to such a major case.

195
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,350
Chi, do you suspect

196
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,970
they were behind it?

197
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,120
You two, come with me to the prison.

198
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,450
It's time to interrogate Yang Ying.

199
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,130
Little Wan'er!

200
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,350
I knew you're still awake.

201
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,710
Do you know what I've been doing
these past few days?

202
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,390
No idea.

203
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,270
Yan Li and I went undercover,

204
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,360
as spies.

205
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,300
Was it fun?

206
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,790
Fun? Not at all.

207
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,950
We discovered something big.

208
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,840
That Pang fellow is definitely
not a good guy.

209
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,130
My Lady, Your Highness.

210
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:49,920
Young Master Yan says

211
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,160
we need to pack our belongings quickly

212
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,490
and leave Yuzhou early tomorrow morning.

213
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,880
Why such a hurry?

214
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,040
Does Chi know about this?

215
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,900
No, he doesn't.

216
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,350
No need to ask.

217
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,920
It must be related to Liu Renli's death.

218
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,160
Go pack our things first.

219
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,640
Ning and I will make a run
to the prefect's office.

220
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,120
Okay.

someone dies.

226
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,550
This is already the fourth time
I've heard it.

227
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:33,550

Why did she stop singing?

230
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,240
Let's go.

231
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,810
What's wrong with her?

232
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,950
She probably had a seizure.

233
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,550
She got frightened just now.

234
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:52,360
Come on.

235
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,710
Yang Ying.

236
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,470
Since its founding, the Shuangqing Troupe

237
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,400
has always had two leaders.

238
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,220
Why is it that after Qing Yun left,

239
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,040
the number of leaders
went from two to one?

240
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,970
That's not true.

241
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,160
There was another leader, Qingxi.

242
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,990
She's Qing Yun's junior,

243
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,670
but later she got married

244
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,120
and left with her apprentice.

245
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,360
Qing Yun had a falling out
with her after that.

246
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,280
What was Qingxi's apprentice's name?

247
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,280
Qing Huan.

248
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,000
In terms of movement techniques
and vocal skills,

249
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,940
she's better than
Qing Yun's apprentice Qing Li.

250
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,420
It's really a pity.

251
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,540
And who did Qingxi marry?

252
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,190
A general from the Northwest,

253
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,050
surnamed Zhang, I believe.

254
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,760
He also helped her
escape her lowly status.

255
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,700
So when did Leader Qing Yun

256
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,770
pass her position

257
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,190
to Qing Li?

258
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,640
About

259
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,750
eight or nine years ago, I think.

260
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,160
After Leader Qingxi got married,

261
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,590
Qing Yun drank every day

262
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,790
and lost interest
in managing the Shuangqing Troupe.

263
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,000
15 years ago,

264
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,830
Qing Yun followed Mr. Pang
to do business in the Northwest

265
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,000
and made a fortune.

266
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,480
Later,

267
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:20,290
it was said that Leader Qingxi
took her disciples to visit her hometown

268
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,850
and was killed by bandits.

269
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,430
After that,

270
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,670
Qing Yun handed over the leadership
to Qing Li

271
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,430
and retired herself.

272
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,240
Occasionally after that,

273
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,870
she would come with us to Yuzhou

274
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,200
to meet with Mr. Pang.

275
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:34,900
Chi.

276
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,320
How did you know there would be

277
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,050
records of the gold heist here?

278
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,290
I once saw it when...

279
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,920
When reading
a senior judicial official's notes.

280
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,040
Which senior official?

281
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,360
Let me read it too.

282
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,210
I forgot.

283
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,120
I only remember he previously
served in Yuzhou.

284
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,380
Why so many questions? Hurry and search.

285
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,670
Found it.

286
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,650
This is...

287
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The household register
of General Zhenwu's family?

288
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,640
Wife:

289
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,940
Zhang Qingxi.

290
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,470
The military funds allocated
to the Northwestern border army

291
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,040
were divided into four routes.

292
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,640
The route escorted by General Zhenwu
from the Northwest

293
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,970
was robbed in Dingzhou.

294
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,520
50,000 taels of gold
vanished into thin air.

295
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,920
All accompanying soldiers died fighting.

296
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,140
General Zhenwu's family members

297
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,720
also perished.

298
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,550
All dead?

299
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,630
How is that possible?

300
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,430
What kind of bandits would do this?

301
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,490
Intelligence says

302
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,360
Liu Renli's resignation from office,

303
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,160
Pang Fuliang's purchase of
the Shifang Inn, and Qing Yun's retirement

304
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,760
all happened in the same year
as the gold heist.

305
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,880
50,000 taels of gold.

306
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,950
What a great deal.

307
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,160
But that was all military funds,

308
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,790
and those were all soldiers escorting it.

309
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,280
They must have been insane.

310
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,280
I bet General Zhenwu never imagined

311
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,880
that instead of dying on the battlefield,

312
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,280
he would die by the weapons
of his own people.

313
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,470
I'll arrest that beast Pang Fuliang
right now

314
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,470
to honor General Zhenwu's memory!

315
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,470
Stop right there!

316
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,050
Do you think we're still in Shuoxi?

317
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,670
Since I've taken the position
of Surveillance Commissioner,

318
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,310
I must act according to
national laws and criminal codes.

319
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,240
But this case happened so long ago.

320
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,590
Where can we find evidence?

321
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,590
Qing Yun and Liu Renli are both dead.

322
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,830
If Pang Fuliang refuses to confess,

323
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,720
there will be no witnesses left.

324
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,310
Let's go meet with Pang Fuliang now

325
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,560
and settle all these accounts with him
one by one.

326
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,960
[Qinghui Manor]

327
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,260
What's wrong with Yun?

328
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,500
Yun!

329
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,550
Yun!

330
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:01,580
Yun!

331
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,590
Yun!

332
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,590
Mother.

333
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,820
Madam, Young Lady just
had a seizure.

334
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,680
Has this ever happened before?

335
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,710
Yun has had this condition
since childhood.

336
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,370
It tends to act up
whenever she gets frightened.

337
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,310
Yun, look what this is.

338
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,150
Mother.

339
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,790
Where is my general?

340
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,640
I want my general.

341
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,950
Yan will go get it for you.

342
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,430
I want my general.

343
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,470
Yan's gone to get it, okay?

344
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,590
These two dolls are so exquisitely made.

345
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,250
Where did you get them, Madam?

346
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,920
Yun loves listening to opera

347
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,640
but can't easily meet strangers,

348
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,280
so Qing specially made these two dolls

349
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,680
to keep her entertained.

350
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,810
Yun.

351
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,500
Good boy, Yan.

352
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:59,830
♪ Ride on the auspicious cloud,
heading for Mount Lingshan ♪

353
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:05,560
♪ Buddha's compassion guides the way ♪

354
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,470
Jia Yun can sing
"Mulian Rescues His Mother"?

355
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,930
So what we heard before...

356
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,000
Thank you.

357
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,160
Please stop here.

358
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:32,930
Little Wan'er.

359
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,510
What is this?

360
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,370
Don't touch it.

361
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,630
This is a Datura flower.

362
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,640
It's poisonous.

363
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,230
Ning, go to
the prefect's office immediately,

364
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,360
tell Chi everything that just happened,

365
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,750
and ask him to bring people
to Qinghui Manor as soon as possible.

366
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,360
Got it.

Help...

370

Me...

371
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,840
I can't treat your wound.

372
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,880
As soon as this sword is pulled out,

373
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,210
you will die instantly.

374
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,860
Who did this to you?

375
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,650
If you don't speak now,
you'll die in vain.

376
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,100
Hurry up! Come on!

377
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,350
Go get water quickly!

378
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,170
Hurry!

379
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,570
You, come here!

380
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,890
-My Lady!
-Wan!

381
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,800
-My Lady!
-Come on, put out the fire!

382
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,120

383
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,080
Wan, where are you?

384
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,540
Put out the fire! Quickly!

385
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,920
Steward, have you seen Her Ladyship?

386
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,350
Is Her Ladyship inside?

387
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,320
Get lost! You're being a nuisance!

388
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:09,920
Go away!

389
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,160
You old servant!

390
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,880
-How dare you shove her?
-You dare to push me?

391
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,430
-So what if I did?
-I'll beat you to death!

392
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:15,920
I...

393
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,670
If you ever dare touch her again,

394
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,930
I'll kick you to death!

Yan Chi's feelings for Qin Wan

437
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,490
are truly something else.

438
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,920
If we play this right,

439
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,360
within three years,

440
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,560
the Shuoxi Army will become
a strong support for His Highness.

441
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,020
If His Grace asks about Liu Renli,

442
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,690
how should we respond?

443
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,710
I've already mentioned it in my letter

444
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,570
that Li Muyun suddenly
made a visit to Yuzhou,

445
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,770
and to avoid revealing our intentions,

446
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,630
I stopped in time.

447
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,850
Understood.

448
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,400
However,
something like Liu Renli's incident

449
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,460
must never happen again.

450
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,880
If it happens again,

451
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,230
I'll lose all credibility

452
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,400
with His Highness forever.

453
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,880
That was because Pang Fuliang
deliberately concealed information.

454
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,880
It wasn't your fault, Young Master.

455
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,920
I was still too hasty.

456
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:24,330
I'm afraid observant people may
have already noticed my intentions.

457
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:27,200
We can't be seen so close
to Prince Yu anymore.

458
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,560
As it happens,

459
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:31,960
Father wrote that

460
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,470
His Highness's affairs
have run into some trouble

461
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:37,470
and urgently need
Wan's skills to solve the problems.

462
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,670
Let's set off for the capital right away.

463
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,320
Yes.

464
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,640
[Yuzhou Prefecture Office]

465
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:51,840
The fatal wound is still
some distance from his chest.

466
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,160
The killer wanted Pang Fuliang

467
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,400
to watch himself being burned alive

468
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,270
without being able to save himself.

469
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,070
Based on the victim's injuries,

470
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,990
even if he hadn't been burned to death,

471
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,090
he could have died from blood loss,

472
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,390
leaving no chance for rescue at all.

473
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,790
This notebook

474
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,990
documents Father's investigation

475
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,080
of the gold heist,

476
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,340
along with many inconsistencies
in the official records.

477
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,080
Father meticulously organized files
on many unsolved cases.

478
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,710
I wonder

479
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,020
how many still remain to this day.

480
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,190
Don't worry.

481
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,720
No matter how many still remain

482
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,100
or where they might be,

483
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,150
we'll definitely be able to retrieve them.

484
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,510
The official records state that

485
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,510
General Zhang's entire family was
burned to death in the inn,

486
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,850
but after my father personally examined
the bodies, he discovered

487
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,810
the family

488
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,540
was actually abused to death,

489
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,450
and the fire

490
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,360
was just to cover up the evidence.

491
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,750
Qingxi died from a broken neck by hanging,

492
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,930
the eldest son was drowned,

493
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:54,230
and General Zhang was killed
by an arrow in his back.

494
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,960
Now look at these four victims:

495
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,160
Qing Yun was hanged,

496
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:01,700
Qing Li

497
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,650
died from an arrow in the back,

498
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,850
Liu Renli was drowned to death,

499
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,990
and though Pang Fuliang suffered
a sword wound,

500
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,590
the torment of waiting to die

501
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,600
was more lethal than his injury.

502
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,920
The causes of death for these four

503
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,800
are almost identical
to General Zhang's family's,

504
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,230
which cannot be coincidental.

505
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,640
But their actual causes of death

506
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,230
were never recorded in the official files

507
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,320
or made public.

508
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,320
The murderer of the Pang family case
actually knew these details perfectly,

509
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,640
which suggests this person

510
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,120
is very likely a survivor of

511
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:27,980
the gold heist.

512
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,430
Keep reading.

513
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,480
The bodies of her foster sister
and eldest daughter are missing.

514
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,970
But Qingxi doesn't have a foster sister.

515
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,410
Unless...

516
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,950
Yang Ying said Qing Huan was
the most skilled in the Shuangqing Troupe.

517
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,530
If the foster sister was Qing Huan,

518
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,320
then Qingxi's eldest daughter

519
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,120
was very likely rescued by Qing Huan.

520
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,670
Killing Liu Renli and Pang Fuliang

521
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,510
requires some martial arts skills.

522
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,470
Judging from the movement techniques
and motive,

523
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,260
the killer

524
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,040
should have been Qing Huan.

525
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,980
According to household records,

526
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,080
if Qingxi's eldest daughter
survived until now,

527
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,560
she should be around 18 years old,

528
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,360
and Qing Huan should be about 30.

529
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,120
Based on the age calculation,

530
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,030
plus the Datura flowers in the courtyard,

531
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,360
the dolls, and the song,

532
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:10,100
Qing Huan is very likely to be Qing.

533
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,270
Then the Eldest Madam
of the Pang household

534
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,600
must be General Zhang's eldest daughter.

535
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,390
After the gold heist,

536
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,700
the battle in the northwest

537
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,900
was extremely tough.

538
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,060
My father once believed

539
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,080
that the military funds
were stolen by mountain bandits.

540
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,640
After driving back the enemy forces,

541
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,840
he also went to wipe out
several bandit strongholds.

542
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,170
Who could have imagined

543
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:34,160
that the always brave and open-minded
General Zhang

544
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,160
would die at the hands of those villains?

545
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,360
Although these people deserved to die,

546
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,190
none should have died unjustly and without
clear cause due to vigilante punishment.

547
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,270
Such revenge

548

is rather extensive and complex.

one has a wooden shaft with an iron tip,

626

the other is made entirely of iron.

was removed from the victim's body
as the murder weapon.

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,410
And this iron-tipped arrow

630
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:43,600
is the one originally included
in the quiver for performance use.

631
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,510
The killer replaced this iron-tipped arrow

632
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,910
with a pure iron one,

633
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,420
increasing the weight,

00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:51,030
requiring the mechanism to be triggered
twice in succession to release it.

Therefore, when Yang Ying
lowered her head again,

636

the iron arrow was released

had a private conversation
with Pang Fuliang in his study,

demanding the Shifang Inn from him.

656

They had a heated argument
and parted on bad terms.

657
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,750
The killer knew
Madam Qin was fond of drinking,

658
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,990
so they took the opportunity

659
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:44,050
to put Datura seed powder in her wine.

due to the poison,

661

the suspect snuck into her room,

662
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,920
removed Madam Qin's waistband,

663
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,710
dragged her near the beam,

664
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,080
and used a hemp rope

665

to hang Madam Qin from the beam.

666
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,640

was looped over the beam

667

and tied around Madam Qin's neck,

668
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,600
after which the hemp rope
around her waist was untied,

669

using the falling body's momentum
to strangle her to death.

670

Jumping onto the beam

671
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,400
is not something
an ordinary person could do.

With your skills,

00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,630
when you stabbed Pang Fuliang
with your sword,

717
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,960
could you have killed him with one strike?

718
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,570
Yes, I could.

719
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:32,720
Then why did you

720
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,920
deliberately miss his heart by an inch?

721
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,760
Because I wanted him to suffer,

722
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:39,680
to watch himself being burned alive.

723
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,290
What kind of grudge did you two have

724
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,530
that drove you to harm him so severely?

725
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,110
They were just a bunch of

726

cold-hearted, rotten, and vicious people.

727
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,270
Because they

728
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,890
conspired to hang my master Qingxi,

729
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,760
shoot General Zhang, my master's husband,

730
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:58,110
and drown my master's eldest son.

00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,720
Even my master's little daughter,
Jia Yun,

732
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,120
was frightened into such
a state of idiocy.

733
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,200
Because they

734
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,170
were the real culprits

735
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,400
behind the gold heist from 15 years ago!

736
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:09,600
What?

737
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,550
This is an earth-shattering secret!

738
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:13,880
The culprit hasn't been found in 15 years.

739
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,580
Court dismissed!

740
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:27,360
The gold heist
will be tried another day.

741
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,230
Take Qing away!

742
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,720
Thank you.

743
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:11,910
Should I call you Qing Huan or Qing?

744
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:15,270
Since I left the Shuangqing Troupe
with my master,

745
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:18,690
the name Qing Huan has had
nothing to do with me anymore.

746
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,180
Please just call me Qing.

747
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,450
I presented the evidence and accused you,

748
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,550
yet you hold no grudge against me at all.

749
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,880
From the moment I did those deadly deeds,

750
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,920
I knew this day would come.

751
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:34,550
Why should I harbor hatred towards you?

752
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,680
Miss Qin, since you were willing

753
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,150
to help me reveal the injustice
from back then in court,

754
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,590
you must have known something
about what happened.

755
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,790
I might as well tell you
the whole truth.

756
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,070
Miss Qin, I believe you'll
understand my intentions.

757
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:49,280
Though Qing Yun was older than my master,

758
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,630
she was narrow-minded,

759
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:52,920
envious, and resentful of talent.

760
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:55,350
She envied my master
for marrying a good man

761
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,950
and coveted the wealth
of the general's household.

762
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,510
Therefore, after falling out
with my master,

763
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:02,320
she came back,
pretending to rekindle their sisterhood.

764
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,110
My master was very loyal and trusting,

765
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:06,070
so she was easily fooled
by Qing Yun's act,

766
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,330
which invited trouble

767
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,560
and planted the seeds of disaster.

768
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,880
The journey was going smoothly, and once

769
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,920
we reached Mengzhou, the border troops
were supposed to meet us.

770
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,750
But unexpectedly, Qing Yun colluded with
Pang Fuliang and Liu Renli...

771
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:18,140
Kill!

772
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:20,100
Bringing Qing Li to Dingzhou.

773
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,590
They disguised themselves as coachmen
and cooks to sneak into the inn,

774
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,450
drugged the escorting soldiers,

775
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,840
and slaughtered

776
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,510
everyone.

777
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,400
Master's two children

778
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,490
were just innocent little kids back then,

779
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:46,550
but that vicious wretch

780
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,000
still threw them into the well.

781
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,730
Fortunately, that day, Master advised me

782
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,580
to be more respectful to Qing Yun.

783
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,850
Acting on impulse, I hid away

784
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,300
and thus survived.

785
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,930
So Lady Jia Yun...

786
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:22,250
Right, Jia Yun was Master's
youngest daughter.

787
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,680
After they left,

788
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:26,600
I immediately went down into the well.

789
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,760
But

790
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,770
only Jia Yun survived.

791
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,970
Her older brother carried her
on his back until his death

792
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,610
and ended up drowning himself.

793
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:45,440
That's how Jia Yun ended up
like she is now.

794
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,920
So you did all this

795
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,070
to make Qing Yun and the others
pay blood for blood?

796
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,780
For a lowborn woman like me,

797
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,760
I had to become even more ruthless
than those villains

798
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:04,320
to seek justice for my master's family.

799
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:07,070
But why didn't you report it
to the authorities?

800
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,030
Miss Qin.

801
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,800
The gold heist involved military funds.

802
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,360
Have you ever wondered

803
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,720
why it could remain hidden for 15 years?

804
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,690
General Zhang was brave and upright,

805
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,840
and my master was kind and generous.

806
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,760
Why did they die tragically
at the hands of villains,

807
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,840
while those scoundrels could rise to power

808
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,440
and do whatever they please?

809
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:27,830
In this world,

810
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,880
there's no true justice

811
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,660
or clear distinctions
between right and wrong.

812
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,660
It all comes down to power and money.

813
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:36,430
True justice,

814
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,920
clear distinctions
between right and wrong...

815
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,260
Wan.

816
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,550
When judging a case, remember:
official matters belong to authorities,

817
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:58,950
right and wrong have reason,
and severity is governed by law.

818
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:01,330
One must not override public justice
for personal reasons,

819
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:03,040
nor bend the law

820
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:05,000
to favor personal relationships.

821
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:11,630
The unexceedable bounds
of severity and leniency

822
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,030
constitute the law;

823
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:16,780
carefully upholding legal principles while
deeply considering human circumstances

824
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,910
is what makes the law strict and clear.

825
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,170
Even if perfect justice
is hard to seek in this world,

826
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:25,650
one must not lose faith because of it,

827
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,870
much less use it as an excuse to do evil.

828
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,740
Only by upholding justice

829
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,630
with a public-minded heart

830
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,330
can we change

831
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:35,590
this unfair world.

832
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:48,430
If all officials were like Master Wan,

833
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:50,320
all people under heaven

834
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,780
could truly live in peace and safety.
