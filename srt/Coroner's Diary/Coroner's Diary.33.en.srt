[Coroner's Diary]

00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,950
[Episode 33]

3
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,270
On the night Consort Jin passed away,

4
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,030
I was on duty at Yingyang Gate.

5
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:44,640
After the incident,

6
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,560
before Prince Jin's guard, Song Xiwen,

7
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,280
could be detained
by the Court of Judicial Review,

8
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,539
the Empress seized him

9
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,680
and sent him to
the Imperial Punishment Department.

10
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,410
She then ordered me to secretly

11
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,210
take the body out of the palace.

12
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,229
What makes you so sure
this was the Empress's doing?

13
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:01,840
How could the Empress summon
a mere palace guard like you?

14
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,370
It was my godfather, Wan Xi,

15
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,390
who passed the message to me.

16
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,480
He serves only the Empress

17
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,560
and has her complete trust.

18
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,470
Where did you take the body?

19
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,800
It was hidden in a secret compartment
under the night soil cart.

20
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,990
Under the cover of darkness,

21
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,250
I took it out of the city

22
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,360
and buried it on Qiwu Mountain.

23
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,120
Nonsense!

24
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,750
The body was clearly found
in the backyard of Prince Jin's mansion.

25
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,710
Be honest!

26
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,150
I swear I'm not lying!

27
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,200
I really did take Song Xiwen's body

28
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,550
and bury it in the mountains.

29
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,710
I really have no idea

30
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,970
how the body ended up
at Prince Jin's mansion.

31
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,280
Then how can you be certain

32
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,329
that the dead man was Song Xiwen?

33
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:39,260
Song Xiwen often

34
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,150
accompanied Prince Jin into the palace,

35
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,190
and I'd seen him

36
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,560
during my shifts.

37
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,740
Did you see Song Xiwen's body
with your own eyes?

38
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,070
What was its condition?

39
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,560
It was only

40
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,000
when I was about to bury the body

41
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,070
that I noticed it was somewhat stiff,

42
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,750
with blood marks from torture

43
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,020
but no wounds on the face.

44
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,650
That's how I recognized him as Song Xiwen.

45
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:03,460
Bai Feng,

46
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,440
take him to confirm the burial site.

47
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,170
Yes, Master.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,560
Bai Feng,

49
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,970
if you find these seeds at the location
Wang Han mentioned,

50
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,330
that will confirm
where the body was originally buried.

51
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:13,680
Yes.

52
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,840
Let's go.

53
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,770
Wang Han was likely telling the truth.

54
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,210
I found these

55
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,780
on the body during my initial examination.

56
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,260
These are Vaccinium bracteatum seeds.

57
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,050
They help calm the mind and stop coughs.

58
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,600
They typically grow deep
in remote mountain forests.

59
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,530
So they couldn't possibly appear
in the backyard of Prince Jin's mansion.

60
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,180
At that time, I suspected
that the body had been moved,

61
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,579
but Li Muyun was present,

62
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,780
so I held my tongue.

63
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,770
You were right not to say anything.

64
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,810
I once suspected the Empress was
involved in Prince Jin's case.

65
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,160
If Song Xiwen's death

66
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,840
was truly the Empress's doing,

67
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,430
then Prince Jin might still have a chance
to clear his name.

68
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,840
I'm just afraid that when that happens,

69
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,090
the Crown Prince will certainly
be stripped of his title.

70
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,820
If Li Muyun hadn't intervened,

71
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,810
the Marquis of Zhongyong
would never have let you  off.

72
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,160
As long as we're together,

73
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,690
I'm not afraid of any storm.

74
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:08,720
Mother,

75
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,600
where do you feel unwell?

76
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,840
Have you summoned Wan to check on you?

77
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,279
I just didn't sleep well last night.

78
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:22,450
What troubles you so much

79
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,280
that you cannot sleep at night, Mother?

80
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,840
Have a seat. Sit first.

81
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,720
Thank you, Mother.

82
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,040
In what seems like the blink of an eye,

83
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,770
even your hair has turned gray.

84
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,520
My health is failing day by day,

85
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,360
and I don't know
how much longer I can hold on.

86
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:47,970
I had hoped

87
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,920
that with Lin as your right hand,

88
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,940
I could rest easy even in death.

89
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,940
I never imagined
that he would die before me.

90
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,840
I called you here today

91
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,890
to discuss

92
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,010
having Chi inherit the title
as soon as possible.

93
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,350
So he can then take on
his father's responsibilities

94
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,290
and protect you.

95
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,400
What do you think?

96
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,580
Since he's to inherit the title...

97
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,770
well,

98
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,140
Li

99
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,110
has been the Heir of Prince Yi
for many years now.

100
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,470
Taking this opportunity,

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,520
we might as well confer titles upon
both of them together.

102
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,190
You truly treat Li like your own son.

103
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,590
Li is my godson,

104
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,080
so I naturally favor him a bit more.

105
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,000
It's also to repay

106
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:42,710
Prince Yi for risking his life
to save mine years ago.

107
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,840
When all is said and done,

108
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,240
it's all fate.

109
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,330
Then I ask one thing of you:

110
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,659
no matter

111
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,440
what happens in the future,

112
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,650
you must treat Chi well.

113
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,140
Mother, please rest assured.

114
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,450
I promise you,

115
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,730
as long as Chi

116
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,220
doesn't commit any capital offenses,

117
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,300
I will ensure his safety

118
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,570
for the rest of my life.

119
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:11,890
Good.

120
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,040
Good.

121
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,720
Now I can rest easy.

122
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,040
Your Highness, I've confessed everything,

123
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,970
and the burial site has been found.

124
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Please show mercy

125
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,140
and spare my life, Your Highness.

126
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,020
I can spare you,

127
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,690
but you must do something for me.

128
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,400
As long as Your Highness spares my life,

129
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,380
I'll do

130
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,590
whatever you say.

131
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,630
Turn yourself in to Prince Cheng.

132
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,970
No, no, I can't.

133
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,400
The Empress's maternal family has
eyes and ears everywhere.

134
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,460
Once I show myself,

135
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,020
I'll be dead anyway.

136
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,590
As long as you confess

137
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,180
that the Empress ordered you to
dispose of Song Xiwen's body,

138
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,850
Prince Cheng will ensure
you can see His Majesty alive.

139
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,220
But she's the Empress!

140
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,020
For the sake of royal dignity,

141
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,770
His Majesty will have me silenced!

142
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,130
You're just a palace guard.

143
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,240
What does royal dignity
have to do with you?

144
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,570
Since I'm telling you to turn yourself in,

145
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,170
I have ways to keep you alive.

146
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:03,840
If you refuse,

147
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,160
the moment you leave this mansion,

148
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,130
you'll be hunted
by both Prince Cheng's men

149
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,590
and the Empress's forces.

150
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,580
You'll probably die even faster.

151
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,600
Then what should I...

152
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,630
tell Prince Cheng?

153
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,720
Tell the truth.

154
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,720
However,

155
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,530
Prince Cheng and I don't get along.

156
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,130
If you want his protection,

157
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,130
don't mention that I saved you.

158
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:27,980
Alright.

159
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,130
I'll do as Your Highness says.

160
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,450
[Court of Judicial Review]

161
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,280
Song Xiwen has been dead for so long.

162
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,010
Why have you only come forward
and confessed now?

163
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,130
My godfather said

164
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,840
that someone of high status gave orders

165
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,280
for me to lay low for a while

166
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,860
so as not to let any word slip out.

167
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,720
Because my family urgently needed money,

168
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,920
I came back secretly,

169
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,800
hoping to get some money
from my godfather,

170
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,930
only to learn that he'd been arrested.

171
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,159
That was when I knew
how serious things were.

172
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,159
Song Xiwen was a large man,

173
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,120
and his body was heavy.

174
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,730
How did you manage to

175
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,530
dispose of his body so quietly
on your own?

176
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,690
When I took over,

177
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,130
his body

178
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,970
was already in the night soil cart.

179
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,840
The person who handed it to me was...

180
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,010
a eunuch named Kang Bowen.

181
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,260
Minister Li, you can verify this
through a simple investigation.

182
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,690
Is...

183
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,440
what you're saying true?

184
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,310
If I've spoken even half a lie,

185
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,030
may Heaven strike me down,

186
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,330
and may I die a terrible death!

187
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,090
Very well!

188
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,330
Guard,

189
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,640
arrest Kang Bowen immediately!

190
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:35,940
Yes, Your Highness.

191
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:38,789
Your Highness,

192
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,169
a eunuch's body was found in the well

193
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:41,740
at the Harem Attendants Bureau
in the North Garden.

194
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,600
It's said to be Kang Bowen,
the head of the Harem Attendants Bureau.

195
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,450
What?

196
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:55,890
Note this:

197
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,570
the deceased was Kang Bowen.

198
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,700
There's mud around his mouth and nose.

199
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,690
No injuries to the back of his head.

200
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,570
There's an abrasion on his forehead,

201
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,370
likely from hitting the well wall
during the fall.

202
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,290
Note this:

203
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,820
the deceased's shoe soles

204
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,930
have traces of moss and mud,

205
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,290
yet the moss along the well's rim
shows only footprints

206
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,810
and no slip marks.

207
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,450
This indicates that the deceased

208
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,710
didn't accidentally fall into the well.

209
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,170
Apply white vinegar to the body's skin.

210
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,360
Apply more to the shoulders, arms,
and wrists.

211
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,520
If he had been forced to
jump into the well,

212
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,840
there should be marks of

213
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,040
dragging or binding.

214
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,670
All bones are intact,

215
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,510
with only a few abrasions on the body.

216
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,580
I need to open the chest cavity

217
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,780
to determine the actual cause of death.

218
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,180
Stop!

219
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,370
This person was a suspect
in the Song Xiwen case.

220
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,680
Without my permission,

221
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,720
how dare you conduct an autopsy here?

222
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,450
Kang Bowen was a palace eunuch.

223
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,480
The Empress Dowager personally ordered
Princess Yongci and me to

224
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,290
assist the Imperial Punishment Department
in determining the cause of death.

225
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,130
If Your Highness Prince Cheng has
any objections,

226
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,410
feel free to ask Her Majesty
to withdraw her order.

227
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:25,810
You...

228
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:27,910
Your Highness,

229
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,360
Princess Yongci's skills as a coroner

230
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,420
are unparalleled.

231
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,630
Surely,

232
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,290
with Her Highness's assistance,

233
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,820
the truth behind this case
will come to light.

234
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,880
There's water in the deceased's lungs.

235
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,590
He must have been alive
before falling into the water,

236
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,520
which confirms death by drowning.

237
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,700
Based on the current findings,

238
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,520
I believe

239
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,520
that Kang Bowen did indeed commit suicide
by jumping into the well.

240
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,720
Within the harem,

241
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,690
the one who could easily silence Wan Xi

242
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,420
and drive Kang Bowen to suicide

243
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,850
can only be the one in the Fengyi Palace.

244
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,120
Imperial power is always blinding.

245
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,310
Especially

246
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,670
when she's a mother
who loves her son dearly.

247
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,180
Leave us.

248
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,570
Mother,

249
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,330
Kang Bowen committed suicide

250
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,690
by jumping into a well.
His body has been found,

251
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,410
and it was Qin Wan
who performed the autopsy.

252
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,240
What does Kang Bowen's suicide

253
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,010
have to do with you?

254
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,760
Yan Qi has captured Wang Han.

255
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,720
He confessed and implicated Kang Bowen,

256
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,770
and also confessed

257
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,700
that you ordered him to
dispose of Song Xiwen's body.

258
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,450
Is that true?

259
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,000
Complete nonsense!

260
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,530
I meant well by letting Song Xiwen go.

261
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,970
How could I have known
he would be murdered?

262
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,500
Yan Qi thinks
he can just arrest a few servants

263
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,330
and use them to implicate and challenge
your position as Crown Prince?

264
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,530
It won't be that easy.

265
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,690
Mother...

266
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,530
let's not fight for
the throne anymore, okay?

267
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,300
If it comes to it,
I'll give up being Crown Prince.

268
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,570
Say that again,

269
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,240
and I'll die right here in front of you!

270
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,050
As long as there's breath left in us,

271
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,450
we must fight for the throne
to the very end!

272
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,170
Only by claiming that throne

273
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,370
can you make your father...

274
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,170
can you make your father pay for

275
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,110
his indifference toward us.

276
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,780
Mother, please calm down.

277
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,040
I was wrong.

278
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,890
I was wrong.

279
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:04,300
Your expression, especially around
the eyes, looks just like his.

280
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,410
If he saw you,

281
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,110
he would surely be delighted.

282
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:12,720
Mother,

283
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,100
what are you talking about?

284
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,090
Who is "he"?

285
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,480
Your father, of course.

286
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,050
Che.

287
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,640
Remember this:

288
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,210
as long as there's breath left,

289
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,940
you must fight for the throne
to the very end.

290
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,520
I will remember, Mother.

291
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,330
Swear to me.

292
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,030
Even if one day I am gone...

293
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,490
you must keep your promise.

294
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,090
Mother.

295
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,050
Swear it!

296
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,650
Heaven above bears witness,

297
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,050
I, Yan Che, hereby swear:

298
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,740
even if

299
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,720
I alone survive in this world,

300
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,240
I will still fight

301
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,230
to claim the throne!

302
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,480
If you break this oath...

303
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,790
If I break this oath,

304
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,970
may I be eternally condemned to
live as a beast

305
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,260
and never

306
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,450
be reborn as a human.

307
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,840
By Heaven's mandate,

308
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
I, the Emperor,

309
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,880
hereby appoint Yan Chi,
Heir of Prince Rui,

310
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,120
to succeed to the title of Prince Rui.

311
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,480
Prince Rui Yan Chi

312
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,880
is devout and respectful,

313
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,360
honors Heaven and Earth,

314
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,170
follows the principles of nature,

315
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,210
and upholds the royal family
and the state through virtue.

316
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,360
Today, I appoint Yan Chi as Prince Rui,

317
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,090
grant him the royal seal,

318
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,520
and bestow upon him the hereditary title
along with endless imperial favor.

319
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,640
Thus decreed!

320
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,840
I, Prince Rui Yan Chi,

321
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,070
thank Your Majesty for this great honor.

322
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,690
Your Highness,

323
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,240
with your succession and marriage,
you have double happiness.

324
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,600
This humble servant wishes you
and Princess Yongci

325
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,690
many children

326
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,090
and a long life together.

327
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:29,840
[Prince Rui's Mansion]

328
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,520
Chi!

329
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,220
Chi!

330
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,330
I've inherited a title too!

331
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,480
I'm now Prince Yi!

332
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,680
His Majesty isn't
just toying with me, is he?

333
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,360
His Majesty's words are law.

334
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,170
Do you think he jokes like you do?

335
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:40,970
Right, right.

336
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,690
Even if His Majesty were joking,

337
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:43,820
what he said counts.

338
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,860
This humble servant congratulates
Your Highness Prince Yi.

339
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,600
His Majesty has high hopes for you

340
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,450
and will soon send you to
the Ministry of Personnel for training.

341
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,250
You must make His Majesty proud.

342
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,420
This servant takes his leave.

343
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,880
I have to go work
at the Ministry of Personnel?

344
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,330
With my temperament,

345
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,640
how can I possibly sit still in an office?

346
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,050
Is His Majesty trying to drive me crazy?

347
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,120
Why are you looking so glum, Prince Yi?

348
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,810
Are you not satisfied
even after becoming a prince?

349
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,610
Do you want to reach for the moon?

350
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:37,520
You...

351
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,910
could tell it was me and not Chi...

352
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,170
just from my back?

353
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,430
Not just your back;

354
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,140
even if you were naked, I'd...

355
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,240
I'll go to congratulate Chi.

356
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:50,720
Ning!

357
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:53,450
I...

358
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,260
Would you take another look at me?

359
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,170
Look at you?

360
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,930
You want me to compliment you, don't you?

361
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:04,210
Your robe looks quite impressive,

362
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:07,140
and the color really brings out
your gallant spirit.

363
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,040
I mean...

364
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,500
you could consider me.

365
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,099
Before,

366
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,410
the capital was full of royal kin,

367
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,810
and I was the only outsider.

368
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,170
Now,

369
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,890
I've inherited a royal title,

370
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,819
and His Majesty values me greatly.

371
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:22,990
If you marry me,

372
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,369
I can't promise you a life of
extravagant luxury,

373
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:26,520
but you'll never go hungry

374
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,980
or face others' contempt.

375
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,450
In my heart,

376
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,820
there will never be another girl.

377
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,410
I know.

378
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,560
But

379
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,270
Yan's eyes still haven't recovered.

380
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,150
I know.

381
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,740
I can beg His Majesty.

382
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,130
No matter what compensation he asks for,

383
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,480
I'll do everything in my power
to give it to him.

384
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,270
Only you!

385
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,040
I cannot give you up.

386
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,510
What do you mean?

387
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,730
Pinky swear.

388
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:04,520
You...

389
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,370
don't need to beg His Majesty.

390
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:06,930
I...

391
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,370
I won't marry anyone else either.

392
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,390
A promise, then.

393
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:18,890
A promise.

394
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:21,970
Ning,

395
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,210
is that you?

396
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,000
She didn't come!

397
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,960
Never apart.

398
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,080
Never to be apart.

403

very good.

404
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,090
My Empress is

405
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,120
so capable indeed.

406
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,240
Go issue my decree.

407
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,480
The Empress Zhao

408
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,240
has been swayed by evil counsel

409
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,930
and has conducted herself improperly,

410
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,280
causing frequent chaos

411
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,890
within the imperial palace.

412
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,870
She is hereby temporarily stripped of
her authority over the harem

413
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,640
and shall be confined to Fengyi Palace,

414
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,950
receiving only basic provisions

415
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,260
like a commoner

416
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,440
to reflect on her actions.

[Fengyi Palace]

418
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,340
Wait.

419
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,350
Fight.

420
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,390
The Crown Prince has failed
in filial duties

421
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,130
and in restraining the Empress's actions.

422
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,170
He shall be confined
to the Eastern Palace until his wedding,

423
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,680
which shall be conducted
with minimal ceremony

424
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,090
as punishment.

425
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,640
[Chongming Hall]

426

Father said there's no need to
pay respects to him tomorrow.

427
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,170
I've caused you to suffer.

428
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,370
It's just a temporary storm.

429
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,450
It will pass soon.

430
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,450
I hope this storm

431
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,210
will subside soon.

432
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:11,930
Quickly! Someone, help!

Madam Qin is bleeding heavily!

434
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,110
Your Highness, Madam Qin has miscarried.

435
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,950
Qin Xiang is merely a concubine.

436
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,420
So what if she is miscarrying?

437
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,870
Why call for a royal physician?

438
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:23,660
Go back!

439
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,250
What's going on?

440
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,820
Your Highness, please save Madam Qin.

441
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,750
Madam Qin is having a miscarriage!

442
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,490
Your Highness,

443
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,220
that Qin woman should know better
at her age.

444
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,860
She insisted on playing by the water
while pregnant.

445
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,480
However, the moss by the bank is
too slippery,

446
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,560
and she fell.

447
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,510
I'm afraid the baby can't be saved.

448
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,550

449
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,800
scold me if you wish.

450
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,390
I told you...

451
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,590
not to play games in front of me.

452
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:07,760
Whether she lives or dies,

453
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,690
and when she dies,

454
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,090
is for me alone to decide!

better or not?

To be honest with you, Yan,

521
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,690
His Majesty hasn't been
in a good mood lately

522
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,040
and keeps making me study affairs
at the Ministry of Personnel.

523
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,080
Once His Majesty decides to
cut me some slack,

524
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,410
I'll definitely pay you a proper visit.

Working at the Ministry of Personnel

526
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,360
has always been

527
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,800
a necessary path for princes' training.

528
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,560
Li, many would envy

529
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,330
how much His Majesty values you.

530
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:39,970
Alright,

531
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,340
get back to your lessons.

532
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,210
And don't bring

533
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,840
these things to Yan.

534
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,630
They'll only slow his recovery.

535
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,260
Yeah,

536
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,350
that was pointless of me, okay?

537
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:50,350
I will definitely find

538
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,150
better medicinal herbs for  Yan.

588
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,760
Lately,

589
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,980
I've been feeling uneasy.

590
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,610
I can never quite figure out

591
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,670
what His Majesty truly intends to do.

592
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,080
You mean

593
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,970
that His Majesty has only
temporarily confined the Empress

594
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:17,830
and doesn't intend to depose her?

595
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,890
Deposing the Empress would shake
the foundations of the country.

596
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:23,150
It would require not only solid evidence

597
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,010
but also formal petitions
from court officials

598
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,060
before His Majesty could take such action.

599
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,070
Given His Majesty's harshness toward
the Crown Prince,

600
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:32,330
the Empress's confinement is likely
to be only temporary.

601
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,680
Deposing the Empress

602
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,590
is merely a matter of time.

603
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,420
Are you worried

604
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:44,350
that His Majesty wants to use
Prince Jin's case to depose the Empress?

605
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,480
I don't know either.

606
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:49,800
The Empress still refuses to say
why she wanted Song Xiwen dead.

607
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,720
If His Majesty meant to
depose her over that,

608
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,850
he could've simply reopened
Prince Jin's case.

609
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,560
So why would he have Prince Cheng
investigate Song Xiwen's death,

610
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,760
forcing him to turn against
his own brother, the Crown Prince?

611
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,560
And Yan Li.

612
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,760
Why would His Majesty

613
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,070
assign him to the Ministry of Personnel,

614
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,620
such a prominent position?

615
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,650
With His Majesty's discernment,

616
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:10,110
he must know
that Yan Li is neither suited for

617
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:12,620
nor willing to undertake this position.

618
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,450
Could it be

619
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,850
that His Majesty plans to
make Prince Cheng the new Crown Prince,

620
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,510
using Yan Li to toughen him up?

621
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:24,430
I keep feeling the truth is within reach,

622
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,610
yet I can't grasp it.

623
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,650
If you can't figure it out,
don't think about it for now.

624
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,560
The Empress Dowager once warned me

625
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,820
that we should stay far from that throne.

626
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:40,610
She must have

627
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,490
foreseen the chaos that would ensue.

628
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,520
Having you inherit your title early

629
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,360
was her way of giving us a shield.

630
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,040
Indeed.

631
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,520
Given His Majesty's deep wariness of
the Shuoxi Army,

632
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,480
I doubt I'd have inherited
the title so quickly

633
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,940
if the Empress Dowager hadn't spoken
for me.

634
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,930
But if Yan Qi ascends to the throne,

635
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:01,780
your princely title

636
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,810
may not be enough to protect us.

637
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:10,980
Don't worry.

638
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,190
He won't get the chance.

639
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:16,530
Let's go to sleep now.

640
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,920
We need to conserve our strength

641
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,179
to deal with those beasts that lie ahead.

642
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,560
It was wrong of Mother
to secretly release

643
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,469
Song Xiwen.

644
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,409
But Mother has always been upright
in conduct.

645
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:32,400
She would never take someone's life.

646
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,929
There must be someone
plotting behind this.

647
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:35,449
Father, I beg you
to investigate thoroughly.

648
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:37,710
Whether there's a conspirator or not...

649
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:39,690
see for yourself!

650
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,639
No.

651
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,750
Mother would never lie to me.

652
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,940
Mother couldn't possibly do
such a thing, Father!

653
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,190
The evidence before us is irrefutable,

654
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,640
yet you remain so stubbornly blind.

655
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,250
Tell me,

656
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,360
during your confinement,

657
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,440
have you taken a single moment
to reflect upon yourself?

658
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:06,430
I

659
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,190
have been negligent and complacent,

660
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,250
failing to live up to your teachings.

661
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,450
But as the head of the harem,

662
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:14,330
Mother truly has no reason

663
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:16,190
to kill a mere guard of Prince Jin.

664
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,560
Wang Han, a palace guard, dared to flee.

665
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,600
How can
such an untrustworthy person's testimony

666
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,370
be trusted, Father?

667
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,160
Then, by your logic,

668
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,520
I've indulged

669
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:32,120
this treacherous person in
slandering my Empress?

670
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,640
In your eyes,

671
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,370
am I

672
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,330
just a muddle-headed ruler

673
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:38,610
who can be easily manipulated by others?

674
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,680
I never dared to think that.

675
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,770
I spoke rashly.

676
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,760
Please forgive me, Father.

677
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,550
Father.

678
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,270
Father, please calm your anger.

679
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,640
The Empress has committed
such a serious crime.

680
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,080
It's understandable
that Che loses his composure

681
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,340
out of concern for her.

682
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,120
But

683
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:58,040
the witness and his testimony
are both here.

684
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,770
Che, you should consider this:

685
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,600
before Kang Bowen
threw himself into the well,

686
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,330
he was summoned by the Empress.

687
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:06,810
If she hadn't pressured him,

688
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,410
why would he have given up his position
as the head of the Harem Attendants Bureau

689
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,820
and taken his own life for no reason?

690
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,040
Shut up!

691
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,440
Yan Qi,

692
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,610
you must be the one scheming behind this!

693
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:17,340
How dare you!

694
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,850
I'm still alive,

695
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,600
yet you dare to act so presumptuously.

696
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,630
If you were to

697
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,850
truly sit on this throne one day,

698
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,120
would your brothers have
any chance of surviving?

699
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,540
I may be dull in wit,

700
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,350
but I have never coveted power.

701
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:40,600
My inappropriate behavior
in front of Father today

702
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,120
was only because I couldn't bear to see
Mother being framed by villains.

703
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:44,600
I'm

704
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,700
willing to accept punishment.

705
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,510
I only beg you, Father,

706
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,020
not to listen to slanderous words

707
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,860
and to restore Mother's innocence soon!

708
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,890
You insolent brat!

709
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,370
I think you've

710
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,850
long forgotten

711
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,120
what loyalty means.

712
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:04,300
Draft the edict:

713
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:06,780
the Crown Prince Yan Che

714
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,290
shows favoritism in his actions,

715
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:10,020
is willful and temperamental,

716
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,200
disrespects my words,

717
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,080
and behaves improperly
in the royal presence.

718
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,140
If such a disloyal and unfilial person
were to be ruler,

719
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:18,250
what would become of my country?

720
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:19,750
From this day forward,

721
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,320
Yan Che is stripped of

722
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,090
his position as Crown Prince

723
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:25,350
and confined to the Imperial Clan Court.

724
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:32,980
Thank you...

725
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,830
for your mercy, Father.

726
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,370
Move aside.

727
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,170
I need to see the Empress.

728
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:57,680
Your Highness,

729
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,760
without His Majesty's decree,

730
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,490
no one may enter Fengyi Palace.

731
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:02,560
Fine, I won't enter.

732
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,640
But surely, I can say a few words

733
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,400
through the door, right?

734
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:10,000
How pitiful.

735
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,170
You're confined here

736
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,560
and don't even know

737
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,090
that your own son has been stripped of
his title as Crown Prince.

738
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,370
I really feel sorry for you.

739
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,320
What nonsense are you spouting?

740
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,520
Che is the only son of His Majesty and me.

741
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:29,340
No one can challenge his position
as Crown Prince!

742
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:31,500
Others may not be able to challenge it,

743
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,200
but if His Majesty wants to depose him,

744
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,810
a single imperial edict would suffice.

745
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,010
Poor Crown Prince...

746
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,860
Now I should address him

747
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,970
as the "Second Prince."

748
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:42,480
Shut up!

749
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,640
Poor Second Prince,

750
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,370
from now on, he can only live in hardship
at the Imperial Clan Court.

751
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,040
And you, you probably won't hold on to

752
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,970
your position as Empress for long.

753
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:54,070
You and your son may never see
each other again.

754
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,700
Please take care of yourself

755
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,810
and don't be too heartbroken.

756
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,450
Don't be too heartbroken!

757
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,120
You madwoman! Come back!

758
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:13,850
Come back!

759
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:17,930
Unlock this door! Unlock this door!

760
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,330
I need to see His Majesty!

761
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:22,350
Unlock this door!
I need to see His Majesty!

762
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,240
I need to see the Empress Dowager!

763
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,560
Unlock this door!

764
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,480
Unlock this door!

765
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,040
Mother!

766
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,730
Greetings, Mother.

767
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,810
Zhaoyu,

768
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:33,490
why are you here?

769
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,480
Che hasn't been deposed, right?

770
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,450
Right?

771
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:41,100
Thanks to His Majesty's mercy,

772
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,520
I was granted special permission

773
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,450
to bid farewell to you

774
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,680
before being sent to
the Imperial Clan Court.

775
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:55,890
Mother.

776
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:58,620
He really made his move.

777
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,310
It happened so suddenly.

778
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,370
We cannot just sit and wait for death.

779
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:06,210
Mother, do you have any good ideas for
saving the Crown Prince from this crisis?

780
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:07,330
We don't have much time.

781
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,890
Mother, please think of something quickly

782
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,340
so that I can ask my father

783
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,330
to act for us.

784
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,730
Good child.

785
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:17,040
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

786
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,760
As long as the Empress Dowager is
still alive,

787
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,510
His Majesty won't dare to take
further action against Che for now.

788
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,640
But Prince Cheng

789
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:26,130
will certainly seize this opportunity
to destroy us completely.

790
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,660
The most important thing now is

791
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,290
to get Che out of
the Imperial Clan Court immediately.

792
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:31,730
As long as he's alive,

793
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:34,390
there will always be hope.

794
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,000
Understood.

795
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:44,810
Congratulations, Your Highness!

796
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:45,740
How satisfying.

797
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,370
Father has finally confined
that useless fool.

798
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:49,330
Thank heavens,

799
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:51,330
Master, your time has finally come.

800
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:53,930
Is that woman behaving herself today?

801
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:55,090
Her Highness

802
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,360
went to the palace
to pay her respects to Noble Consort Su.

803
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,000
It's this late,
and she still hasn't come back.

804
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,850
Once I become the Crown Prince,

805
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,330
I'll get rid of her sooner or later.

806
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,750
Don't you want to

807
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:11,000
give me an explanation about Che?

808
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,000
I understand why you're upset, Mother.

809
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,600
Your deep care for your grandchildren

810
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,810
is their blessing.

811
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,220
But Che is truly lacking in the talent

812
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:27,330
required to ascend the throne.

813
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:29,000
A weak ruler with strong ministers

814
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,290
will only plunge the court into chaos.

815
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,500
The longer this is delayed,

816
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,560
the harder it will be
to control the situation.

817
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,520
I know

818
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,680
all of this.

819
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,330
But throughout history,

820
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:46,060
how many deposed crown princes

821
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:48,250
have met a good end?

822
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,840
Che is naturally carefree

823
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,080
and has absolutely no desire for power.

824
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,120
I only ask Your Majesty to show mercy

825
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,430
and exile him far away.

826
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,940
If he remains confined
within the Imperial Clan Court,

827
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,750
I'm afraid his fate is sealed.

828
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,330
I...

829
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,700
will handle this matter carefully.

830
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,820
I still have some memorials
to review today,

831
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:21,210
so I won't be joining you for the meal.

832
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,810
Mother, please...

833
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:26,060
rest and take care of yourself.

834
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:29,680
Huai.

835
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,180
The Empress has been confined to
Fengyi Palace,

836
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,760
while Noble Consort Su is not yet familiar

837
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,970
with managing the harem affairs.

838
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,330
From today on,

839
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:43,680
let me take charge of

840
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,120
harem matters.

841
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:47,640
Then,

842
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,550
Mother, please

843
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,970
don't worry about

844
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:52,890
the state affairs either.

845
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,220
That's how it should be.

846
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,290
Thank you, Mother.

847
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,740
Just wait a little longer.

848
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:39,600
Soon,

849
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,490
the truth will come to light.
