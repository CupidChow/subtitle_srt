Come.

394
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,860
Okay, it was a colleague.

and the murder was her male colleague.]

396

408
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,840
I think this must be pretty bizarre.

409
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,070
Does that man have mental issues?

410
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,150
[Sixth question:

411
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,640

is a male colleague with a sane mind.]

415
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:22,930
It's too sour.

[So sour even her sixth sense is cleared]

Is it a normal reason

419

or something ridiculous?

420
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,680
A very normal reason.

[Clues: She was murdered by a male colleague
with a sane mind, and there was nothing strange.]

422
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,950
A very normal reason?

423
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,480
Did he kill her

424
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,260
simply because she was...

425
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:40,870
wearing high heels?

426
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,470
Yes.

427
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:42,790
[A step closer to the truth:
Her high heels are a direct reason]

428
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,200
This woman wore high heels

429
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,200
which made her taller than him,

430
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,480
so he killed her.

431
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,700
Half right.

432
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,010
[One step closer to the truth.
It's about height.]

433
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,640
I understand.

434
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,800
This is my guess.

435
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,440
The guy might have killed her by accident.

436
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,720
He probably intended to kill
someone taller,

437
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,080
but because that woman was
wearing high heels,

438
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,200
so he ended up killing her instead.

439
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
That's possible.

440
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,800
Was it accidental?

441
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,130
[Ninth question: Was it manslaughter?]

442
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,240
Yes.

443

See?

444
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,570
Okay, one last question.

445

[No.7: You must answer the soup base thoroughly.]

446
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,560
It's accidental.

447
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,800
So it might because her heels

448
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,440
made her appear taller.

449
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,670
Right, they were colleagues,

450
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:15,730
she was murdered,

451
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,200
and it was by a man.

452
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,370
It might have been accidental.

453
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,540
Could it be that...

454
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,400
Could it be that

455
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,720
this man was a magician,

456
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,520
and then he...

457
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,280
And then this woman

458
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,560
suddenly wore high heels that day,

459
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,520
so her height was different,

460
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,760
and therefore all the mechanisms

461
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,960
didn't work as planned.

462
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,760

00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,230
These are our new dancers.

564
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,490
I am Chen Hongsheng.

565
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,350
Welcome, all you talented young people.

566
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:21,830
Tonight, I'm suffering from
the loss of my family heirloom.

567
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:26,250
The thief is among us here.

568
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,100
The thief's hand gestures
are very distinctive.

569
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,120
[That gesture looks familiar]

570
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,040
It's him!

571
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,180
Your hand gesture.

572
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,870
[Becomes even more suspicious]

573
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:42,430
That night, my security guard Zhao Si

574
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,530
was knocked unconscious
with a blunt object.

575
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:50,780
Tonight, I'm just trying to
recreate the case.

576
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,530
Let's see who looks most suspicious.

577
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:00,370
[I'm wronged]

578
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,200
Sir, please stop making that gesture.

579
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,650
It has to be Chengen.

580
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:01,910
I understand now.

581
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,580
[Is the thief's special hand gestures
hinting at Yu Chengen?]

582
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,000
