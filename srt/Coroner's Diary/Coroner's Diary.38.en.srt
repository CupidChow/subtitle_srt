[Coroner's Diary]

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,930
[Episode 38]

3
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:37,680
Attack!

4
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,789
Attack!

5
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:00,530
It's me,

6
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,680
Yan Ze,

7
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,510
an orphan whose parents
both died because of you.

8
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,720
How did you know?

9
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,320
It must be you wretched lackey.

10
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:14,670
I...

11
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,340
I trusted and valued you so deeply,

12
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,680
yet you dared to collude with traitors

13
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,829
and betray me!

14
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,040
As they say,

15
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,670
evil deeds will eventually
lead to self-destruction.

16
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,390
Yuan Qing,

17
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,850
serve tea to the sinner.

18
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,110
Yuan Qing...

19
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,450
Your Majesty, don't worry.

20
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,610
I've added the same amount of
Dream Butterfly Poison to this tea

21
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,329
as was given to the late Princess Xin.

22
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,480
Your Majesty will have plenty of time
to savor

23
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,600
and watch,

24
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:56,790
to see clearly
how the late Princess Xin died!

25
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,600
The Dream Butterfly Poison you found
back then was made from the wing powder

26
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,880
of the Five-colored Butterfly
from the Southern Frontier.

27
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,280
This poison is colorless and odorless,

28
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,110
only detectable after it takes effect.

29
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,280
My poor mother.

30
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,790
She saved your life,

31
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,990
yet became the first person you used
to test poison.

32
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,720
Poor me. I tested the water temperature
for my dying mother,

33
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,180
yet got my eyesight ruined
with just one sip!

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,130
My Father followed my mother in death,

35
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,040
surely also your doing.

36
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,510
This is

37
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,829
as heartless as it gets.

38
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:37,230
Don't you

39
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,440
celebrate too soon.

40
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:40,870
I

41
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:45,390
still have two palace guard divisions
standing by on full alert,

42
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,760
as well as the Huaiyang Army,

43
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,410
which will soon

44
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,040
enter the capital to protect me.

45
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,079
Has Your Majesty forgotten?

46
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,070
The one who delivered your verbal orders
to the Palace Guard Division

47
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,280
was me.

48
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,920
You won't be seeing the Huaiyang Army.

49
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,550
You...

50
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,280
You...

51
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,200
You...

52
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,230
You bastard!

53
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,600
I'll kill you!

54
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,550
Traitor Yan Han,

55
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,140
such an end for you is only proper,

56
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,279
showing that justice prevails!

57
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,839
Yuan Qing!

58
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,650
Read the Self-reproach Edict.

59
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:36,670
Yan?

60
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,440
-Li.
-What are you doing?

61
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,120
Why are you here?

62
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,440
You've come at the perfect time.

63
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,500
A son pays for his father's debts—

64
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,840
that is the eternal way of heaven.

65
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,550
You...

66
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,600
Li.

67
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,159
Li, leave now!

68
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:55,920
They...

69
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,640
They're all rebels!

70
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,840
Hurry, Li.

71
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,190
Li!

72
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,040
Li!

73
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,150
Yan Ze!

74
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,400
Yan Ze,

75
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,250
what are you doing?

76
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,990
Li! Li!

77
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,830
Yan Ze, you've gone crazy!

78
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,960
What exactly are you trying to do?

79
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,640
Yan Li.

80
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,350
Listen carefully to
that Self-reproach Edict

81
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,440
and see the true colors of
this emperor before you.

82
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,520
Yuan Qing!

83
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,430
Yuan Qing!

84
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,160
By Heaven's mandate, I issue
this edict of self-reproach to the world.

85
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,640
I,

86
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,920
Yan Han, the second legitimate son
of the late Emperor,

87
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,480
incited Fu Chengye to rebel,

88
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,750
attempting to seize the throne,

89
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,840
-pretended to surrender
-Yuan Qing!

90
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,080
to lure my twin brother
Yan Huai to Storm Ridge

91
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,430
for a private meeting,

92
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,159
where I murdered him

93
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,870
and destroyed all evidence, after which

94
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,990
-I took the throne in my brother's name.
-What wrong did I do? I'm innocent!

95
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,159
-From then on, the order was overturned,
-I'm the chosen one!

96
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:55,020
the sun and moon darkened,
and all conscience lost.

97
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,400
End of the decree.

98
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,340
How dare you, a usurper of the throne,

99
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,990
claim you're the chosen one?

100
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,690
These are all just ravings

101
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,150
and nonsense.

102
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,890
Whether it's nonsense or not,

103
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,040
he himself knows best.

104
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,980
Isn't that right,

105
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,920
Prince Yi?

106
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,190
You...

107
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,600
You...

108
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,020
Prince Yi?

109
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,290
You heard it right.

110
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,460
He is your biological father,

111
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,350
Prince Yi, Yan Han.

112
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,340
My dear son, Li.

113
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,750
My dear son, Li!

114
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:46,760
Li.

115
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,280
Father...

116
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,110
Li.

117
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,200
Li.

118
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,040
Impossible.

119
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,210
This is impossible.

120
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,610
Otherwise, why do you think he allowed

121
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:02,170
Prince Cheng and the Crown Prince
to turn against each other,

122
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,010
yet treated you better than his own sons?

123
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,400
So what if I am Yan Han?

124
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,290
I

125
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,080
am also the Empress Dowager's
biological son,

126
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,960
still of the royal bloodline.

127
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,310
Just because

128
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,110
I was a twin,

129
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,600
the Yan family

130
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,600
cast me aside like worn-out shoes!

131
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,280
Who has ever sought justice for me?

132
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,320
Heaven's justice is clear.

133
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,600
What the Yan family

134
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,750
owed me

135
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,210
should naturally be repaid
with the throne!

136
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,480
I have no shame before Heaven and Earth,

137
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,890
nor before my parents!

138
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,930
What about me and my mother?

139
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,409
Do you also feel no guilt toward us?

140
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,480
Li.

141
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,450
Why don't you ask your biological father

142
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,140
how Chi's mother died,

143
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:22,910
how Consort Jin

144
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,520
met her end,

145
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,720
and what caused

146
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,200
Prince Jin and Shen Yi's deaths?

147
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:36,789
No way...

148
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,240
Li.

149
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,840
Everything I've done

150
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,710
is for you.

151
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,830
I didn't want you to suffer

152
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,250
a life of hardships like I did!

153
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:52,920
Li.

154
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,280
I did it all for you,

155
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,070
clearing away all obstacles,

156
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,090
just so you could ascend to the throne!

157
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,110
No.

158
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,280
This can't be true.

159
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,450
Li!

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,590
No!

161
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,340
This can't be true!

162
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,710
Yan Li.

163
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,640
My dear Li!

164
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,250
You wretched lackey!

165
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,720
You... You...

166
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,140
I'll kill you!

167
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,160
Yan Han.

168
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,950
Even your own son,

169
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,430
whom you have such high hopes for,
doesn't believe your lies.

170
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,160
When you abandoned your wife and child
back then,

171
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,360
did you ever think it would come to this?

172
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,040
You...

173
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,000
Yan Ze.

174
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,470
Yan Ze.

175
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,070
Yan Ze!

176
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,640
Yan Ze!

177
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,160
Li, wake up!

178
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,300
Li, wake up!

179
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,450
Li, wake up!

180
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,430
To use your son's blood

181
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,840
to complete this unrighteous flower
and send you to your death—

182
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,830
I suppose it can be considered

183
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,290
me granting a final favor
to you and your son.

184
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,470
Body sacrifice,

185
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,470
heavens tremble,

186
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,990
with flying dragons' protection,

187
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,720
immortal and indestructible!

188
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,410
Spare...

189
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,550
Spare Li.

190
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,620
I will immediately draft a decree

191
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,240
to

192
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,790
pass the throne to you.

193
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,360
Yuan Qing,

194
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,190
tell me,

195
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,920
should I take the throne?

196
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,400
Leader, your virtue shines bright

197
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,640
and your noble spirit reaches far.

198
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,370
You are the heaven-ordained sovereign
of the...

199
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,830
You lied to me...

200
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,590
You're all...

201
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,390
The same...

202
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,190
You're right.

203
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,220
Sooner or later, you'll be

204
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,470
discarded like a tool
that's served its purpose.

205
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,200
I only want the throne

206
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,080
so that everyone who enabled Yan Han

207
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,160
will pay for my parents' deaths.

208
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,280
You've helped me achieve my goal.

209
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,900
Rest in peace now.

210
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,670
How cruel is fate,

211
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,530
so many die with regrets.

212
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,560
May he in his next life

213
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,160
never again believe in

214
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,960
carrying out heaven's justice.

215
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,960
Let's go!

216
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,190
Bai Feng!

217
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,220
Hurry up and go!

218
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,240
Let's go!

219
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,520
The ringleader of
the Heavenly Way Society,

220
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,320
Yuan Qing, has been eliminated.

221
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,400
After today,

222
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:26,640
no one will know about my connection
to the Heavenly Way Society.

223
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,370
People will only remember that

224
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,240
you died at the hands of  Yuan Qing,
the traitor from the Heavenly Way Society,

225
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,240
and that Yuan Qing

226
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,260
and your precious son killed each other.

227
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,790
Except for your crimes
that will be made public,

228
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,960
all the truth

229
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,400
will vanish into thin air.

230
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,240
Li!

231
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,000
Are you alright?

232
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,050
Are you alright?

233
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,480
Are you alright?

234
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,080
I never thought

235
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,920
that I, Yan Li, would end up

236
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,640
dying alongside you.

237
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,240
I wonder if I'll ever

238
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,190
have a chance to see Ning again.

239
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,160
If she sees me like this,

240
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,640
she'll surely be disgusted.

241
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,380
I'm here with you, Li.

242
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,310
Good.

243
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,280
I'll let you fully experience

244
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,430
what it feels like to watch
your loved ones die right before your eyes

245
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,190
and be powerless to save them—

246
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,700
that heart-wrenching, gut-twisting pain.

247
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,880
Li!

248
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,000
Wan.

249
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,070
How is

250
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,270
Li?

251
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,510
I can save him.

252
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,990
You liar! Murderer!

253
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,270
Young Marshal,
hurry and go protect His Majesty!

254
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,400
Leave this to us!

255
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:49,840
Master.

256
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,060
How is Sui?

257
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:51,990
He's all right,

258
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,120
probably just choked a bit.

259
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,880
Someone set a fire inside.

260
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,000
I've already put it out.

261
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,790
Princess Wan and Yongning
are already in the bedchamber.

262
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,750
Take good care of Sui.

263
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,470
I'll go save Princess Wan.

264
00:17:59,470 --> 00:17:59,920
Yes.

265
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:22,870
Yan Li!

266
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,120
Chi.

267
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,840
He's not the Cousin Yan we knew anymore.

268
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,900
He wants to kill us!

269
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,800
Chi.

270
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:35,760
My father...

271
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,430
He killed His Majesty

272
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,320
and your mother.

273
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:40,840
And also...

274
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,880
For these sins,

275
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,830
let me pay with my life.

276
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,550
You and he are different people.

277
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,980
You must live on.

278
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:53,640
Master!

279
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,190
The rebels are retreating.

280
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,590
Take them all out of here.

281
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,140
-Yes!
-Be careful.

282
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,270
Here.

283
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,710
Don't worry about me.

284
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,060
Take Li away.

285
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,430
Take Li away first.

286
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:31,640
Here.

287
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,080
Chi.

288
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,710
Yan Han killed our parents.

289
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,560
Why are you trying to save him?

290
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,270
His crimes

291
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,350
will be judged by the law.

292
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,270
We cannot watch someone die
without helping.

293
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,080
The law?

294
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,230
Yan Han's crimes

295
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,040
are too numerous to list,

296
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,090
utterly devoid of conscience.

297
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,900
How can mere laws fully punish such evil?

298
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:17,950
Yuan Qing's body

299
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,430
is hardly cold,

300
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,120
yet you...

301
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,270
You're already

302
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,230
putting on

303
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,260
this righteous act

304
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,670
to cover up your crimes.

305
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,520
What a selfish and cold-hearted

306
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,460
hypocrite.

307
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,830
So it really was all carefully calculated.

308
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,320
Yan Ze

309
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:51,190
used the pretext of divine justice

310
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,230
to manipulate people.

311
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,950
But in fact, he used
the Heavenly Way Society

312
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,320
to cultivate power,

313
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,400
in order to plot for the imperial throne

314
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,120
and avenge

315
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,320
his personal grudge.

316
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:09,880
I...

317
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,730
Though I may have gained my throne
through improper means,

318
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:15,550
serving as

319
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,670
the ruler for years,

320
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:18,920
I've been

321
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:25,030
a diligent and benevolent emperor.

322
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,490
Diligent and benevolent?

323
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,890
Everything you've done

324
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:29,890
was to prove

325
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:32,710
that the Empress Dowager
was wrong to have abandoned you.

326
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:34,510
To satisfy your selfish ambition

327
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,280
to rule the world,

328
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,030
you even abandoned your wife and children,

329
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,830
betrayed your brother-in-law,

330
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,000
and plotted against
your own blood relatives.

331
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:43,990
You

332
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,730
are truly

333
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,470
the most vicious and cruel villain
in this world!

334
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:48,990
You...

335
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,920
-You both, shut up!
-How dare you...

336
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,160
What hypocrite,

337
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,750
what vicious villain,

338
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,320
you're birds of a feather.

339
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,500
No matter what reasons you have,

340
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,600
you're both nothing but murderers
with blood on your hands!

341
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,670
Those I killed

342
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,030
were all guilty!

343
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,990
They deserved to die.

344
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,200
I've told you,

345
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:16,150
their crimes should be judged by the law.

346
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,350
You're in no position to judge them.

347
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,110
Don't think you can use this

348
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,420
as an excuse to escape your guilt.

349
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,470
Think about your father.

350
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,160
Think about our mothers.

351
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:58,330
Are you still going to save
a sinner like Yan Han

352
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,510
and aid the wicked?

353
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,640
Yan Han must die!

354
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,790
I'll kill you...

355
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,400
Why

356
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,190
did you kill my mother...

357
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,120
You...

358
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,360
Who are you?

359
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,430
Who are you?

360
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,360
Don't come any closer.

361
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,120
Go away.

362
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,190
Go away!

363
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,660
Stay back!

364
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:21,920
You...

365
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,980
Don't come near me!

366
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:25,710
Stop pretending.

367
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,110
Come with me to Zichen Hall now

368
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,400
and expose that person's true colors.

369
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,070
I don't know what you're talking about.

370
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:32,510
I...

371
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,970
Stop playing dumb with me.

372
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,920
You think I've tolerated you
all these years

373
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,300
because I'm afraid of you?

374
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,120
I simply didn't bother

375
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,120
to make an enemy of a wretch like you.

376
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,670
That bastard of yours

377
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,800
caused my Che to die tragically.

378
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:57,120
And what fate did he meet in the end?

379
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,430
When you sought favor every day

380
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,800
and surrendered yourself to that traitor,

381
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,110
did you ever think you’d end up like this?

382
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,160
What's wrong with me
surrendering to the traitor?

383
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,970
Don't you want the same?

384
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,840
Acting all proper and dignified.

385
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:21,190
If he hadn't been so guarded around you,

386
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,400
you would have dragged him
to bed long ago.

387
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,950
Do you think all women in the world

388
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,710
are as debased as you?

389
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,640
Ever since discovering that impostor
wasn't His Majesty,

390
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,070
I've been making plans,

391
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,660
just to make sure His Majesty's bloodline

392
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,860
inherits the throne.

393
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,900
And what about you?

394
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,760
All you care about
is your own power and wealth.

395
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,080
Your own son died by his hand,

396
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:47,230
yet you still pretended to be crazy
and fooled around just to survive.

397
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,960
How could there be a Mother like you
in this world?

398
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,270
I'm not to blame for Qi's death,

399
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,960
so why should I follow him to death?

400
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,290
What's wrong with me wanting to survive?

401
00:26:58,990 --> 00:26:59,920
All these years,

402
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:03,130
he's treated me like I'm invisible,

403
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,640
lying beside me

404
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,720
without even removing his undergarments.

405
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,920
For Qi's sake,

406
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:15,280
I've lain beside an impostor,

407
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:18,350
living as a widow for over a decade.

408
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,510
What more do you want from me?

409
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:28,670
To preserve His Majesty's bloodline?

410
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,990
You raised your son
to be weak and incompetent,

411
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,720
just so he could be your puppet,

412
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,160
allowing you to be
the regent empress dowager.

413
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,670
Everything you've done
has been for yourself!

414
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:40,880
Shut your mouth!

415
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,710
The Empress is trying to kill me!

416
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,510
The Empress is trying to kill me!

417
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,840
Remember this day.

418
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,930
I'll finish you
on behalf of the late Emperor!

419
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,160
If I'm to die,

420
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,400
you won't live either!

421
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,950
I thought

422
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,360
I met a benefactor

423
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,080
when my career was over.

424
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,230
Who knew it would still
all be for nothing?

425
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,080
What a pity that I,

426
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,380
a man of such great talent,

427
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,940
have no place in this imperial court.

428
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,030
I'm leaving.

429
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:34,960
Stop right there!

430
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,730
Mr. Li.

431
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,250
Where are you going?

432
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,120
My defeat today

433
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,530
is due to the injustice of fate,

434
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:52,460
allowing a mediocre person like you
to succeed at every turn,

435
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,290
while I placed my trust
in the wrong person.

436
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,090
You

437
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,050
are not worthy to mock me!

438
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:00,190
You colluded with rebels
and betrayed your mentor,

439
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:02,320
yet you dare claim
our Prefect Zheng succeeds at every turn?

440
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,180
Our Prefect Zheng serves
with absolute integrity.

441
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,600
He didn't even have the money
to save his wife.

442
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,310
It was us bailiffs who chipped in.

443
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,370
I may not be as good an official as you,

444
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:12,600
but as a person, you're beneath me.

445
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,120
Take him away!

446
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,400
-Yes!
-Yes!

447
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,030
Please...

448
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,130
I beg you...

449
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,710
Don't

450
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,340
harm Li.

451
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,310
Li is my brother,

452
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,660
my own flesh and blood.

453
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,450
I shouldn't have...

454
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,770
I shouldn't have

455
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,990
let Yan Qi

456
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,880
kill your father.

457
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,270
I regret it,

458
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,510
but it's too late.

459
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,080
What about the late Emperor,

460
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,810
Consort Jin,

461
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:31,990
Prince Jin,

462
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,710
and Lord Shen's deaths?

463
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,800
Do you regret those too?

464
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,270
I...

465
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:39,920
If you hadn't been blinded
by imperial power,

466
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,780
none of this would have happened.

467
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,920
My parents would still be alive.

468
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,270
Your parents?

469
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,430
You are...

470
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,320
My father

471
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,080
is Shen Yi,
the Minister of Judicial Review.

472
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,460
I am Shen Yi's daughter,

473
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:00,810
Shen Wan.

474
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,630
My father and Prince Jin
concealed the weapon

475
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,600
to cover up your murder of Consort Jin,

476
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,710
to prevent it from becoming public

477
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,800
and avoid causing turmoil in the court.

478
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,660
Yet you wrongfully killed a loyal official
who saw you as a wise ruler.

479
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,560
It was my fault.

480
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,870
My fault.

481
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,120
I was wrong...

482
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,640
One wrong step

483
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:52,800
leads

484
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,470
to many more.

485
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,510
I...

486
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,270
I've...

487
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,380
I've...

488
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:07,750
I've

489
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,300
wronged...

Ever since he returned to the palace,

00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,679
I knew he wasn't Huai.

506
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,240
But what difference does it make?

507
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,950
I'm not only a mother,

508
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,140
but also the Empress Dowager
of our country.

509
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,750
He's diligent and disciplined,

510
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,550
with decisive authority.

511
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,110
He's more suitable

512
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,590
to be emperor than Huai.

513
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,430
I had thought

514
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,080
if the court could truly be well-governed,

515
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,130
then passing the throne to Che

516
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,900
would be returning to
the rightful succession.

517
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,160
Who would have known

518
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,720
that one wrong step

519
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,300
would lead to mistake after mistake?

520
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,320
Grandmother, you've done nothing wrong.

521
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,520
It's the imperial rules that are wrong.

522
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,720
My mistake was with Han.

523
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:36,810
First mistake,

524
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,550
I shouldn't have been so soft-hearted

525
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,770
and spared his life.

526
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:40,960
Second mistake,

527
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:43,170
after he returned to the palace,

528
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,630
I shouldn't have deceived myself.

529
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,990
I was wrong from the very beginning.

530
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,360
Grandmother, please don't blame yourself.

531
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,240
If you hadn't made these two mistakes,

532
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,170
Yan Li and Sui wouldn't be here now.

533
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,480
Letting Sui

534
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,760
inherit the throne

535
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,830
is also for the sake of the empire.

536
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,720
You two won't

537
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,040
resent me

538
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,380
for making such a decision, will you?

539
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,590
Li and I never desired that position.

540
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,590
We have no resentment at all.

541
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,650
In fact, it's exactly what we wanted.

542
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,470
All I want is Wan as my wife,

543
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,170
and Shuoxi as my domain.

544
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,180
I ask for nothing else.

545
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,150
Good.

546
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,690
Help Sui for a few more years.

547
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:36,150
I'll surely fulfill your wishes.

548
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:58,980
Have a seat.

549
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,620
How is the Empress Dowager doing?

550
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,520
Grandmother still grieves,

551
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,760
but her depression has lifted.

552
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,890
She will get better.

553
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,200
That's good.

554
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,360
With you two by her side,

555
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:18,240
I can return to Jingzhou
with peace of mind.

556
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,430
Great Aunt, why are you
in such a hurry to leave?

557
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:23,560
Wan and I haven't had the chance
to properly care for you.

558
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,550
You don't need to care for me.

559
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,990
Just treat Wan well.

560
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,570
That's what matters most.

561
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,410
Grandma.

562
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,590
Thank you.

563
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,920
