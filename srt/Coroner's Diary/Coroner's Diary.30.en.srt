[Episode 30]

3
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,979
Your Highness.

4
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,560
Thank you.

5
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,710
Where is His Highness?

6
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,390
He hasn't recovered from his cold

7
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,520
and sent me to inspect the scene first.

[Prince Jin's Mansion]

9
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,850
Yan Chi,

10
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,199
this day has finally come.

11
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,820
Open the gate.

12
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,780
No, Your Highness.

13
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,630
This concerns the late Prince Jin.

14
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,550
You need written approvals
from both the Supreme Court

15
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,680
and the Ministry of Justice
before you can open the gate.

16
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:23,490
Your Highness, please don't.

17
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,500
This is the mansion
of a convicted traitor.

18
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,160
Breaking the seals without permission

19
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,350
is tantamount
to challenging the imperial authority.

20
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,770
His Majesty granted me the authority
to serve as a Ministry of Justice officer.

21
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,230
His Highness ordered me
to examine the body.

22
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,790
How am I acting without permission?

23
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,070
If His Majesty is displeased,

24
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,180
I'll take full responsibility myself.

25
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,560
Prefect Zheng, Constable Zhan,

26
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,050
just proceed as usual.

27
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,250
-Yes.
-Yes.

28
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,110
Where is the thief?

29
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,900
Bring him over.

30
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:14,680
Yes!

31
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:16,770
Move!

32
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,750
Tell Her Highness honestly

33
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,210
what happened last night.

34
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,579
I heard at the gambling house

35
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,370
that when Prince Jin's Mansion

36
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,870
was sealed,

37
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,800
the servants buried many treasures
in the backyard.

38
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,579
So I thought

39
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,910
I'd sneak in at night and try my luck.

40
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,380
The soil here

41
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,130
looked fresher than the rest,

42
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,190
so I...

43
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,280
Greetings, Minister Li, Prefect Zheng.

44
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,840
I tore off the seals.

45
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,630
Minister Li, if you want to punish me,

46
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,600
I'll go with you to the Supreme Court.

47
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,730
You misunderstand.

48
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,820
I'm here

49
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,650
because of the skeleton
that suddenly turned up too.

50
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,900
As for the seals,

51
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,970
even if you hadn't removed them,

52
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,720
I'd have

53
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,150
removed them myself.

54
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,190
When

55
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,040
Prince Jin's Mansion was confiscated,

56
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,230
I had it thoroughly searched.

57
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,510
There was no chance
a body could've been hidden here.

58
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,480
Yet a year later,

59
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,210
a skeleton suddenly appeared.

60
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,640
I'll get to the bottom of this.

61
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,060
But I don't like people interfering
with my work,

62
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,680
and I'm not used to working with others,

63
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,480
not even with the Supreme Court.

64
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,040
Your forensic skills are unmatched.

65
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,240
As long as you keep me updated

66
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,870
on the findings

67
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,030
so I can report to His Majesty,

68
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,170
that will be enough.

69
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,480
He's not stopping me
from examining the body?

70
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,700
I've just finished
the initial examination.

71
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,900
The deceased is male,

72
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,760
likely between 20 and 23 years old.

73
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,830
He was about six feet eight inches tall.

74
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,350
Adipocere has formed on the body.

75
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,430
So the death occurred

76
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,650
over a year ago.

77
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,390
What's the cause of death?

78
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:55,860
There's an indentation on the sternum.

79
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,390
He was likely stabbed in the heart

80
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,630
with a two-inch-wide blade from the front.

81
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,960
A two-inch-wide blade?

82
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:01,930
A sword

83
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,630
or a dagger?

84
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,630
To determine the exact cause of death,

85
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,430
further examination is needed.

86
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,830
The man was very tall,

87
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,000
with facial features

88
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,260
far more defined than the Zhou people's.

89
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,500
He appears to have foreign blood.

90
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,460
Li Muyun

91
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,460
is indeed no ordinary person.

92
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,550
I can't let him near this body again.

93
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,710
Minister Li, your insight is razor-sharp.

94
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,720
No wonder you're Lord Shen's top disciple.

95
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,610
In that case,

96
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:27,800
I'll stay out of it

97
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,840
and leave this matter to you.

98
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,850
Please don't be angry, Your Highness.

99
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,120
I didn't mean to act like

100
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,150
I knew about forensics better than you.

101
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,110
Your Highness,

102
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,720
the official duty comes first.

103
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,650
Forgive my recklessness.

104
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,720
Since it's an official duty,

105
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,270
I can't decline it.

106
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,770
Prefect Zheng,

107
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,570
please have this skeleton
moved to the morgue.

108
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,790
Without my permission,

109
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,920
no one is to enter.

110
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:53,800
Yes.

111
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,130
Zhan Yang.

112
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,310
I

113
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,280
haven't heard the title "Prince Jin"
in a long time.

114
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,870
It's my fault, Your Majesty.

115
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,580
Rise. This isn't your fault.

116
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,800
-Thank you, Your Majesty.
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

117
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,480
However, since this matter

118
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,680
involves Prince Jin,

119
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,310
you'll need to

120
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,810
investigate it thoroughly.

121
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:27,620
Listen,

122
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,710
put this matter on hold for now.

123
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,070
Wan, there's no need to rush the autopsy.

124
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,390
Right now,

125
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,620
the Empress Dowager has just recovered

126
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,760
and wishes to go on a spring outing.

127
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,040
Here's what we'll do—

128
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,310
everything can wait

129
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,530
until after the Double Third Festival.

130
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,210
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

131
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,990
You may go.

132
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,890
Princess Yongci, you stay.

133
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,840
Wan,

134
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,670
during the Double Third Festival,

135
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,930
spend more time with the Empress Dowager

136
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,720
and the Grand Princess.

137
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,980
Don't mention

138
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,650
anything about Prince Jin,

139
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:13,150
lest it bring back painful memories.

140
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,290
Understood, Your Majesty.

141
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,520
You've always been sensible.

142
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,910
I trust you.

143
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,360
Now that your mourning period is over,

144
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,360
it's time you thought about your marriage.

145
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,670
I'm in no rush, Your Majesty.

146
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,990
You may not be,

147
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,300
but I'm afraid

148
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,200
someone else is.

149
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,440
Well,

150
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,690
if someone

151
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,049
catches your eye during the outing,

152
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,370
just go ahead

153
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,909
and tell the Empress Dowager.

154
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,520
She and I

155
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:43,970
will make the arrangements for you.

156
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:44,620
Yes.

157
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,320
I take my leave.

158
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:15,780
Your Majesty,

159
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,430
you truly care about
the Heir of Prince Rui.

160
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,700
Wan

161
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,850
doesn't have powerful family support.

162
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,400
If Yan Chi

163
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,460
turns out to be more obedient
than his father,

164
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,390
then letting this marriage happen

165
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,210
wouldn't be a bad thing.

166
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,470
How can you?

167
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,090
How can you let me and the soldiers

168
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,510
who've followed you for years
go die for nothing

169
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,000
just because of your personal vow?

170
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,270
This isn't fate.

171
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:48,970
It's pure stupidity!

172
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,790
Get out!

173
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,000
I don't have a cowardly son like you!

174
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,720
Like this.

175
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,010
Blow again.

176
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,230
Come on,

177
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,130
have some tea.

178
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,590
With Wan around,

179
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,520
he looks so happy.

180
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,140
Yeah.

181
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,170
I just wonder

182
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,260
when Sui

183
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,760
will return to how he used to be.

184
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,320
He's still young.

185
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,000
When he grows older,

186
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,420
everything will be fine.

187
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,880
I hope so.

188
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,380
Sister-in-law, don't worry.

189
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,720
If you ask me,

190
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,860
Sui is a blessed kid.

191
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,930
He'll surely turn misfortune
into a blessing

192
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,460
and find luck in adversity.

193
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,880
Speaking of blessings,

194
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,220
Sister-in-law,

195
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,780
have you heard about this?

196
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:05,960
Prince Yu

197
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,160
married 11 women,

198
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,870
and one of them bore him twins
—a boy and a girl.

199
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,790
I must say

200
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,580
I'm truly impressed.

201
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,110
He's spent most of his life

202
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,630
indulging in pleasure,

203
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,960
and now in his old age,
he married a beauty

204
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,220
and even fathered a son.

205
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,950
Just imagine how many people are
green with envy.

206
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,270
A boy and a girl?

207
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:26,770
Yeah.

208
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,760
What a blessing.

209
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,830
He is blessed,

210
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,630
but I think

211
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,490
no one in this world

212
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,920
is more blessed than you.

213
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:37,870
Think about it.

214
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,460
His Majesty is wise and filial,

215
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:41,880
Prince Rui is

216
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,280
remarkably valiant,

217
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,950
and you have Wan

218
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,410
always by your side.

219
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,780
What more could you possibly ask for?

220
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,390
Now look at me—

221
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,670
all my life,

222
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,170
I only had one child, Qiong.

223
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,220
Shouldn't I be crying my heart out?

224
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,000
Gosh,

225
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,350
as you've gotten older,

226
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
you've become such a smooth talker.

227
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,210
-Sui.
-Grandmother.

228
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,870
Let me see.

229
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,670
Blow.

230
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,690
Wonderful.

231
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,960
Grow up strong, alright?

232
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,150
Wan,

233
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,540
what has Chi been busy with lately?

234
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,310
I haven't seen him at the palace for days.

235
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,620
If he doesn't show up soon,

236
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,690
I might have to
start looking for suitors for you.

237
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,310
Whether he shows up or not,

238
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,890
I'm not meeting any suitors.

239
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:31,470
Look at her.

240
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,650
Just like that,

241
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,740
you're already speaking your mind.

242
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,360
Wan is being so forthright now.

243
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,820
If Chi doesn't come
to ask for her hand soon,

244
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,180
I won't let him marry Wan anymore.

245
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,060
Exactly.

246
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,010
It's decided.

247
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,150
It's decided.

248
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,600
Yan Chi,

249
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,950
you must return safely.

250
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,520
Qi.

251
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,640
Qi,

252
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,800
I've had all the royal families
in the capital

253
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,440
under surveillance.

254
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,290
Just say the word,

255
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,290
and I can even

256
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,560
tell you how much rice

257
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,260
each family eats every day.

258
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,830
All I ask is that you speak to His Majesty
on my behalf

259
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,320
to betroth

260
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,880
Princess Yongning to me
during the Double Third Festival.

261
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,640
Why don't you turn to my mother?

262
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,600
She's your aunt, after all.

263
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,300
But she cares for you the most, Qi.

264
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,000
As long as you say the word,

265
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,130
it's as good as done.

266
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,200
Yongning's got a fiery temper.

267
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,930
She's not that easy to control.

268
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,250
Aren't you afraid

269
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,240
you might live to be the groom

270
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,810
but not survive the wedding night?

271
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,450
I'll just knock her out
with some knockout powder

272
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,380
and consummate the marriage first.

273
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,590
If she dares act up afterward,

274
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,580
I'll just divorce her.

275
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,630
If I can't,

276
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,320
I'll send her to a temple.

277
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,100
So much for your magnanimity.

278
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:54,940
Qi,

279
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,290
I'm not someone destined
for great things like you.

280
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,020
I don't need to be magnanimous.

281
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,110
Qi,

282
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,110
about my request…

283
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,420
You want my help?

284
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,630
Fine.

285
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,670
Help me with something first.

286
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,670
Anything you say.

287
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,500
No, no, Qi, I can't.

288
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,310
You know,

289
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,990
Yan Chi guards those he cares for
like a wolf.

290
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,270
If he finds out,

291
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,550
I'm done for.

292
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,480
He's not in the capital.

293
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,000
When he finds out,

294
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,450
it'll be too late.

295
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,760
You're right.

296
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,540
Li,

297
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,520
during a hunt,

298
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,300
what must you keep in mind?

299
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,580
Do you remember?

300
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,460
Don't act on your own.

301
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,790
Don't enter the dense forest alone.

302
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:11,730
Don't…

303
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,050
Don't…

304
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,070
Don't pursue wounded beasts alone.

305
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,340
Che is right.

306
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,240
Your Majesty,
if there's anything you don't know,

307
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,320
just ask Che.

308
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,770
You really are

309
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,070
a child who never grows up.

310
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,650
All you do is fool around.

311
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,620
Your Majesty,

312
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,120
if I'm a child,

313
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,250
what does that make Che and Chi?

314
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,410
You silly boy.

315
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,320
I'll go check over there.

316
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,910
Your Highness,

317
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,380
General Jiang ordered me to inform you

318
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,710
that Yan Chi has left Shuoxi.

319
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,640
It's about time.

320
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,080
Excellent.

321
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:56,750
Proceed as planned.

322
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,080
Yes.

323
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,070
Qi…

324
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,060
Qi,

325
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,690
what are you doing here?

326
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,040
Who was that just now?

327
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,100
The less you ask,
the longer you live.

328
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,230
How's the task I gave you coming along?

329
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,350
All set and ready.

330
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,470
I'm waiting

331
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
on your word.

332
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,370
What's the rush?

333
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,890
With something like this,

334
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,960
you have to take your time
to make the most of it.

335
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,700
That boy Xue Qingshan

336
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,920
just happens to be on duty today.

337
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,900
When we walk by,

338
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,060
you two

339
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,770
can get a good look at him.

340
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,400
I know you have a good eye.

341
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,940
Greetings, Marquise of Wu'an.

342
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,740
Now, he's just

343
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,730
a seventh-rank lieutenant,

344
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,180
but he has limitless potential.

345
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,300
Seventh rank?

346
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,609
How is that any better
than a low-ranking soldier?

347
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,590
Xiang,

348
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,070
what do you think?

349
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,230
I'll go along with whatever you decide.

350
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,600
My marriage

351
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,160
is mine to decide.

352
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,290
No one else gets to decide for me.

353
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:01,990
Forgive my rudeness.

354
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,660
I know a bit about injuries.

355
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,730
Maybe I can help.

356
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,030
May I?

357
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,140
Luckily, the bone's not broken.

358
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,700
It's nothing serious.

359
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,110
Sir,

360
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,550
have you seen my aunt,

361
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,750
the Marquise of Zhongyong, or my sister?

362
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,560
Just now,

363
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,600
the Marquise of Wu'an

364
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,110
and two other ladies entered the woods.

365
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,520
I'm not sure if the Marquise of Zhongyong
was among them.

366
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,380
Thank you, sir.

367
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,950
Are you going to them?

368
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,300
I can help you there.

369
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,600
No need.

370
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,150
I can go by myself later.

371
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,390
Farewell.

372
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,000
Wait.

373
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:53,970
This…

374
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:56,960
It's dirty here.

375
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,050
Thank you.

376
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,160
-Greetings, Father.
-Greetings, Father.

377
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,170
Send the order.

378
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,140
Begin the competition.

379
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:24,750
Yes.

380
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,490
Che,

381
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:28,680
after you.

382
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,310
If I could marry

383
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,000
someone like Prince Cheng,

384
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,850
that would be wonderful.

385
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,890
What?

386
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:51,950
Your Majesty,

387
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,770
the two princes ended in a draw.

388
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,030
Did I hear that right?

389
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,740
Che drew with Qi?

390
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,920
You heard right.

391
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:05,380
Che understands the importance
of both civil and martial skills.

392
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,090
He's been practicing archery

393
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,130
and never slacked off.

394
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,730
If Qi

395
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,990
had put in half the effort
His Highness does,

396
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:15,780
he wouldn't have scored so poorly today.

397
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,300
Send the order.

398
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,790
The one who hits the target
will be rewarded.

399
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,510
Yes.

400
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,010
Che,

401
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,680
if your arms are getting tired,

402
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,040
don't force yourself.

403
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,260
What do you mean by that?

404
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,930
After a few more shots,

405
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,750
you won't be able to
draw your bow anymore.

406
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,900
Then that leading goose

407
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,060
will be mine.

408
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,610
Despicable!

409
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,190
Thank you for your praise, Che.

410
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,630
Your Majesty.

411
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,720
Your Majesty,

412
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,100
he shot both eyes

413
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,710
with a single arrow.

414
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,290
Both eyes were shot.

415
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:43,920
I, Yan Chi,

416
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,350
am late due to illness.

417
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,460
Please forgive me.

418
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,880
It's good

419
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,160
that you made it.

420
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,830
Being late isn't a grave offense.

421
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,990
Get up, get up.

422
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,230
Since the Empress Dowager said it's fine,

423
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:58,990
you may rise.

424
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,300
Thank you, Your Majesty.

425
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,000
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

426
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:04,920
So,

427
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,890
it was you who shot it down?

428
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:09,340
I saw two arrows vying
for the leading goose

429
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,450
and worried it might get away,

430
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,450
so I took the shot.

431
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,150
Why did you use a whistling arrow?

432
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,590
A whistling arrow

433
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,050
is meant to warn,

434
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,310
not to kill.

435
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,870
Your Majesty just promised a reward.

436
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,860
Hope you're not taking that back.

437
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,350
Yan Chi, Heir of Prince Rui,

438
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,270
a master archer who fights evil

439
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,470
and upholds justice,

440
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,780
is hereby awarded 1000 taels of gold.

441
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

442
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,660
"Fights evil and upholds justice."

443
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,740
Father truly has a discerning eye.

444
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,220
Wan.

445
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:19,940
♪ A deep mark you left,
etched in my heart ♪

446
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:26,760
♪ Now and then it aches,
stirring old memories ♪

447
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:30,430

00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:46,440
♪ The story isn't over yet,
and tears are not the only part of it ♪

451
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:42,410
You were gone so long.

452
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,770
Did everything go well?

453
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,150
There's something

454
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,740
I need to tell you.

455
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:48,920
What is it?

456
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:52,810
His Majesty hopes Father will voluntarily
hand over the military command of Shuoxi.

457
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:53,810
But Father...

458
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,440
His Lordship wouldn't listen to you?

459
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,170
He wouldn't.

460
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,360
He fears that if he gives up command now,
the nomadic enemies will attack us.

461
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,960
He insists on
crushing them completely first.

462
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,660
But I doubt His Majesty
can wait that long.

463
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,840
If His Majesty insists on
reclaiming command,

464
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,500
does the Prince plan to rebel?

465
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,990
How could you say something so treasonous?

466
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:13,950
I'm serious.

467
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,290
If His Majesty reclaims military control,

468
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,000
in the end,

469
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,510
either you and the Prince are
stripped of rank,

470
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,760
and I work as a physician to support us,

471
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,360
or

472
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,400
the Prince rises up with the Shuoxi Army,

473
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,350
and His Majesty kills us both
to intimidate the rebels.

474
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,150
We have to prepare for the worst.

475
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,420
Did you just say "us"?

476
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,890
Even if I lose my title and rank,

477
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,360
even if I lose my life for this,

478
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,560
you'd still marry me?

479
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,160
Until death

480
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:39,160
do us part.

481
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:00,560
Master,

482
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,780
I have urgent news.

483
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:02,680
Go ahead.

484
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:05,270
On the marriage list Noble Consort Su
gave the Imperial Astronomical Bureau,

485
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,900
the bride listed for Prince Cheng is
Miss Qin.

486
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,290
I was afraid of causing a commotion,

487
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:10,020
so I didn't dare steal the list.

488
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,560
I await your instructions.

489
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,600
There's no way Prince Cheng
truly wants to marry me.

490
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,950
We mustn't act rashly.

491
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,090
Don't worry.

492
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,830
Whatever scheme he's planning,

493
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,400
I won't let him get his way.

494
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,650
I'll await your good news.

495
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,150
You

496
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,990
traveled day and night to come back.

497
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,180
I appreciate it.

498
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,700
I would gladly give my life

499
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,550
in Your Majesty's service.

500
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:44,040
Then tell me,

501
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,920
how did

502
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,040
the mission go?

503
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,040
Your Majesty,

504
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,640
there is more
to the military provision case

505
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,510
than it seems.

506
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,150
By the time I arrived in Shuoxi,

507
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:54,480
Prince Rui had dismissed and detained
the grain official who colluded

508
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,980
with the transport commissioner.

509
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,720
During the interrogation, I discovered

510
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,400
that it was a local official
from Liangzhou

511
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,450
who introduced the two.

512
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,370
Fearing I might alert them,

513
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:06,540
I didn't dare pursue it without orders.

514
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,100
But this is enough to prove

515
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,540
that the Shuoxi Army was

516
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,680
the victim in the military provision case.

517
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,800
Prince Rui never condoned corruption

518
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,440
or bribed officials as alleged.

519
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,440
There is someone else behind it all.

520
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:26,830
Your Majesty,

521
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,810
from what I personally saw

522
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:29,810
and heard,

523
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,540
Prince Rui is wholly loyal to Zhou

524
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,040
and utterly devoted to Your Majesty.

525
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:36,410
The Shuoxi Army

526
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,840
belongs to Your Majesty.

527
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,910
It's the wall that protects Zhou.

528
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:40,780
I

529
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,570
am Prince Rui's only son.

530
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,120
If Your Majesty still has doubts,

531
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,290
you may imprison me.

532
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,570
If Prince Rui disobeys,

533
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,160
you can cut off one of my limbs.

534
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,270
If that's not enough,

535
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,030
you may take my head

536
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,130
and send it to Shuoxi

537
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,860
as a warning to the entire army.

538
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,010
Don't talk nonsense.

539
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,080
Sorry.

540
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,160
You said just now

541
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,640
you didn't dare investigate
the Liangzhou official.

542
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,850
That means whoever's behind this

543
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:15,940
must be quite powerful.

544
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,420
There's no concrete proof yet.

545
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,760
I dare not speculate.

546
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,210
Your Majesty,

547
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,680
please give me a bit more time.

548
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,160
I'll get to the bottom of this

549
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,350
and personally bring

550
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,960
the one behind it before you.

551
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,090
How many people out there

552
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,440
could have influence
over both the Ministry of Revenue

553
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,770
and the Ministry of War?

554
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,000
Enough.

555
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,720
I'm aware of the situation now.

556
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,510
You may leave now.

557
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:39,890
Your Majesty,

558
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,680
there's one more matter.

559
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,480
Your Majesty,

560
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:45,910
the Empress and the Noble Consort
request an audience.

561
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,960
Wait inside the tent.

562
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,380
We'll talk later.

563
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:53,480
Yes.

564
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,570
Your Majesty,

565
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,190
you must help Qi and me.

566
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,960
The Palace Domestic Service
has humiliated us.

567
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,920
None of the young ladies
they selected for him

568
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,980
come from families as distinguished

569
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,680
as Lady Yu of the Qin family.

570
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,290
My poor son,

571
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:14,030
he can never measure up
to the Crown Prince.

572
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,360
It's all my fault. I'm so useless

573
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,840
and have always been overshadowed
since I entered the palace.

574
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,900
If you and Qi

575
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:24,210
have any noble lady in mind,

576
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,630
you can make the decision yourselves.

577
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,560
Just report it
to the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

578
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,570
This matter

579
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,880
still needs Her Majesty's approval.

580
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,940
I'm not sure if she'll permit it.

581
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,920
No need for that.

582
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,400
I approve of it.

583
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,290
Thank you, Your Majesty.

584
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,730
Her Highness is so good at this.

585
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,840
Amazing!

586
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,410
Excellent!

587
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,080
Why aren't you applauding?

588
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,880
Princess Yongning,

589
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,740
Your Highness,

590
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,360
may I have a word with you?

591
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,910
Everyone, enjoy yourselves.

592
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,020
Come on.

593
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,330
Princess Yongci is feeling a bit tired.

594
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,790
She'd like to return and rest early.

595
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,140
So, Princess Yongning,

596
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,220
please go back to the tent
and get some rest as well.

597
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:48,820
Oh, right,

598
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,410
Her Highness specifically asked

599
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,540
Lord Li

600
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,430
to look after Princess Yongning.

601
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,030
Since it's a request from Wan,

602
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,130
I guess I'll take the trouble.

603
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,040
No need.

604
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,090
It's not like my sword can't kill.

605
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,150
Bringing him along

606
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,600
would just slow me down.

607
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,840
I may be a burden,

608
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,000
but I'm not useless.

609
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,200
I can talk

610
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,460
and entertain people.

611
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,160
I'd never ignore people

612
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,270
like someone did.

613
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,510
And I can walk

614
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,970
without needing support.

615
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,080
I don't fight well,

616
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,010
but my eyesight is decent.

617
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,890
At least I can take a hit or two for you.

618
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,240
Yan Li,

619
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,480
I don't mind you joking about me,

620
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,000
but if you joke about Ze,

621
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,750
I swear I'll cut you down!

622
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:32,600
I'm sure

623
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,280
that's not what Lord Li meant,

624
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,140
right?

625
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:38,600
Take it.

626
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,390
That's exactly what I meant.

627
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:43,290
If you marry Ze,
that's as good as killing me.

628
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,420
Sooner or later,

629
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,380
I'll die anyway.

630
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,480
So I'll say it straight today—

631
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,050
I won't let you marry Ze.

632
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:50,730
It's not going to happen!

633
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:58,850
I won't have to marry him.

634
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,960
As long as I can find him a woman

635
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,490
who truly cares for him,

636
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,240
there's no need for me to step in.

637
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,770
Why didn't you say so earlier?

638
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,880
Matchmaking is my specialty.

639
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:16,030
Background, character, talent—

640
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,390
I'll handpick the best of the best
for him.

641
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,230
What about looks?

642
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,590
She can't be worse-looking than me.

643
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,710
He can't see.

644
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,690
But I can.

645
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,590
Now you're being unreasonable.

646
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,210
How am I supposed to find anyone

647
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,610
better looking than you?

648
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,670
Why are you smiling?

649
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,560
Alright, alright.

650
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,220
I'll go look tomorrow.

651
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:55,690
Bai Feng.

652
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,660
You're my witness.

653
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,200
If I find someone,

654
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,190
she can't go back on her word.

655
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,700
Your Highnesses,

656
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,490
I'm not witnessing anything.

657
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,760
I need to hurry back
and stand night watch for Her Highness.

658
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,510
I'll take my leave now.

659
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,600
Why don't you start looking now?

660
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,110
It's too dark.

661
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,830
I can't find anyone pretty.

662
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,960
I can't see clearly.

663
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,930
Didn't you just say your eyesight's great?

664
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,350
I went blind just now.

665
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,699
Are they sent by Prince Cheng?

666
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,850
Master.

667
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:46,550
You may leave.

668
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,440
-Yes.
-Yes.

669
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:00,270
Hurry.

670
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:01,080
Get up.

671
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,550
Careful, careful.

672
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,220
Your face is dirty.

673
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,410
Let me clean it for you.

674
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,270
Who are you?

675
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,580
Don't move.

676
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,580
What drug are you using on me?

677
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:18,890
You mean this?

678
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:23,010
That's what the Fengqi House uses
to train their girls.

679
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,690
It keeps you awake

680
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,100
but makes your whole body go limp.

681
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,780
You can only lie there
and let me do what I want.

682
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,780
What can you get out of this?

683
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,330
I heard

684
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,780
you and Yongning are
as close as real sisters.

685
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,050
Tell me,

686
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:43,890
if I get intimate with you…

687
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,610
Who's there?

688
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:54,560
Qi?

689
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:03,070
You definitely have a death wish.

690
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,430
How dare you lay hands

691
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,800
on the girl I want?

692
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:08,350
Qi,

693
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,610
you're really planning to marry her?

694
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,470
She's a coroner.

695
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,880
She'd bring you nothing but bad luck.

696
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,410
Just have some fun with her.

697
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:24,020
You're not even worthy of

698
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,600
touching my dog,

699
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,480
let alone the girl I want.

700
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,010
Understand?

701
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,190
Qi,

702
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,990
the Noble Consort is my aunt.

703
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,250
We're related.

704
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,650
Aren't you being a bit too harsh?

705
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,960
Related?

706
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,230
I'm a royal prince.

707
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:50,510
Who are you to be related
to the royal family?

708
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,990
Yan Qi,

709
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,650
you're not even the Crown Prince yet,

710
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,280
and you're already
turning your back on me?

711
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,850
If it weren't for the money

712
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,080
and manpower from the Feng family,

713
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:06,080
you and your mother

714
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,420
would've died in the palace long ago!

715
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,670
When you came to me for money,

716
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:12,650
why didn't you call me unworthy?

717
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,440
Good.

718
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,960
Perfect.

719
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:44,920
He's much less

720
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,800
annoying now, isn't he?

721
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:48,480
You've lost your mind.

722
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,400
This place is dirty now.

723
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,440
Let's talk somewhere else.

724
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,320
Was the campsite

725
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,230
arranged by the Patrol Battalion?

726
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:08,840
Yes.

727
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,390
Most of its men work for Prince Cheng.

728
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,670
Check who's absent tonight.

729
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,510
No need for confessions.

730
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,370
Just kill them.

731
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,310
Yes.

732
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:19,730
Also,

733
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,340
the kidnapping of Her Highness

734
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,490
must be kept secret.

735
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,150
Master,

736
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,860
Her Highness wasn't kidnapped.

737
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,520
She went missing
while learning to hunt with me.

738
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,250
The Tianshu Camp's knockout powder.

739
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:40,830
Hurry!

740
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,690
It's herbal powder.

741
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,100
Wan.

742
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,220
So?

743
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,550
Are you satisfied

744
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:38,960
with the setup?

745
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,170
I rarely put such effort

746
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,030
into pleasing a woman.

747
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,560
You're truly different.

748
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,720
Not screaming or making a fuss.

749
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,080
So composed.

750
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,310
It actually makes me

751
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:56,560
start to like you.

752
00:39:59,100 --> 00:39:59,790
Why not

753
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,700
become my primary consort?

754
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,510
You want me to be your primary consort

755
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,370
just because you need my talents.

756
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,370
I could help you
boost your political standing,

757
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,630
and as the Marquis of Zhongyong's niece,

758
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,070
I could help you drive a wedge
between the Qin family

759
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,270
and the Crown Prince.

760
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:18,170
Do you think

761
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,850
I'm the kind of coward
who climbs up by using women?

762
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,440
Aren't you?

763
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,750
You're treating me like this

764
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,590
only because Yan Chi

765
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,120
humiliated you in front of everyone.

766
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,440
You can't defeat him fair and square,

767
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,190
so you're trying to bully me

768
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,920
to vent your frustration.

769
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,400
Shut up. I'm warning you!

770
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,280
So not only are you a coward
who rides women's coattails,

771
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,710
you're also the kind who picks on the weak

772
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,430
to feel like a man.

773
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,200
Now you know

774
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,390
I'm not gentle with women, don't you?

775
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,260
If it hurts, cry.

776
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:56,130
If you're scared, beg me.

777
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,920
I can be very patient

778
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,090
with women who please me.

779
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:03,010
I'm scared of snakes.

780
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,400
But does that mean
I should beg a snake not to bite me?

781
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,280
If you don't even understand that,

782
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,130
you're not just a coward—

783
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,590
you're also a fool.

784
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,360
Great.

785
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:21,920
What a sharp tongue.

786
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:24,600
But save that sharp tongue of yours

787
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,550
for Yan Chi.

788
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,990
I'd love to see

789
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,590
the look on his face

790
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,720
after I strip you naked

791
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:35,600
and have my way with you.

792
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,520
It'll definitely be very interesting.

793
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,410
By then,

794
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,600
when the commoners talk about you,

795
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,840
they'll call you, Princess Yongci,

796
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:49,000
a tainted woman.

797
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,390
Living

798
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:54,590
will be your greatest torment.

799
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,290
After death,

800
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,900
the flesh and organs

801
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,790
rot into a pool of filth
in less than 10 days.

802
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,840
You may think teeth are hard,

803
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,960
but they fall out
within a couple of weeks,

804
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,980
just like your power
and hollow reputation.

805
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,710
They're the first to fade away.

806
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,610
The hair seems soft,

807
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,840
but it won't decay even after 100 years.

808
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:16,760
Like one's virtues and talent—

809
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,280
no one can take them away.

810
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,280
So I'd like to see

811
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:23,260
whether I'll be broken
by these petty things

812
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,630
or you'll fall from grace first

813
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:26,670
and be remembered in infamy.

814
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,880
I'll kill you!

815
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,310
Are you alright?

816
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:02,060
I'm fine.

817
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,750
Yan Chi,

818
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,260
how dare you attack me?

819
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:09,650
What do you want to do?

820
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,800
You're gonna kill me?

821
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,390
Yan Chi.

822
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:17,970
Yan Chi.
