00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,930
[Episode 17]

3
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,870
Thank you.

4
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,229
Li Muyun?

5
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,000
Here, try some too.

6
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,140
My Lady,

7
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,230
you were staring at Li Muyun

8
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,829
and barely ate anything.

9
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,380
I have no appetite.

10
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,030
That eye contact was an accident.

11
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,010
I was afraid he'd see through my mind.

12
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,340
It was not your fault.

13
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,380
Who could stay calm when seeing

14
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,000
their enemy with a vendetta?

15
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,790
I've pictured his face numerous times,

16
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,760
but never did I

17
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,550
expect him to appear such a gentleman.

18
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,920
My Lady, he wrecked your whole family.

19
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,290
No matter how decent he may seem,

20
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,490
he's still a villain.

21
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,829
Keep it down.

22
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,790
Little Wan'er.

23
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:01,920
Oh, my God.

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,990
It's me.

25
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,460
Finally got out of there.

26
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,430
Why didn't you two

27
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,110
inform me before you snuck out?

28
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,710
It was suffocating in there.

29
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,420
We came out for some fresh air.

30
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,270
I'm wondering what's wrong

31
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,410
with Princess Yu.

32
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,220
She kept pushing me about my marriage.

33
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,820
And all those madams

34
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,000
happen to have sons or nephews—

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,600
handsome, talented,

36
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,860
promising, and single,

37
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,920
waiting for me to save them
from their misery.

38
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,380
I had to dig my nails into my palms

39
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,780
to keep from lashing out.

40
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,790
Can't believe you actually held back.

41
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,320
You've made some progress.

42
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,720
Your Highness, Wan.

43
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,150
What brings you here?

44
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,880
The Shuangqing Troupe is about to perform
"Mulian Rescues His Mother."

45
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,079
I came to let you know.

46
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,390
I ate too much

47
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,790
and needed to walk it off.

48
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,510
We still need to watch the show later.

49
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,970
You're blessed
with such a carefree nature.

50
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,160
Prince Yu, wish you infinite fortune

51
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,500
and longevity.

52
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:04,890
Thank you.

53
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,440
Cheers.

54
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,160
Prince Yu, wish you infinite fortune

55
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,390
and longevity.

56
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,730
Thank you.

57
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,600
Thank you.

58
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,790
Prince Yu, I'll have one with you.

59
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,600
Come on.

60
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:20,910
Mr. Li.

61
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,920
Cheers.

62
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,190
Who are those people at the back table,

63
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,480
too timid to come to toast?

64
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,240
Cheers.

65
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,110
They all work in salt delivery.

66
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,400
The one toasting over there

67
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,280
is Liu Renli.

68
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,120
Keep a close eye on them.

69
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,040
Understood.

70
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:51,780
Minister Li, forgive my negligence.

71
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,510
I just learned you're still staying
at the post house.

72
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,510
If you don't mind,

73
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,310
my Qinghui Manor
is quite a pleasant residence.

74
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,790
Why not...

75
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,310
I'm here on an official mission
entrusted by His Majesty.

76
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,210
I am supposed to stay at the post house

77
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,540
according to the rules.

78
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,750
Minister Li, I'm impressed
by your adherence

79
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,810
to proper conduct.

80
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,270
This one's for you.

81
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,360
Mr. Pang,

82
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,270
cheers.

83
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,160
Li Muyun is extremely cautious
in his words and actions.

84
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,670
Can't tell his integrity
or treachery for now.

85
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,330
Nonsense!

86
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,430
My youngest son is not

87
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,700
my own flesh and blood?

88
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,920
Ridiculous!

89
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,750
Just some childish gibberish.

90
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,080
Lord Yan is drunk.

91
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,520
I didn't give birth to him,

92
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,270
so how would I know?

93
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,960
Great-uncle, I have some advice for you.

94
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
In this world,

95
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,490
only the mother knows
who the child's real father is.

96
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,920
Therefore,

97
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,450
never mess with women.

98
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,110
Great-uncle, you'd better be nicer
to your wife from now on.

99
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,680
Finally said something sensible.

100
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:53,870
We can't afford

101
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,270
to offend women.

102
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,040
-They're formidable, you know?
-Yeah.

103
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,670
Come on, let's drink.

104
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,080
Alright, bottoms up.

105
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,760
Come on.

106
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,330
Cheers.

107
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,220
Thank you for your blessing.

108
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,010
Good.

109
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,050
Impressive.

110
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,110
Prince Yi's heir is truly handsome.

111
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,160
Literally a himbo.

112
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:44,870
Now, let's welcome

113
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,790
the birthday protagonist,

114
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,040
Prince Yu, to deliver a speech!

115
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,190
Alright.

116
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:48,920
Everyone!

117
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,520
Let's all raise a glass to Prince Yu.

118
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,190
Prince Yu, wish you
infinite fortune and longevity.

119
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,280
Your Highness,
could you kindly let Prince Yu know

120
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,190
that I cannot handle any more alcohol

121
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,160
and need to return to my lodging to rest?

122
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,960
I'm not saying goodbye in person

123
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,430
because I don't want to ruin the vibe.

124
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,230
Of course.

125
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,960
His Majesty was so pleased

126
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,470
to learn that you solved two major cases

127
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,000
in Jingzhou consecutively.

128
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,110
If you could give me
some advice on investigation

129
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,840
after returning to the capital,

130
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,870
I would be greatly honored.

131
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,980
Minister Li, you know,

132
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,670
those who follow different paths
cannot work together.

133
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,350
For someone who betrayed his teacher
to climb up the career ladder,

134
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,670
I only hold him in contempt and disdain.

135
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,480
I see, Your Highness.

136
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,930
Here, let me fill your cup.

137
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,040
Brother, you haven't

138
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,520
secured your position
in the Ministry of Justice.

139
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,380
I don't think it's wise to fall out

140
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,550
with him now.

141
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,640
We're long past the point of playing nice.

142
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:00,990
Yan Li.

143
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,480
Nice!

144
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,520
Reward them!

145
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,440
If Xiang hears about
such a great performance,

146
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,169
she'll throw another tantrum.

147
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:36,500
Then don't let her know.

148
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:38,830
She made mistakes herself.

149
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,890
Grounding her is already going easy!

150
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,040
Mr. Pang,

151
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,470
why did Liu Renli leave early?

152
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,370
He went back on his word.

153
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:00,120
Does he have any respect
for the Crown Prince?

154
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,820
It's really not that serious.

155
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,320
Commissioner Liu was simply afraid
of being targeted by Yan Chi,

156
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,350
so he had to hide temporarily.

157
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,340
Why?

158
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,550
He

159
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,310
once invested in Qingyuan Pawnshop,

160
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,040
and Yan Chi is handling that case.

161
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,920
What?

162
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,200
Is he involved in that case?

163
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,050
He wouldn't dare be involved
in such matters.

164
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,950
He withdrew his investment

165
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,580
as soon as the news broke.

166
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,040
If he had a weakness in Yan Chi's hands,

167
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,920
I would never recommend him

168
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,050
to the Crown Prince.

169
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,270
Please rest assured.

170
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,520
He's clean, squeaky clean.

171
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,850
These two men from the Qin family

172
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,590
are really stirring up trouble.

173
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,470
They made me squat here for ages!

174
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,650
I need to go somewhere to relax.

175
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,930
Your Highness.

176
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,880
Feng,

177
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,040
what are you doing here?

178
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,810
Master told me to keep watch here.

179
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,310
Feng.

180
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,500
It's said that Miss Qin Wan

181
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,990
is going to be
my Brother Chi's future wife?

182
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,070
I have no idea.

183
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,190
I heard that in Jingzhou's case,

184
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,390
my future sister-in-law was a big help.

185
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,590
Is that true?

186
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,470
No idea.

187
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,430
My future sister-in-law

188
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,040
just looks like a doll.

189
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,190
What help could she possibly offer?

190
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,310
Please stop it.

191
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,710
No matter how many times you ask,

192
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,110
I'll only say, "No idea."

193
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,840
Seems like it's something
hard to talk about.

194
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,550
There are only a few roles
in criminal justice.

195
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,610
What are you hiding from others?

196
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,980
Case solving? Chi is good at it.

197
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,070
Deduction?

198
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,990
It's okay if people know about it.

199
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,430
Criminal law?

200
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,820
It can be covered by scribes.

201
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,600
Making arrests?

202
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,310
My future sister-in-law's
too vulnerable for it.

203
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,530
So that only leaves the examination.

204
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:19,290
My sister-in-law
couldn't be a coroner, could she?

205
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,300
Thanks.

206
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,560
Wait, hold on.

207
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,890
Why did you say thanks to me?

208
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,760
Thank you for telling me that

209
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,880
my future sister-in-law

210
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,920
is an expert at handling dead bodies.

211
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,550
I didn't say anything!

212
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,760
I only need to make Chi

213
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,750
think you did.

214
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:39,700
Wait.

215
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,520
You're a prince!

216
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,140
How

217
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,830
could you frame me?

218
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,920
Prince Yu, this one's for you.

219
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,040
And me too, Your Highness.

220
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,880
Good.

221
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,250
Brat, where have you been?

222
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,070
Bathroom.

223
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,090
It's starting!

224
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,850
Here we go!

225
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,120
The show is going to begin!

226
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,920
My Lady, look!

227
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:23,190
♪ The Dharma sees
the child's filial piety ♪

228

233
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,950
Bravo!

234
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:15,550
Bravo!

235
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,240
Bravo!

236
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,920
Great!

237
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,040
Bravo!

238
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,030
Leader Qing Li, impressive!

239
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:21,880
Bravo!

240
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,470
Bravo!

241
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,670
That's amazing!

242
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,710
Wan, it's such a great show!

243
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,190
Prince Yu, are you alright?

244
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,240
-Prince Yu!
-Your Highness!

245
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,410
Your Highness!

246
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,630
Don't move!

247
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,920
Prince Yu has suffered a stroke

248
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,120
and must not be moved.

249
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:26,880
Fuling, get me

250
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,500
a paper and a brush.

251
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:27,940
Yes.

252
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,970
She's dead.

253
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,470
I didn't do it.

254
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,430
Impossible.

255
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,160
It wasn't me!

256
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,720
-Stay still!
-I didn't do it.

257
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,400
Bai Feng.

258
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,040
Yes!

259
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,100
Lock down the area.

260
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,280
Kill those

261
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,680
who sneak out.

262
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,490
Understood!

263
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,730
Lock down the area!

264
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,720
Where is the Governor of Yuzhou?

265
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,670
It's me.

266
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,950
I'm here.

267
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,910
[Wang Huaiyu, Governor of Yuzhou]

268
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,070
Here.

269
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,550
Keep squeezing out

270
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,040
the congested blood until it turns red.

271
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,430
Okay.

272
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,900
Your Highness.

273
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,280
You are Governor Wang?

274
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,550
Yes. Greetings, Your Highness.

275
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,550
You are elderly.

276
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,810
So save the formality.

277
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,070
Thank you, Your Highness.

278
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,920
The suspect, Yang Ying,
is being taken to the office.

279
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,550
Please arrange
an interrogation immediately.

280
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,640
Yes, Your Highness.

281
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,280
Decoct thick medicine that I prescribed.
Two doses will cure him.

282
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,010
Yes, My Lady.

283
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,360
What's wrong?

284
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:05,369
Nothing.

285
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,079
How is my great-uncle?

286
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,339
He's out of danger now.

287
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,579
Did you notice anything unusual?

288
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:12,339
No discoveries so far.

289
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,660
Thank you for saving my great-uncle.

290
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,829
As I should. No need for thanks.

291
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,880
At a birthday banquet,

292
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,160
such incidents could easily
stir up trouble.

293
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,190
I want to examine
the troupe leader's body quickly

294
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:25,119
to prevent rumors from going wild.

295
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,500
Okay.

296
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,300
I'll have Bai Feng escort you and Ning
to the prefect's office.

297
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,560
I'll go join you
after I examine the scene.

298
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,560
Ning, let's go.

299
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,110
Okay.

300
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,010
I'll go with you!

301
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,840
[Morgue]

302
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,880
Oh, my goodness.

303
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,670
Are you done?

304
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,510
My turn now.

305
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,990
No! I can never be done with it!

306
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,050
It's absolutely fascinating.

307
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:01,960
Just wait.

308
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,670
You've been watching for so long!

309
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,200
I haven't seen it even once.

310
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,190
Why did it end so suddenly?

311
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,000
It's

312
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,240
over?

313
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,560
Let me see.

314
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,590
Help me hold this.

315
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,030
What's wrong?

316
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,230
Seriously?

317
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,870
Isn't it just like
watching someone sew clothes?

318
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,950
Sewing clothes and sewing a person
are different things!

319
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,230
Fine, fine.

320
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,670
I told you not to watch

321
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,130
Little Wan'er perform the autopsy,

322
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,050
but you insisted.

323
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:52,040
See? All because you didn't listen to me.

324
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,360
-What are you doing?
-Come on.

325
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,120
Help me just this once.

326
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,450
I'll grant any favor you ask
in the future.

327
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,470
I told you not to watch the autopsy.

328
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,280
Now you're suffering, huh?

329
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,580
Silly tricks.

330
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,140
Go have fun somewhere else.

331
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,030
Alright, alright.

332
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,950
It's okay.

333
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,030
I saved your face.

334
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,990
If you dare break your promise,

335
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,650
I'll break this hand of yours.

336
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,470
Come on.

337
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,640
I'm a man

338
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,670
of my word.

339
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,530
You can ask for whatever you want.

340
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,080
I want to drink

341
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,420
to my heart's content!

342
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,360
No way.

343
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,880
If Chi finds out, he'll kill me.

344
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,300
Do you believe I can now...

345
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,510
You win this time.

346
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,520
Let's go.

347
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,400
Put it down there.

348
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,710
Have the Dove Unit investigate it.

349
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,280
Yes.

350
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,770
You may leave, too.

351
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:07,610
Yes.

352
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,080
Died from a chest wound?

353
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,840
Yes.

354
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,320
The arrow was made of pure iron,

355
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,360
entered through the back,

356
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,620
and pierced the heart.

357
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,640
But if it were an intentional murder,

358
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,920
the murderer would
need to be confident of a fatal shot.

359
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,080
Yet when I examined the scene,

360
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,080
I found no signs of any setup.

361
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,330
Could it really be an accident?

362
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:34,600
Every accident has its inevitable cause.

363
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,560
What did Yang Ying say?

364
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,970
Governor Wang's questioning him now.

365
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,270
What are you worried about?

366
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,600
I want to make achievements
in criminal justice to facilitate

367
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,530
your future recommendation of me.

368
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,470
I want to

369
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,320
take over this case.

370
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,430
Then do it.

371
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,240
Why are you hesitating?

372
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,560
But you're already handling
the Qingyuan Pawnshop case

373
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,560
and the salt transport corruption case.

374
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,220
I don't want to stress you out.

375
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,510
Prince Yu is
His Majesty's last remaining uncle,

376
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:06,570
holding the highest seniority
in the imperial family.

377
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,070
At his birthday banquet,

378
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,600
not only did a murder occur,

379
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,320
but he also fell suddenly ill.

380
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,740
Officially and personally,

381
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,540
I cannot stand by and do nothing.

382
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:15,850
Moreover,

383
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,320
this birthday banquet

384
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,950
gathered officials
of the fourth rank and above

385
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,030
from the Upper-capital
and Southeast Circuits.

386
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,640
Someone committed murder at such an event.

387
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,230
It's hard to tell how many people
have been involved.

388
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,950
And it's likely to be related
to the two cases

389
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,280
I'm handling right now.

390
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,600
Your assistance

391
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,170
would be a great help to me,

392
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,120
not a burden.

393
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,360
I'm glad to hear that.

394
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,040
Are these all the arrows
shot from the quiver?

395
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,600
Except for the one that hit Qing Li,

396
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,840
all the others are here.

397
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,800
I collected them myself,

398
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,260
untouched by anyone else.

399
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,950
Weird.

400
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,120
This arrow

401
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,800
is much lighter than the one
that struck Qing Li.

402
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,570
Look.

403
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,720
I need Hanyue.

404
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,470
This arrow

405
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,750
is covered with iron on the outside,

406
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,080
but made of wood inside.

407
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,050
But the arrow that killed Qing Li

408
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,180
is made of iron only.

409
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,360
Even with an iron-plated arrow,

410
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,430
given the speed and force
offered by this quiver,

411
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,780
it'd be enough to kill people.

412
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,380
No need to specifically use
pure-iron arrows.

413
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,880
The quiver is the key to the problem.

414
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,030
The iron arrow was too heavy,

415
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,320
requiring the device
to be pulled twice to fire.

416
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,360
When the Shuangqing Troupe
was arranging this play,

417
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,990
they must've set the shooting's timing
and position meticulously.

418
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,920
Given their years of collaboration,
Yang Ying and Qing Li

419
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,190
must've developed
perfect coordination and trust.

420
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,230
But the killer
exploited exactly this point

421
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,230
to make this iron arrow

422
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,250
fire at a different time than planned.

423
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,360
This one strike caught Qing Li off guard

424
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,270
and killed her.

425
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,740
The murderer must be so familiar
with this quiver

426
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,190
that he knew exactly
where to place the iron arrow

427
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,720
to hit Qing Li's vital spot.

428
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,430
When Qing Li was shot,

429
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,430
she was about to go off stage for a pose.

430
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:35,920
That was the only time in the play

431
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,510
she stood with her back to Yang Ying.

432
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,800
The killer must've known
Yang Ying would bow at that moment

433
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,660
and trigger the mechanism again.

434
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,430
Given the murderer's perfect plan

435
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,840
for the attack timing,

436
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,510
he or she must've been extremely familiar

437
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,750
with the arrangement of this play.

438
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,710
In that case,

439
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,320
everyone in the Shuangqing Troupe
is suspicious.

440
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,360
Because this play is a must-learn
for an apprentice

441
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,490
in the Shuangqing Troupe to graduate.

442
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,760
That means

443
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:59,430
every one of them knows
the arrangement of this play

444
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,030
and the directions of the arrow shots.

445
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,560
For such an important prop,

446
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,400
why didn't Yang Ying
check it himself before going on stage?

447
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,270
Because he's the deputy troupe leader

448
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,130
in charge of the troupe's chores.

449
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,920
Even if he checked it in person,

450
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,160
he couldn't possibly keep

451
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,120
this quiver on his back all the time.

452
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,320
Someone could enter backstage
when he wasn't around

453
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,320
and have the chance
to tamper with this quiver.

454
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,600
When Qing Li was shot,

455
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,160
Yang Ying looked in great shock.

456
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,400
It didn't look like his scheme.

457
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,320
Let's set aside whether his shock
was real or not.

458
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,030
Right now,

459
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,190
we need to figure out who else could've

460
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,650
tampered with this quiver

461
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,410
besides Yang Ying.

462
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,710
Prisoner Yang Ying,

463
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,030
you just confessed

464
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:02,870
that you killed Qing Li,
the Shuangqing Troupe Leader.

465
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,840
Is what's written in your confession

466
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,230
true?

467
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,340
Yes.

468
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,750
It's true.

469
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,880
Since it's true,

470
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,710
then press your fingerprint
on the confession.

471
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,080
No, no!

472
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,640
It was not...

473
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,800
Not...

474
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,070
Yang Ying,

475
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,320
nearly a hundred people
at the birthday banquet

476
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,510
saw you kill Troupe Leader Qing Li.

477
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,800
With both the witnesses and evidence,

478
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,560
you cannot get away
with this murder charge.

479
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:38,110
I'm about to finish my term in office

480
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,480
and retire soon.

481
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,840
I don't want to execute anyone
before I leave.

482
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,750
As long as you press your fingerprint
on this confession,

483
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,470
I will consider
that you turned yourself in

484
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,320
and spare your life.

485
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:57,750
-It was not me!
-Behave!

486
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,990
It wasn't me! I didn't do it!

487
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,880
Yang Ying,

488
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,360
are you trying to fool me?

489
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,170
Gag him!

490
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,580
Continue the beating!

491
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,040
Stop!

492
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,670
Greetings, Your Highness.

493
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,800
Why are you using such brutal force
on the suspect?

494
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,560
Yang Ying dared to go back
on his confession in court.

495
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,400
For such a cunning criminal,

496
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,270
I had no choice but to adopt brutal force.

497
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,400
This is murder.

498
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,220
Yang Ying was gagged during torture,

499
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,400
making it hard for him

500
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,320
to breathe or cry out to release the pain,

501
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,360
causing his internal energy

502
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,710
to mess up, leading to his fainting.

503
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,080
Your Highness,

504
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,920
this young lady is talking nonsense.

505
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,350
This "young lady" you said

506
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,080
is the expert in criminal justice,
who I consider my mentor,

507
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,100
Master Wan.

508
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,080
M-Master...

509
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:09,880
Master Wan.

510
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:12,360
Please forgive my ignorance.

511
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,880
If Yang Ying remains in a coma
for too long,

512
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,350
it may lead to organ failure.

513
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,150
I need to treat him immediately.

514
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,160
Take Yang Ying to the prison for now.

515
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,810
Yes!

516
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,480
Make sure to keep him alive.

517
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,270
Go, go.

518
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,080
Move it!

519
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,160
Your Highness.

520
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:39,110
I am already a man long in the tooth,
ready to retire.

521
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,800
How could I possibly abuse torture

522
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,260
and cause needless death?

523
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,400
Actually, Yang Ying already confessed

524
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,880
that he killed Troupe Leader Qing Li,

525
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,360
but he refused to sign the confession.

526
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,760
Where is the confession?

527
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,880
Yang Ying confessed that he

528
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,750
was desperate to become the troupe leader,

529
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,760
but Qing Li was addicted to gambling

530
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,590
and secretly lost the Shuangqing Troupe
to someone else in a bet.

531
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,870
So Yang Ying held a deep resentment.

532
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,760
When and to whom did Qing Li

533
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,920
lose the troupe?

534
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,090
Where did she gamble?

535
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,990
Well...

536
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,160
How did Yang Ying
use the quiver to kill her?

537
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,880
Since Yang Ying already confessed,

538
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,620
why bother with these trivial details?

539
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,080
If Yang Ying wanted to kill
Troupe Leader Qing Li,

540
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,640
he'd have
countless secretive methods and means.

541
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,900
Why did he have to kill in public?

542
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:37,080
Most performers are impulsive and vulgar.

543
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,510
Maybe Yang Ying was out of his mind

544
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,710
and acted on impulse,

545
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,080
committing this heinous murder.

546
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,980
"Maybe"? Governor Wang,

547
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,510
is this how you solve cases?

548
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,580
Your Highness.

549
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,960
Your Highness, you may not know

550
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,470
that local courts at all levels

551
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,400
have always based their verdicts
on the suspect's confessions.

552
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,430
The former Minister of the Supreme Court,
Shen Yi,

553
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,640
clearly stated in the legal code
he drafted

554
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,100
that case files submitted

555
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:16,290
must include detailed confessions,
postmortem reports, and evidence.

556
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,340
Your claim doesn't make any sense.

557
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,310
Shen Yi was convicted of a felony.

558
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,550
How can the legal code he drafted

559
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,160
be considered valid?

560
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,330
It's still the code
approved by His Majesty

561
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,990
and has never been abolished.

562
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:32,710
Governor Wang, are you trying
to make decisions for His Majesty?

563
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,570
Your Highness,

564
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:39,440
I've had absolute loyalty to His Majesty.

565
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,800
During all my years in office,

566
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:46,190
I've always been diligent in my duties

567
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,720
and cautious in my actions.

568
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,190
I don't seek rapid advancement.

569
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:53,120
All I wish is to serve properly
from beginning to end.

570
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,760
Serve properly from beginning to the end.

571
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,040
Governor Wang,

572
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,880
if you're thinking of hastily closing
this murder case

573
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,140
for a safe retirement,

574
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,730
you've made a grave miscalculation.

575
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,600
I'm confused.

576
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:09,250
Please enlighten me, Your Highness.

577
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,550
The murderer ruined
Prince Yu's birthday banquet

578
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,770
and nearly caused him to pass away.

579
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,200
If you randomly close this case,

580
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,230
how do you think Prince Yu will feel?

581
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,930
If he submits a memorial

582
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,200
to accuse you of disregarding the law

583
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,800
and neglecting your duties,

584
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,750
you'll say goodbye to your dream

585
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,640
of a glorious retirement

586
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,190
and even end up behind bars soon.

587
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,760
Now you know

588
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,410
what to do, right?

589
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:02,120
Thank you for your guidance,
Your Highness.

590
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,210
I swear

591
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,710
I'll get to the bottom of this case.

592
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,800
No more oversights.

593
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,270
I swear on my life.

594
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,360
Guards.

595
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,990
Guards!

596
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,110
[Self-restraint for Loyalty]

597
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,430
Can't believe a provincial governor

598
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,990
needed you to lecture him
on official duties

599
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,470
before he'd do his job properly.

600
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,270
If the imperial court is awash
with such officials,

601
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,800
how can we expect fair laws?

602
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,800
That's exactly what makes

603
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,730
you and your father
so precious with your integrity.

604
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,410
Father spent his whole life

605
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,840
writing the legal code.

606
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,720
Are those false accusations

607
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,120
going to ruin all his efforts?

608
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,470
The most precious work in his life
isn't the legal code,

609
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,180
but you,

610
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,560
his most beloved daughter.

611
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,510
In matters of law,

612
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,180
I'm not your equal.

613
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,880
But in court politics, I'm outdoing you.

614
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,870
Go ahead and focus on upholding justice.

615
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:04,800
I'm here to help you
clear up injustices in the world.

616
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,710
Together,

617
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,130
we won't let Mr. Shen's efforts
be in vain.

618
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:17,990
Thank you.

619
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:39,270
If I were a man,

620
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:44,080
I'd have gone to fight
on the front line long ago

621
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:46,270
instead of getting ready for a marriage

622
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,510
and the continuation

623
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,880
of the bloodline.

624
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,770
I'd travel around the world,

625
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,190
commanding troops on the battlefield!

626
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:56,600
That'd be much better than being confined
to the household.

627
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,140
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

628
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,420
You know what?

629
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:08,040
Though I'm a man,

630
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,550
I'm not that carefree either.

631
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,400
My father, who died young,

632
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,100
earned a prince title with his life,

633
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,400
but it came with no land

634
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,860
and no official position.

635
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,170
I merely hold an empty noble title.

636
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:24,230
Those aristocrats in the capital

637
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,870
all look down on me.

638
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,320
Those who wish to marry me

639
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,670
are all fortune-hunters,
coveting my title.

640
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,200
They're all up to no good.

641
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,470
Yes, exactly.

642
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,360
Those shallow people

643
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,760
don't deserve an unmatched beauty like me.

644
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,800
That's true.

645
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,120
It's rare to see a man

646
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,840
as beautiful as you.

647
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,750
Don't worry. From now on,

648
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:55,960
I'll treat you like my own sister

649
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:58,800
and won't let anyone
take advantage of you.

650
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,190
"Sister"?

651
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,800
No, it should be "bro"!

652
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,660
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

653
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,590
Bro!

654
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:16,460
Since we're good friends now,

655
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:19,830
I should be honest with you, right?

656
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:20,989
Of course.

657
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,179
Actually, that day

658
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:27,719
when Little Wan'er did the autopsy,

659
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,429
I was

660
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,820
closing my eyes.

661
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,350
What?

662
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,170
What did you say?

663
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,389
Can't believe you fooled me!

664
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,150
Good friends should be honest
with each other!

665
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,320
Don't be angry.

666
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:50,840
Didn't expect you to be too scared
to see that too!

667
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:53,770
Come on,

668
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,719
we're good friends in misfortune.

669
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,550
Let's have another drink!

670
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,470
Cheers!

671
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,400
Well,

672
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,000
you fear being schemed in your marriage,

673
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,600
and I fear being confined to a household.

674
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,570
How about

675
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,430
we get married?

676
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,590
As long as you don't interfere
with my heroic deeds,

677
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:19,250
I swear I won't meddle
in your romantic affairs!

678
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,760
Isn't that perfect for both of us?

679
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,520
Bro,

680
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,760
what a brilliant idea!

681
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,590
If this works out,

682
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,960
we can lead a carefree

683
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,310
and unrestrained life,

684
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,950
free of all worries from now on!

685
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:41,990
Nice!

686
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,280
Come on!

687
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:44,910
It's a deal.

688
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,150
Deal!

689
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,240
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

690
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,780
This heartless man!

691
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,110
Were it not for me,

692
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,150
you wouldn't be where you are now!

693
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,930
The Shifang Inn? Come on!

694
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,690
This Qinghui Manor

695
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,350
and even the entire Pang family
should be mine!

696
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,470
[Qinghui Manor]

697
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,880
My Lady, come on.

698
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,510
You're finally back.

699
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,270
You must be exhausted after a day's work.

700
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:39,980
It's okay.

701
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,020
Fuling,

702
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,990
are you blaming me

703
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,740
for making your lady work too hard?

704
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,860
How dare I blame you, Your Highness?

705
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,950
I'm just concerned about my lady.

706
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,470
Then why is your tone so natural

707
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,150
and casual in front of your lady,

708
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,010
but so stiff and formal before me?

709
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,720
You two are different, of course!

710
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:03,990
Fine.

711
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,880
Then I promise

712
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,430
I won't exhaust your lady anymore.

713
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:08,150
Happy now?

714
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,640
That's more like it.

715
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,030
You should go visit Prince Yu

716
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,360
and get some rest early.

717
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,720
If you see Qin Yan,

718
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,840
you might as well give him a hint.

719
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,920
I've figured out
Liu Renli's bribery transactions.

720
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,590
Tell him to be careful
not to get implicated.

721
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,650
Why do you always help the Qin family?

722
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,120
Because as long as you're in this family,

723
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,240
I can't let anything happen to them,

724
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,960
lest you get dragged into it.

725
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,070
This is the same Red Flare
that Yingqi used before.

726
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,150
If I'm not around

727
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,360
when you run into danger,

728
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,620
you can point it toward the sky

729
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,820
and pull the trigger.

730
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,960
I'll come as quickly as I can.

731
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,990
This is an eagle whistle

732
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,610
made for the Shuoxi Army's scouts.

733
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:09,520
Blow it,

734
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,830
and it'll make a sound like a gyrfalcon.

735
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,300
I can hear it within two li.

736
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:21,840
Got it?

737
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,280
I got it.

738
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,920
If you're far from me,

739
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,320
use the Red Flare.

740
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,760
If you're close,

741
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,020
use the eagle whistle.

742
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:34,650
My Lady, let's go back. It's getting cold.

743
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,540
You don't need to get up early tomorrow.

744
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,600
Get some good rest.

745
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,760
If there are any updates
on Qing Li's case,

746
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,090
I'll come to pick you up.

747
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:43,790
Okay.

748
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:44,740
Let's go.

749
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,010
Your Highness,
you should go back to rest as well.

750
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,250
Hope you can deal with Fu Ling soon,

751
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,300
Bai Feng.

752
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,990
Why has Young Master Qin Chen
still not shown up?

753
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,990
You canceled the last appointment.

754
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,230
So waiting a bit longer now is fair.

755
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,960
Don't you know why?

756
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,680
All because Li Muyun and Yan Chi showed up

757
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,400
unexpectedly!

758
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,550
How could I say that?

759
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,510
If Young Master Qin Chen knew
that you were targeted by Yan Chi,

760
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:21,110
he wouldn't recommend you
to the Crown Prince.

761
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,050
Li Muyun is here too.

762
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,110
Everyone knows His Majesty

763
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:27,510
is investigating
the southeast salt transport.

764
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,110
First, you avoided them.

765
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,240
Then you were desperate for a meeting.

766
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,880
Anyone could tell

767
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,880
that you've got something to hide.

768
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,400
The Crown Prince wants people
who can rake in money for him,

769
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,110
not some troublemakers.

770
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,070
So what now?

771
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,510
Anyway,

772
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,080
if I can't turn to the Crown Prince,

773
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,810
you must help me fill the financial hole.

774
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,470
Otherwise, I'm losing not only my job

775
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,510
but also my life!

776
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:58,720
Besides,

777
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,070
without me,

778
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,420
who else will cover up
for your Pang family's business?

779
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,490
What do you all take me for?

780
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,680
A cash cow?

781
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,840
We made an agreement in the first place:

782
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,920
you pursue your career,

783
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,070
she manages her Shuangqing Troupe,

784
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,760
I run my Shifang Inn,

785
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,920
and our profits would be our own business.

786
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,200
That's what you said.

787
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:20,410
Now

788
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,550
you ask me to cover your debts,

789
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,430
and she wants my Shifang Inn.

790
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,500
Why should I do it?

791
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,810
She really asked you for the Shifang Inn?

792
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:29,710
When?

793
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,210
Did she just come to see you?

794
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,330
You already knew she had this plan?

795
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,880
I went to see her a few days ago.

796
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,110
She told me

797
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:54,040
Qing Li lost the Shuangqing Troupe
to someone in a bet

798
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:57,060
and threatened her
with that incident from years ago.

799
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,280
She's just a woman,

800
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,970
terrified out of her wits.

801
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:01,320
I told her not to mention it

802
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,680
to you over and over again,

803
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,510
but still...

804
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,680
What a mess.

805
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,410
But now, Qing Li is dead.

806
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,510
Why does Madam Qin still want

807
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,680
my Shifang Inn?

808
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,720
Just think about it.

809
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,730
She's a woman.

810
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:21,720
She's kept such a stressful secret

811
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,980
in her heart for years.

812
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,680
It's been a real torture.

813
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,720
You're caring about her,

814
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,120
but don't drag me into it.

815
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,880
We're all old now.

816
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,540
Forget about those feelings.

817
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,420
Considering our past friendship,

818
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:37,920
we should just help each other
when we can.

819
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,150
She's only stuck to her good looks
all her life.

820
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,610
Just spare her some money—

821
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,800
enough for her to spend on her hobby.

822
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,580
If she dares to threaten me
with that incident,

823
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,720
she won't get a single copper from me.

824
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,800
What about me?

825
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,400
Will you also stand by and watch me fall?

826
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:06,760
Master,

827
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,080
Young Master Qin Chen has arrived.

828
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,070
Invite him in.

829
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,640
Mr. Pang, Commissioner Liu,

830
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,530
sorry to keep you waiting.

831
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:27,750
