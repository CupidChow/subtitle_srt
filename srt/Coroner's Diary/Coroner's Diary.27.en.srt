[Episode 27]

3
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,280
You didn't sleep again last night.

4
00:01:58,759 --> 00:01:59,590
I'm not tired.

5
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,640
I just wrote down the questionable points

6
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,040
we discussed last night.

7
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,789
Were you woken up
by Prefect Zheng's snoring?

8
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,690
It's alright.

9
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,910
I'm not tired anyway.

10
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,390
It's time for him to head to court.

11
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:27,860
It's okay.

12
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,360
Who dares...

13
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,490
Your Highness.

14
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,870
Prefect Zheng.

15
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,430
You sure slept well.

16
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,870
Your Highness, Princess Yongci,
please forgive me.

17
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,329
I have been discourteous.

18
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,700
His Highness was just
being a bit childish.

19
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,540
Do you feel unwell, Prefect Zheng?

20
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,500
No, not at all.

21
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,000
I was just feeling thirsty.

22
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,190
Your Highness, this gesture of yours

23
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,000
actually felt to me like refreshing rain

24
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,230
after a long drought. Very nice.

25
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,850
Prefect Zheng, you've been working
tirelessly

26
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,220
on the patrol arrangements.

27
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,020
However,

28
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,970
there's another matter that

29
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,690
I need to trouble you with, Prefect Zheng.

30
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,180
Please don't speak of trouble.

31
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,300
Whatever tasks you two have,

32
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,850
just give the order and I'll do it.

33
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,120
Please make a run to
the Ministry of Archives, Prefect Zheng,

34
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,060
to copy the records of
the three murder cases in Guanyin Town

35
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,570
and Fourth Young Master Wu's murder case,

36
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,980
including the weather conditions
and astronomical events of those days,

37
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,220
for future reference in the investigation.

38
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,850
Your Highness may not be aware,

39
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,250
but the monthly astronomical records
are under the Imperial Astrology Bureau,

40
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,940
and are submitted in secret
directly to His Majesty.

41
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,870
I have no authority to access them.

42
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,650
I've heard that you, Prefect Zheng,

43
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,060
and the current Court Diarist

44
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,620
are close friends
who passed the imperial exam together.

45
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,680
Surely he can do you this small favor?

46
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,850
Please rest assured, Your Highness,

47
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,650
I will not fail you.

48
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:50,610
Someone,

49
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,800
quick, bring me my official robe!

50
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,460
How could the Court Diary

51
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,190
contain astronomical records
for Guanyin Town?

52
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,780
I just wanted to give him something to do

53
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,310
so he wouldn't be in our way.

54
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,230
You still suspect Zhang Dongxuan?

55
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,900
As for the Heavenly Way Society,

56
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,980
apart from that old fraud's own claims,

57
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,779
no one can verify its existence.

58
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,209
Besides,

59
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,180
the first body in Guanyin Town

60
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,040
was found right outside his door.

61
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:24,880
And with

62
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,060
these drawings found in his house,

63
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,940
even if he wasn't physically capable of
carrying out the murders himself,

64
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,250
it can't prove
he had nothing to do with it.

65
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,450
But these drawings

66
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,250
might not have been drawn by him.

67
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,810
My father must have verified his story

68
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,100
in Guanyin Town

69
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,360
before believing he wasn't
the real culprit.

70
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,010
I know.

71
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,330
Then why do you still suspect him?

72
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,810
Until there's concrete evidence,

73
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,060
this is merely a matter of belief
or disbelief.

74
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,620
You and Lord Shen choose to believe him,

75
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,860
so you investigate accordingly;

76
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,840
I don't trust him,

77
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,570
so I investigate differently.

78
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,540
This old fraud is skilled at

79
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,980
saying whatever suits the moment.

80
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,540
As long as I remain skeptical,

81
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,740
we won't all end up
being led about at his whim.

82
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,500
All right.

83
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,510
I do have some thoughts
about these drawings.

84
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,370
Why don't we ask him about

85
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,100
the details of the other two murder cases

86
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:08,980
and his investigation process?

87
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,840
We might discover something new.

88
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,790
That old fraud

89
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,500
is quite silver-tongued.

90
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,810
He gets all riled up like a fighting cock
whenever he sees me.

91
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,890
I won't go with you,

92
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,850
so I don't get in the way
while you question him.

93
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,470
Okay.

[Ministry of Justice]

95
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,270
Your Highness seems quite angry today.

96
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,770
If there's anything you want to know,

97
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:31,330
just ask.

98
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,330
You once gave fortune readings
to all three victims

99
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,390
from Guanyin Town.

100
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,540
For the latter two,
were their readings made

101
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,800
before or after the flaying case,

102
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,100
and how much time lay between them?

103
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,370
Of course it was before!

104
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,250
I'm not stupid.

105
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,690
I clearly knew that
those from the Heavenly Way Society

106
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,810
had got their eyes on me.

107
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,540
Why would I still show up
in public to do readings?

108
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,180
If they had discovered me,

109
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,980
wouldn't my life have been over?

110
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,300
Bring them up.

111
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,100
These are folk legends about

112
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,240
various punishments
for evil people after death,

113
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,340
which almost exactly match
the manner of death

114
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,670
of the latter two victims in Guanyin Town.

115
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,250
The second victim

116
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,570
divorced his wife to marry another woman,

117
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,370
falsely accused his ex-wife of infidelity,

118
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,370
and was painfully killed by
having his tongue severed,

119
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,250
corresponding to
the tongue-severing punishment.

120
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,340
The third victim

121
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,180
refused to provide for his aged Father,

122
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,210
drove his Father out in the dead of winter
to freeze and starve to death,

123
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,890
and was tied naked to the frozen river
to freeze to death in the end,

124
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,020
corresponding to the ice punishment.

125
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,250
What are you doing?

126
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,100
Is that right?

127
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,180
Yes.

128
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,490
Then do you know

129
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,750
who hid these drawings in your house?

130
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,300
How do you know
I didn't draw these myself?

131
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,450
What... What are you doing?

132
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:11,250
You... You...

133
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,610
What is this for?

134
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,740
I still had my doubts yesterday,

135
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:16,740
but now,

136
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,990
I can confirm you have hemophobia.

137
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,500
If you're this afraid even of
these drawings,

138
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,830
there's no way you'd be capable of murder.

139
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,130
If those officials knew that

140
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,620
such an illness actually exists
in this world,

141
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,710
then my crimes

142
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,210
would truly be cleared.

143
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,570
Officials aren't all-knowing.

144
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,010
Even physicians

145
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:43,100
might have only read about this illness
in medical texts.

146
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,659
But you shouldn't feel wronged.

147
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:46,330
After all, you did give fortune readings

148
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,450
to all three victims.

149
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,980
If you claim
it was just a coincidence,

150
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,690
it's hard for anyone to believe.

151
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,000
I also know that wasn't a coincidence.

152
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,770
When those three murders happened
one after another,

153
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:56,860
I realized that

154
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,770
the Heavenly Way Society never intended
to let me go.

155
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,720
But what I don't understand is

156
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,840
why they wanted to frame me.

157
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,940
Weren't they worried

158
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,690
I might get caught by government officials

159
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:07,940
and spill everything?

160
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,340
You did tell everything,

161
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,620
but does anyone believe you

162
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,820
other than Lord Shen?

163
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:15,820
That's true.

164
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,500
They already knew that
even if I got caught,

165
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,700
no one would believe
what I said anyway.

166
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,090
By framing you,

167
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,940
they could not only cover their crimes,

168
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,370
but also quietly erase
the existence of the Heavenly Way Society—

169
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,230
killing two birds with one stone.

170
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,690
Such calculation is really terrifying.

171
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,140
Do you know

172
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,220
who the leader of
the Heavenly Way Society is?

173
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,559
No idea.

174
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,659
The Society Leader rarely showed up.

175
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:41,490
All I know is that

176
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,090
he always wears a white mask.

177
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,380
He's a tall, slim man with good posture.

178
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,380
Can't tell his age,

179
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,300
but his voice sounds very steady.

180
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,160
Then what is this
Black Unrighteous Flower you mentioned?

181
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,890
Your Highness has cleared me of suspicion.

182
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,570
I'll never forget your great kindness,

183
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,810
so I'll tell you everything I know.

184
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,070
According to that old man,

185
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,850
the Heavenly Way Society specially
looks for

186
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,420
people like me near government offices,

187
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,610
the miserable ones with grievances
but nowhere to appeal.

188
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,730
He himself suffered great injustice too.

189
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,060
That black-petaled, red-stamened
unrighteous flower pattern

190
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,940
was created by the Society Leader.

191
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,780
I heard

192
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,660
this kind of flower

193
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,090
can only be found at execution sites.

194
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,540
It requires

195
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,260
human blood to bloom—a flower from hell.

196
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,100
Drawing this flower at execution sites

197
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,970
is meant to warn people that

198
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,970
the heavenly way no longer exists,

199
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,120
and evil has spread everywhere.

200
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,930
Everywhere?

201
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,900
Doesn't that mean

202
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,010
as long as
the Heavenly Way Society exists,

203
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:51,990
there will

204
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,270
continue to be murders in this world?

205
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,640
Wan.

206
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,260
Master Wan.

207
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,230
A tongue-severing case has taken place
in the capital too.

208
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,240
So it really is the Heavenly Way Society.

209
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,330
Take him back to the prefect's office.

210
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:22,950
Yes.

211
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:25,940
Be careful, all of you.

212
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,600
Don't contaminate the scene.

213
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,130
Did you see it clearly?

214
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,460
Was his tongue really severed?

215
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,060
I saw it clearly.

216
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,950
There was blood all over his face.

217
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,910
The other day over there,

218
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,730
wasn't there someone who got flayed?

219
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,290
-So brutal.
-Flaying?

220
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,240
Flaying

221
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,380
and tongue-severing...

222
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,940
That's some serious grudge!

223
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,900
I've heard

224
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,180
they were both evildoers,

225
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:49,980
and that's why

226
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,800
they were punished by heaven.

227
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,420
That's still terrifying.

228
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,090
It seems even the capital area
isn't safe anymore.

229
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,330
Exactly.

230
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,020
If the capital prefecture

231
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,350
doesn't give us all a proper explanation,

232
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,300
who among us common folks

233
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,730
would dare go out at night again, right?

234
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,060
Yes! Right!

235
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,780
They must give us an explanation today.

236
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,850
We demand answers!

237
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,060
Everyone step back!

238
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:13,810
Move back!

239
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,980
Step back! This is a crime scene!

240
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,020
Don't come any closer!

241
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,330
I am Princess Yongci,

242
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,090
here by imperial order to investigate
the capital's murder scene

243
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,090
and examine the body.

244
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,320
Everyone, please step back

245
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,920
to preserve the crime scene.

246
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,060
So they sent a princess.

247
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,450
A woman showing her face in public
to examine corpses?

248
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,090
Is she capable of that?

249
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:28,730
Exactly.

250
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,380
Quick, bring in
a brave male coroner instead.

251
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,610
We just want to know who the victim is,

252
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,180
when the murderer will be caught,

253
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,330
and whether we can still go out
at night in the future.

254
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,260
Right! We need answers!

255
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,810
Please stop crowding.

256
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:41,810
If you contaminate the scene

257
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:42,900
and damage evidence,

258
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,330
the real culprit will escape justice

259
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,690
and hide among us.

260
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,750
Perhaps

261
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,090
the next victim

262
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,690
could be someone dear to you.

263
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:50,730
Surely none of you want

264
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,730
to cause such consequences, right?

265
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,160
I am Yan Chi, Deputy Minister of Justice.

266
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,540
The prefect's office will increase
night patrols

267
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,380
to ensure the safety of the people.

268
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,330
As for the victim's identity,

269
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,940
once Princess Yongci
completes the autopsy,

270
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,970
I'll provide you all with an answer.

271
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,440
I think he has a point.

272
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,490
That makes sense.

273
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:12,660
Come on.

274
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,020
Everyone step back.

275
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,930
Move along.

276
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,440
This is a critical period
for the case investigation.

277
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,690
The more time is wasted,

278
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,090
the harder it will be to solve the case.

279
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,660
As citizens of the capital,

280
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,140
you not only enjoy the prosperity
of living under imperial rules,

281
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,200
but also share the responsibility
to safeguard it.

282
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,540
Therefore, you should neither
believe rumors

283
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,000
nor act on your own accord.

284
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,850
Everyone, please step back
and return home

285
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,210
to assist the capital prefecture
with our investigation,

286
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:38,410
so as to bring peace back to the capital.

287
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,840
Come on, everyone. Step back.

288
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,180
Thank you for your cooperation.

289
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,420
I promise you all that

290
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,020
we'll solve this case as soon as possible.

291
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,260
I'll make the sketches,

292
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,660
and you examine the body.

293
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,020
Can Her Highness solve this alone?

294
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,540
Based on the traces here,

295
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,400
it appears someone once hid here,

296
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,940
but it's unclear
whether it was the killer.

297
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,010
Note down where the tongue was severed.

298
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,530
Note this.

299
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,420
There're calluses
on the victim's right ring finger,

300
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,210
likely from years of writing.

301
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,620
The victim was likely a scholar.

302
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,250
The fingers are twisted.

303
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,610
There's a large amount of blood
in his mouth,

304
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,940
indicating the tongue was severed
while he was still alive.

305
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,180
Black petals and red stamens...

306
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,330
Could it be the unrighteous flower?

307
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,590
This appears to be drawn with lead chalk.

308
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,610
This ink also carries a scent of agarwood.

309
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,960
And it's top-quality, submerged agarwood
at that.

310
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,140
Greetings, Your Highness, Princess Yongci.

311
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,850
I've come on order of Prefect Zheng

312
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,180
to sketch the deceased.

313
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,420
Mr. Ning, your painting skills
are exceptional.

314
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,180
Thank you for your efforts.

315
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,330
You flatter me, Princess Yongci.

316
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,610
I didn't get the chance
to thank you earlier, Mr. Ning.

317
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:01,730
I appreciate your hard work, Mr. Ning,

318
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,210
in sketching Fourth Young Master Wu.

319
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,450
Your Highness is too kind.

320
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,050
I'm merely a humble painter.

321
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,660
Being able to do some small things
within my ability for the government

322
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,490
is my humble contribution to

323
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,690
safeguarding the peace of the capital.

324
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,140
Please.

325
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,460
Constable Zhan.

326
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,300
Once Mr. Ning completes the portrait,

327
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,310
post it up

328
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,060
and have the neighborhood chiefs

329
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,810
go to the morgue to identify the body.

330
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:33,450
Yes.

331
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,420
Oh my!

332
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,230
Honey, what a tragic death you suffered!

333
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,540
How am I supposed to live without you!

334
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,220
Mrs. Zhao, are you sure
you know the victim?

335
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,560
He's my husband,

336
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,120
Zhao Jiaxu.

337
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,780
You worked so hard to support our family,

338
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,260
leaving home early and returning late

339
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,730
to teach the children of the Wei family.

340
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,450
Honey...

341
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:13,890
Mrs. Zhao.

342
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,270
Are you saying Mr. Zhao was out
working as a tutor?

343
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,430
It was the Wei family

344
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,270
who insisted that
he teach evening lessons.

345
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,210
Princess Yongci.

346
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,810
Mrs. Zhao, please go home now.

347
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,860
We'll catch the murderer
as soon as possible.

348
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,790
I'll escort her.

349
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,400
This way, Mrs. Zhao.

350
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:39,730
This way.

351
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,460
Did you discover something?

352
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,620
Why didn't you tell Mrs. Zhao about it?

353
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,850
Check out the stains on these pants.

354
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:54,900
This is...

355
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,330
Male essence?

356
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,090
There're also older stains
on these clothes,

357
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,140
which indicates he wasn't out teaching,

358
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,420
but having an affair.

359
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,210
The flaying

360
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,670
and tongue-severing,

361
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,099
such rare coincidental crimes

362
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:11,540
actually occurred twice.

363
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,300
If it wasn't done by
the culprit of the Guanyin Town cases,

364
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,430
who else could it be?

365
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,760
So you don't suspect him anymore?

366
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,510
The pattern at the scene
is already blurred.

367
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:22,900
Sir, can you tell

368
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,780
if this matches the Heavenly Way Society's
unrighteous flower?

369
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,530
Although it's blurry,

370
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,580
the color and general shape are the same.

371
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,900
Is there any particular significance
to the colors?

372
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,380
My family has a secret formula
for making colored chalk sticks.

373
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,450
The lead chalk sticks of these two colors

374
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,290
were specifically prepared by me

375
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,690
at the Society Leader's request.

376
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,450
Did you add submerged agarwood
when making the ink?

377
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,030
Yes.

378
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,670
All the materials were provided
by the Society.

379
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,730
Have you given this secret formula
to anyone else?

380
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,940
To leave the Heavenly Way Society sooner,

381
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,400
I offered the formula
to the Society Leader.

382
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:03,530
So this time,

383
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,830
could it be the Society Leader himself
who did it?

384
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,350
This murder case

385
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:11,340
is far more brutal than the previous ones.

386
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,150
If they stopped

387
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,970
after three executions back then

388
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,010
to avoid drawing attention
from the government,

389
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,050
why would they dare
to commit such brazen crimes

390
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,250
under the emperor's nose
after lying low for five years?

391
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,070
Perhaps they never truly lay low.

392
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,380
They simply moved their actions
to the capital.

393
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,340
The capital?

394
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,250
Why the capital?

395
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,340
Acting on Heaven's behalf...

396
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,290
Heavenly Way...

397
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,470
Could it be His Majesty?

398
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,420
That I truly don't know.

399
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,000
These are all just speculations.

400
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,530
Whatever the Heavenly Way Society
is plotting,

401
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,010
we cannot allow them to continue
their brutal killings.

402
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,540
But now, there are too few
clues and evidence.

403
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,970
What else do you know about
that Society Leader?

404
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,490
The Society Leader values rituals
and propriety greatly,

405
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,690
and believes in following
the way of heaven.

406
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,860
Everything must be done according to

407
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,660
the calendar and proper timing.

408
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,550
According to the Society Leader,

409
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:13,660
disrupting the order is equivalent to
disrupting heaven's timing.

410
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,050
In that case,

411
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,680
that Society Leader must be someone with

412
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,450
a high opinion of himself
and extremely strict self-discipline.

413
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,250
His rules won't change on a whim,

414
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,940
and his order of executions

415
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,420
won't be easily altered either.

416
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,180
The Heavenly Way Society's
execution methods

417
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,420
are derived from the folk legends of hell,

418
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,210
and they select victims
according to a specific order.

419
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,100
The first cases in both Guanyin Town
and the capital

420
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,560
were skin-flaying cases,

421
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,830
followed by tongue-severing cases.

422
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,810
The next one

423
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,750
will be the ice case.

424
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,730
Since you're skilled at fortune-telling,

425
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:46,730
shouldn't you also be able to

426
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,070
predict the time and location
of the murders?

427
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,870
Your Highness flatters me.

428
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,660
I just read some books

429
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,250
when I was young and learned a bit.

430
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,620
All I did was
read people's expressions

431
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,750
and tell them what they wanted to hear
to make some money.

432
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,640
No one else can know about
tonight's matter.

433
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,010
If you can figure out

434
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,010
the connection between the solar terms,

435
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:11,580
time, and location of
the three murder cases in Guanyin Town,

436
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,980
I'll release you from prison immediately.

437
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,660
Are you trying to use this method

438
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,460
to predict the time and location
of the next crime?

439
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,490
You old fraud.

440
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,450
I mean, Mr. Zhang, according to you,

441
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,910
since that Society Leader

442
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,940
values celestial timing and calendar
so much,

443
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,380
he should adhere even more to
the right time and location.

444
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,100
As long as we figure out

445
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,210
the pattern behind these vigilante cases
in Guanyin Town,

446
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,050
we can take precautions in advance.

447
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:35,580
Exactly.

448
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,860
Your Highness, Princess Yongci.

449
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,100
When do you plan to release me
from this prison?

450
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,970
I've been in this dungeon for five years

451
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,180
without even touching a single book.

452
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,530
I need to go back and prepare properly,

453
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,860
so as not to mess up
this important matter.

454
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:48,570
Tonight,

455
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,340
I'll document your illness and hemophobia

456
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,710
and submit it to His Highness, Mr. Zhang.

457
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,330
Tomorrow,

458
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,320
I'll release you from prison.

459
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,560
[Map of Guanyin Town]

460
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,840
How did you think of using Zhang Dongxuan

461
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,900
to deduce the time and location
of the crime?

462
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,360
It was truly a genius move.

463
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,340
I only know
how to utilize people's talents.

464
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,490
You cleared his name
with just a drop of blood.

465
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,820
That's some real skill.

466
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,730
I genuinely admire you.

467
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,060
Spare me your flattery.

468
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,860
These are the divination records
of Guanyin Town.

469
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,820
Tomorrow, I'll give them to Mr. Zhang,

470
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,580
so he can examine
whether the Guanyin Town cases

471
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,690
had any special

472
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,210
celestial characteristics back then.

473
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,340
You really found it?

474
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,580
I thought you were just trying

475
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,110
to get rid of Prefect Zheng.

476
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,250
I was truly looking for it,

477
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,940
but also truly wanted to get rid of him.

478
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,270
There's one more thing.

479
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,140
The prefect of Luozhou, which
Guanyin Town belonged to at that time,

480
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:01,970
was Li Muyun.

481
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,420
Then why isn't Li Muyun's signature

482
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,180
on the Ministry of Justice's case files?

483
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,420
Because he never
got involved in this case.

484
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,530
Three murder cases in a row

485
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,050
directly alarmed the Ministry of Justice,

486
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,770
so they took over the cases immediately.

487
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:16,860
Then could it be that
the transcripts and annotations from

488
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,450
when my father re-investigated the case
were all destroyed by Li Muyun?

489
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,910
He joined the Supreme Court
after this case.

490
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,210
Logically speaking,

491
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:25,210
he wouldn't have had the opportunity.

492
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:29,010
What if he destroyed them
after that incident happened to my father?

493
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,290
But this case has no connection
to Prince Jin's case.

494
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:36,090
Li Muyun would have no reason
to go to such trouble.

495
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,100
This major case in Guanyin Town
happened under his jurisdiction,

496
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,900
so he couldn't possibly be unaware of it.

497
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,820
There must be some connection here.

498
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,010
But what could it be?

499
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,080
Don't overthink it for now.

500
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,350
You need to have some good rest.

501
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,900
But there are still
so many unresolved matters.

502
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,100
No matter how many problems there are,

503
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,160
I'll be with you every step of the way.

504
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,620
Let's take it step by step.

505
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,050
There'll always be light
at the end of the tunnel,

506
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,650
so no need to rush things now.

[Marquis of Zhongyong's Mansion]

508
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:16,940
Lord Yan always sends you out
to do all sorts of tasks.

509
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,250
Let's go, hurry.

510
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,230
Hurry up.

511
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:30,940
It seems

512
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,490
that my autopsy work

513
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,340
is known to everyone
in this household now.

514
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,350
They're all just ignorant people.

515
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,180
My Lady, you're performing autopsies
by imperial order,

516
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,040
yet they actually look down on us.

517
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,490
My Lady, please don't take it to heart.

518
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,860
Just go back and have a good rest.

519
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,140
I'll go buy you something delicious,

520
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,660
so you'll have something warm to eat
as soon as you wake up.

521
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,340
It seems

522
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,470
Bai Feng has taken you out quite often.

523
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,840
I only hung out with him
to find nice things for you, My Lady.

524
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,940
Is that Mo Yu from Aunt's household?

525
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,470
Who else could it be but her?

526
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,050
When you weren't home, My Lady,

527
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,530
she came every day to snoop around,

528
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,580
and I never said a single kind word
to her.

529
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,210
In the next few days,

530
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,260
pack up my things.

531
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,690
We'll be moving out.

532
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,030
My Lady, are you marrying Lord Yan?

533
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,210
Don't talk nonsense.

534
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,830
Who said I'm marrying him?

535
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:20,770
You're not?

536
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:21,860
But if you're not getting married,

537
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,080
how can we move out?

538
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,530
If a woman's capable,

539
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:26,940
she can go anywhere she wants

540
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,140
and live well without needing to marry.

541
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:30,660
I should be asking you.

542
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,320
Have you decided to marry him?

543
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,010
Of course not!

544
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,450
My Lady, you once said

545
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,250
a woman should see herself as precious

546
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,110
and not beg for a man's affection.

547
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,430
I won't be a concubine.

548
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,470
No matter how well you
and His Highness treat me,

549
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,620
My Lady, it's still not acceptable.

550
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,880
What are you thinking?

551
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,250
The "him" I was referring to

552
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,220
is General Bai.

553
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,860
My Lady,

554
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:53,620
we should go.

555
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,290
Why are you being shy?

556
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,140
I'm not. Stop it.

557
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,550
Madam.

558
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,310
Lady Wan has returned.

559
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,660
I've been out gathering information.

560
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,010
She's been conducting autopsy
by imperial order these days,

561
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:09,100
either at the capital prefecture
or at the morgue.

562
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,690
Everyone knows about it now.

563
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,050
Even with an imperial order
to conduct autopsy,

564
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,660
she's still practicing
a despicable profession.

565
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,590
She can forget about
ever being compared to Yu again.

566
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,250
Please rest assured, Madam.

567
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,010
I've had someone

568
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:22,210
make note of everything she's touched.

569
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,770
As soon as she's married off,
we'll burn them all

570
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,010
to avoid bad luck.

571
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:28,950
All right. Let's do it.

572
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:48,760
This way.

573
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:00,620
Careful!

574
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,420
What are you two doing,
lurking outside someone's door?

575
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,250
What?

576
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,440
What are you doing?

577
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,150
What do you think I'm doing?

578
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:08,900
I...

579
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,750
That lady's silhouette looked familiar
to me.

580
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:15,410
I think she might be
one of my former lovers.

581
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,000
May I ask which house she works at?

582
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,010
The Fengqi House.

583
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,820
She was redeemed by a man surnamed Zhao
over a year ago,

584
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,340
kept here as his mistress.

585
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:29,420
Disgusting.

586
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:34,820
You men

587
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,140
are all no good!

588
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,250
Zhao Jiaxu's wife trusted him so much,

589
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,510
yet he kept a mistress!

590
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:42,250
He deserved having his tongue severed!

591
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,590
That's why I'll either stay single

592
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,750
or never keep a mistress if I marry.

593
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,940
I absolutely cannot let outsiders

594
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,880
take advantage of us.

595
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,340
You make it sound nice,

596
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:02,260
but who knows
who'll be taking advantage of whom?

597
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,810
Let's go.

598
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,530
Why are you flirting with me in public?

599
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,660
Let's quickly inform Constable Zhan.

600
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,820
Princess Yongci and I have confirmed

601
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,290
that the two murder cases in the capital

602
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:16,620
are connected to the Guanyin Town murders.

603
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,820
If we don't report to His Majesty now

604
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,970
to deploy more guards and impose a curfew,

605
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,830
I fear there will be more victims.

606
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,380
But His Majesty never intended

607
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,040
to cause panic in the capital.

608
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,200
What if he blames us for spreading fear?

609
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,330
We have too few leads at hand right now.

610
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,820
If we don't create some obstacles

611
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,680
for the killer,

612
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,620
we might not even get close
to catching them

613
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,690
before His Majesty has your head.

614
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:41,380
Perhaps we should consult with
Minister Li about this.

615
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,890
His Majesty trusts him greatly,

616
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,290
and he was ordered to oversee this case.

617
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,770
If he's the one to propose the curfew,
it would be...

618
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,230
Draft the memorial first,

619
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,210
and I'll accompany you and Li Muyun
to present it to His Majesty.

620
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,690
As you command, Your Highness.

621
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,490
Master!

622
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,690
Master, something terrible has happened.

623
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:55,380
What is it?

624
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,690
Prince Rui has reported

625
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:58,420
that there're discrepancies
in the Shuoxi Army's provisions.

626
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,530
He says the grain sent

627
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:01,130
contained moldy old millet,

628
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,010
and the Shuoxi Army is now
nearly out of provisions.

629
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:04,450
His Majesty has urgently summoned you
back to the palace

630
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,580
to discuss countermeasures, Master.

631
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,490
Chi.

632
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:08,940
You've come at the right time.

633
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,180
His Majesty has summoned me to the palace,

634
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,290
so I'm entrusting Wan's safety
to you and Yue Ning.

635
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,290
Don't you let her face danger alone.

636
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,590
Don't worry.

637
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,170
Ning and I won't leave her side
for a moment.

638
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,000
Now is not the time to assign blame

639
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,260
for corruption in military provisions.

640
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:27,420
Resolving the provision supply
is our top priority now.

641
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:30,250
But this year's taxes
haven't been collected yet,

642
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:34,110
and the Ministry of Revenue cannot spare
any resources at the moment.

643
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,140
Then we shall borrow.

644
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:38,180
From where can we transport provisions

645
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:38,940
the fastest?

646
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,860
Your Majesty.

647
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,860
Liangzhou is closest to
the Shuoxi garrison,

648
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,770
and with favorable weather
these past two years,

649
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,180
they should have grain reserves.

650
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,210
After covering the city residents' needs,

651
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:57,180
there should be over a month's supply
left for the army.

652
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,180
I concur, Father.

653
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,860
If we can have a month's buffer,

654
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,780
the Ministry of Revenue can arrange for
new provisions.

655
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,820
In that case,

656
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:07,860
Crown Prince, you shall personally
make a run to Liangzhou.

657
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,530
Such an important matter
cannot be entrusted to others.

658
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:11,900
You should depart immediately,

659
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,050
ride swiftly,

660
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:17,050
and personally deliver
the provisions to Shuoxi.

661
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,900
Even if it's just surplus grain,

662
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,100
you must personally oversee its allocation

663
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,210
to ensure the army's winter provisions.

664
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,570
As you command, Father.

665
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:35,290
To think someone would dare
tamper with military provisions.

666
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,820
It shows that

667
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,420
I've been too lenient in issuing orders.

668
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:40,850
Chi.

669
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,300
I appoint you as Investigating Censor.

670
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:46,280
You must root out this corrupt worm,

671
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,290
and even if it involves
members of the imperial family,

672
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,620
no mercy shall be shown.

673
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:53,180
Better to imprison and behead more

674
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,340
than to let a single one escape.

675
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,800
As you command, Your Majesty.

676
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,340
That Zheng fellow knows nothing

677
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,540
but asking for money.

678
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,050
He's been loitering in the Shuoxi Army
for a year,

679
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:11,510
yet he still hasn't accomplished anything.

680
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,340
Useless.

681
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:14,630
The army's not like the court.

682
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:16,210
You can't just pass exams

683
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:18,660
and find a mentor to rise step by step.

684
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:21,620
Those soldiers are bound
by life-and-death loyalty,

685
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,590
so for a newcomer like him,

686
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,690
standing out is far from easy.

687
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,380
This Shuoxi Army provisions case
is a perfect opportunity

688
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,100
for him to climb a few steps up,

689
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,700
and our long-term plan in the army
won't be in vain.

690
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:38,010
But His Majesty has appointed Yan Chi
as Investigating Censor.

691
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:41,790
I fear that after all his investigating,

692
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,690
they might end up wiping out

693
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:44,770
our own people.

694
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,820
Then all the money we've spent

695
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,420
and the manpower we've gathered
over the years

696
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,210
would be for nothing, wouldn't it?

697
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,740
Mother, you worry too much.

698
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,010
Prince Rui and his son, Yan Chi,
have never gotten along.

699
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:58,140
Yan Chi has no control over Prince Rui.

700
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,710
When the time is right,

701
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,050
I'll find some scapegoats

702
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,450
to present to Prince Rui.

703
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,910
As long as Prince Rui is convinced,

704
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,530
there's nothing Yan Chi can do.

705
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,970
The Crown Prince is weak and incompetent.

706
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,070
As for such an important task
as delivering provisions,

707
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,190
why would your father send him?

708
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,580
Why else?

709
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,310
Obviously to build up

710
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,150
his reputation as the heir.

711
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,900
No matter how much you resent
that Zhao Shuhua, Mother,

712
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,690
the Crown Prince

713
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,940
was born from the Empress's womb.

714
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:30,270
Whether by legitimacy

715
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,360
or seniority,

716
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,400
his status is unshakable.

717
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,660
There's no arguing about legitimacy,

718
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,290
but when it comes to seniority and merit,

719
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,490
how could Zhao Shuhua's son deserve it?

720
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,470
If Prince Jin hadn't died,

721
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,120
her son wouldn't even
be considered senior!

722
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,560
Mother, just listen to me.

723
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:51,450
As long as Father doesn't mention
deposing the Crown Prince,

724
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,500
we shouldn't make unnecessary trouble.

725
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,630
The Marquis of Zhongyong is an old fox.

726
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:57,180
Even if the Crown Prince takes the throne,

727
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,640
he won't have an easy time.

728
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,510
If we can help depose the Crown Prince,

729
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,250
we'll go with the flow.

730
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,490
If Yan Che really takes that throne,

731
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,450
I,

732
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,180
being a prince with real power,

733
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:13,820
would surely live a better life
than that pathetic emperor.

734
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,860
That won't do.

735
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:16,940
I definitely cannot allow Zhao Shuhua

736
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,600
to flaunt her power before me.

737
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:21,180
The two of us entered the palace

738
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:23,730
and married His Majesty on the same day.

739
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,250
Just because
she's two years older than me,

740
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,640
she was made Empress.

741
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:28,700
On what grounds?

742
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,530
Until the very end,

743
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,580
no one can make me admit defeat!

744
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,900
Mother.

745
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,420
I too

746
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,520
wish to fulfill your desires.

747
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,020
However,

748
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,940
planning this
requires careful arrangements

749
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,540
to secure people's loyalty.

750
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,140
You

751
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,530
should be more frugal.

752
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,940
To accomplish great things,

753
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,220
who knows how much longer
we'll have to scheme?

754
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,720
Thank you, Mother.

755
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,040
Please rest assured, Mother.

756
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,070
Once I

757
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,480
have control over

758
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,540
the Shuoxi Army's command,

759
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:12,060
I'll make sure that Zhao Shuhua

760
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:15,170
can't hold her head up in your presence.

761
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,050
You've gone another night without sleep.

762
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:45,250
Ning told me about
the military provision case.

763
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,710
Is there anything I can do?

764
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:47,910
No need.

765
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,530
These are just petty tricks,

766
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:50,900
no need for your involvement.

767
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,210
However, I won't be able

768
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,970
to be with you all the time
for the time being.

769
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:56,100
If you need anything, just tell Yan Li.

770
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,730
Greetings, Princess Yongci.

771
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,290
W-What's going on here?

772
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,380
It wasn't in vain for a charming prince
like me to play coachman

773
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,110
after all.

774
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,340
Ever since Chi learned that
I gave my fine horse

775
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,610
to Ning,

776
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,870
he's been planning to give you
something even better.

777
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,159
That's why I...

778
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:28,570
I had planned
to gift you a carriage long ago.

779
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,690
It's just I only got it today.

780
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,969
I often see you coming and going
from the Marquis Mansion.

781
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:34,780
Borrowing a carriage isn't convenient,

782
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,050
and riding a horse yourself

783
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,380
exposes you to wind and sun,

784
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,090
so...

785
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,010
Though this carriage is small,

786
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:43,449
it's made entirely of ironwood,

787
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:44,489
resistant to fire

788
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:46,650
and impenetrable by ordinary swords.

789
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:50,270
This carriage has far more features
than just those.

790
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:57,220
Little Wan'er, let me show you something.

791
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,880
Look.

792
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,450
All these panels contain
separate medicine compartments.

793
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:02,820
And your precious coroner's kit

794
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,650
can be stored in this hidden compartment.

795
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:06,240
There's also this portable table,

796
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,350
fully equipped with

797
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,560
tea sets, snacks, and rain gear.

798
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,190
Beneath it is a complete set of bedding,

799
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,190
specially for your rest on the road.

800
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,290
No need to thank me.

801
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:18,140
If you really feel the need to repay me,

802
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,170
just

803
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,570
embroider a small pouch for me.
That'll do.

804
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:23,400
But

805
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,640
I don't know how to do needlework.

806
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,700
You don't even know
how to embroider a pouch?

807
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,340
So what? I don't know either.

808
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,900
That's actually better.

809
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:37,010
Only those sheltered women
from the inner chambers

810
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,210
would do such things.

811
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,860
A true heroine

812
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,190
would never bother with

813
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,880
such mundane matters, right?

814
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:46,090
Right. I agree with him.

815
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,020
Anyway,

816
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,970
I'll just give you something
I made myself.

817
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:54,740
Yes, that was my plan from the beginning.

818
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,500
Those two are truly
a match made in heaven.

819
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,610
Chi's finally getting it.

820
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,570
Just go ahead with your business.

821
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:05,450
I'll

822
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:07,700
go to the Supreme Court later to review
the files of the Guanyin Town cases,

823
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,530
and also check

824
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,340
Lord Shen's previous records
while I'm at it.

825
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,140
Li Muyun isn't easy to deal with.

826
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,130
Why not wait a few days
so we can go together?

827
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,790
Prefect Zheng will go with me.

828
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,500
Don't worry.

829
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,210
I'll be careful

830
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,420
and play it by ear.

831
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,860
As long as you know what you're doing.

832
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,420
The house is all set.

833
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:31,130
I'll come see you
once I'm done with my work.

834
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:36,050
Ning.

835
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,620
Seeing how lovey-dovey Chi
and Little Wan'er are,

836
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:42,420
it seems getting married
isn't such a bad idea.

837
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,820
If you want to get married, then do it.

838
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,950
Why tell me about it?

839
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,780
I never said I wanted to marry you.

840
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,580
Why are you getting so worked up?

841
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:54,610
[Supreme Court]

842
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:52,970
Your Highness.

843
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,780
All files of unsolved and pending cases

844
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,130
are kept in this archive.

845
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,380
I wonder when Minister Li's
approval documents will arrive?

846
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,050
Once I receive them,

847
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,530
I can properly account for everything.

848
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:01,780
Prefect Zheng will have them delivered.

849
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,450
Your Highnesses.

850
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:03,910
-Your Highness!
-Please.

851
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,900
Princess Yongci is here by imperial decree
to investigate the case.

852
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,450
Why are you being so obstructive?

853
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:08,130
Are you deliberately stalling?

854
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,420
No, no, I wouldn't dare.

855
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,080
I'll open the door for Your Highness
right away.

856
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,240
Your Highness.

857
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,220
Are these the files?

858
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:15,950
Yes.

859
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,010
Your Highness, just locate the cabinet

860
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:20,210
following the corresponding numbers.

861
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:56,540
Father.

862
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,780
I'm finally here.

863
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:12,900
Lower left side.

864
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:18,720
Stay calm.

865
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:20,090
Stay calm.

866
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,940
I must find the files of
Father's and Prince Jin's cases

867
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,260
before Li Muyun arrives.

868
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,400
Prince Jin's case.

869
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,920
Why aren't Father's case files here?

870
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,700
Where could they possibly be?

871
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,200
Father...

872
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:59,480
Thank you, Mr. Li, for making an exception
for Her Highness.

873
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,110
You flatter me, Mr. Zheng.

874
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:04,190
This case is also my responsibility.

875
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:11,530
The flaying case remains unclear,

876
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,530
and now we have this tongue-severing case.

877
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,090
I truly fear I can't escape

878
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,290
a flogging this time.

879
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,380
Li Muyun is here.

880
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,310
Go ask Little Wan'er
how much longer she needs.

881
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:22,000
Even if we just find a few suspects,

882
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,940
things would be easier for both of us.

883
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,140
Little Wan'er, would you like some tea?

884
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,420
Half a cup will do.

885
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,540
Just hold on for half a cup of tea.

886
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:43,330
Where are you two headed?

887
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,920
I didn't know Your Highness was here.

888
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:48,570
Please pardon me

889
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:50,430
for any rudeness, Your Highness.

890
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,860
It's fine.

891
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,510
Sorry to keep you waiting, Your Highness.

892
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,300
The waiting isn't a problem,

893
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,380
but this place is so dreary,

894
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:03,820
without even a spot to have tea or rest.

895
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,820
I had to just sit here and do nothing.

896
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,530
The Supreme Court is a place
of law enforcement,

897
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:11,130
not meant for idle visitors.

898
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:13,090
If Your Highness is displeased,

899
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,900
you're welcome
to report it to His Majesty.

900
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,530
You...

901
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:16,700
Oh no.

902
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,280
I've lost count of
how many finger snaps it's been.

903
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,010
Has it been half a cup of tea yet?

904
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,660
Little Wan'er, hurry up!

905
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:24,660
I can't hold on much longer!

906
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,530
I still have official duties to attend to.

907
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,020
If Your Highness
has no further instructions,

908
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,220
please allow me to proceed with my work.

909
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,720
I haven't finished speaking yet!

910
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:44,630
You...

911
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,900
Minister Li, what happened?

912
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,170
I don't know what happened,

913
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:57,300
but he pushed me.

914
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:58,400
Minister Li.

915
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:01,190
Why have you upset
Princess Yongning like this?

916
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,940
I was worried Princess Yongci
would be criticized

917
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,010
for entering the storeroom
without permission,

918
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:07,340
so I specially came with Prefect Zheng
to deliver the approval documents.

919
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,130
However,

920
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,010
I don't understand why Princess Yongning
was blocking me?

921
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:13,700
It was because
I didn't want to be disturbed

922
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,560
that I asked Princess Yongning
to keep watch outside.

923
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,610
I see.

924
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,450
Then I was being presumptuous.

925
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,940
I'll go deliver the approval documents
to the treasury office right away.

926
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,400
Minister Li, please wait.

927
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:30,170
I have one more matter to inquire about.

928
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,340
Please go ahead, Your Highness.

929
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,050
In the murder cases of Guanyin Town,

930
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:36,220
the witness testimonies
against Zhang Dongxuan

931
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,080
can only prove that
he had contact with the victims,

932
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,050
but no one witnessed him
committing the crime,

933
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:43,310
nor is there any concrete evidence
placing him at the scene.

934
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,970
Yesterday, I also confirmed that

935
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:46,740
Zhang Dongxuan indeed
suffers from hemophobia.

936
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,050
He can't possibly be the culprit
behind the Guanyin Town cases.

937
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:50,820
Minister Li, Prefect Zheng.

938
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:53,950
Would you agree to declare him innocent
and release him?

939
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,900
Princess Yongci, your medical skills
are unmatched.

940
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,700
With Your Highness as guarantor,

941
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,650
I will immediately

942
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:01,940
arrange for his release.

943
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:02,710
Besides,

944
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:05,570
since Shen Yi classified this case
as a suspicious case,

945
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:06,860
why are there no notes from him

946
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:09,720
marking the questionable points
in the case files?

947
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,070
It was my oversight.

948
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:14,370
I will immediately have someone

949
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:16,110
investigate this matter.

950
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:19,130
I'll trouble you with this matter then,
Minister Li.

951
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,220
With the help of Shen Yi's clues,

952
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,170
perhaps we could

953
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:24,940
prevent another Guanyin Town tragedy
from happening in the capital.

954
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,340
Your Highness speaks wisely.

955
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,820
I will definitely spare no effort.

956
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,940
Princess Yongci. Prefect Zheng.

957
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:37,220
There's been a murder in the ice cellar
of Zuixian Restaurant, west of the city.

958
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,280
Good heavens.

959
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,580
Can't they let us have a moment of peace?

960
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:42,740
Your Highness...

961
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,420
We'll head to the scene right away.

962
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,280
I'm coming too.

963
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,220
She didn't come here for Shen Yi.

964
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:04,190
Could it be she's not Shen Wan?

965
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:18,780
[Imperial Files]

966
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:24,350
So she came for Prince Jin.
