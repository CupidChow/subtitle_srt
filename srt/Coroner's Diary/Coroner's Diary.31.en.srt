00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,910
[Episode 31]

3
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,240
What are you doing?

4
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,430
You dare to kill me?

5
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:40,990
Yan Chi.

6
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,500
Yan Chi.

7
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,610
What are you going to do?

8
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,229
You wouldn't dare.

9
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,200
You wouldn't dare!

10
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,070
How dare you?

11
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,610
Yan Chi! You wouldn't dare!

12
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,150
Don't!

13
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,070
Don't!

14
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,260
Let's go.

15
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,890
Yan Chi,

16
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,990
it's war between us now!

17
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,780
Why did you take the risk alone?

18
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,060
With the arranged marriage list,

19
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,380
I suspected Yan Qi was behind it,

20
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,829
so I wanted to see what he was up to.

21
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,160
I never expected

22
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,530
he would be even more

23
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,790
audacious and shameless than I thought.

24
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,579
Did they hurt you anywhere else?

25
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,400
Do you think I'm tainted now?

26
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,570
Of course not.

27
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,750
I just feel I failed to protect you—

28
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,080
that's why you got hurt.

29
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,570
Wan,

30
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,280
you don't have to think about
anything now.

31
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,190
Just get ready to be my bride.

32
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,340
The humiliation I suffered today—

33
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,190
I'll repay it double.

34
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,440
I'll repay it double.

35
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,060
Your Highness!

36
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,380
Your Highness, you...

37
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,070
What's wrong?

38
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,520
Are you hurt?

39
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,420
What are you doing here?

40
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,780
You didn't come back last night.

41
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,750
The Noble Consort was so worried
she couldn't sleep.

42
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,660
I thought maybe you went night hunting

43
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,890
on a whim,

44
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,560
but I was afraid something might've
happened to you,

45
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,910
so I came to find you.

46
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,149
What's going on here?

47
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,130
I...

48
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,600
Greeting, Your Highness.

49
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,000
So, you and Feng Chenbi have long

50
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,620
had feelings for each other.

51
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,840
Then I

52
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,360
shall not disturb you.

53
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,159
Let's go.

54
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,800
Your Highness.

55
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,120
You did that on purpose just now.

56
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,810
Your Highness.

57
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,580
I...

58
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,320
I truly care about you.

59
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,910
Truly?

60
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,200
Did you also "truly" care

61
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,560
for the Crown Prince before?

62
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,320
Feng Chenbi,

63
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,230
drop the act.

64
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,840
I know

65
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,130
better than you what kind of heart
hides under

66
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,430
that painted face.

67
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,260
I don't want your heart.

68
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,970
So why care about mine?

69
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,010
I just want a husband

70
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,920
who can rival the Crown Prince—

71
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,210
someone who can put me on equal footing
with Qin Zhaoyu,

72
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,260
or even help me enter the Eastern Palace
one day as Crown Princess,

73
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,260
and eventually become the Empress.

74
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,700
What's wrong with that?

75
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,550
Don't play this game with me.

76
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:50,980
Tell me,

77
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,690
who sent you here?

78
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,750
Speak!

79
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,970
No one!

80
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,370
You people from the Feng family...

81
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:59,620
are really...

82
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,500
Your Highness,

83
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,810
as long as you're willing to marry me
as your primary consort,

84
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,340
there's so much our Feng family
can do for you.

85
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,460
I can't stand Qin Zhaoyu,

86
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,060
and you can't stand the Crown Prince

87
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,740
or Yan Chi.

88
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,250
How could you take on both of them alone?

89
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,260
We can join forces

90
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,860
to deal with them together.

91
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,830
There's only one.

92
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,990
Only the Crown Prince!

93
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,430
So Feng Chenbi really does want to
become Princess Consort Cheng.

94
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,250
Prince Cheng.

95
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,330
Prince Cheng.

96
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,060
I, Qin Xiang,
respectfully greet Your Highness.

97
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:10,820
Your surname is Qin?

98
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,830
Then you and Qin Wan...

99
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,210
I dare not hide from Your Highness.

100
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,470
I'm the fifth sister of Princess Yongci.

101
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,450
You came here so early in the morning

102
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,050
just to let your grandmother

103
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,860
try your fried fish?

104
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,710
Grandmother,

105
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,210
you may not know this,

106
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:02,580
but this fish

107
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,860
is called peach blossom fish.

108
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,620
It's only available

109
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,180
when the peach trees
are in full bloom every year,

110
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,620
and it's incredibly fresh and delicious.

111
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,500
We hold hunting banquets every year.

112
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,980
I've never heard of
any peach blossom fish.

113
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,980
Did these fish

114
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,060
swim here on their own?

115
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,130
Grandmother, if you like it,

116
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,830
I'll bring it to you every year
as a token of my filial respect.

117
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,500
A token of your filial respect?

118
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,330
Not because of that fight
with Qi yesterday?

119
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,690
That little scuffle's hardly worth
bothering you over.

120
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,250
besides, I didn't really hurt him.

121
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,140
So...

122
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,150
why are you being

123
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,610
so attentive?

124
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:37,770
Tell the truth.

125
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,140
If you don't,

126
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:40,850
I'm not eating

127
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,780
this token of your filial respect.

128
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,800
Then I'll tell you the truth.

129
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,540
I sincerely wish to marry Princess Yongci

130
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,900
as my primary consort,

131
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,120
and I humbly ask for your decree
to grant this marriage.

132
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,020
You always made excuses

133
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,810
whenever I mentioned the marriage before.

134
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,220
Why are you suddenly asking
to marry Wan today?

135
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,300
I dare not hide it from you.

136
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,060
Princess Yongci has many admirers.

137
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,510
I've long admired her

138
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,280
and can't wait any longer.

139
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,060
That's honest of you.

140
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,540
But

141
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,660
I've allowed Wan
to choose her own marriage.

142
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,940
If you want me to grant her to you,

143
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,300
she must agree first.

144
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,560
Otherwise, people will say

145
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,210
I'm abusing my power.

146
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,470
Grandmother,

147
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,730
please stop teasing me.

148
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,100
With your keen eyes,

149
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,450
can't you see

150
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,420
we've long been in love?

151
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,230
Since that's the case,

152
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,250
I have a question for you.

153
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:48,130
Wan is no ordinary girl.

154
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,520
Can you promise never to betray her?

155
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,270
I, Yan Chi, swear here that

156
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,140
if I ever betray her,
may heaven strike me down

157
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,870
and disown me from the Yan clan.

158
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,890
Thank you, Grandmother.

159
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,470
There was so much chaos during

160
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,580
the Double Third Festival hunt!

161
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,730
It's utterly disgraceful!

162
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,740
It's my fault for failing in my duty
as an elder brother.

163
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,200
Please punish me, Father.

164
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:30,890
Punish you?

165
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,900
How should I punish you?

166
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,620
A prince and a royal heir

167
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,780
fought over a single prey.

168
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,710
If word gets out,

169
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,920
what will become
of the royal family's dignity?

170
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,300
The Noble Consort is here!

171
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,420
Your Majesty!

172
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,610
Your Majesty!

173
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,490
Your Majesty,

174
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,540
Zhang is the only son
of my maternal family.

175
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,140
Now he's dead
under suspicious circumstances.

176
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,780
I beg you to investigate thoroughly

177
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,490
and seek justice for me!

178
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,210
A weapon knows no friend or foe.

179
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,070
How am I supposed to investigate?

180
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,420
Then investigate those who

181
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,440
were at the hunt.

182
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:07,900
Arrest them all

183
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,210
and question them one by one.

184
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,730
We'll surely discover something.

185
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,090
You're being ridiculous.

186
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,540
I was also at the hunt.

187
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,570
Injuries and deaths during a hunt

188
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,030
are inevitable.

189
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,060
Your Feng family lost a son,

190
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,580
and now you expect me,

191
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,540
the Crown Prince, and Prince Cheng

192
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,730
to be arrested and interrogated?

193
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,060
Enough.

194
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,150
This

195
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,740
was purely an accident.

196
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,330
Stop making baseless accusations.

197
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,470
By the way,

198
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,660
the Imperial Astronomical Bureau
has completed its calculations.

199
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,660
Qi and Duke of Zhong's
legitimate eldest daughter

200
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:54,380
are truly a match made in heaven.

201
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,990
Impossible, impossible!

202
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,510
I clearly reported...

203
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,180
[Feng Chenbi]

204
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,620
What do you mean by this, Prince Cheng?

205
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,330
The list was personally delivered to
the Imperial Astronomical Bureau by Noble Consort Su.

206
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,330
It wasn't handed off to anyone else.

207
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,420
There's no way there was a mistake.

208
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,690
The Crown Prince is well aware

209
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,640
of the deep affection
between you and Miss Feng.

210
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,380
If you deny it now,

211
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,190
how will Miss Feng

212
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,360
face others in the future?

213
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,550
I don't believe

214
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,670
Prince Cheng is a fickle man.

215
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,290
I

216
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,140
will obey the decree, Your Majesty.

217
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:43,630
Very well.

218
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,690
Since you agree,

219
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,420
I will decree

220
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,940
your marriage

221
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,270
along with the Crown Prince's,

222
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,850
so you may soon set a date.

223
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,020
-Thank you,
-Thank you,

224
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,780
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

225
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,690
Thank you, Father.

226
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,660
Alright, alright.

227
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,690
you may both rise.

228
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,140
Report!

229
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:05,780
Your Majesty,

230
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,110
this is a decree from the Empress Dowager.

231
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,060
Please read it.

232
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,780
Good.

233
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,490
Great!

234
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:25,440
Well,

235
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,610
the Empress Dowager has also arranged

236
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,900
Chi's marriage.

237
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,090
Now,

238
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,340
the palace

239
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,450
is filled with joyous occasions.

240
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,480
Wonderful!

241
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,420
Xiang, you're hurt?

242
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:06,490
No.

243
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,730
Yes, you are. I just saw it.

244
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,260
Who did this to you?

245
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:11,960
Come on,

246
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,180
let's go find Aunt.

247
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,660
Mind your own business.

248
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,020
If you dare tell others,

249
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,940
don't blame me
for forgetting our sisterhood!

250
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,570
Xiang...

251
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:19,090
Shut up!

252
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,720
I didn't expect

253
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,020
His Majesty would let
last night's incident go so easily.

254
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,150
So what if he didn't?

255
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,180
Yan Qi is the mastermind.

256
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,980
He naturally won't admit it.

257
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,660
Feng Chenbi dares not say anything either.

258
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,320
His Majesty

259
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,180
wouldn't create trouble for himself.

260
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,380
Given Prince Cheng's vengeful nature,

261
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,790
I don't think he'll let it drop easily.

262
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,110
I have a feeling

263
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,060
he has a bigger scheme.

264
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,010
I share your concern.

265
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:50,610
Do you know

266
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,260
why Yan Qi hasn't gone to his domain?

267
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,020
Because of the Crown Prince's position?

268
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,570
No.

269
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,130
What he wants

270
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:01,090
is the key supply base for provisions
and warhorses—

271
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:01,890
Liangzhou.

272
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,870
A vital stronghold in Shuoxi?

273
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:07,060
So the mastermind
behind the military provision case...

274
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,320
Could very well be him.

275
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,330
Or the Crown Prince.

276
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,250
Or even...

277
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:16,540
His Majesty.

278
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,690
His Majesty wants Shuoxi Army.

279
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,670
My father's stubbornness

280
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,780
has already crossed
His Majesty's red line.

281
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,260
Although I used
the military provision case

282
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,610
to defend my father before His Majesty

283
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,530
when I returned to the capital,

284
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,910
it's not a long-term solution.

285
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,730
Why doesn't Prince Rui understand

286
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,930
that you came to the capital as a hostage

287
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,340
to guarantee his and Shuoxi Army's safety?

288
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,150
He does understand,

289
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,450
but in his heart,

290
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,970
a general should hold a seat in court
through glorious military achievements.

291
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,100
While my strategies

292
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,560
are nothing but political maneuvering.

293
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,090
Right now, in His Majesty's eyes,

294
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,180
I'm my father's spy placed in the capital.

295
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,510
And in my father's eyes,

296
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,140
I'm a cowardly rebellious son.

297
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,970
Don't meddle in Prince Jin's case anymore.

298
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:03,780
Why?

299
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,020
Li Muyun is suspicious
about the unidentified body

300
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,420
at Prince Jin's Mansion,

301
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,300
but he hasn't stopped me
from investigating further.

302
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,140
I suspect

303
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,200
he's waiting for me to make a mistake.

304
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,540
If His Majesty finds out

305
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,260
you're trying to reopen Prince Jin's case,

306
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,020
I'm afraid your situation
will become even more dangerous.

307
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,020
Then I certainly can't let you
face this danger alone.

308
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,330
Besides,

309
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,940
the Empress Dowager
has already granted our marriage.

310
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,740
From now on, as husband and wife,

311
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,560
our fates are bound together.

312
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,220
Wan,

313
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,810
the road ahead will be full of danger.

314
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,670
Are you willing to face it with me?

315
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:40,810
I am.

316
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:09,290
Let

317
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,160
Qin Zhaoyu,

318
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,859
Feng Chenbi,

319
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,550
and Princess Yongci

320
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,770
come forward to hear the decree.

321
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,370
By the Empress Dowager's decree,

322
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,930
Qin Zhaoyu, daughter of Marquis of Zhongyong,
Qin Shuzhi,

323
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,740
is virtuous, composed,

324
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,450
modest, and respectful.

325
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,320
The Empress Dowager is pleased
with her conduct

326
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:47,410
and hereby grants her
in marriage to Crown Prince Yan Che

327
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,970
as Crown Princess.

328
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:53,380
Feng Chenbi, daughter of Duke of Zhong,
Feng Bingyi,

329
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,040
is gentle, gracious,

330
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,250
proper, and exemplary in behavior.

331
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:01,860
She is hereby granted in marriage
to Prince Cheng, Yan Qi,

332
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,540
as his primary consort.

333
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,470
Princess Yongci, Qin Wan, adopted daughter

334
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,230
of Marquis of Anyang, Yue Qiong,

335
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,180
is refined in manners

336
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,900
and unceasing in diligence.

337
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,730
She is hereby granted in marriage
to the Heir of Prince Rui, Yan Chi,

338
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,230
as his consort.

339
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,830
The relevant ministry shall choose
an auspicious date for the weddings.

340
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,190
Thus decreed.

341
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,330
Thank you, Your Majesty.

342
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,930
These flowers are so beautiful.

343
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:49,920
Let's go take a look over there.

344
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,880
So pretty.

345
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,450
Then we're leaving.

346
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,620
Let's go.

347
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,490
Xiang, stop drinking.

348
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:11,490
It's a serious offense
to be drunk in front of the Emperor.

349
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,100
Madam.

350
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,050
If we bring trouble on the Qin family

351
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,540
at the Spring Banquet,

352
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,850
Uncle and Aunt will eat us alive.

353
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,660
You may fear them,

354
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,580
but I don't.

355
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,700
One day, when I climb to a higher status,

356
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,010
even they will have to kneel before me.

357
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:32,010
Xiang, please don't talk nonsense.

358
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,120
You need a ladder
to climb to a higher status.

359
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,200
Those princes

360
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,620
are closely watched by His Majesty

361
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,770
and the powerful ministers.

362
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,290
You don't have a chance with any of them.

363
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,890
So don't even dream about it.

364
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,010
Xiang.

365
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:47,530
Xiang...

366
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,480
Your Highness, you're truly gallant!

367
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,050
Let's go take a look too.

368
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,340
Chi, is this a wild goose?

369
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:26,270
Great Aunt,

370
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,500
with this wild goose as a betrothal gift,

371
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,690
I humbly ask you
to consent to the marriage

372
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:33,020
of your sworn granddaughter Qin Wan to me.

373
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,520
The Empress Dowager has already
given her decree, right?

374
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,040
What else can I say?

375
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,510
This is quite a grand gesture.

376
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:47,960
Truly impressive.

377
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,670
For your sincerity,

378
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,770
alright!

379
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,820
Today I accept you

380
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,000
as my sworn grandson-in-law.

381
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,450
Thank you, Great Aunt.

382
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,770
Your Majesty.

383
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,940
Chi is truly happy

384
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,140
about this marriage.

385
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:09,530
Good.

386
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,900
That's good.

387
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,820
Since you are happy,

388
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,340
I feel

389
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,890
I've fulfilled my duty

390
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,870
to Prince Rui.

391
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,300
Thank you, Your Majesty.

392
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,340
Report!

393
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,140
Your Majesty!

394
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,180
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

395
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,510
Being flustered like this—how improper!

396
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,580
This...

397
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:35,900
This...

398
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,580
-Father!
-Father!

399
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,260
Father, please take care of your health!

400
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,400
Father, please sit down.

401
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,730
-Your Majesty!
-What is this?

402
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:41,770
Your Majesty!

403
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,440
Mother!

404
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,250
Mother, please don't look!

405
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,200
Don't look at it!

406
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,010
-Your Majesty!
-Grandmother!

407
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,210
-Sister-in-law!
-Grandmother!

408
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,010
Your Majesty!

409
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,690
Check on her!

410
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,860
Mother!

411
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,450
Help the Empress Dowager back
to her room to rest now.

412
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,490
Hurry!

413
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:07,770
Come on.

414
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,190
Be careful, Grandmother.

415
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,370
This...

416
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,390
Yuan Qing,

417
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,990
what exactly happened?

418
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,520
Prince Rui...

419
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:29,690
Prince Rui...

420
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,800
My brother Prince Rui...

421
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,870
has passed away!

422
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,870
My dear brother Prince Rui!

423
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,730
Yan Chi.

424
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:22,210
Yan Chi.

425
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,340
I am already your wife.

426
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,250
No matter what happens,

427
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,340
I will face it with you.

428
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:32,970
Remember that.

429
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,910
Will Grandmother recover?

430
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,070
She'll be fine.

431
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,060
His Majesty is here!

432
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,350
Alright, no need for formalities.

433
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,210
How is the Empress Dowager?

434
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:12,210
Grandmother hasn't eaten anything

435
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,140
and refuses to take her medicine.

436
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:14,870
Wan,

437
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,860
have you administered acupuncture
to the Empress Dowager?

438
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,530
Her Majesty is still deep in sorrow.

439
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,660
It's too risky to perform acupuncture now,

440
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,940
so we can only treat her
with medicine for the time being.

441
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,380
You all wait outside the tent;

442
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,580
I'll go in and see her.

443
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,990
Greetings, Your Majesty.

444
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,290
Greetings, Mother.

445
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,130
Mother...

446
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,180
Let me help you

447
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,510
take your medicine.

448
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,150
Mother,

449
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,100
you're tormenting yourself like this.

450
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,090
How can I be at peace?

451
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,080
Mother,

452
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,670
now that Lin is gone,

453
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,010
do you not want me anymore?

454
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,380
I am

455
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,800
also your son.

456
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:34,940
Bring Lin...

457
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:38,580
back to me.

458
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,120
Rest assured, Mother.

459
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,210
I've already ordered Chi to depart quickly

460
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:45,070
and bring Lin back to the capital.

461
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,410
Mother!

462
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,100
Your Majesty,

463
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,420
please take care of your health.

464
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,180
Don't worry about the Empress Dowager.

465
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,720
I am here to take care of her.

466
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,870
You should go back and rest.

467
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,270
Thank you, Aunt.

468
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,250
Well, Mother,

469
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,490
please take good care of yourself.

470
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:18,230
I'll...

471
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,750
take my leave.

472
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,460
Don't be afraid.

473
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,320
Grandmother will be fine.

474
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,290
Li.

475
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,940
Spend more time

476
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,560
with your grandmother these days.

477
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:57,630

now

it's my turn to protect you.

once we return to the capital,

511
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,870
we'll go straight to the morgue.

512
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,840
I need to steam the bones
to check the injuries.

513
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,630
Yes!

514
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,580
You two,

515
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,710
lift it a bit higher.

516
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:04,450
Yes.

517
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,290
Hurry up.

518
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,330
Take all these over there.

519
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:08,990
Right away.

520
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,990
Your Highness,
the medicinal decoction is ready.

521
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,530
Pour the herbal decoction over the bones

522
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,400
to remove the cadaveric wax.

523
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:30,960
Yes.

524
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:11,030
Add three liters of wine
and five liters of vinegar.

525
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,460
If you have anything to say,

526
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,610
let it show

527
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:27,450
so I can see it.

528
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:01,980
Father,

529
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,420
throughout history, no emperor

530
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,220
has allowed military power to slip away.

531
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,010
His Majesty wants his Shuoxi Army,

532
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,820
not Prince Rui's private troops.

533
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,450
The struggle for succession
in the capital is full of intrigue.

534
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:13,450
Shuoxi Army is surrounded by enemies.

535
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:15,550
As long as you return to the capital
with me to hand over the tiger tally,

536
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,290
and as long as you're no longer
suspected by His Majesty,

537
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:18,730
Shuoxi Army can be protected

538
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,970
from gradual dismantling.

539
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:20,690
Silence!

540
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,940
I am His Majesty's
full brother by the same mother.

541
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:27,230
How can there be a loss of military power?

542
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,530
Before His Majesty
went to the front lines,

543
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,900
he entrusted Shuoxi to me.

544
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,910
He entrusted me
with this strategic territory.

545
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,770
His Majesty is always wise and benevolent.

546
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:38,530
He trusts me

547
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,750
as much as himself.

548
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,880
No matter how others try to sow discord,

549
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,530
as long as His Majesty hasn't
taken back the tiger tally,

550
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,680
I will keep

551
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,940
defending Shuoxi.

552
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:47,990
But Father,

553
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,940
people change.

554
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,620
If His Majesty truly trusted you
without doubt,

555
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,730
why didn't he first investigate
the Ministry of War and Ministry of Revenue,

556
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:04,350
instead of sending me back to Shuoxi Army
to investigate corruption?

557
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,130
Father,

558
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:08,450
during these days in the capital,
I've seen things clearly.

559
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:09,980
His Majesty is deep-minded

560
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,940
and skilled in balancing power.

561
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,620
He is wary even of the Empress Dowager

562
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,940
and the Crown Prince,

563
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,470
let alone you, his brother.

564
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,490
After all these years,

565
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,490
he's no longer

566
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,890
the new emperor
who just ascended the throne.

567
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,570
His Majesty ordered you to investigate,

568
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,050
then do so.

569
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,160
I have lived an upright life.

570
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,400
While guarding the border,

571
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,580
I've never harbored
any selfish intentions.

572
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,130
The reputation of Shuoxi Army

573
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:34,790
cannot be destroyed
by a few corrupt officials.

574
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,600
After you finish your duties,

575
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,270
you should...

576
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:52,210
return to the capital as soon as you can.

577
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:54,900
Father,

578
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:58,180
the difficulty isn't in the investigation

579
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,140
but in His Majesty's suspicion.

580
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,340
If you use the military supplies
as a reason

581
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,290
to return to the capital with me
and hand over the tiger tally,

582
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:07,950
His Majesty will thoroughly investigate
the corrupt officials.

583
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:09,650
Even without you,

584
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:12,300
Shuoxi Army

585
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,060
will have a new commander.

586
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:18,650
It's mid-spring now,

587
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,170
the time when the nomadic enemies

588
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,820
raid everywhere.

589
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:25,010
Once they learn that Shuoxi Army
has a new commander,

590
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:27,139
war will break out on the border again.

591
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:28,380
Years ago,

592
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,380
I swore to the new emperor

593
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:32,170
that I would not leave Shuoxi

594
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,500
until the nomadic enemies were defeated.

595
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,170
Those words still ring in my ears.

596
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:38,170
How could I become an oath-breaker?

597
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,230
But Father...

598
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:40,420
Rest assured.

599
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,300
When I eventually enter the capital
to see His Majesty,

600
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,969
I will return the tiger tally to him.

601
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:47,489
Father,

602
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,449
now, His Majesty,
the Crown Prince, and Prince Cheng

603
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:52,780
are determined to seize control
of the Shuoxi Army.

604
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,040
The one who tried to assassinate us

605
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,780
must be from one of these three parties.

606
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,940
Nowadays, His Majesty

607
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,130
values military power
more than border security.

608
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,700
No one knows how many people
Prince Cheng and the Crown Prince

609
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,860
have planted in the grain transport
and supply lines.

610
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,050
Once war breaks out again,

611
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,700
Shuoxi Army will be attacked
from both the front and the rear.

612
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,560
If you keep clinging to your oath,

613
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,780
you're just sending us to die for nothing.

614
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,820
Shuoxi Army has achieved many victories.

615
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,850
How could His Majesty
allow schemers to cause trouble

616
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,480
and destroy his own defenses?

617
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,210
Generals should die in battle.

618
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,240
If that day really comes,

619
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:23,010
then it's our fate.

620
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,130
But why?

621
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,810
Why should I and the soldiers

622
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:27,970
who've followed you for years

623
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,220
die in vain

624
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,550
just because of an oath?

625
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,220
This isn't fate!

626
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:33,780
It's foolishness!

627
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:34,890
Get out!

628
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,890
I have no cowardly son like you!

629
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:45,610
Father,

630
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:50,340
whether you're willing or not,

631
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:56,870
you're coming back
to the capital with me this time.

632
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:03,140
[Memorial Tablet of My Late Father,
Prince Rui, Yan Ling]

633
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:17,150
Young Marshal!

634
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:20,640
Young Marshal! Young Marshal!

635
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,570
Young Marshal!

636
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,570
You may take out the remains.

637
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:44,310
This smell...

638
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,370
What is that smell?

639
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,860
What is that smell?

640
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,260
It's awful.

641
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,970
Anyone feeling sick, step away.

642
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:56,780
Yes.

643
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,740
Constable Zhan,

644
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,170
I'll describe, and you record.

645
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:01,920
Alright.

646
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,520
Minister Li.

647
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:08,980
This is where the Her Highness
performed the bone steaming.

648
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:15,990
Your Highness.

649
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,130
May I ask

650
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:42,010
where you learned

651
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,490
this technique?

652
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,750
From books.

653
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,010
Constable Zhan,

654
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:51,940
write this down.

655
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:54,320
There's a dark purplish blood stain

656
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,740
on the occipital bone—

657
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:58,240
likely caused by a blunt force strike.

658
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,800
The victim also has reddish cracks

659
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,430
and blood stain

660
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,400
on both clavicles,

661
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:11,490
the third and fourth ribs
on the left side,

662
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:12,740
the left wrist, the right shinbone,

663
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,640
and both kneecaps.

664
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:16,900
This indicates he was likely
beaten by multiple people

665
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,100
or for an extended period before death.

666
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,420
The right ulna

667
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,220
also shows signs of impact—
blood stains and fine fractures—

668
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,010
likely from heavy force.

669
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,300
Possibly from raising his arm

670
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:29,650
to block a heavy punch during a fight,

671
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,050
or bracing himself with his arm

672
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:33,510
when falling from a horse.

673
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,930
But the wounds alone

674
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,860
cannot prove the identity of the deceased.

675
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,260
Besides the injuries,

676
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,940
the deceased's legs are uneven in length.

677
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,960
The left knee bends inward,

678
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,450
so when standing,

679
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:50,240
the right leg
should appear slightly longer.

680
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,000
When walking,

681
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,820
the shoulders would naturally
sway up and down.

682
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,450
The deceased had
a stable lower body stance,

683
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:57,540
usually

684
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,090
generating power with the left leg

685
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:00,300
and striking with the right.

686
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,260
Judging by this,

687
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:04,010
the deceased was no ordinary
bandit or guard.

688
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,840
He was likely a bodyguard or escort—

689
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,820
someone properly trained in martial arts.

690
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,200
The burial in Prince Jin's Mansion
is no coincidence.

691
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,010
Prefect Zheng, Minister Li,

692
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,420
you can look for clues
among Prince Jin's servants or guards

693
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,650
to identify him.

694
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,970
The files of Prince Jin's former personnel

695
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:20,820
are all kept at the Supreme Court.

696
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,080
Minister Li, I'll trouble you with this.

697
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,110
But why

698
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,700
start with Prince Jin's former personnel?

699
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,920
Prince Jin's Mansion
has been sealed for over a year.

700
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,360
The death occurred

701
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:33,910
about a year ago.

702
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:35,740
The body was likely buried in the backyard

703
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,300
before Prince Jin's Mansion was sealed.

704
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,570
All the guards are more or less involved.

705
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:41,280
Constable Zhan,

706
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,380
send the remains back to the morgue.

707
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,610
They will serve as evidence

708
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:45,870
at the interrogation.

709
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:49,590
Your Highness,

710
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:51,880
the Disgraced Prince

711
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,160
indeed had an armed guard

712
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:55,810
of Western origin

713
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,360
named Song Xiwen.

714
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,920
But if this corpse is him,

715
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,260
I'm afraid

716
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,510
it's beyond the three of us

717
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:05,960
to handle.

718
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:07,450
Why?

719
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:09,980
Because Song Xiwen

720
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,000
was supposed to be detained in

721
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,930
in the Imperial Punishment Department.

722
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,990
The Imperial Punishment Department?

723
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:18,390
The place where palace maids are punished?

724
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,420
Exactly.

725
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,350
So how did he escape

726
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:24,300
from the tightly guarded
Imperial Punishment Department?

727
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,650
And who killed him?

728
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,170
If we dig too deep,

729
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:28,240
I'm afraid

730
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,050
many will be implicated.

731
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,640
Since Song Xiwen
was a guard of Prince Jin's Mansion,

732
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,650
why did he end up
in the Imperial Punishment Department?

733
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:36,050
What crime did he commit?

734
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:36,890
This...

735
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:38,820
This...

736
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,180
involves the Disgraced Prince.

737
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,240
I'm sorry,

738
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:43,880
but I cannot say anything.

739
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,270
Minister Li,
I believe you understand this principle:

740
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,340
one mistake leads
to ten more to cover it up.

741
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,700
The more you try to cover up mistakes,

742
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,300
the more errors you'll make.

743
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,490
Since these remains

744
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:54,570
appeared where they shouldn't have,

745
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:56,530
we must report honestly.

746
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,450
As for who might be implicated,

747
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:00,610
that should be for His Majesty to decide.

748
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:02,170
Your Highness, you're right.

749
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:05,230
We will definitely report
our findings to His Majesty.

750
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,700
Then thank you for your hard work.

751
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,610
Not at all.

752
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:09,670
We'll draft the memorial right away.

753
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,420
After you, Mr. Li.

754
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,060
Yan Chi,

755
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,900
I've finally found the breakthrough
in Prince Jin's case.

756
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,530
You must return safely.

757
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:32,850
Your Majesty,

758
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:37,360
the Heir of Prince Rui has escorted
Prince Rui's coffin into the capital.

759
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:38,740
When the decree was issued,

760
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,760
was Yan Chi

761
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,580
calm?

762
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,930
His Highness

763
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:47,060
only presented the tiger tally
of Shuoxi Army to you,

764
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,420
saying nothing else.

765
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,680
It's finally back.
