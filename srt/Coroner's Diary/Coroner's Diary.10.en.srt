[Coroner's Diary]

2
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,920
[Episode 10]

3
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,680
The nails have turned purple

4
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,840
with blackening at the lunula.

5
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,729
Hair loss is evident.

6
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,730
Has Master Qin An
shown any new symptoms lately?

7
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,650
Yes, indeed.

8
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,360
The master has been
complaining of headaches recently,

9
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,130
and he's suffering from severe itching,

10
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,190
his temper has also
become more irritable than before.

11
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,210
Master Qin An isn't ill.

12
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,340
He's been poisoned.

13
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:19,800
It seems

14
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,980
someone is eager to silence him.

15
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:41,240
There's nothing wrong
with this prescription.

16
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,090
Miss Qin, please investigate.

17
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,990
Does Master Qin An
usually take any medicinal pills?

18
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:47,870
No,

19
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,630
never.

20
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,990
Is this in the medicine pot

21
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,920
the herbs currently being soaked?

22
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,770
Yes.

23
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,700
It's definitely mineral poisoning.

24
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,520
Your Highness, please look,

25
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,800
there's a layer of black residue
at the bottom of this bowl,

26
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,329
left behind from
dissolved medicinal pills.

27
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,370
But the dosage of this mineral poison

28
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,800
isn't enough to be fatal, is it?

29
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,250
This amount for an ordinary person

30
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,170
would indeed be
unlikely to cause serious harm,

31
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,410
but Master Qin An has been
suffering from syphilis for some time,

32
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,450
his body is weakened,

33
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,180
so this dosage is
enough to worsen his condition,

34
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,920
eventually causing organ failure

35
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,450
and mental deterioration.

36
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,290
Tell me,

37
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,079
who ordered you to poison Qin An?

38
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,079
Speak!

39
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,780
I'm innocent!

40
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,290
I'm the master's personal attendant.

41
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,290
If anything happened to the master,

42
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,520
I'd surely suffer the consequences

43
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,320
I would never dare harm the master!

44
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,320
Who usually prepares the medicine?

45
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,290
It's me.

46
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,450
But

47
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,920
Physician Qian always
delivers the medicine personally.

48
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,010
I only

49
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,410
brew it as instructed.

50
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,050
Though I deliver the master's medicine,

51
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:17,930
each time it's

52
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,959
personally inspected by Madam Qin.

53
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,050
I truly don't know
how mineral poison got into it!

54
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,850
Take these two into custody

55
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,370
and we'll decide
their fate after finding the poisoner.

56
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,020
Yes.

57
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,000
Your Highness.

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,930
I'm innocent!

59
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:33,640
Your Highness.

60
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,860
I've been wrongly accused!

61
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,760
I'm innocent!

62
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,450
Your Highness.

63
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,050
Your Highness.

64
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:37,720
Your Highness.

65
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,780
Please see the truth, Your Highness.

66
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,860
How much longer can Qin An survive?

67
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,960
At least three months

68
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,250
or up to half a year.

69
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,250
Can you cure his mineral poisoning?

70
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,490
The Qin family case
must be reported to the Ministry of Justice,

71
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,159
and the paperwork alone
could take more than half a year.

72
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,760
He's completely heartless,

73
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,160
but

74
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,280
don't you want to see him alive

75
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,930
to face legal punishment?

76
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,130
Fine.

77
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,170
What are you thinking about?

78
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,580
I'm thinking about

79
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,450
how Madam Qin
has always doted on her descendants,

80
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,350
she's done so much for Qin An,

81
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,520
why would she be so cruel to him?

82
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,320
She's just sacrificing
a rook to save the king.

83
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,570
Clearly, Qin An couldn't be saved anymore.

84
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,360
If she wanted to protect
Qin Chen's future,

85
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,760
she couldn't let
Qin An live to stand trial.

86
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,400
If that's the case,

87
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,520
why not use a quicker method?

88
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,570
This way, Qin An
wouldn't have to face trial

89
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,830
and would suffer less.

90
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,890
In Qin An's current condition,

91
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,220
even if he wants to die,

92
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,400
he can't die quickly,

93
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,330
and he's living in terrible agony.

94
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,520
What if the poisoner isn't Madam Qin,

95
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,200
but someone who wants Qin An to suffer?

96
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,930
Then in this household,

97
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,200
there must be someone
who hates him even more than I do.

98
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,659
We previously speculated

99
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,490
that the killer murdered Concubine Liu

100
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,720
to draw out Liu Chun.

101
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,160
Creating ghost fire

102
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,960
was to lead us to the Purple Bamboo Grove.

103
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,050
And killing Liu Chun

104
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,810
was to bring up Concubine Yang's death.

105
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,760
Then Concubine Yang's
death was to uncover...

106
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,200
The case of the body buried in the well.

107
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,690
Yes.

108
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,320
If we trace the cause
and effect of these cases

109
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,540
backward...

110
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,660
The case of the body in the well

111
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,660
is the root cause of all the murders.

112
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,250
Someone among the victim's
family must know the truth.

113
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,960
All the murders
that happened in the Qin family

114
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,360
might be revenge from the victim's family.

115
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,180
We need to identify
the victim girls as soon as possible.

116
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,450
Thirteen.

117
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,570
Exactly thirteen young female remains.

118
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,320
Xu He.

119
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:46,840
You and I verify

120
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,570
the hand bones
of these three skeletons together.

121
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,610
Let's find

122
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,370
finger joints with exostosis
marks at the epiphysis.

123
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:51,890
Yes.

124
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,050
Found it.

125
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,010
The left thumb

126
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:40,340
has obvious exostosis
marks at the second joint epiphysis.

127
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,680
Heaven is just!

128
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,409
We can finally reunite Concubine Yang

129
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,370
with her daughter.

130
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,720
The Yang family
had a fire after the mistress disappeared?

131
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,450
Yes,

132
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:22,840
Concubine Yang's husband

133
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,640
was burned to death in that fire.

134
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,160
Prefect Huo.

135
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,450
Why are the Yang County records

136
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,780
so careless about documenting this fire?

137
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,539
There's only speculation about fireworks

138
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:34,890
causing the fire,

139
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,250
with no description
of the scene whatsoever.

140
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,970
Well, um,

141
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,210
the fire happened near the year-end,

142
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,440
when all prefect's offices
are at their busiest.

143
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,260
It was negligent.

144
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,440
Must be rectified.

145
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,860
It must be.

146
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,500
These

147
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,970
are all testimonies
from the Yang family's neighbors.

148
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,010
I haven't reviewed them yet.

149
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,490
Could you check if they mention the fire?

150
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,130
Alright.

151
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,330
Master,

152
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,980
when I was questioning them,

153
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,910
I did bring up the fire at the scene.

154
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,970
Since someone died in it,

155
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,170
all the nearby residents know about it.

156
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,280
Concubine Yang had two daughters?

157
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:17,890
Yes,

158
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,850
the younger daughter
was born with six fingers.

159
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:20,440
But

160
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,330
they say the elder daughter
resembled Concubine Yang more,

161
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,640
being both beautiful and capable.

162
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,610
On the day of the fire,

163
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,040
she was delivering goods for her father,

164
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,920
which is how she escaped the disaster.

165
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,720
Where is the elder daughter now?

166
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:30,970
Some say

167
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,320
she wept bitterly
in front of the burnt ruins,

168
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,280
kowtowed several times,

169
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,560
and then left.

170
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,280
After that,

171
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,680
no one ever saw her again.

172
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,610
Your Highness,

173
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,400
all the victims
of the Qin family murder cases

174
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,190
once harmed Concubine Yang.

175
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,330
The Concubine Liu drove
Concubine Yang to drown herself in a well.

176
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,920
Liu Chun was Qin An's accomplice.

177
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,120
This cannot possibly be a coincidence.

178
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,370
Concubine Yang's eldest daughter

179
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,730
is now in her twenties.

180
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,730
As the only survivor of the Yang family,

181
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,370
if during these ten years of disappearance

182
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,850
she's been searching
for her mother and sister,

183
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,970
then after discovering their whereabouts,

184
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,130
she would have had every opportunity
to infiltrate the Qin family

185
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,130
and seek revenge.

186
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,920
But she's an orphan girl

187
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,650
with no martial arts training.

188
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,440
Even if she could strangle Concubine Liu,

189
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,170
how could she control Liu Chun?

190
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,850
These serial murders

191
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,920
were long planned

192
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,280
and involve many people.

193
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,800
Even if she's not the killer herself,

194
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,890
she can't escape
suspicion as the mastermind.

195
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:17,890
If we can find her,

196
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,090
identifying the other
accomplices will be simple.

197
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,160
Li said

198
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,850
Qin An often
painted portraits of Concubine Yang.

199
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,520
If the elder daughter
resembles her mother,

200
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,040
then finding Concubine Yang's portrait

201
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,330
would give us a reference
for her appearance,

202
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,040
making it easier
for the prefect's office to find her.

203
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,010
Prefect Huo.

204
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,210
Search Qin An's quarters immediately

205
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,330
and his study, inside and out,

206
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,090
to find Concubine Yang's portrait.

207
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,220
Yes, Your Highness.

208
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:39,970
Miss Qin, please

209
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,040
bring your medicine box.

210
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,160
Master Qin An

211
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,560
should be waking up soon.

212
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,640
Feed him medicine.

213
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,530
Master, time for your medicine.

214
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,920
Master.

215
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,600
Your Highness.

216
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,520
Master won't open his mouth.
I can't get the medicine in.

217
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,450
Get a bigger one.

218
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:25,670
Force it in.

219
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,950
Yes, Your Highness.

220
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:49,610
It hurts...

221
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,610
My head hurts so much.

222
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,610
You've been poisoned.

223
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,610
Poi...

224
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,490
Poisoned?

225
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,150
Syphilis doesn't turn
your fingernails black.

226
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,780
If not treated,

227
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,090
in three days your intestines will rot,

228
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,010
and you'll die in agony.

229
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,210
Save me!

230
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,490
Quickly, give me the antidote!

231
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,250
Save me!

232
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,380
-Help me! Help me! Give me the antidote
-You want to live?

233
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,370
I don't want to die, I don't!

234
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,490
Please give me the antidote.

235
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,210
Save me!

236
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,810
If you want to live, confess honestly.

237
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,520
Were all those thirteen

238
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,980
young girls  your victims?

239
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,120
It wasn't me.

240
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,100
I just told them

241
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,490
to dispose of the unhealthy ones.

242
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:35,970
Liu Chun.

243
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,900
It was Liu Chun.

244
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,280
Liu Chun drugged them

245
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,560
and threw them into the well.

246
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,640
You left them in the well to die slowly?

247
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,610
I wanted to give them a quick death,

248
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,890
but...

249
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,490
but arsenic

250
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,350
is controlled by the government.

251
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,860
Beast!

252
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,130
You bought 13 girls
from brokers over time.

253
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,370
All these years,

254
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,610
not a single relative
came to the Qin family to visit them,

255
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,370
nor did anyone inquire about their deaths.

256
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,540
This isn't how legitimate brokers operate.

257
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,470
Which broker did you buy them from?

258
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,640
I'll tell...

259
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,040
I'll tell...

260
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,510
It was Qingyuan Pawnshop.

261
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,760
You mean the Qingyuan Pawnshop

262
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,560
with branches throughout Zhou?

263
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,280
They know my preferences

264
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,760
and regularly bring kidnapped girls

265
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,610
to my residence.

266
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,930
Why would a pawnshop

267
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,520
do such a heinous thing?

268
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,120
It's a pawnshop in name only,

269
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,280
but actually serves the powerful

270
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,980
by doing their dirty work,

271
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,400
gaining connections

272
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,760
while collecting dirt on the elite.

273
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,440
Could the Yang mother and daughter

274
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,210
have been kidnapped by the pawnshop too?

275
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,610
They only took the young one at first,

276
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:02,380
but Concubine Yang
loved her daughter so much

277
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,460
she tracked them down.

278
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,730
When I went to pick up the goods,

279
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,000
they were about to kill her.

280
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,840
When she saw I'd bought her daughter,

281
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:15,560
she begged desperately to stay with her,

282
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,420
to enter the household together.

283
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,890
Seeing she was beautiful,

284
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,870
I decided to buy

285
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,610
both of them.

286
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,940
She's just a fool.

287
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,610
Wherever that little thing is,

288
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,520
that's where she'll be.

289
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:42,070
I just have to threaten her
with the little one,

290
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:47,720
and she'll do anything I want.

291
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,610
Let go of me!

292
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,210
I'll make this despicable thing...

293
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,540
-experience unbearable pain.
-Bai Feng.

294
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,130
Leave this matter to Bai Feng.

295
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:56,850
Don't dirty your hands.

296
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,330
I'm telling the truth.

297
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,610
Master, this...

298
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:03,440
Master.

299
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:04,730
Your hand.

300
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,160
It's just a small wound.

301
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,090
Don't move.

302
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,590
Syphilis can be transmitted through blood.

303
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,280
Wanxing,

304
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,250
bring the medicine box.

305
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,010
Yes.

306
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,520
I'm sorry,

307
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,590
I lost my composure today.

308
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,610
Qin An still shows no remorse

309
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,140
for his actions.

310
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,040
Anyone else

311
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,900
would want to kill him on the spot.

312
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,210
But that's no excuse for my mistake.

313
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,890
You're human too,

314
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,330
don't be so hard on yourself.

315
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,610
Greetings, Your Highness,

316
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:55,640
Miss Qin.

317
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,130
Miss Qin.

318
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,380
I mentioned giving you a new umbrella,

319
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,920
and today I found one
with the same pattern

320
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,680
in a color that suits you.

321
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:12,670
Thank you.

322
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,440
I'm glad you like it.

323
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,220
Such a bright color,

324
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,130
how could it suit me?

325
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,140
If you don't like it, throw it away.

326
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,440
Why waste energy over an umbrella?

327
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,610
It's not that I don't like it,

328
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,640
but I've only recently
ended my mourning period,

329
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,370
so it's inappropriate
to use such bright colors.

330
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,210
Isn't she Madam Qin's

331
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,810
most trusted personal maid?

332
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,540
How could she forget something like this?

333
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,210
Caihe has always been meticulous,

334
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,520
logically,

335
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,579
she wouldn't make such an oversight.

336
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,339
However...

337
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,210
Given what I've done
to the Qin family lately,

338
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,339
it's remarkable she even bothers

339
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:13,869
to make this gesture at all.

340
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,660
If I hadn't met her
in the Purple Bamboo Grove,

341
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,119
resealing the dry well

342
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:21,400
might have

343
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,960
been kept secret longer.

344
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,440
Madam Qin

345
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,720
has been anxious about
this cursed well for two days.

346
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,500
This morning,
as soon as Prefect Huo gave the word

347
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,530
that the investigation was complete,

348
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,000
she immediately ordered me to bring people

349
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,340
to seal the well.

350
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,810
Resealing the dry well.

351
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,400
Resealing...

352
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,760
This stone slab must be
the demon-suppressing stone used to seal the well.

353
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,920
[Government Office]

354
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,570
Judging by the moss growth,

355
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,330
this stone slab

356
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,010
must have been moved recently.

357
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,050
This is a forbidden area
of the Qin family.

358
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,530
Who would have nothing better to do than

359
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,590
move this demon-suppressing stone?

360
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,050
I think

361
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,380
we missed the first case
at the Qin family.

362
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,730
Is it the Lianye case?

363
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,570
No.

364
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,400
It's the case of secretly
moving the demon-suppressing stone.

365
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,050
Whether it was Liu Chun's death

366
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:09,830
or leading us

367
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,920
to find the remains
of the Yang mother and daughter,

368
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,640
the killer needed to move
the demon-suppressing stone first.

369
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,330
Therefore,

370
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,240
moving the demon-suppressing stone

371
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,370
was the first step in the revenge plan.

372
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,810
If that's the case,

373
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,780
the killer has been planning

374
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,000
before taking action

375
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,530
and showing such patience for so long.

376
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:26,200
Indeed.

377
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:27,890
For over a decade.

378
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,160
In the entire Qin family,

379
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,810
only Liu Chun could openly enter
and exit the Purple Bamboo Grove.

380
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,370
For the killer to secretly move
the stone without anyone knowing,

381
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,200
they would need Liu Chun's cooperation.

382
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,400
But Liu Chun

383
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,170
was a trusted confidant
of both Madam Qin and Qin An,

384
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,700
so gaining his trust
would not have been easy.

385
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,850
This shows that

386
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,770
the killer's temperament

387
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,070
and cunning

388
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,570
are truly formidable.

389
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,000
But that demon-suppressing stone

390
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,660
would require at least
four or five strong men to move.

391
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,660
Even with Liu Chun's help,

392
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,490
that's only two people.

393
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,470
How could they move

394
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,530
a stone weighing over a thousand jin?

395
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,370
And after moving the stone,

396
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,200
why didn't they immediately

397
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,770
make a move against
Concubine Liu and Liu Chun?

398
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:05,810
What were they waiting for?

399
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,400
I'm afraid they were waiting for us.

400
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,330
Us?

401
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,270
After the Marquis of Anyang's
Mansion's bride case,

402
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,470
I discovered someone was watching you.

403
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,590
Rather than surveillance,

404
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,130
it was more like waiting,

405
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,830
waiting for an opportunity

406
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,960
to unfold his scheme.

407
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,620
Without your autopsy skills,

408
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,610
the true cause of Concubine Liu's death

409
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,810
would have been covered up by Madam Qin.

410
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,920
Without me as the prince's heir,

411
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,720
the newly appointed
Surveillance Commissioner

412
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,670
Huo Huaixin wouldn't
dare to offend the Qin family,

413
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,260
and the killer's plan
couldn't have moved forward at all.

414
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,200
But because of our collaboration,

415
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,440
the killer's scheme
was successfully executed,

416
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,550
exposing Qin An as the mastermind.

417
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,230
The murderer
is like an experienced hunter.

418
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,570
who waited patiently

419
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,710
for that one fatal strike.

420
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,290
If that's the case,

421
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,810
Lianye

422
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,920
has nothing to do
with the Yang mother and daughter,

423
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,520
and her death
wasn't part of the killer's plan.

424
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,610
Thinking back
to the night of Lianye's murder,

425
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:04,870
when Liu Chun arrived,

426
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,920
he specifically went to
look at the victim's body,

427
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,610
as if to confirm the victim's identity.

428
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:09,640
Lianye?

429
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:13,610
This indicates

430
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,010
Liu Chun had no idea
the victim was Lianye.

431
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,240
When Lianye was killed,

432
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,610
Liu Chun definitely
wasn't in the Purple Bamboo Grove.

433
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,370
Unfortunately, I have no way of knowing

434
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,570
what Lianye actually
witnessed before her death

435
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,610
that forced the killer

436
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,050
to hastily silence her.

437
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,380
Let's ask the maid
who was close to Lianye,

438
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,400
perhaps

439
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,400
we can find out why
she went to the Purple Bamboo Grove.

440
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:33,610
Your Highness!

441
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:34,570
Your Highness!

442
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,130
We've searched the Qin family's
storeroom and Qin An's quarters

443
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,240
thoroughly

444
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,300
but there's absolutely
no portrait of Concubine Yang.

445
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,160
Are there no portraits
with Qin An's inscription

446
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,530
or specifically none of Concubine Yang?

447
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,920
Forget about inscriptions,

448
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,320
there aren't any portraits
of women at all.

449
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,160
Master, over here.

450
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,450
The secret passage is behind here

451
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:13,420
and the mechanism

452
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,880
must be somewhere nearby.

453
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,950
It's here.

454
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,770
Let me.

455
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,410
What the hell is this?

456
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,450
Concubine Yang's portrait
is at least eight or nine years old,

457
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,810
just look for scrolls
with slightly yellowed paper.

458
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,870
Don't bother with all the other junk.

459
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,530
They're all things Qin An has touched.

460
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,860
Don't dirty your hands.

461
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,860
No inscription or signature.

462
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,860
This portrait has
quite a romantic atmosphere.

463
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,140
[Yumin]

464
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,640
There's a seal here.

465
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,750
Yumin?

466
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:55,720
It means a beautiful jade that's
Nhard to distinguish as real or fake.

467
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,890
In the entire Qin household,

468
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:58,490
the only person whose name relates to jade

469
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:59,890
seems to be Qin Chen.

470
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,530
Is this the Young Madam Qin
in the painting?

471
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,370
No.

472
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,500
My sister-in-law said

473
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,240
my brother had someone else in his heart,

474
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,570
but no one believed her.

475
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,680
So she wasn't being paranoid after all.

476
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,650
Qin Chen hiding this scroll here

477
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,130
proves that he knew

478
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,530
this affair couldn't
bear the light of day.

479
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,570
Master, we've searched everywhere,

480
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,130
but there's not
a single proper portrait of a lady.

481
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,050
It must be that Qin An,

482
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,330
afraid of revealing
Concubine Yang's whereabouts,

483
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,330
secretly had someone destroy them.

484
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,960
Concubine Yang's remains
have already been dug up,

485
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,620
so why destroy the portraits?

486
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,530
Your Highness means

487
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:39,820
someone else destroyed the portraits.

488
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,800
Qin Chen manages the household affairs,

489
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,370
Liu Chun is Qin An's confidant,

490
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:46,170
both had opportunities
to destroy the portraits.

491
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:49,720
It's a pity we have no reference for
Concubine Yang's daughter's appearance.

492
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,530
No matter,

493
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,400
as long as she's still in the mansion,

494
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,640
she won't escape.

495
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,920
Concubine Yang's daughter
certainly has reason for revenge,

496
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,330
but how could a physically weak woman

497
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,680
kill Liu Chun and Concubine Liu?

498
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,810
Perhaps she had more
accomplices than just Liu Chun,

499
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,130
or perhaps

500
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,730
she's merely an accomplice.

501
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,290
Right now,

502
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,680
we first need to figure out

503
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,790
how the killer moved
the demon-suppressing stone.

504
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:12,540
Alright,

505
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,640
I'll reinspect
the Purple Bamboo Grove immediately.

506
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,640
Clamps.

507
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,160
I understand now.

508
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,130
Your Highness,

509
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,720
could you ask General Bai
to examine this bamboo grove

510
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,870
for any signs of wear or breakage?

511
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,810
In the future, when you need Bai Feng,

512
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:09,210
there's no need to specifically inform me.

513
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,050
Thank you.

514
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:14,990
Right away!

515
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,810
Miss Qin, please look.

516
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:35,000
There are indentations
on many bamboo stalks here,

517
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,600
clearly made with a knife.

518
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,180
But only this bamboo stalk

519
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,300
has a piece of broken rope on it.

520
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,290
These cuts are...

521
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:47,150
To control the rope position
and prevent slipping.

522
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:53,670
This knotting technique is the same
as the person who made the ghost fire.

523
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,440
Such a large demon-suppressing stone,

524
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,570
bigger than a millstone,

525
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:07,370
could these few
bamboo stalks really move it?

526
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:09,860
Then please,
Prefect Huo, see for yourself.

527
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:23,330
The killer was working
alone with limited strength,

528
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:25,570
they could only use
the bamboo's rebounding force

529
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,720
to move this thousand-pound stone.

530
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,460
Wrap the rope around to the bottom,

531
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,610
then wrap it once

532
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,410
on each side.

533
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,280
Go help them.

534
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,480
The killer wrapped multiple ropes around
the bottom of the demon-suppressing stone,

535
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,050
utilizing the durability of bamboo

536
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,330
to secure both ends of the ropes

537
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:01,720
to pre-selected bamboo branches.

538
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,240
When I count to three,

539
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,440
we'll push together.

540
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:23,810
One, two, three!

541
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,440
Following the killer's method,

542
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,920
just two people can move the stone,

543
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,850
even if one of them is a woman,

544
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,000
they could manage it.

545
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,610
Concubine Yang's daughter must have

546
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:50,850
infiltrated the Qin family

547
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,080
a year ago and recruited help

548
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,800
to move the stone.

549
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,580
Prefect Huo,

550
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:58,130
did the Qin family
purchase any servants a year ago?

551
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,920
According to the registry,

552
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,810
the Qin family last
purchased servants two years ago,

553
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:05,000
all maids for the inner quarters.

554
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,640
Investigate these maids immediately.

555
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,770
Any between 20 and 25 years old

556
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:10,090
with no family connections

557
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:12,050
should be detained
at the administration office.

558
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,370
Those under serious suspicion

559
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:15,240
shall be held in the jail for questioning.

560
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,280
Yes, Your Highness.

561
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,570
Constable Qi, let's go.

562
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:18,330
Yes.

563
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:18,920
Let's go.

564
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,640
We can't arrest people
based on speculation alone.

565
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,240
Right now we can only deduce that

566
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,610
Concubine Yang's
daughter has a motive for murder,

567
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:26,160
but her accomplice hasn't been identified.

568
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,000
To secure a conviction,

569
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,200
we still need more evidence.

570
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,290
Once we catch her,

571
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:30,950
her accomplice won't escape.

572
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,090
Evidence

573
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,240
will come eventually.

574
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,440
If she refuses to confess,

575
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,530
what will you do?

576
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:36,920
Do you want to abuse the punishment?

577
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,950
Don't worry,

578
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,060
I won't force a false confession.

Bai Feng.

580
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,840
Take the Black Armor Guards
to seal off Qingyuan Pawnshop immediately,

581
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,720
and bring everyone
to the jail at the prefect's office.

Don't be angry.

585
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,890
My approach actually
kills two birds with one stone.

586
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:58,920
Concubine Yang's daughter

587
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,290
can only get information about her mother

588
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,930
through Qingyuan Pawnshop.

589
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:03,850
Qingyuan Pawnshop has informants

590
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:04,980
in every household.

591
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,730
Once Prefect Huo begins investigating

592
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,440
the backgrounds of these maids,

593
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,960
it will certainly alert our suspects.

594
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,240
By moving on both fronts simultaneously,

595
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,440
they won't have a chance to coordinate.

596
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,640

don't think having
the Shuoxi Army as your backing

Behave yourself.

The owner of our Qingyuan

is not someone
you can afford to mess with.

that Lianye entered
the household before Caihe,

704
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,170
but Madam Qin bypassed Lianye

705
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,850
and promoted Caihe to first-class maid.

706
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,480
Lianye was resentful

707
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,580

The night Lianye was killed,

709
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,170
Caihe said she was
going to the sewing room

710
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:57,440
and Lianye followed
her closely out of the courtyard.

711
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,520
But the people in the sewing room said

712
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,440
they saw neither Caihe

713
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,820
nor Lianye that night.

714
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:05,690
As Madam Qin's
most trusted first-class maid

715
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,430
and an orphan with no parents,

716
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:08,810
where did Caihe

717
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,140
actually go that night?

718
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,690

Hearing that Fuling has been
assisting you with diagnoses all day,

725

worried that your place
might be short-handed,

726
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,370

00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,370
I also took the liberty

738
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:25,810
of repairing the well in this flower shed,

739
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,170
so Madam Qin won't worry

740
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,730
about anyone else falling in.

741
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,520
Although I delivered
the master's medicine,

742
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,370
each time it was

743
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:33,440
personally inspected by Madam Qin.

744
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,490
Wan.

745
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:39,820
What is all this

746
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,620
really about?

747
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,440
For revenge.

748
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,080
Caihe

749
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,810
is Concubine Yang's daughter.

750
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,720
[Confession]

751
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,900
[Confessor: Zhao Yuanxi]

752
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,290
Master.

753
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:29,020
The Yang family register
from Magistrate Yang has arrived.

754
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:39,030
Concubine Yang's husband
suffers from color blindness.

755
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,030
Color blindness?

756
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,380
What does that mean?

757
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:43,890
He sees yellow as red and blue as black.

758
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:46,560
It's an eye condition where one
cannot distinguish between green and red,

759
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,620
and it can be passed down to children.

760
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:52,120
If you don't like it, just throw it away,

761
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,320
why waste your energy over an umbrella?

762
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,300
It's not that I don't like it,

763
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,120
I've just ended my mourning period,

764
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,180
so it's inappropriate
for me to use such bright colors.

765
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,920
Caihe.

766
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:10,190
Careful, Young Madam.

767
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,210
Your mother-in-law is waiting
for you at Madam Qin's place.

768
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,120
Don't rush,

769
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,850
it would be terrible
if you hurt the young master.

770
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,730
Slow down, Young Madam.

771
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:20,000
Let's go.

772
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,040
Go find His Highness,

773
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,810
tell him Caihe's name,

774
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:45,560
he'll understand what I mean.

775
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,960
If he asks about me,

776
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,560
tell him I've gone to see Prefect Huo,

777
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,520
and that he should prepare himself.

778
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,330
Yes.

779
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:03,290
Where are you going?

780
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:04,370
I'm going out for a bit.

781
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,310
If Fuling asks,

782
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,080
just tell her

783
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,680
I'm delivering a pair
of shoes to my godmother.

784
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,310
Chen, why are you here?

785
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:48,190
I've been waiting for you.

786
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,330
I need to find Xu He.

787
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:51,860
Let's talk as we walk.

788
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,170
Wan.

789
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:57,400
You're so clever.

790
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:03,210
But I don't want to see Prefect Huo.

791
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,060
What did Wantang tell you?

792
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:08,440
And what did Li tell you?

793
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,460
Li only confirmed my suspicions.

794
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,370
Wan.

795
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,620
I've always treated you well,

796
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:20,190
could you please let us go?

797
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,480
If you delay telling
Huo Huaixin for just one day,

798
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,140
I'll take Caihe away tonight.

799
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,810
What about your wife and her unborn child?

800
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,290
What about your mother and sister?

801
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:30,020
Things have come to this point,

802
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,480
I can't worry about all that anymore.

803
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,920
Chen, for Caihe's sake,

804
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,210
you'd abandon your wife and mother,

805
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:37,640
even commit murder and patricide?

806
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,400
If it weren't for you,

807
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,520
I wouldn't be in
such a miserable state today.

808
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,290
Did I force you to kill Lianye,

809
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:44,210
to kill Concubine Liu,

810
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:45,200
to kill Liu Chun?

811
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,420
That was their karma.

812
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,180
Since I discovered Qin An's true nature,

813
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,650
I've wanted him dead every single moment.

814
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:53,370
He doesn't deserve to be my father.

815
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:54,850
He doesn't deserve to be human.

816
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:56,890
They all deserve to die!

817
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,440
Wait.

818
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,370
My stomach hurts a bit.

819
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:09,690
I'll go call Wan.

820
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:11,370
No need to disturb her.

821
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:14,130
Why don't you come in
with me to rest for a while?

822
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,000
Moshu,

823
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,890
go get the medicine.

824
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:16,960
That way, we can feel more at ease.

825
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,920
Okay.

826
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,310
Young Madam,

827
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,210
please.

828
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,320
Chen, you're determined
to take Caihe away,

829
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,180
but have you asked what she wants?

830
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,040
Does she truly want to go with you?

831
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:38,080
Caihe is the purest
and most wonderful woman in the world.

832
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,370
I treat her with all my heart,

833
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:41,040
of course she wants to come with me.

834
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,440
For revenge,

835
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,300
she endured for eight long years.

836
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:45,440
Now,

837
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:47,790
Qin An, the main culprit, is still alive,

838
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:50,520
the third branch of the Qin family
still enjoys their wealth and glory,

839
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,320
do you think she can accept that?

840
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,030
I'm the one who wants revenge.

841
00:43:57,810 --> 00:43:59,580
For the sake of my future,

842
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:02,250
she has already given up on revenge.

843
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:04,660
She urged me to marry Xinlan,

844
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,250
to help me connect with the Yue family,

845
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:10,670
she even gave up being my concubine.

846
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:13,260
She has sacrificed so much for me,

847
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:14,360
how could I bear

848
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:16,560
to make her abandon her blood feud?

849
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,120
If she truly gave up on revenge,

850
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,960
then after Qin An's crimes were exposed,

851
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,690
why would she still poison him?

852
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:24,010
Do you know

853
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:26,350
the person who put musk
in Xinlan's medicine

854
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:27,460
was none other than

855
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,040
your so-called kind and wonderful Caihe?

856
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,500
You're talking nonsense,

857
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,770
Caihe would never harm anyone.

858
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,100
If you don't believe me,

859
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:35,890
you can investigate yourself,

860
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,960
find out who said you had fainting spells,

861
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,250
who sent your maid to get musk
from the medicine storage,

862
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,670
who gave the medicine
containing mineral poison

863
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:42,930
to Qin An's attendant.

864
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,420
What she wants

865
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:45,970
is not just to make everyone who hurt

866
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:47,290
Concubine Yang pay with their lives,

867
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:48,920
she also wants
the third branch of the Qin family

868
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,040
to end without descendants.

869
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:50,920
Shut up!

870
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,400
I won't allow you to slander her,

871
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,130
not anyone!
