[Imperial Edict]

4
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:58,590
Chi,

5
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:02,320
did you change your mind
and join the Ministry of Justice

6
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,720
in order to investigate Prince Jin's case?

7
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,560
Exactly.

8
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,310
By returning to the capital,

9
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,000
you're already endangering yourself.

10
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,530
Besides, Prince Jin's case

11
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,360
is considered a taboo by the Emperor.

12
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,690
If word gets out,

13
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:18,970
have you thought of...

14
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,000
Uncle, don't try to persuade me.

15
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,620
I was raised by Grandmother.

16
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,160
Prince Jin was like a father and a brother
to me in those years.

17
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,410
I must clear his name

18
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,520
with the enemy's blood.

19
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,630
But...

20
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,140
Uncle,

21
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,850
I have a favor to ask.

22
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,030
Speak up.

23
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,640
Miss Qin Wan has agreed

24
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,550
assist me in investigating cases
in the capital.

25
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,460
But since she's the only daughter
of the Qin family's second branch,

26
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,610
I’m afraid she’ll be constrained

27
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,480
by the Marquis of Zhongyong's influence.

28
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,880
So, Uncle, I'm wondering

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,480
if you can give her an extra identity

30
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,740
as a way to support her?

31
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,380
I'll be very grateful for that.

32
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,750
It's a good idea.

33
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,780
I was just wondering how to repay

34
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,980
Miss Qin Wan's favor.

35
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,460
It'll be my pleasure
to help secure her safety with my title

36
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,860
as the Marquis of Anyang.

37
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,230
Thank you, Uncle.

38
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,640
My Lady!

39
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,360
My Lady, His Highness is here.

40
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,970
Greetings, Your Highness.

41
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,690
I told you to forgo the formalities.

42
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,900
Your Highness,

43
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,870
have you decided when to leave for Shuoxi?

44
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,400
If so...

45
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,030
I'm afraid I can't leave now.

46
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,910
As for you, Miss Qin,

47
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,829
you'll have to stay too.

48
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,850
Why?

49
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,040
I was given a new job yesterday.

50
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,680
The Emperor appointed me
as the judicial surveillance commissioner

51
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,790
to inspect and supervise

52
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,590
all the local criminal cases.

53
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,860
Surveillance commissioner?

54
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,190
Does it mean
you'll never return to Shuoxi?

55
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:11,860
That's right.

56
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,769
Now,

57
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,490
as the surveillance commissioner,

58
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,380
I'm officially inviting you, Miss Qin Wan,
to join me in solving cases.

59
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,730
I'm officially invited?

60
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,450
Does it mean I can legally

61
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,580
perform autopsies?

62
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,680
Of course.

63
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,260
Will I still be allowed
to do that back in the capital?

64
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,260
Wherever you are,

65
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,840
as long as I'm around,

66
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,170
you can do anything.

67
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:45,870
That's great.

68
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,780
I got a report before I came here.

69
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,430
A murder happened in the Qin Mansion.

70
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,360
Please go and perform an autopsy now.

71
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,630
On a girl named Lianye?

72
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:59,659
No.

73
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,500
The people there said

74
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,210
the victim was Concubine Liu.

75
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,350
Concubine Liu?

76
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,500
Please lead the way, Miss Qin.

77
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,480
Thank you.

78
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:19,810
Bai Feng,

79
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,310
she didn't address me as "Your Highness."

80
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,270
So?

81
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,040
So, it means she has put
more trust in me now.

82
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,240
Congratulations...

83
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,960
to you, Master.

84
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,390
Why would this happen?

85
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
It's horrifying.

86
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,360
What are you looking at?

87
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,360
Don't you have chores to do?

88
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,040
Go away.

89
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,990
Scatter!

90
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,070
Let's go.

91
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,540
This is where Concubine Liu

92
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,610
used to live.

93
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,290
Her personal maids said

94
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,370
she felt sick in the previous days,

95
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,060
so she went to bed early last night.

96
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,740
They were shocked to find her dead in bed

97
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,940
this morning when they opened the door.

98
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,640
Your Highness.

99
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,230
Is the door unlocked?

100
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,030
Yes.

101
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,280
Where is Master Qin An?

102
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,640
My father is sick in bed.

103
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,330
Now, it is me

104
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,870
who assists Grandma
in managing the household.

105
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,430
If Your Highness needs anything,

106
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,380
just let me know.

107
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,670
The victim was a concubine
of Master Qin An's.

108
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,990
The third branch had better
stay clear of this case.

109
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,870
If Prefect Huo and I have any questions,

110
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,130
we'll ask Miss Qin Wan.

111
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,370
Your Highness,

112
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,700
Wan is an unmarried lady after all.

113
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,820
Making too many public appearances

114
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,350
might damage her reputation.

115
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,000
What do you think, Miss Qin?

116
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,700
Although I'm a woman,

117
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,740
I also aspire to see justice served.

118
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,230
If Your Highness and Prefect Huo
have faith in me,

119
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,290
I'm ready to do anything I can to help.

120
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:51,780
Wan,

121
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,620
you just reunited with the family
not long ago.

122
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,290
You haven't learned about everyone
in the mansion.

123
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,610
Why not let Chen...

124
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,380
Wan...

125
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,830
Miss Qin devotedly defends justice.

126
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,090
Prefect Huo and I both find it admirable.

127
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,670
This is an official investigation.

128
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,730
Only authorized personnel can stay.

129
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,120
Mr. Qin Chen,

130
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,150
Third Madam,

131
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,590
please leave.

132
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,310
-Yes.
-Yes, as Your Highness commands.

133
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,020
The burden is on you now, Wan.

134
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,620
This matter concerns
our family's reputation.

135
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,220
I'm obligated to protect it.

136
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,530
Let's take a look inside.

137
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,200
Open the door!

138
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,340
Go get your grandma here now.

139
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,690
Hurry!

140
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,670
Concubine Liu was indeed
favored by Mr. Qin An.

141
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,670
Look at all these precious art works
and decorations.

142
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,590
Greetings, Your Highness.

143
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,850
Prefect Huo, Miss Qin.

144
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,350
Are you sure she was strangled to death?

145
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,850
Your Highness, Miss Qin,

146
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,720
please come with me.

147
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,700
Look.

148
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,650
This ligature mark is fine, but deep.

149
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,659
At the back of the victim's neck,

150
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:02,200
there are red and small dots
above and below the mark.

151
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,530
Her face looks bluish purple and swollen.

152
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,520
It proves that she was strangled to death.

153
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,820
Xu He has made much progress

154
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,590
since he started learning from Miss Qin.

155
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,650
Yes. Miss Qin has generously
offered me much guidance.

156
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,370
Prefect Huo, when you brought people in,

157
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,940
did they touch anything here?

158
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,070
No. Despite all my inadequacies,

159
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,780
I still know to follow the rules.

160
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,590
Has Your Highness found anything wrong?

161
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,380
Since the victim was strangled to death,

162
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,020
she must've struggled a lot.

163
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,470
But why is her room so tidy and clean?

164
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,140
Even her personal maids

165
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,500
didn't hear a noise.

166
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,210
Maybe the victim was unconscious?

167
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,740
Any findings?

168
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,110
This is not where the murder happened.

169
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,370
The victim was moved here after she died.

170
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,870
The murderer must have connections
with someone in this mansion.

171
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,590
But do you have any proof, Miss Qin?

172
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,930
This matter concerns
the Qin family's reputation.

173
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,550
On a dead body's lower parts

174
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,480
and where forces were imposed,

175
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,290
there are usually blood stains.

176
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,740
In about two hours after death,
the limbs begin turning stiff.

177
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,200
In six hours,
the entire body becomes stiff.

178
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,310
Now, though the victim's limbs are stiff,

179
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,620
her torso is still soft.

180
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,590
It means she died
within the past six hours.

181
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,260
The murder probably
happened between 4 a.m. to 5 a.m..

182
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,350
That was when the night patrol
in the Qin Mansion finished,

183
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,540
and the attendance check
of servants started.

184
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,420
Only someone who knows the mansion

185
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,380
and the routines of the Qin family well

186
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,020
could manage to kill a woman,

187
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,500
flee and hide in one short hour.

188
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,500
Given how familiar
the murderer is with the mansion,

189
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,980
he or she can't be an outsider.

190
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,980
Miss Qin,

191
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,140
what is it

192
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,190
about the body

193
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,950
that tells you it was moved?

194
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,980
Look.

195
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,340
Strip-shaped scratches
on the victim's palms.

196
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,780
Wound contraction.

197
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,240
Broken nails,

198
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,110
with mud under them.

199
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,830
It means the victim
was lying on somewhere muddy

200
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:19,960
when she struggled.

201
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,340
Besides,

202
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,270
if the victim died
when she was lying on her back—

203
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,970
like the position her body is in now—

204
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:28,170
her legs wouldn't have curved this way.

205
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,480
The only possibility is,

206
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,800
she died when she was lying on her side
with her legs curved.

207
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,420
Judging from the stiffness of the body,

208
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,190
the victim was moved here

209
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,030
two hours after she died,

210
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,030
when her limbs began turning stiff.

211
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:42,820
Therefore,

212
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,070
there are blood stains

213
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,730
behind her left shoulder
from lying on her side.

214
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,230
Also, on her upper arms
and the outside of her calfs

215
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,630
there are blood stains from being grabbed.

216
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,370
Most importantly,

217
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,620
the victim's shoes are not in the room.

218
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,450
Moving a stiff body from the outside

219
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,070
into here two hours after the victim died

220
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,070
couldn't be easy.

221
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,900
The murderer meticulously chose
the perfect time slot for the killing.

222
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,380
It doesn't make sense
that he'd wait two hours

223
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,710
before moving the body,

224
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,780
or that he'd simply
place the body in the bed

225
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,980
without concealing the ligature mark.

226
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,110
The murderer

227
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,140
couldn't have been this sloppy.

228
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:21,600
I agree.

229
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,220
The sizes of the blood stains on the limbs

230
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,210
indicate that the body
was moved here by someone else.

231
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,110
To be more specific,
it took two people to move

232
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,380
the victim's stiff body into this room
by dragging her limbs.

233
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,710
The purpose of moving the body
was to create confusion

234
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,310
on where the murder truly happened.

235
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,780
There must be secrets

236
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,510
behind Concubine Liu's death.

237
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,580
Mother,

238
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,240
do you think the killer of Concubine Liu

239
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,190
is still in the mansion?

240
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:56,620
What if...

241
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,620
What if Xiang and her sisters run into

242
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,190
this...

243
00:11:59,190 --> 00:11:59,950
Nonsense.

244
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,620
There are many officers
in the mansion now.

245
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,290
Would the murderer stick around,

246
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,530
waiting to be caught?

247
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,930
I'm relieved to hear that.

248
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,720
What strikes me as strange

249
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,400
is that the officers came so soon,

250
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,870
though we didn't report
the murder to the prefect's office.

251
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,620
Yeah.

252
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,620
They came in a group, looking scary.

253
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,550
What's more, the Heir of Prince Rui

254
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,350
insisted on taking Wan with him.

255
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,260
Is he interested in Wan?

256
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,110
Even if that's true,

257
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,590
they won't be a couple,
given Wan's origins.

258
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,960
I just didn't expect

259
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,540
that this jinx managed to build

260
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,870
connections with a prince's heir so soon.

261
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,330
Since he already asked for Wan's company,

262
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,650
we'd better not
defy or offend this ruthless man.

263
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,140
When he returns to the capital,

264
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,340
let's see how that hateful girl
will live with this shame.

265
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,420
Your Highness.

266
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,420
Who first found Concubine Liu dead?

267
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,690
Her personal maids.

268
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,640
Summon them for inquiries.

269
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,620
Prefect Huo,

270
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,470
what does

271
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,580
His Highness mean?

272
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,990
Don't worry, Madam Qin.

273
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,740
His Highness just wants
to ask some questions.

274
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,350
Wan,

275
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,280
just now in the room,

276
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,870
what did His Highness say?

277
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,900
His Highness was watching
the coroner examine the body.

278
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,950
He didn't talk much.

279
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,990
Did you not notice anything odd?

280
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,160
His Highness is not a man of our family.

281
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,820
How could I keep gazing at him?

282
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,780
Oh, you...

283
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,140
Wan,

284
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:44,020
His Highness has put much trust in you.

285
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,660
Inform us if you hear

286
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,970
anything negative about the Qin family.

287
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,440
That way, we can take precautions in time.

288
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,940
After all, you and your two sisters
are unmarried ladies.

289
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,740
A lady's reputation

290
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,220
is closely related

291
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,740
to her family's moral prestige.

292
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,470
Grandmother, rest assured.

293
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,600
I will do what little I can

294
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,700
to uphold the family's dignity.

295
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:08,990
That's good.

296
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,320
That's...

297
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,110
I'm Xiuqin.

298
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,040
I'm Xiushu.

299
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,780
-Greetings, officers.
-Greetings, officers.

300
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,140
Which one of you

301
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,740
first found Concubine Liu dead
in her room?

302
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:47,990
It was me.

303
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:49,990
Earlier this morning, I wanted

304
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,730
to see if Concubine Liu had got up.

305
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,310
Right after I entered the room,

306
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,190
I found her dead

307
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,470
horribly in bed.

308
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,760
Do you know

309
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,780
those who give false testimonies

310
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,190
would be treated as accomplices

311
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,900
and tier-two offenders
according to the law?

312
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,350
I dare not lie to you, officers!

313
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,570
What about you?

314
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,350
I...

315
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,850
I just saw what she saw.

316
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,990
How dare you, lowly maids!

317
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,870
It's bold of you to lie
to His Highness and me.

318
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,280
The law carries no weight in your eyes!

319
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,900
Take them away.
Heavily flog them 30 times!

320
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,620
Please spare my life!

321
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,470
Prefect Huo, are you going to
torture them for information?

322
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,260
Chen!

323
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,490
He's just an ignorant young man.

324
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,590
I beg for your forgiveness, officers.

325
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,190
The maids said

326
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,140
Concubine Liu didn't go out
after she went to bed.

327
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,350
But there was heavy makeup
on her face when she died.

328
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,810
Evidently, she did go out.

329
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,070
Her finger nails were badly broken.

330
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,020
She must've struggled madly
before she died.

331
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,880
But there aren't any signs
of a struggle in her room.

332
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,600
The maids' testimonies don't add up.

333
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,400
They must've lied, didn't they?

334
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,230
Your Highness is indeed wise.

335
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,220
To be perfectly candid,

336
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,030
I did instruct these maids

337
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,380
to lie.

338
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,750
I am the one

339
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,810
who should be punished.

340
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:08,900
Grandma!

341
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,770
Mother!

342
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:11,730
Grandma.

343
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,740
Your Highness, Prefect Huo,

344
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,250
my grandmother
didn't mean to conceal the truth.

345
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,620
The fact is, Concubine Liu
had a rendezvous at late night,

346
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,950
which caused her death.

347
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,960
My grandmother had no choice
but to hide the truth

348
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,740
in order to protect
our family's reputation.

349
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,260
If anyone is to be punished,

350
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,470
please let it be me.

351
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,270
You should've disclosed

352
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,000
that information sooner.

353
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,660
It was I who first found
Concubine Liu dead.

354
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,120
When I saw her,

355
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,700
she was disheveled,

356
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,580
lying dead in the flower shed
in the eastern court.

357
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,880
Eastern court?

358
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,420
Is it the flower shed
near the Purple Bamboo Grove?

359
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,420
Master.

360
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,720
Why is this place in a mess?

361
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,070
According to the servants,
this well is said to bring bad luck.

362
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,500
So, Madam Qin ordered it
to be sealed overnight

363
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,359
after having a ritual performed.

364
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,800
Get them out of here!

365
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,010
Move. Hurry!

366
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:12,180
Any theories
about this well being inauspicious before?

367
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,500
No, only the Purple Bamboo Grove
has been considered that way.

368
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,359
But my sister, Shuang, did fall
into this well once.

369
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,960
What a loving grandmother Madam Qin is.

370
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:25,109
This place is not exactly secluded.

371
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,140
Why would Concubine Liu
have a rendezvous here?

372
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,680
Your hands are for saving lives.

373
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,110
I perform autopsies with these hands too.

374
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,710
It's okay.

375
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,240
A sage of criminal law once said,

376
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,500
Remedying injustices

377
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,720
is the same function as resurrection.

378
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,250
You've read that classic
about criminal justice?

379
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,310
I didn't realize how ignorant I used to be

380
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,570
until I read that book.

381
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,180
I already learned a lot

382
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,440
after a rough reading.

383
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,220
I'd rather study harder

384
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,990
than give you another chance
to lecture me—

385
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,510
the powerful surveillance commissioner.

386
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,420
Master, Prefect Huo has a report to make.

387
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,220
Got it.

388
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,550
Since Madam Qin intends
to hide the facts,

389
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,590
she must've had all the trails
here covered up.

390
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,250
Let's not waste our time on it.

391
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,590
Your Highness,

392
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,820
we've found the clothes
Concubine Liu were in when she died.

393
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,950
This maid buried them in the backyard.

394
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,620
Where was the victim lying

395
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,620
when you saw her?

396
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,090
Right over there.

397
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,180
Tell me

398
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,140
the positions of her head and feet.

399
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,680
Bai Feng, demonstrate it with your body.

400
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,660
Yes.

401
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,740
Concubine Liu's feet
were pointing that way,

402
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,070
while her head towards the left.

403
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,280
She was lying on her side.

404
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,730
Her feet were like this.

405
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,620
I can do it myself.

406
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,670
H-Her head touched the ground.

407
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,310
These vines were pulled and broken.

408
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,580
Concubine Liu must've held onto them
when she struggled.

409
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,560
Has this place been cleaned up?

410
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,360
Madam Qin asked us

411
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,420
to move the concubine back to her room
and change her clothes.

412
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,550
The dirt and fallen leaves here

413
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,750
were then swept away.

414
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,110
There was a drag mark on the ground.

415
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,420
It went from here

416
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,940
to there.

417
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,550
Master!

418
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,640
May I get up now?

419
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,790
Get up.

420
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,520
Thank you, Miss Qin.

421
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,490
Is this the victim's handkerchief?

422
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,890
Is this the way she sewed?

423
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,700
Judging from the stitches,

424
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,310
this might be an embroidery
of Concubine Liu's.

425
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,030
But she considered white
an inauspicious color,

426
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,380
so none of her most personal items
were in white.

427
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,440
Then why did you bury this handkerchief

428
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,970
with the victim's clothes?

429
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,140
I found this handkerchief in her bosom

430
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,670
when I changed her clothes.

431
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,420
I just hurriedly

432
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,220
buried them together in a panic.

433
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,490
It's the smell of men's sweat.

434
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,550
It must've been used as a token
to ask Concubine Liu out.

435
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,080
What a heavy smell of sweat.

436
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,600
It couldn't have been left by a noble man.

437
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,150
Could the victim die of a bad romance?

438
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,280
What's on your mind?

439
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,080
There was a time...

440
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,900
when I saw Liu Chun and Concubine Liu

441
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,700
both in the Purple Bamboo Grove.

442
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,660
Detain Liu Chun now!

443
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,590
I’ll interrogate him later.

444
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,050
Take this maid
back to the prefect's office.

445
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,180
Yes.

446
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:50,520
Move.

447
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,780
The murderer

448
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,830
must've grabbed Concubine Liu from behind

449
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,160
and dragged her along this trail

450
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,160
to the broken vines, where she died.

451
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,180
The leaves here have turned black.

452
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,780
The murderer must've
stood here for a long time,

453
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,110
given the way the leaves were trampled on.

454
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,030
Nobody could've

455
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,380
spotted him hiding here.

456
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,270
To grab Concubine Liu from behind...

457
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,390
That must be where she stood.

458
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,580
With the lush plants here,

459
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,300
the murderer could hardly avoid
making a noise when he showed up.

460
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,730
Concubine Liu stood here.

461
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,760
When she heard a sound from behind,

462
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,860
she would definitely look back.

463
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:05,420
It would be difficult for the murderer
to take her down at once.

464
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,030
Unless...

465
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,860
Unless Concubine Liu knew this person.

466
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,520
That's why she didn't scream.

467
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,870
Or...

468
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,220
she was frightened or shocked

469
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,380
by something the murderer said.

470
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,560
That gave the murderer

471
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,270
a chance to calmly pace
to her back and attack.

472
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,760
Pardon me for that rude behavior,

473
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,940
Your Highness.

474
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,280
You already called me "you" once.

475
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,520
Just keep addressing me that way.

476
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,650
But...

477
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,270
that's against...

478
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,180
Your Highness!

479
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,390
Miss Qin.

480
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,140
I found something peculiar
about the victim

481
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,830
when I conducted a preliminary check.

482
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,220
I dare not make a hasty judgment.

483
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,350
Miss Qin,

484
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,360
please come with me to take a look.

485
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:02,870
What's so strange?

486
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,640
I...

487
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,220
Your Highness,

488
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,670
the victim probably

489
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,530
contracted syphilis.

490
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:34,940
Xu He,

491
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,290
these symptoms are self-explanatory.

492
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:40,290
What held you back
from determining it to be syphilis?

493
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,270
Miss Qin,

494
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,830
I thought...

495
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,150
S-She...

496
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,220
she was a concubine of the Qin family,
wasn't she?

497
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,480
There was no way
she'd have this disease.

498
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,720
So, I didn't dare to make a judgement.

499
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,790
As a coroner,

500
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:53,870
your only focus

501
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,870
should be what you see on a dead body.

502
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,840
The victim's social status

503
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,620
has nothing to do with your work.

504
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,110
Coroners shouldn't belittle themselves,

505
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,820
though this is not recognized
as a decent occupation.

506
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,220
The yearning for justice

507
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,500
is what makes your eyes
extra bright at work.

508
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,330
I'll remember that.

509
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,300
See you soon!

510
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,770
Concubine Liu had syphilis.

511
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,120
Could she still...

512
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,210
Her symptoms appeared two months ago.

513
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,580
The sores already extended to her torso.

514
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,440
Normally, she wouldn't
have sex with anyone.

515
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,510
Then her...

516
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,440
Is it possible that her secret lover

517
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,980
is in a severer condition than her?

518
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,980
Not necessarily.

519
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,980
Some people are physically strong enough

520
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,510
to heal even if they are
infected with this disease,

521
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,590
or to never exhibit symptoms
in a lifetime.

522
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,330
The bruises on the victim suggest

523
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:44,870
that the murderer must be very strong

524
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,220
and in perfect health.

525
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,820
I've ordered a body search

526
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,620
on every male in the Qin Mansion.

527
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,510
Whether the murderer
has shown symptoms or not,

528
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,140
new clues will definitely be found.

529
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,620
Why not wait till we find the owner

530
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,830
of the handkerchief?

531
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:59,150
The evidence we have now isn't enough

532
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,760
to conclude
that the murderer is the victim's lover.

533
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,720
Ordering a body search now...

534
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,060
I ordered that
exactly due to the lack of evidence.

535
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,380
The bigger the scene is,

536
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,220
the more agitated her lover will be.

537
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,380
Then he'll be more likely
to give himself away.

538
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,750
This is a war strategy—
scout and observe.

539
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,820
Criminal cases are different
from military situations.

540
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,470
Making such a huge scene

541
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,420
will deeply impact the Qin family.

542
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,790
You could be accused of
being an overbearing lord.

543
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,180
If the Qin family truly
care about their reputation,

544
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,440
they wouldn't have treated you so badly.

545
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,730
How they treated me
is irrelevant to this case.

546
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,940
Your Highness was appointed by the Emperor

547
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,420
as the surveillance commissioner.

548
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,900
If you act like this
instantly after you took office,

549
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,420
there could be criticisms.

550
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,830
Victory is better obtained

551
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,890
sooner than later.

552
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,340
If I can catch the culprit sooner,

553
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,230
I don't mind being criticized.

554
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,920
Take a look!

555
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,670
Lord Yan...

556
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,140
Where has Lord Yan brought Wan to?

557
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,100
You're also at fault.

558
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:01,420
At this critical moment,

559
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,480
why did you have to quarrel with Chen?

560
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:05,600
What if you have

561
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,030
a miscarriage?

562
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,000
Stop nagging at her.

563
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,950
Wan has passed the second gate.

564
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:16,820
That's great!

565
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,360
Grandma,

566
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,510
Lord Yan ordered

567
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,870
a body search on all the males
in the mansion,

568
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:28,730
including masters and servants,

569
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,270
strip naked.

570
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,110
What?

571
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,170
Why didn't Prefect Huo stop him?

572
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,810
Now, Lord Yan

573
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,240
is the surveillance commissioner
working on the Emperor's behalf.

574
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,240
Prefect Huo wouldn't dare
to go against him, would he?

575
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:46,270
The Qin family has never
been humiliated like this!

576
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,380
Now,

577
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,800
let's go to the ancestral hall.

578
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,110
I must tell our ancestors

579
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,870
how the descendants
of the late Marquis of Zhongyong

580
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:58,660
are being degraded and bullied!

581
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,970
-Let's go!
-Mother, careful!

582
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:03,510
Moshu,

583
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:08,910
look after the young madam.

584
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:09,630
Yes.

585
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:25,510
Chen,

586
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,380
why is your wife feeling unwell again?

587
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,900
She overthinks everything.

588
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,310
I felt so anxious
about the ongoing chaos in the mansion

589
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,970
that I bickered with her a bit.

590
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,220
Turn around.

591
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,030
Leave it here.

592
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,060
Everyone is here.

593
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,610
A careful search, isn't it?

594
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,540
Pause!

595
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,730
Take a pause!

596
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:00,970
Your Highness,

597
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,160
Madam Qin wouldn't listen to me.

598
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,700
She insisted on crying
in the ancestral hall.

599
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,090
She is quite old now.

600
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,650
If anything happens to her,

601
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,070
we can’t explain
to the Marquis of Zhongyong.

602
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,240
So, why don’t we

603
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,330
take a pause?

604
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,480
Prefect Huo,

605
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,880
if the marquis is to blame anyone,

606
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,390
I will take full responsibility.

607
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,450
However, as the prefect of Jingzhou,

608
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:24,220
if you give them preferential treatment
and neglect your duties,

609
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,550
then I, the surveillance commissioner,

610
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,350
will have to punish you.

611
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,070
Please don't be mad,

612
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:29,980
Your Highness.

613
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,620
I won't do this again.

614
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,790
I'll fulfill my duties faithfully.

615
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:36,320
I'll be a responsive helper
to Your Highness.

616
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,640
Go on with it!

617
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,350
Why did you stop?

618
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,070
Next.

619
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,690
I'm between a rock

620
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,170
and a hard place now.

621
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,920
Why is it so difficult
to do an officer's job?

622
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,290
Your Highness.

623
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,190
It seems like the murderer will emerge

624
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,060
before the masters are searched.

625
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,020
You didn't take the medicine
I prescribed on time, right?

626
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:34,830
Wan,

627
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,080
I would've taken the medicine

628
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,120
if it hadn't

629
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,710
been tampered with.

630
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:44,030
But Chen always says
I'm just overthinking things.

631
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,390
I had no choice but to...

632
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:02,030
Why is there musk in the medicine?

633
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,230
Lady Wan,

634
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:06,110
I beg you to help the Young Madam!

635
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,510
We did cook the herbs in our own kitchen.

636
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,620
But since the Young Madam felt unwell
after taking the medicine,

637
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,460
I secretly stashed some residue of it.

638
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,530
However, the Eldest Young Master
wouldn't believe the Young Madam

639
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,100
or bother conduct an investigation,

640
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,700
so the Young Madam had to take the liberty
to stop the medication.

641
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,180
Why didn't you tell
the Third Madam about it?

642
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,940
The Young Madam wouldn't let me,

643
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,140
out of fear of making a fuss

644
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,470
to bring shame to the Eldest Young Master.

645
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,370
Don’t be silly.

646
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,980
You're too weak to receive
a third acupuncture therapy.

647
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,120
You must take medicine,

648
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,200
or you and your baby
will both be endangered.

649
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,970
I wish I were truly silly.

650
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,970
Wan,

651
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,040
do not marry

652
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,070
the man you love dearly.

653
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:51,160
If he can't treat you the same
as you treat him,

654
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,590
you'll be in utter misery.

655
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,860
Is Chen having an affair?

656
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,220
No. Lady Wan,

657
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,980
the Eldest Young Master always

658
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,540
keeps a distance with women,

659
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,190
except Her Ladyship.

660
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:09,470
They treat each other with great respect.

661
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,430
Respect?

662
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:14,430
Even my own dowry maid thinks it that way.

663
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,720
It explains all.

664
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,140
It's no wonder that he always says
I'm overthinking everything.

665
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,660
But I share a bed with him.

666
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,860
Whether he secretly
loves someone else or not,

667
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,750
I'd know best.

668
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,290
If you do prioritize his love

669
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,870
over your life and your baby's life,

670
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:37,830
then I can't be of any help.

671
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,440
But I'm sure of one thing.

672
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,030
If you hurt yourself and your baby
for that reason,

673
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,820
Chen won't value you more.

674
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,980
He'll even be more alienated from you.

675
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,220
Madam Qin and the Third Madam

676
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,550
will also resent you.

677
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,880
I can cure diseases,

678
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,280
but not a broken heart.

679
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,720
You must

680
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:56,690
get your thinking straight
on certain matters.

681
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,510
There must be a mole here.

682
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,550
I'll make the herbs into pills
and send them over.

683
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,560
Listen,

684
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,660
it's never easy to live as a woman.

685
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,380
You have to cherish yourself first

686
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,240
for others to cherish you, right?

687
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:15,870
Wan.

688
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:17,480
About Xinlan,

689
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,900
how is she now?

690
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,850
Where have you been, Chen?

691
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,190
Grandma went to the ancestral hall,
crying.

692
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,750
I was really worried about her,

693
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,950
so I kept her company.

694
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,230
Xinlan and her baby nearly died.

695
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,810
Yet you were not with them.

696
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,980
What a caring grandson you are.

697
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,340
I couldn't be in two places
at the same time.

698
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,670
Grandma has her sons, daughters-in-law

699
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,780
and grandchildren in this mansion.

700
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,420
Meanwhile, Xinlan

701
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,070
only has you, her husband.

702
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,960
If you keep neglecting your wife and baby,

703
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,350
I'm afraid I can't help with anything.

704
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:51,370
Did Xinlan

705
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,110
say something to you?

706
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,350
No.

707
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,420
Don't worry, Wan.

708
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,240
I'll spend more time with her from now on.

709
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:07,590
Lady Wan!

710
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:10,670
Lady Wan!

711
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,000
Bad news. Madam Qin fainted!

712
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:30,210
Grandma fainted
because she was too emotional.

713
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,070
She is fine now.

714
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,900
All she needs is a few days' rest.

715
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,420
Grandma fainted.
How could you say she is fine?

716
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,780
You're not even making a prescription.

717
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,770
Do you not care about Grandma at all?

718
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:40,330
Medicine is not always good for health.

719
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,550
Grandma, at this age,

720
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:44,150
you shouldn't take medicine
unless necessary.

721
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:44,949
Wan,

722
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:47,170
has the murderer been caught yet?

723
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,290
No.

724
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,710
Wan,

725
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,290
you were with the officers
the entire time.

726
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:54,889
What exactly have you found?

727
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:58,810
Why did every male in the mansion have to

728
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,360
receive a stripped search?

729
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,560
It'll make the Qin family
lose all standing

730
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,470
in Jingzhou, won't it?

731
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,710
The coroner found
Concubine Liu had contracted syphilis.

732
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,870
Lord Yan thinks

733
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,900
she was infected by her secret lover.

734
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,940
He plans to go on with the investigation
following this lead.

735
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,020
Go on?

736
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:17,690
But...

737
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:21,790
All the males have received
stripped searches.

738
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,240
What else is there to investigate?

739
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:27,270
Since I'm a member of the Qin family,

740
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:29,400
Lord Yan wouldn't tell me everything.

741
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,250
So you do know your position.

742
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,310
Xiang!

743
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,560
Grandma,

744
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:39,330
Mother,

745
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,480
don't worry.

746
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,100
Authorities follow certain rules at work.

747
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,700
They'll stay within bounds.

748
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,850
There's nothing we can do now.

749
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,870
Go be with your wife then.

750
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,790
Or she'll get upset again.

751
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,790
Wan, you've been busy all day.

752
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:57,060
Go get some rest now.

753
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,540
I'll visit you tomorrow then, Grandma.

754
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,230
She always looks holier-than-thou.

755
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,670
How annoying.

756
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,020
Grandma, are you feeling better now?

757
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,080
I was really afraid for you, Grandma.

758
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,460
Wan!

759
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,480
Let me walk you out.

760
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,930
No need, Chen.

761
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,150
You shouldn't keep Xinlan waiting.

762
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,350
It's getting dark.

763
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,210
How can I let you go back
to your place alone?

764
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:32,280
Sir, don't worry.

765
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,990
I'll be escorting Lady Wan.

766
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:43,730
There has been

767
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,160
danger in the mansion lately.

768
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,610
You must be extra careful.

769
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,010
Tell me if anything comes up.

770
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,660
I'll help you.

771
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,870
Thank you, Chen.

772
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,030
Your wife matters most now.

773
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,120
I'd hate to distract your attention.

774
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,490
You're right.

775
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,800
It's time I went back.

776
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,380
Take care, Sir.

777
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,790
What are you watching, Lady Wan?

778
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:14,570
Nothing.

779
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,710
Who would know

780
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,310
Your Ladyship is the bravest

781
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,710
though you're the youngest?

782
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:22,290
You even had the courage
to look at Concubine Liu's body.

783
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,630
I began studying medicine in childhood.

784
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,090
I've got accustomed to it.

785
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,110
Your Ladyship suffered so much.

786
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,770
Your sisters
—carefully nurtured here—

787
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,790
would never have to be put through that.

788
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:34,190
After Lady Shuang
accidentally fell into a well,

789
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:36,590
she had a three-day fever
caused by fright.

790
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:37,670
Madam Qin,

791
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,630
out of constant fear
of accidents related to wells,

792
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,380
immediately ordered all the wells

793
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,510
in the mansion to be sealed overnight.

794
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,920
Where does that fear come from?

795
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,870
Since I started working here,

796
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:51,310
I've always heard Madam Qin
mumbling about this.

797
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,400
Whenever people mention about wells,

798
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,930
she'd be thrown into panic.

799
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,060
But I don't know

800
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,340
the exact reason.

801
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,440
You may stop here, Caihe.

802
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,370
I can walk the rest of the way alone.

803
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:08,000
Take care then, Your Ladyship.

804
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:19,890
Master Qin An.

805
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,740
Kill them all!

806
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:24,400
Kill each and every person

807
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,660
in that woman's abode!

808
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,940
The officers are investigating
her death in the mansion.

809
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:32,000
Don't you think
we've been humiliated enough, Father?

810
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:33,570
You defiant brat!

811
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,960
I'll kill you too!

812
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,830
Caihe!

813
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,500
Master.
I…

814
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,380
Master!

815
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,590
You...

816
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,370
Enough!

817
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,670
Who are you to scold Chen now?

818
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,980
If you hadn't favored that woman so much,

819
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,980
how could all of this have happened?

820
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,080
Go away!

821
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,980
For us,

822
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,000
now is a critical moment.

823
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:11,900
We'd better lay low.

824
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,080
Caihe,

825
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,020
do as I say.

826
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,150
Go and send all the servants

827
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,900
in Concubine Liu's abode
to the laundry division.

828
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,940
Laundry division?

829
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,300
I have to kill them all!

830
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,630
When this is all over,

831
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,850
get rid

832
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,230
of those gossipers.

833
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,460
Who would be so vicious to put musk

834
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,770
[Grace and Purity]

835
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,740
in a pregnant woman's medicine?

836
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:55,530
How heartless this person is!

837
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:01,190
It doesn't make sense
if someone covets Xinlan's position

838
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,420
as Chen's legitimate wife,
since he's not involved with other women.

839
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,390
Besides, who could possibly be able
to plant a mole in his place?

840
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,990
Even if Chen is not
deeply in love with his wife,

841
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,410
there's no reason he'd hurt his own baby.

842
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,670
Anyway, there are few good people
in this mansion.

843
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,800
The herbs have run out.

844
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:19,540
We need to go to the pharmacy tomorrow.

845
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,270
Oh, right.

846
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,940
I told you to put
purple bamboo in a box.

847
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,210
What happened afterwards?

848
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,600
You guessed it right, My Lady.

849
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,860
Wantang truly is a spy.

850
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:30,060
I placed the purple bamboo
somewhere unnoticeable

851
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,380
and asked Wantang to tidy up the room.

852
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,190
Wantang,

853
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,270
go and tidy up Lady Wan's dressing table.

854
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:34,790
Okay.

855
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:16,500
Fuling,

856
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,400
it's done.

857
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:18,900
Go take a rest then.

858
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,400
Okay.

859
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,750
I followed her to the second gate

860
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:30,460
and saw her giving the item
to an old woman

861
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,610
before she came back.

862
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,100
I thought highly of her.

863
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:34,840
But it turns out she's a spy.

864
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:35,670
My Lady,

865
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,310
why don't I probe into the background

866
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:38,540
of that old woman tomorrow?

867
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,420
That can wait.

868
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,970
We should first guard against Wantang.

869
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,030
My Lady,

870
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,730
could Lianye's death

871
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:51,830
be relevant to Concubine Liu?

872
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:54,310
I'm not sure of it yet.

873
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,060
But indeed, Lianye

874
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,620
and Concubine Liu
were murdered in a similar way.

875
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:01,710
They both died of suffocation
due to attacks on their necks.

876
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:03,980
They both visited the Purple Bamboo Grove.

877
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,510
Injuries left on Lianye's body
when she tried to flee and fight.

878
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,820
It shows that the murderer
had never killed anyone before,

879
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,360
so he had no experience
as to how to control his preys.

880
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,840
There is only one fatal wound
on Concubine Liu's body.

881
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,670
The murderer decisively and brutally
took her life

882
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:17,740
with one strike only.

883
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,870
That couldn't be the first time he killed.

884
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,190
If my guess is correct,

885
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:24,010
when we find the killer of Concubine Liu,

886
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,310
we'll also figure out the truth
of Lianye's death.

887
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,170
Think about it.

888
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,540
Only the murderer knows

889
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,630
Lianye went to the Purple Bamboo Grove.

890
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,080
Wantang's secret master

891
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,460
is very likely

892
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,150
the killer of Concubine Liu.

893
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:37,420
Wan!

894
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:38,750
Wan!

895
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,100
Wan, help!

896
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:43,090
-Wan!
-Li,

897
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:43,960
calm down.

898
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:45,020
What happened?

899
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:45,830
Listen,

900
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,350
the Heir of Prince Rui

901
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:48,800
brought some people to my place.

902
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,960
They'll find out about my illness!

903
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,710
Why is His Highness
searching the mansion again?

904
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:54,700
It's said that Liu Chun went missing,

905
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,180
so they're looking for him.

906
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,370
Could Liu Chun be...

907
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:58,670
Wan,

908
00:42:58,890 --> 00:42:59,710
it'll be a real disaster

909
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,260
if they mistake me
for Concubine Liu's lover

910
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,580
and arrest me!

911
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,230
Even rabbits don't eat
the grass by their dens.

912
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:05,850
I would be worse than an animal

913
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:06,900
if I ever had an affair

914
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,230
with my father's women, wouldn't I?

915
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:09,540
Calm down, Li.

916
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,600
I will explain your illness
to His Highness.

917
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,470
Really?

918
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,100
Really.

919
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:14,890
Thank you, Wan.

920
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:18,540
Wan, the mansion is not
quite peaceful lately.

921
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,960
Madam Qin hates it most
when there's trouble.

922
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,610
Listen,

923
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:22,630
do not go to the Purple Bamboo Grove.

924
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,450
Madam Qin,

925
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:27,490
out of constant fear
of accidents related to wells,

926
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,100
immediately ordered all the wells

927
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,710
in the mansion to be sealed overnight.

928
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:32,860
Li,

929
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:36,560
do you know there is a well
in the Purple Bamboo Grove?

930
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:37,900
How did you get to know that?

931
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,140
I need an answer from you.

932
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,470
Did Madam Qin lock down the grove

933
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:41,990
because of that well?

934
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:46,370
Yes.
