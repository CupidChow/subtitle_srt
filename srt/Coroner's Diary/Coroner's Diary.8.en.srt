[Coroner's Diary]

2
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:33,940
[Episode 8]

3
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,410
Did you see with your own eyes

4
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,789
that it was Chen's maid who took the musk?

5
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:42,729
I checked the prescription several times,

6
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:44,479
and even coaxed it out of Physician Qian.

7
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,479
I'm sure about it.

8
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,580
That maid said

9
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,259
it was for the Eldest Young Master's
dizziness.

10
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,500
Dizziness?

11
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,380
Chen looks clear-headed

12
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,770
and perfectly healthy.

13
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,229
Doesn't seem like someone
suffering from that.

14
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,550
Even if Physician Qian

15
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,960
isn't very skilled,

16
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,320
he wouldn't misdiagnose something
that obvious.

17
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,870
So why did he let that maid

18
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,890
take something as valuable as musk?

19
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,360
To please the Eldest Young Master,
obviously.

20
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,360
Let it go, My Lady.

21
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,750
You helped the Young Madam
protect her unborn child.

22
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,280
That's more than enough
for the third branch.

23
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:19,870
Fuling!

24
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,970
I'm not that close to you!

25
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,570
Why did you scare me in broad daylight?

26
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,430
It's only been a few days
and you don't recognize me?

27
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,100
I'm Bai Feng. Greetings, Miss Qin.

28
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,760
The servants from Qin Mansion
gave us a few leads.

29
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,250
Master is waiting at the pavilion ahead

30
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,980
to discuss something with you.

31
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,370
Thank you, General Bai.

32
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,510
Fuling, take the medicine back first.

33
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,290
I'll walk Fuling back.

34
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,060
Let me carry them for you.

35
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,650
No need.

36
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,880
They're too heavy for you.

37
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,670
No need.

38
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,630
Let me.

39
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,690
No need!

40
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,090
You offended everyone at the Qin family.

41
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,490
Why did they
still serve you tea and snacks?

42
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,250
With greedy Bai Feng around,

43
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:31,030
there's always food.

44
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,310
Weren't we supposed to discuss the case?

45
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,660
Why did you pick a spot like this?

46
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,079
Aren't you afraid someone might eavesdrop?

47
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,400
This place is wide open.

48
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,610
No one could

49
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,630
hide from me here.

50
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,590
Please, have a seat.

51
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,510
You've had a long night.

52
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,770
Did you find anything?

53
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,430
We haven't found Liu Chun,

54
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,870
but I've ordered a citywide search.

55
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,950
Still, it wasn't a total loss.

56
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,350
Master Qin An

57
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,830
also has syphilis.

58
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,630
The servants from Qin Mansion

59
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,540
said his illness began about 20 days ago,

60
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,000
which matches the days
he claimed to be sick.

61
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,520
The deceased was
a concubine of Master Qin An.

62
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,390
It's not surprising he got infected.

63
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,000
There's also another person.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,550
Qin Li?

65
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:15,520
Exactly.

66
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:17,209
His illness

67
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,560
has nothing to do with the deceased.

68
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,209
Why do you trust him so much?

69
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,980
Because I treated his illness.

70
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,340
Concubine Liu's condition has been

71
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,600
repeatedly treated with folk remedies.

72
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,520
If they were really involved
with each other,

73
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,780
Qin Li would have used medicine earlier.

74
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,710
Besides,

75
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,310
Concubine Liu's illness
lasted much longer.

76
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,670
When Qin Li fell ill,

77
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,480
her sores were already severe and obvious.

78
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,900
How could a playboy who frequents brothels

79
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,230
be so blinded by lust
as to take such risks?

80
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,860
Everyone in the mansion knows

81
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,120
I'm handling this case for His Highness.

82
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,610
If he were truly her lover,

83
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,030
why would he keep begging me to save him?

84
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,700
That leaves

85
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,210
only Liu Chun.

86
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,170
That handkerchief indeed
belongs to Liu Chun.

87
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,870
The servants of Qin family also said

88
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,130
Liu Chun hasn't been seen

89
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,400
since roll call.

90
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,220
Huo Huaixin suspects that Liu Chun,

91
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,900
fearing the affair would be exposed,

92
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,430
killed Liu because she

93
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,520
passed the disease to Master Qin An

94
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,780
and then fled in guilt.

95
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,410
But if he wanted to hide the affair,

96
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,600
why not bury the body

97
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,070
and instead leave a handkerchief behind?

98
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,140
The autopsy

99
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,180
will reveal the deceased's illness.

100
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,290
He definitely won't escape
the adultery charge.

101
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,090
Killing Liu would be pointless.

102
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,520
Unless...

103
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,950
Unless someone set him up

104
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,800
and the real murderer is someone else.

105
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,330
Exactly.

106
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,350
If that's true,

107
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,310
I'm afraid Liu Chun is in danger.

108
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,990
Since the murderer could get Liu Chun's
handkerchief,

109
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,050
they must know him.

110
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,730
If they want to frame him,

111
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,260
they will kill him for sure.

112
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,530
We must find Liu Chun as soon as possible.

113
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,560
[Wanted]

114
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,720
Seal off all exits

115
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,430
and search the entire city for Liu Chun!

116
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,120
Yes!

117
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,370
Come here.

118
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:01,660
Go.

119
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,080
Wait.

120
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,670
Keep moving.

121
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,010
Go.

122
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,460
Go.

123
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,700
It's getting colder now
that autumn's here.

124
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,560
If it weren't for what happened
to Concubine Liu,

125
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,420
we wouldn't be out here freezing.

126
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,290
Shut up.

127
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,430
Don't talk about the living during the day,
and don't talk about ghosts at night.

128
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,030
Don't talk nonsense
in the middle of the night.

129
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,830
Ghost!

130
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,380
My Lord.

131
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,630
There is still no news.

132
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,450
Your Highness, we've searched
inside and outside the city.

133
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,080
Even if Liu Chun had wings,

134
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,710
he would've left some trace.

135
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,720
Then get the team together

136
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,630
and search Qin Mansion again.

137
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,490
Your Highness,

138
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,630
we've already checked everywhere
a person could hide in Qin Mansion.

139
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,190
Then, Prefect Huo, check the places

140
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,570
where no one could hide.

141
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,430
Well...

142
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:16,830
Yes.

143
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,310
Master.

144
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,140
The Purple Bamboo Grove in Qin Mansion

145
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,020
is haunted.

146
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,330
Haunted?

147
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,320
Your Highness,

148
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,140
I haven't found anything yet.

149
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,800
You've searched the place.

150
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,060
There's nothing here.

151
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,640
If you keep saying nonsense,

152
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,430
I'll have you taken to the authorities!

153
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,310
Eldest Young Master,

154
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,190
we wouldn't dare lie.

155
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,040
We really did see ghost fire

156
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,990
just now.

157
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,020
That's right. The female ghost...

158
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,510
We clearly heard a female ghost crying.

159
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,600
A female ghost?

160
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,430
She must have a story.

161
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,430
Your Highness,

162
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,510
servants' gossip cannot be trusted.

163
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:01,820
If it's not true,

164
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,930
why did your family seal off

165
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,770
this bamboo grove that's so lush?

166
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:06,230
Well...

167
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,320
My second brother and I

168
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,610
once fell into the well there as children.

169
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,970
Our grandmother, out of love,

170
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,320
ordered the sealing of the well

171
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,180
with a demon-suppressing stone.

172
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,940
Master, Lady Wan is here.

173
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:28,890
Your Highness,

174
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,720
my ninth sister is still unmarried

175
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,000
and faces many restrictions.

176
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,789
It's better if I attend you instead.

177
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:36,190
No need to trouble
two people for one thing.

178
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,070
Since you are here,

179
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,580
I'll trouble you again.

180
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,659
Yes.

181
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:28,190
This stone slab should be the
demon-suppressing stone sealing the well.

182
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,310
Judging by the moss,

183
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,520
it was moved not long ago.

184
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,980
This is a forbidden place of Qin Mansion.

185
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,290
Who would move the stone

186
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,960
for no reason?

187
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,170
There are signs of stomping here.

188
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,630
Someone must have struggled fiercely here.

189
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:19,370
Bai Feng,

190
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,760
go down and take a look.

191
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,330
Yes.

192
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,940
There's a dead body in the well!

193
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,270
Throw down the rope!

194
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,490
Quick, get the scaffolding set up.

195
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,460
Miss Qin,

196
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,130
Xu He is still in the morgue.

197
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,830
Please carry out the initial autopsy.

198
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,470
Are you sure?

199
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,920
If you examine the body here,

200
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,160
you won't be able to hide
that you're skilled at autopsies.

201
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,220
It doesn't matter.

202
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,580
It's time to show them
what I'm capable of.

203
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,360
Prefect Huo,

204
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,650
please don't let anyone else disturb me.

205
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:14,450
Constable Qi,

206
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,180
guard the entrance to the bamboo grove.

207
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,070
No unauthorized persons allowed inside.

208
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:18,690
Yes.

209
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:20,950
Then, as usual,

210
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:22,510
you speak

211
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:23,700
and I record.

212
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,420
My Lord, it's coming up!

213
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,300
It's coming up!

214
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,000
Be careful.

215
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,220
Give him a hand!

216
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,850
Hurry! Put it here.

217
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,390
Be gentle.

218
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,230
Don't destroy the evidence on the body.

219
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,200
It's really Liu Chun.

220
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,380
How could you let Yan Chi barge into
the Purple Bamboo Grove?

221
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:54,950
You...

222
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,360
Why didn't you confront him?

223
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,610
Tell him

224
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,420
if he forces his way in,

225
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,040
you'll...

226
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,980
you'll die right in front of him!

227
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,480
Madam Qin, calm down.

228
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,670
Go away!

229
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,940
It was all my fault.

230
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,600
Don't let yourself get sick from anger.

231
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,790
Mother.

232
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,330
Mother, please calm down.

233
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,770
The Heir of Prince Rui has a noble status.

234
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,090
Our Chen

235
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,380
has no title at all.

236
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,240
How could we possibly stop him?

237
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,640
Then I'll go.

238
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:27,170
I've fought hard
to keep the third branch going until now.

239
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,930
I won't let anyone

240
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,250
destroy my hard work.

241
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,020
Mother!

242
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,340
-Grandma!
-Mother!

243
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,250
But...

244
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,960
But what if even you can't stop him?

245
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,450
Don't worry.

246
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,920
I have my own way.

247
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,570
He was strangled to death too.

248
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,190
Let me.

249
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,880
The one who had an affair
with Concubine Liu

250
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,010
was indeed Liu Chun.

251
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,330
Record:

252
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,260
The deceased Liu Chun,

253
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,510
about 40 to 45 years old,

254
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,220
body found in a dried-up well
in the Purple Bamboo Grove.

255
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,450
The deceased's head,

256
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,050
left shoulder,

257
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,430
and left side of the robe

258
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,360
have mud stains.

259
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,990
The heels of his shoes

260
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,790
and the outer sides of his calves

261
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,670
have dried mud.

262
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,280
Preliminary judgment:

263
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,590
The deceased was strangled outside

264
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,720
then pushed into the well to be hidden.

265
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,810
His face is bluish-purple,

266
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,800
probably caused by

267
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,880
strangulation blocking blood flow.

268
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,120
The strangulation marks are deep,

269
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,850
with bleeding above and below.

270
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,340
The marks meet at the back of the neck.

271
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,920
There are food residues

272
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,800
on the neck

273
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,990
and lips,

274
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,720
indicating the victim was eating

275
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,980
noodles or similar food when strangled.

276
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:32,620
From the wounds,

277
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:36,340
Liu Chun and Concubine Liu
share the same cause of death:

278
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,200
both were strangled from behind.

279
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,300
The strangulation method is identical.

280
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,980
The deceased's shoe heels
show obvious wear

281
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,140
and have dried mud.

282
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,660
There are also wounds on his fingers.

283
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,320
Dried leaves and soil fragments
are found under the fingernails,

284
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,680
indicating a struggle outside the well

285
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,870
before death.

286
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,340
The deceased shows signs
of pus-filled sores,

287
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,030
along with hair loss.

288
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,150
There are purple-black swollen lumps

289
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,700
on the chest,

290
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,140
abdomen, and left back,

291
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,850
with some of the decayed ones
emitting a foul odor.

292
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,810
This indicates a recurrence of syphilis,

293
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,610
now progressed to a severe form.

294
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,330
Among known patients,
this case had the longest duration

295
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,660
and was the most severe.

296
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,370
I got it.

297
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:56,190
Liu Chun must have passed
the disease to Concubine Liu.

298
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,910
Fearing discovery by Master Qin An,

299
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,040
he killed her first.

300
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,480
Unexpectedly,

301
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,940
Master Qin An also contracted the disease

302
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,300
and, in anger, killed Liu Chun.

303
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,580
If you keep making baseless guesses
about the case,

304
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,080
I'll report you for reckless handling
of a life.

305
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,920
Your Highness...

306
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,560
No, no, no.

307
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,210
Surveillance Commissioner, I was wrong.

308
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,450
I won't speak recklessly again.

309
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:25,490
Thank you.

310
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,660
There are no other wounds
found on the body.

311
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,470
After pressing the bloodstains,

312
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,270
only slight fading is observed,

313
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,570
with slow rebound.

314
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,020
All his limbs and joints are stiff.

315
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,130
It must have been

316
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,400
at least 6 to 7 hours since death.

317
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,550
In that case,

318
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,040
Liu Chun was strangled here

319
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,780
between 7 and 9 a.m.,

320
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,390
after Concubine Liu's death.

321
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,280
Yes.

322
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,280
Prefect Huo,

323
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,880
the preliminary autopsy is complete.

324
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,060
The cause of death for Liu Chun

325
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,090
is clear;

326
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,370
no further examination is needed.

327
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,230
Any questions?

328
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,490
I believe in you.

329
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,329
According to the preliminary results,

330
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:09,190
Concubine Liu

331
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,690
and Liu Chun

332
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,940
were killed by the same person.

333
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:15,400
The killer likely used Liu Chun's
handkerchief

334
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,290
to lure Concubine Liu to the flower shed

335
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,819
and strangled her to death,

336
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,849
then came here and killed Liu Chun.

337
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,869
Liu Chun died as early as 7 a.m.,

338
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,930
but the Qin family's servants said

339
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,390
he went missing
after the morning roll call.

340
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:28,830
If the pancake

341
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,550
belonged to Liu Chun,

342
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,110
why was it only eaten
just before the killing?

343
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,840
Besides, Liu Chun was tall.

344
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,220
Even I

345
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,110
couldn't have quietly

346
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,080
forced him here.

347
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,510
You mean

348
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,510
Liu Chun hid here himself

349
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,110
after the morning roll call?

350
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,400
Not just that.

351
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,070
Don't forget,

352
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,480
the murderer is someone who had access

353
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,620
to their love token.

354
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,980
Judging by how Concubine Liu was killed,

355
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,010
the murderer likely tricked Liu Chun

356
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,540
into hiding here
after the morning roll call,

357
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,680
then used the excuse
of delivering a pancake

358
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,550
to catch him off guard,
strangled him from behind,

359
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,080
and dumped his body into the well.

360
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,110
The person who could catch Liu Chun
completely off guard

361
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,360
must have been someone he deeply trusted.

362
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,320
The question is,

363
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,530
why didn't the murderer restore

364
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,540
the well opening after the murder?

365
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,160
Even if they couldn't move the stone slab,

366
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,350
they should have at least

367
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,350
cleared the traces around the well.

368
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,860
If the crime scene

369
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,400
at the flower shed wasn't cleaned

370
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,880
because it was in a conspicuous spot

371
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,250
and time was limited,

372
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,750
then the Purple Bamboo Grove,
being rarely visited,

373
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,230
should have given plenty of time.

374
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,090
So why wasn't that scene cleaned?

375
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,410
Was the murderer so confident

376
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,610
that they wouldn't expose themselves?

377
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:43,130
Maybe this person had accomplices

378
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,610
who could help clean up.

379
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,590
We were searching everywhere for Liu Chun

380
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,480
when ghost fire appeared
in the Purple Bamboo Grove.

381
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,340
That's too much of a coincidence.

382
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,140
The recent cold and rainy weather

383
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,820
shouldn't have allowed
ghost fire to appear.

384
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,550
If the ghost fire was man-made,

385
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:58,920
then Liu Chun

386
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,340
was bait used to lure us here.

387
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,900
Then this well

388
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,250
must hold some other secrets.

389
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,500
Bai Feng.

390
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,020
Start digging the well.

391
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,610
Yes.

392
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,060
Prepare some digging tools.

393
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,970
Hurry back.

394
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:19,350
Yes.

395
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,950
Your Highness, Prefect Huo,

396
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,940
Madam Qin and the Third Madam
are arguing to enter the grove.

397
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,420
Should I stop them?

398
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,420
Officers,

399
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,880
this murder happened in our Qin Mansion,

400
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,060
yet we don't even know who the victim is.

401
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,520
How could that make sense?

402
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,390
His Highness
is investigating the case himself.

403
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,940
None of us in Qin Mansion

404
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,070
would dare disturb him without cause.

405
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,220
But surely we have the right

406
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,470
to witness the scene, don't we?

407
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,030
Could it be that there's something

408
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,030
even we, the owners of this mansion,

409
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,470
are not allowed to know?

410
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,170
The Surveillance Commissioner and Prefect

411
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,650
have strictly forbidden
any unauthorized persons from entering.

412
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,650
Madam Qin, Young Master Qizhi Chen,

413
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,080
please don't make things difficult for us.

414
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,910
Mother,

415
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,530
well...

416
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,010
Alright.

417
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,470
I won't make things difficult
for you officials.

418
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:07,990
Hurry.

419
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,650
Let's go to the capital
and report this to His Majesty,

420
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:14,370
asking the Marquis of Zhongyong
to accuse Yan Chi

421
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,850
of disrespect, lawlessness,

422
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,290
and bullying!

423
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,750
Madam Qin, Young Master Chen,

424
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,630
the Surveillance Commissioner
has given permission

425
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,530
for two people
to enter the Purple Bamboo Grove.

426
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,560
Which two will go with me?

427
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,110
Your Highness, a...

428
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:38,850
a skull!

429
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,610
We only found it
after digging three feet deep.

430
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:41,740
Without your order,

431
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,540
I dared not dig any further.

432
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,440
The skull is small,

433
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,820
and the bones are thin and light,

434
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,860
with an indistinct brow ridge,

435
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,460
nearly round eye sockets

436
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,320
with sharp upper edges.

437
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,830
It's the skull of a woman.

438
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,890
Can we determine the time of death?

439
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,140
We'll only know the details

440
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,000
after examining the well bottom.

441
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,090
But judging by the state of the bones,

442
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,970
this woman has been dead
for at least seven years.

443
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,000
Prefect Huo,

444
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:43,000
you must uphold justice
for the Qin family.

445
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,680
Don't worry, Madam Qin.

446
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,540
We've already found Steward Liu's body
in the well.

447
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:48,550
Grandma!

448
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,500
I hurried here

449
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:07,680
but was still too late.

450
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,280
Your Highness, Prefect Huo,

451
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,080
since you have already discovered this,

452
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,660
there's no need to keep it secret anymore,

453
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,430
so as to avoid any future
misunderstandings.

454
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:22,370
But since this concerns
the women of our household,

455
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,580
please do not

456
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,960
spread it outside.

457
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,080
Madam Qin, please go ahead.

458
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:33,030
It was all my son's fault.

459
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,220
Eight years ago,

460
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,440
my disappointing third son insisted on

461
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,560
taking Concubine Liu into the household.

462
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,360
At the time, Concubine Yang was pregnant

463
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,510
and lost the baby due to the commotion.

464
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,080
Unable to accept it,

465
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:51,100
she threw herself into the well.

466
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,710
We invited a sorcerer,

467
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:56,480
who said her resentment was too strong

468
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,760
and that her soul had become vengeful.

469
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,710
Only a demon-suppressing stone
could seal the well

470
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,920
and protect the household.

471
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,100
Since then,

472
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,040
I ordered the well sealed

473
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:11,310
and the Purple Bamboo Grove
was declared off-limits.

474
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,180
I was afraid someone
might use this incident

475
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,490
to attack the Marquis of Zhongyong,

476
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:20,620
so I covered it up.

477
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:24,680
I didn't expect this cursed well
would truly bring disaster.

478
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,290
Please…

479
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,890
for the sake
of the Marquis of Zhongyong...

480
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,300
Zhou's law clearly states that

481
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,400
if someone dies
under unusual circumstances,

482
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,060
the authorities must be notified

483
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,790
and an investigation carried out
before burial.

484
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,970
Was there anyone who actually witnessed

485
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,500
Concubine Yang's suicide?

486
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:44,820
Her maid tried to stop her,

487
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,160
but was so frightened

488
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,500
she took to bed

489
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,360
and passed away soon after.

490
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,740
Then how can you be sure

491
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:00,150
these are Concubine Yang's remains?

492
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,720
All these years,

493
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,830
no one else

494
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,960
has thrown themselves into that well.

495
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,610
Since you've identified
the remains as Concubine Yang's,

496
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,670
today's discovery

497
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,880
will be treated as the official report

498
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:14,900
of her death.

499
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,710
That is my intention too.

500
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,820
Then what about the death of Lianye?

501
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,570
Why not report that too?

502
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,520
Lianye was her parents' only daughter.

503
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:31,840
They didn't want her to be disturbed

504
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,650
even in death

505
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,480
and firmly refused to report it.

506
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:39,430
I gave them some money for burial,

507
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:42,410
and she's long since been laid to rest.

508
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,890
With so many deaths in Qin Mansion,

509
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,680
it's clear that
demon-suppressing stone is useless.

510
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,080
Rather than holding rituals,

511
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,730
it would be better to let
the authorities investigate properly

512
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,460
and bury the dead with respect.

513
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,070
That is the right way—

514
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,490
to bring peace to the dead.

515
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,380
But...

516
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,940
We're at your command, Your Highness.

517
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,630
Constable Qi.

518
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,950
Have the remaining bones removed.

519
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,020
Yes.

520
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,220
Your Highness,

521
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,000
what should we do about Liu Chun's case?

522
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:18,190
Liu Chun's and Concubine Liu's cases
are mutually corroborated.

523
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,500
Neither may be buried

524
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,560
before a final verdict is reached.

525
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,400
Yes.

526
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,390
What's that smell?

527
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,310
Smell it.

528
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:04,990
Smell it.

529
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,560
The scent won't last long.

530
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,260
It smells...

531
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,320
like garlic.

532
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,390
It's the smell of burning phosphorus.

533
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,720
Phosphorus fire, also called ghost fire,

534
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,500
appears when bones decay

535
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:22,250
and phosphorus
in the bones evaporates into the air.

536
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,920
Phosphorus can spontaneously ignite
when exposed to air

537
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,380
and burns with a green flame.

538
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,450
Because it often appears near graves,

539
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,110
people think it's ghost fire.

540
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,670
White phosphorus can be bought
at temples and pharmacies.

541
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,040
When burned at night,

542
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,950
it can mimic ghost fire and scare people.

543
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,650
White phosphorus
can be used to fake ghost fire,

544
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:39,910
so the ghost fire the night patrolmen saw

545
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,530
was definitely man-made.

546
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,560
Your Highness, Miss Qin,

547
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,010
we found some thin ropes
tied to several branches.

548
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,290
We don't know what they're for.

549
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,330
Please check it out.

550
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,070
It's right ahead.

551
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,980
Sure enough, there's a garlic smell.

552
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,050
Now it's confirmed.

553
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,660
Someone tied cotton soaked
with white phosphorus

554
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,860
to bamboo branches,

555
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,040
then shook the branches
by pulling the ropes,

556
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,890
accompanied by wailing cries—

557
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:46,210
what a puppet show of a female ghost
crying out for justice.

558
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,470
If it weren't for Concubine Liu's death,

559
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,510
we wouldn't have investigated Liu Chun.

560
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,620
If not for the servants
finding ghost fire,

561
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,610
we might not have investigated
the Purple Bamboo Grove thoroughly.

562
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,680
If we hadn't found Liu Chun's body

563
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,750
in the well there,

564
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:59,810
we wouldn't have discovered
Concubine Yang's remains.

565
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,720
These coincidences must be connected.

566
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,850
And there's Lianye.

567
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,640
Based on the method of killing,

568
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:06,840
I suspect

569
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,270
Lianye was the first victim
of the murderer,

570
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,470
followed by Concubine Liu and Liu Chun.

571
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,110
Lianye must have seen the murderer's face

572
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,640
in the Purple Bamboo Grove,

573
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,770
which led to her being strangled
and thrown into the lake.

574
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,860
But why was Lianye
in the Purple Bamboo Grove at midnight?

575
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,910
And what was the murderer doing there?

576
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:23,290
Too many things relate
to the Purple Bamboo Grove.

577
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:23,910
Perhaps

578
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,000
this is the murderer's true intention.

579
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,020
It's impossible
to accomplish these things alone.

580
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,550
Whoever the mastermind is,

581
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,680
since they went to such lengths

582
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,700
to make us find Concubine Yang's remains,

583
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,840
her death

584
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,400
is definitely more complicated
than what Madam Qin said.

585
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,540
Mother,

586
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,990
why did you bring up Concubine Yang today?

587
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:50,810
They were already holding her skull;

588
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,100
what was the point of keeping it a secret?

589
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,930
Why are you looking at Caihe?

590
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,160
She's the most loyal and sensible one.

591
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,760
She wouldn't say anything.

592
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:09,840
Grandma,

593
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,340
do you know

594
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,550
exactly what Wan is doing

595
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,200
for the Heir of Prince Rui?

596
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,260
She was holding a skull

597
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,000
without a trace of fear—

598
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,680
it was quite strange.

599
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:23,490
That girl grew up in Medicine King Valley

600
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:27,640
and naturally developed a brave character.

601
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,110
You should find a chance

602
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,260
to remind her

603
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,970
not to forget she's also a Qin.

604
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:38,510
Although our third branch
wasn't kind to her before,

605
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,160
for the sake of the future,

606
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,560
she should know whom to side with.

607
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,200
I understand.

608
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,380
Grandma, there's one more thing.

609
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,250
Father's illness is getting worse.

610
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,930
Should we ask Wan to...

611
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:50,830
No.

612
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,590
Asking a younger family member like Wan

613
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,850
to treat your father's private disease—

614
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,450
if that got out,

615
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,990
our family will become a joke.

616
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,440
Grandma, please calm down.

617
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,900
I didn't think it through.

618
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,260
Mother,

619
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,600
if they keep digging the well like this…

620
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,620
Let them dig.

621
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,790
I've already told them.

622
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,530
Once they dig up

623
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:17,180
all of Concubine Yang's remains,

624
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,880
they won't dig any deeper.

625
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,840
Mother!

626
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:21,610
Mother!

627
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,480
What are you doing?

628
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,310
Jumping around like that.

629
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,510
You startled me.

630
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:30,460
After being the madam for so many years,

631
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,600
you're not as steady as Chen.

632
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,270
Mother, you are right.

633
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,970
I just worry that Yan Chi might blame

634
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,150
Concubine Yang's death on our family.

635
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:49,120
I've already had Chen

636
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,530
write to the Marquis of Zhongyong.

637
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:55,530
The Crown Prince values him highly.

638
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,530
If Yan Chi wants to cause trouble
for our Qin family,

639
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,510
it won't be easy.

640
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:04,960
But the murderer of Liu Chun

641
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,120
and Concubine Liu hasn't been found yet,

642
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,610
and now Concubine Yang's remains
have been discovered.

643
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,610
The household is in panic now.

644
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,370
Why did Concubine Yang

645
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,350
have to end her life in that well?

646
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,680
Why are you

647
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,010
bringing that up again?

648
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,370
Don't keep asking why.

649
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:22,210
Spend some money

650
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,700
and let her rest in peace
as soon as possible.

651
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,430
What about Steward Liu and Concubine Liu?

652
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,960
Those two servants

653
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,520
secretly had an affair

654
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:36,790
and caused the Qin family
to fall into this state.

655
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,730
Once this is over,

656
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,480
throw their bodies

657
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,160
onto the mass grave.

658
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,510
Yes.

659
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,470
That cursed well

660
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,670
has brought chaos to our family.

661
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,640
After this is settled,

662
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,740
seal that well—

663
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,620
seal it completely.

664
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,640
We can't let that well

665
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,630
cause trouble again.

666
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,190
That's right.

667
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,320
Mother, you're right,

668
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,890
Seal it completely.

669
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,440
You've never dealt
with criminal cases before.

670
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,030
How did you come to think

671
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,890
these three cases are connected?

672
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,990
When I was stationed at Shuoxi,

673
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,740
whenever the Rong people

674
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,400
killed innocent border villagers,

675
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,460
they would deliberately leave clues

676
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,260
to lure the tracking soldiers

677
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,110
into ambushes.

678
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,240
When you mentioned the suspicious points

679
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,590
about the murders in
the Purple Bamboo Grove,

680
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,850
it reminded me of that.

681
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,120
You were

682
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,780
in the tracking team too?

683
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,140
I was the leader.

684
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,080
It was my first time
leading a patrol alone.

685
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,030
Get in!

686
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,750
Hurry up! Get in!

687
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:10,090
Hurry!

688
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,730
Seeing innocent people slaughtered,

689
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,770
I only wanted to kill the Rong people.

690
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,000
Stop! Stop!

691
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:02,400
Stop!

692
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,550
Stop!

693
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:05,880

Only Bai Feng and I survived.

00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,130
Let's go!

722
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,520
How old were you?

723
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:05,910
18 years old.

724
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,280
You probably never thought

725
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,410
I'd be that foolish back then, did you?

726
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:13,550
Boys from other families that age

727
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,190
are still enjoying
their parents' care and affection,

728
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:21,150
but you were already risking your life
to protect the family and country.

729
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,410
Such bravery truly made you a young hero.

730
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,600
You don't have to blame yourself
over one failure.

731
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:40,070
You should go back and rest early.

732
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,770
Don't get involved
in this case any further.

733
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:43,520
Why?

734
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,720
Did I say anything wrong?

735
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:48,540
No.

736
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:51,270
I just didn't think it through before.

737
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,670
Since you asked for my help,

738
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,330
you can't go back on your word.

739
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,800
This case involves the Qin family's past.

740
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,030
Its reputation
will be ruined in the future.

741
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,280
If you step back now,

742
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,260
whatever happens

743
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:04,690
won't be your fault.

744
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,690
If I wanted to stay out of this,

745
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:09,310
I wouldn't have gotten involved
in Lianye's and Concubine Liu's cases.

746
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,840
Four lives are involved in this.

747
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,770
How could I just stand by and watch?

748
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,680
Don't worry.

749
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:16,920
I will do my best to solve this case.

750
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:19,870
Concubine Yang's body has turned to bones.

751
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,460
Xu He is not skilled enough.

752
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,250
Without my help,

753
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,690
you can't even conduct an autopsy.

754
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,220
Let along solving the case.

755
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,880
Your Highness,

756
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,240
if things get bad,

757
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,590
I will ask for your help.

758
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,140
By then,

759
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,890
just help me get out of trouble.

760
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,040
What do you think?

761
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,490
Okay.

762
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,620
You won't change your mind, will you?

763
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,570
Never.

764
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,080
Tonight,

765
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,950
after Constable Qi
digs up the remaining bodies,

766
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,150
I will

767
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,300
clear the mud
and examine the bones the next day.

768
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,590
Deal.

769
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,710
Is your grandma crazy?

770
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:35,900
Yan Chi just became
the circuit surveillance commissioner

771
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,830
and is eager to show his authority.

772
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,610
She brought up that woman now—

773
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:43,540
isn't she sending me straight
to the chopping block?

774
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,200
Lord Yan has already
ordered the well to be dug.

775
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,060
Father, please watch your words.

776
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,000
He did it already?

777
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,480
He did it already?

778
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,280
Chen! Chen!

779
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,030
What if they find anything about me?

780
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,000
What if they find anything about me?

781
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,590
Grandma has arranged everything.

782
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:13,250
Father, just calm down
and focus on recovering.

783
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,190
How can I calm down?

784
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:21,290
Grandma has already
sent someone to the capital

785
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:23,070
to ask the Eldest Uncle
to speak on your behalf.

786
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,420
We can't let you pay for the death

787
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,170
of a concubine with your life.

788
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,480
Yes.

789
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,940
Just a concubine.

790
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,480
Brother will help me.

791
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,190
He will. He will.

792
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,030
He will.

793
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,470
The human skeleton is quite complex.

794
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:35,360
To avoid mistakes
when piecing the bones together,

795
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,780
we must carefully mark each bone

796
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,180
according to this chart.

797
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,030
Yes.

798
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,320
Your Highness, please draw

799
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,920
the corresponding bone diagram
on the postmortem report.

800
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,590
Okay.

801
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,210
Start piecing the bones.

802
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,420
It's done.

803
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,440
Start recording.

804
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,600
Record:

805
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:26,600
The deceased

806
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,680
is Concubine Yang,

807
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:28,230
female,

808
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,020
about 5 feet 7 inches tall.

809
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,570
Based on the length of the leg bones,

810
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:34,700
her age is estimated between 20 and 30.

811
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,180
The bones are normal in color

812
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,850
and smooth,

813
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:41,690
with no obvious signs of poisoning.

814
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,230
The fatal injury

815
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,360
is a broken neck.

816
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,100
The skull shows clear damage.

817
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,070
The sternum

818
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:52,230
and limbs

819
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:54,990
all have varying degrees of fractures.

820
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,660
The cause of death
is likely a fall from height.

821
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:00,960
There are multiple
clear grooves on her pubic bone,

822
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,200
indicating she gave birth

823
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,600
at least once in her life.

824
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,960
But Madam Qin said Concubine Yang

825
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,420
only had one miscarriage.

826
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,400
If it were only a miscarriage,

827
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,860
the pubic bone wouldn't
have such markings.

828
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,550
When a woman is eight or nine months
pregnant,

829
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:16,110
the connective tissue
at the pubic bone gradually opens

830
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:18,370
and fully separates during childbirth.

831
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,560
The connective tissue embedding
into the bone

832
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,250
causes these grooves

833
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,820
behind the pubic bone.

834
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,290
But until now,

835
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,800
I've never heard of the deceased

836
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,460
having any children
while alive at Qin Mansion.

837
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,200
Could it be that all her children
died young?

838
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,040
Looks like I need to meet with
Madam Qin again.

839
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,600
She's old and scheming.

840
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,010
You won't get much from her.

841
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:42,920
But the Third Madam is weak-willed

842
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,980
and more likely to reveal something.

843
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,390
Okay.

844
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:50,070
Your Highness.

845
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,440
We've questioned
all the servants in Qin Mansion.

846
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,390
Only a few old servants remember
Concubine Yang,

847
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:56,990
and their accounts are similar
to Madam Qin's.

848
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,990
What about the ones
who served her back then?

849
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,700
Some have died, and some were sold off.

850
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,100
Not a single one remains.

851
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:04,580
Concubine Yang died only eight years ago,

852
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:06,840
yet not a single servant
with knowledge remains?

853
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,030
They said Madam Qin was heartbroken
that Concubine Yang

854
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:10,800
died from the grief
of losing her child and,

855
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,590
in anger,

856
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:14,120
she dismissed everyone who had served her.

857
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,110
Bai Feng.

858
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,730
Find the maids
who served the other concubines

859
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:20,620
back then.

860
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:23,320
There must have been channels among
the servants for sharing information.

861
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,040
There has to be someone we missed
who knows something.

862
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:25,650
Yes.

863
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:27,240
Prefect Huo,

864
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,400
summon the Third Madam for questioning.

865
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:29,940
Yes.

866
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:38,000
Wrist bone.

867
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:41,230
Metacarpal bone.

868
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,730
[Metacarpal bone]

869
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:52,000
Why is there an extra bone?
