[Coroner's Diary]

00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,890
[Episode 14]

3
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,690
You were not mistaken?

4
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,600
Not only did Yan Chi escort Qin Wan back,

5
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:43,840
he even gave her his Heir's Token.

6
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,789
I saw it clearly.

7
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,789
Lord Yan is unusually protective

8
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:50,320
of Lady Wan.

9
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,000
He even ordered the officers

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,039
to address her as Master Wan.

11
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,670
I didn't expect Yan Chi
to hold Qin Wan in such high regard.

12
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,940
No wonder the Marquis of Anyang was
willing to take her in as his adopted daughter.

13
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,420
It all makes sense now.

14
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,370
Do you think Qin Wan

15
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,110
has feelings for Yan Chi?

16
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,370
Lady Wan keeps her thoughts well hidden.

17
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,300
I cannot tell for now.

18
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,610
Yan Chi is highly respected in the army,

19
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,680
but his ties with the Crown Prince
and Prince Cheng are rather weak.

20
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,010
If we can draw him closer

21
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,360
to our family through Qin Wan,

22
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,630
the Crown Prince's influence would
be enough to overpower Prince Cheng.

23
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,610
But Lord Yan acts on his own terms

24
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,250
and shows little regard for others.

25
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,380
-Lady Wan may not be able to...
-I know.

26
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,140
There's no need to decide now.

27
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:41,040
We'll wait until we're back
in the capital and consult Father.

28
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,280
Throughout this journey,

29
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,900
what's your impression of the ladies?

30
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,910
In my opinion,

31
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,310
among the three ladies,

32
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,120
Lady Xiang has decent looks and manners.

33
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,410
Though she's a bit impulsive,

34
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,790
she could serve as a reliable backup.

35
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,090
Lady Shuang speaks and acts
without forethought.

36
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,170
She's likely of little use.

37
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,800
But Lady Wan's wit and finesse—

38
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,470
few noblewomen in the capital can compare.

39
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,890
And how do you think Qin Wan compares

40
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,470
to Yu?

41
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,060
Lady Yu has had a smooth path in life.

42
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,760
When it comes to depth and shrewdness,

43
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,670
she may fall slightly short of Lady Wan.

44
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,120
You're saying

45
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,720
Father should rank Qin Wan

46
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,470
ahead of Yu?

47
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,240
Lady Wan is impressive,

48
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,000
but the bond between
the second branch and the family...

49
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,030
If she enters the palace,

50
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,530
she may not keep our interests in mind.

51
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,800
Qin Wan

52
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,260
is like a double-edged sword.

53
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,960
If used well,

54
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,120
she can slay all our enemies.

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,260
But if handled poorly,

56
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,490
she could easily turn against us.

57
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,480
Still, she bears the Qin last name.

58
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,170
No matter how much control we exert,

59
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,210
her fate is tied

60
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,000
to the family.

61
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,030
Just make sure everything

62
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,920
is handled more carefully from now on.

63
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,890
We must never

64
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,070
let Qin Wan turn her back on our family.

65
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,710
I understand.

66
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,910
It's time for the medicine.

67
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,160
Why haven't they returned yet?

68
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,150
They wouldn't have fainted halfway,
would they?

69
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,560
Don't ask.

70
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,890
My only answer is—

71
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,710
I have no idea where they are right now.

72
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,340
Look,

73
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,140
I've already reheated the medicine twice.

74
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,510
If they don't come back to drink it,
there's nothing I can do.

75
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,580
Anyway, Junior,

76
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,159
don't blame me for this.

77
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,920
Then I'll go find him.

78
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,400
Wait...

79
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,560
What did you do?

80
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,030
What took you so long?

81
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:05,960
If you'd come back any later,

82
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,030
Junior would've made me
drink your bathwater.

83
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:08,830
They're back.

84
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,670
Don't worry. I'm fine.

85
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,330
Alright, take your medicine.

86
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:21,560
Master,

87
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,720
I'm fine now.

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,130
If the killer's real target is Senior,

89
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,750
then after brutally killing Song,

90
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,670
he must have been
in a violent state of mind.

91
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,380
I'm worried he won't wait
for the right moment

92
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,380
and will strike at Senior directly.

93
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,800
Then how about this—

94
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,840
I'll go keep watch.

95
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,240
Those Song fellows alone

96
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,530
might not be able
to protect Renxin Clinic.

97
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,850
You can barely walk.

98
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,400
What use would you be there?

99
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,180
Senior can't even fight.

100
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,020
He can barely protect himself.

101
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,409
And Feiyan is still ill.

102
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,630
Don't panic just yet.

103
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,650
I've received word that

104
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,430
the Black Armor Guards are already
at the foot of the mountain

105
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,090
and will arrive in four hours.

106
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,780
In these four hours,

107
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,670
Bai Feng and I will keep watch.

108
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,480
-No.
-No.

109
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,270
You haven't fully recovered yet.

110
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,830
You've already worked hard enough
just now.

111
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,430
You can't risk getting hurt again.

112
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:16,950
Right.

113
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,630
It's just a petty thief.

114
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,390
What's there to be afraid of?

115
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,320
Master Wan said no, so you can't go.

116
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:23,130
Exactly.

117
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,160
Alright.

118
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,850
Don't worry.

119
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,659
We'll only scout the terrain

120
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:37,260
and help them set up some men.

121
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,950
After you have lunch with Yue Ning,

122
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,750
we'll be back.

123
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,380
We won't push ourselves too hard.

124
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:41,780
Yes.

125
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,980
You promise you won't get into a fight?

126
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,730
I promise.

127
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,610
If she wants to marry up, just let her.

128
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,770
Why do you even care?

129
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,659
We're sisters, after all.

130
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,390
I can't just watch her
bring trouble on herself.

131
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,700
What are you talking about?

132
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,490
Your dear Fifth Sister Qin Xiang.

133
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,520
She's

134
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,550
attached herself to the Bai family.

135
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,910
Last night, Xiang sneaked out.

136
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,200
This morning,

137
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,550
I found a jade butterfly
in her makeup box.

138
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,740
I suspect she went to see
Young Master Bai.

139
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,750
Are you sure that jade butterfly
was from Young Master Bai?

140
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,370
The jade is top quality,

141
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,340
not something just anyone can have.

142
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,830
Besides, Xiang's standards are high.

143
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,110
In this Herbal Garden,

144
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,980
aside from Young Master Bai and Lord Yan,

145
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,980
who else could she be interested in?

146
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,159
This time, I'm on Qin Shuang's side.

147
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,380
Wan,

148
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,870
do you think

149
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,180
Young Master Bai truly cares for Xiang?

150
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,120
Whether he truly cares for her or not,

151
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,680
with the Bai family's status,

152
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,560
Young Master Bai likely has

153
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,290
little say in his own marriage.

154
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,880
Meeting alone in private would only

155
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,320
damage Qin Xiang's reputation.

156
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,690
Then go talk to her.

157
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,970
You're the only one
she's slightly afraid of.

158
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,800
She'd never listen to me.

159
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,480
The Herbal Garden isn't safe right now.

160
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,170
Neither of you should wander around alone.

161
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,380
Once the killer is caught,

162
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,840
we'll leave immediately.

163
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,700
Until then,

164
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:02,680
just make sure she doesn't do

165
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,010
something foolish that ruins her future.

166
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,060
I suppose that's all we can do.

167
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,610
This spot is high ground.

168
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,960
Station two more guards here.

169
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,500
Yes.

170
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,570
Master,

171
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,430
Miss Qin isn't here. Let me help you.

172
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,070
No need.

173
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,360
My thighs are rubbed raw.

174
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,800
Don't tell me you're completely fine.

175
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,240
Oh?

176
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,200
Want me to check your injuries?

177
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,000
No, no, don't.

178
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,240
I'm fine now.

179
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,450
Sounds like it came from the pharmacy.

180
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,170
I'll go take a look.

181
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,700
Don't go yet—it could be dangerous.

182
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,360
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

183
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,720
Go back and keep an eye on Qin Xiang.

184
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,920
Don't leave the room.

185
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,050
Fuling, stay here.

186
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,200
If Senior comes looking for me,

187
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,840
tell him to get to the pharmacy
right away.

188
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,650
Got it. Be careful.

189
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,980
Wan is amazing.

190
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,430
Did you see the killer?

191
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,760
I was a step too late.

192
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,840
I heard the scream

193
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,080
and feared the killer might kill him,

194
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,430
so I called out
from a distance as a warning.

195
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,860
He used that chance and escaped.

196
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,150
Bai Feng's gone after him.

197
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,950
By the time I got here,
the killer was already gone.

198
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,410
The murderer...

199
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,160
The murderer...

200
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:52,340
Say no more.

201
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,890
Keep this in your mouth.

202
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,370
Don't wait anymore.

203
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,670
Don't wait anymore.

204
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,080
Don't wait for what?

205
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,410
He should be able to survive.

206
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,060
Butler Dong.

207
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,700
He just said "don't wait anymore."

208
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,100
Do you know what he meant?

209
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,330
Cheng was almost fully recovered.

210
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,480
He originally planned
to go home and get married in a few days.

211
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,940
He was probably telling his fiancée

212
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,030
not to wait for him anymore.

213
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,640
Don't be sad.

214
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,370
He just needs some time to recover.

215
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,300
He can get married a few days later.

216
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,170
Lady Wan,
thanks to your acupuncture skills,

217
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,440
Cheng was given a second chance at life.

218
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,670
Master.

219
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:46,690
I failed you.

220
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,680
He got away.

221
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,660
But the tracks show he went west.

222
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,830
If I were in my usual state,

223
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:51,890
that guy wouldn't have escaped.

224
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,750
West? That's the guest quarters,

225
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,290
where all the female guests are staying.

226
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,810
Xiang, don't be foolish.

227
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,170
The Bai family is a prestigious clan.

228
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,050
If they learn about Father's reputation,

229
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,580
they'll never let you marry into
their family.

230
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,070
Qin Wan is a jinx
who brought bad luck to her parents,

231
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,600
but she still won
the Grand Princess's favor.

232
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,330
And Lord Yan still holds her
in high regard.

233
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,940
We're both legitimate daughters
of the Qin family.

234
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,140
How am I different?

235
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,200
But...

236
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,670
You're a concubine's daughter.

237
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,870
Some things you just don't understand.

238
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,240
Fine, I'm a concubine's daughter.

239
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,420
I can't interfere
in legitimate daughters' affairs.

240
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,140
Help! Help!

241
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,850
Xiang has been kidnapped.

242
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,800
He said if Sun Haoyue doesn't meet him,

243
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,320
he'll kill her.

244
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,770
Mr. Dong, go get Senior. Quickly.

245
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,680
Okay. Let's go!

246
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,440
Sun Haoyue!

247
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,210
How many more people must die
because of you?

248
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:11,970
Sun Haoyue!

249
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,050
Do you dare face me?

250
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,250
I'll make you pay with your life!

251
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,120
My sister has nothing to do
with Sun Haoyue.

252
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,910
Let her go!

253
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,000
I don't care!

254
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,730
The killer is prepared to die.

255
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,060
Don't approach rashly.

256
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,860
I'll go calm him down first.

257
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,960
I'll go.

258
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,510
You all stay back

259
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:32,090
so he won't feel threatened
and harm Xiang.

260
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,130
Let me borrow this for a while.

261
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:36,860
Don't worry.

262
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,530
I'll be right beside you.

263
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,800
Don't come over!

264
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:41,730
If you come any closer,

265
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,690
I'll kill her!

266
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:43,930
Alright.

267
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:44,460
Alright.

268
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,150
Calm down.

269
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,920
Let me go with you.

270
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,040
I'm a woman.

271
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,330
He won't be on guard against me.

272
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,730
It's fine. I'll go alone.

273
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,540
Be careful.

274
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,390
Your Highness, I heard you've arrived

275
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,510
but haven't had a chance
to greet you properly.

276
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,310
I'll entrust my sister's safety

277
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,300
to you.

278
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,260
I'll protect my own people.

279
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,430
Sun Haoyue!

280
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,090
Sun Haoyue!

281
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,720
Come out now or I'll kill her!

282
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,440
Wan, save me!

283
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,920
Where's Sun Haoyue?

284
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:17,940
He's coming right away.

285
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,740
That's my sister you're holding.

286
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,440
Could you at least let her
sit down and rest?

287
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,470
No! Until Sun Haoyue stands
in front of me,

288
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,430
she's not taking a single step
away from me!

289
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,830
Judging by your clothes,

290
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,730
you look like an honest, hardworking man.

291
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,490
Why do you bear such hatred

292
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,590
toward Dr. Sun?

293
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,080
Dr. Sun my ass!

294
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,710
He killed my daughter

295
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,360
and destroyed my whole family.

296
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,090
I'll make him pay with his life!

297
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,260
For a parent to bury their child

298
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,770
is truly unbearable grief.

299
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,230
But medicine isn't magic.

300
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,800
Not every life can be saved.

301
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,320
If he had been able to save your daughter,

302
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,550
he would've done everything he could.

303
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,360
Shut up!

304
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,080
If it weren't for him,

305
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,880
my daughter wouldn't have died!

306
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,720
She was born unable to walk,

307
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,430
but she was my only kid.

308
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,510
My wife and I worked ourselves to the bone

309
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,150
just to get her treated.

310
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,400
She was fine when we

311
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,750
brought her here.

312
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,200
But by the time we saw her again,

313
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,590
she was already in a coffin.

314
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,890
Her mother drowned herself
when we got home.

315
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,680
To see my daughter one last time,

316
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,390
I dug up her grave and opened the coffin—

317
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,810
only to find her chest...

318
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,850
her chest...

319
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,010
had been cut open and stitched back up!

320
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,870
He killed her.

321
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,680
He killed my daughter!

322
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,680
Sun Haoyue!

323
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,270
Die!

324
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,790
You're talking nonsense!

325
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,810
Your daughter was taken around
to see quack doctors.

326
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,240
Her body was already ruined

327
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,570
and wouldn't last long.

328
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,580
Our Young Master

329
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,110
only kept her here for treatment

330
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,120
to stop her from suffering any further.

331
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,110
-Shut up!
-You...

332
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,300
Do you want her to die?

333
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,500
The one you hate is me.

334
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,410
You shouldn't have been so cruel to Song.

335
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,490
He was loyal to you,

336
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,670
just a dog you kept,

337
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,100
so he deserved to die!

338
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,320
Since I'm here now,

339
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,640
please let this young lady go.

340
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,610
-Young Master!
-I'll kill you!

341
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,450
Are you alright?

342
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,670
Young Master Bai,

343
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,360
you finally came.

344
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,950
Were you frightened today?

345
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:46,980
Here.

346
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,310
This is calming tea I brewed.

347
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,120
Thank you.

348
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,880
Thank you for saving Xiang today.

349
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,220
If you hadn't come to her rescue in time,

350
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,480
she might have been...

351
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,670
It was my fault your sister
got into danger.

352
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,520
If you keep thanking me,
I'll feel ashamed.

353
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,660
Young Master Bai,
since you're skilled in archery,

354
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,210
why didn't you avoid the vital spots

355
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,210
to spare his life?

356
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,710
I was reckless.

357
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,080
Seeing Xiang...

358
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,660
Seeing Lady Xiang bleeding,

359
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,150
I acted on impulse

360
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,510
without thinking.

361
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,510
I'm truly sorry.

362
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,550
I see.

363
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:32,640
Everyone,

364
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,390
about what the killer said—

365
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,280
Your Highness, if you have any doubts,

366
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,610
just ask Mr. Dong.

367
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,760
Your Highness,

368
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:40,950
Young Master Qin,

369
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,930
my wife can't be left alone.

370
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,710
I'll take my leave now.

371
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:47,410
Here.

372
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,270
Two people have died in a row.

373
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,000
He acts as if nothing happened.

374
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,210
Are all these reclusive masters
so cold-hearted?

375
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:56,810
You...

376
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,710
Who are you talking about?

377
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,030
No one, no one.

378
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,280
Your Highness,

379
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,030
now that the culprit has been killed,

380
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,490
we will set off back
to the capital tomorrow.

381
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,880
Young Master Qin,

382
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,990
the mountain roads are hard
to navigate in snowy weather.

383
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,420
Why not stay a few more days?

384
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,849
Let me organize the case files first,

385
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:18,849
then escort you back to the capital.

386
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,440
My fifth sister has suffered
quite a shock recently,

387
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,109
and most of our group are women.

388
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,440
I'm afraid I must decline your kind offer.

389
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:26,900
I'll take my leave now.

390
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,800
Only to find her chest

391
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,610
had been cut open and stitched back up!

392
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:40,740
I want to take a walk in the plum forest.

393
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,370
Xiang said that

394
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,280
at death's door,
she only thought of Young Master Bai.

395
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,330
Could she have truly fallen for him?

396
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:50,960
Exactly.

397
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:54,680
When a girl is saved by a man,
she often wishes to marry him.

398
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,330
Your Highness, how could you say that?

399
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,970
That's how it's written
in all the storybooks.

400
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,760
Besides, princesses are people too.

401
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,530
Isn't that right, Little Wan'er?

402
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,530
What did you say?

403
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,320
What's wrong with you?

404
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,620
You've been distracted since we got here.

405
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,350
Do you remember

406
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,350
where those beast carcasses were buried?

407
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,190
-Yes.
-No.

408
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:12,500
Take me there to have a look.

409
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,110
Let's go.

410
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,620
It's quite scary.

411
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,650
I don't dare look.

412
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,720
Right here.

413
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,510
There used to be many beast carcasses
piled up here.

414
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,970
They should have been
buried under the tree.

415
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,160
It's not fresh soil.

416
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,460
They weren't buried here.

417
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:48,890
Little Wan'er,

418
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,720
why must you find those beast carcasses?

419
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,720
I want to see how they actually died.

420
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,480
Go get me a hoe from the storage room.

421
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,050
Alright.

422
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,580
Seems like this is it.

423
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,800
We're going to leave early tomorrow.

424
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,730
If you don't pack now, it'll be too late.

425
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,930
My Lady, give it to me.

426
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,390
Xiang,

427
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,620
weren't you the most eager
to enter the capital?

428
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,470
Compared to the young men
from noble families in the capital,

429
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,880
Young Master Bai's family is ordinary.

430
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,320
Why do you hold on to him so much?

431
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,350
But no matter how good
others' family backgrounds are,

432
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,440
none of them

433
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,200
have Young Master Bai's feelings for me.

434
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,260
You've just survived a great ordeal,

435
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,710
so of course
you're deeply grateful to him.

436
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,300
But once you see the splendor
of the capital,

437
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,260
you won't think the same anymore.

438
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,530
So what?

439
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,750
In the eyes of those nobles,

440
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,250
I'm just a girl with a tarnished
family background.

441
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,790
Who would want to marry me
as a legitimate wife?

442
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,520
Someone like Young Master Bai,

443
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:27,560
with a noble family,
outstanding character,

444
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,220
and deep feelings for me—

445
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,540
I'll never meet another like him
in my life.

446
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,150
But will Young Master Bai's parents

447
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,060
agree to your marriage?

448
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,930
He said he won't marry anyone but me.

449
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,030
His parents will surely agree.

450
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,850
Lady Xiang, are you resting?

451
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,140
I request an audience.

452
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,710
Wanqing, go open the door.

453
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:59,050
Lady Xiang, Lady Shuang.

454
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,480
No need for formalities, Mr. Dong.

455
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,820
Young Master Bai is going to leave
for Yizhou early tomorrow morning.

456
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,080
I'm afraid he won't be able
to see you off.

457
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:06,820
He...

458
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,280
Why is he leaving?

459
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,750
Young Master Bai said

460
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,170
he has something important
to report to his elders at home

461
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,110
and can't delay.

462
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,960
This is a gift from Young Master Bai

463
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,910
to comfort you.

464
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,550
He wishes you all the best

465
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,350
and hopes your wishes come true.

466
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,020
Please thank Young Master Bai for me

467
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,310
and tell him not to worry.

468
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,510
I will definitely do so.

469
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,570
Goodness, they are far too valuable!

470
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,200
No, no.

471
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,600
Xiang, you should return them.

472
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,200
You accepted such an expensive gift

473
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,230
without a reason.

474
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,550
What if you can't explain it
in the future?

475
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:54,720
You don't understand.

476
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,240
This is no ordinary gift.

477
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,510
This is Young Master Bai's token
of marriage proposal to me.

478
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:02,040
He didn't mention anything
about a proposal.

479
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,200
He did!

480
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,460
Look at this ruby.

481
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,760
That deep red is reserved
for a legitimate wife.

482
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,320
And this mandarin duck pendant—

483
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,950
it's a token of love.

484
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,540
If it weren't for his marriage, why would

485
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,040
Young Master Bai rush home
to get his elders' approval?

486
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,930
That's just your guess.

487
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:21,160
Who would send a proposal token
through a servant

488
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,510
and leave the girl guessing
whether it's a proposal?

489
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,590
Young Master Bai's sister
is in poor health,

490
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,990
and Dr. Sun is busy.

491
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,550
So who else

492
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,130
could he have sent to deliver the token?

493
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:30,890
I think

494
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,920
you're just jealous of how deeply
Young Master Bai loves me.

495
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,350
Jealous of you?

496
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,760
Good heavens!

497
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,310
I can't talk sense into you.

498
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,590
Do whatever you want.

499
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,750
Wanqing,
I'm sleeping in your room tonight.

500
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,960
Come find me when you're done packing.

501
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,660
Okay.

502
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,410
I'm leaving at 5 a.m.

503
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,550
I hope you'll come with me.

504
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,570
My feelings for you will never change.

505
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:03,850
Will you say yes?

506
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:10,730
Master,

507
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,470
why do you think Qin Yan

508
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,020
is in such a hurry to leave?

509
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,420
I openly asked Lady Wan
to be my strategist.

510
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,080
He's probably in a hurry to go back

511
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,610
and report it to his father.

512
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,670
Could it be

513
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,920
he's trying to win over Lady Wan

514
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,720
so you'll help the Crown Prince?

515
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,180
Of everyone in the capital,

516
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,960
the only one not trying to win me over

517
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,820
is probably the Empress Dowager.

518
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,510
So with your return to the capital,

519
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,510
won't you be like fresh meat to wolves?

520
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,310
Everyone's dying to get a piece.

521
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,090
I don't have the energy
for their political games.

522
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:42,410
I'm fine being a loyal, solitary official.

523
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:44,440
Leave 50 Black Armor Guards with us.

524
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:47,360
Have the rest wait
at the villa outside the capital.

525
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:47,950
Yes.

526
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,400
Chi.

527
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,780
What happened?

528
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,220
Why do you look like this?

529
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,280
Your Highness, have you heard

530
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,400
about the rumors of monsters
in Sanyuan Village?

531
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,190
I have.

532
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,440
It's precisely because I heard

533
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,990
you were driven out
of the inn due to these rumors

534
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,120
that I came here to this Herbal Garden.

535
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,180
I have a theory,

536
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,050
but no solid evidence yet.

537
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,920
So I can't report it to the authorities

538
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,320
nor investigate openly.

539
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,720
Your Highness, could you make Cousin Yan

540
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,350
stay here for another day or two?

541
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,940
Once I find proof, I will report it
to the officials immediately.

542
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,240
That way the villagers won't suffer
from gossip,

543
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,350
nor be at risk.

544
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,540
Since you've asked,

545
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,170
how could I say no?

546
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,930
Thank you, Your Highness.

547
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:47,690
During this time,

548
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,210
keep your sleeve blade
with you at all times.

549
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:50,870
Here, let me help you put it on.

550
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,900
Let me do it.

551
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,590
Here.

552
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,120
Now, can you tell me

553
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,310
where your theory comes from?

554
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,410
Wild animal carcasses.

555
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,750
Except for the four ladies' carriages,

556
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,270
all the others are broken.

557
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,270
Why didn't you check them beforehand?

558
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,410
Young Master Yan, please forgive me.

559
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,210
I did check them last night.

560
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,300
Everything was fine then.

561
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,140
But this morning,

562
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,620
the axles were broken.

563
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,440
What are you waiting for then?

564
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,000
Fix them.

565
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,050
Yes, yes, of course.

566
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,250
Hurry up and fix them.

567
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,070
Alright.

568
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,100
Want to leave?

569
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,630
That depends on whether I agree.

570
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,160
It's empty.

571
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,250
We're not leaving today.

572
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,320
Why are you packing these empty boxes?

573
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,510
If we don't pack,

574
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,610
won't Cousin Yan realize

575
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:50,140
we knew we weren't leaving?

576
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,000
You, who seem honest and kind,

577
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:56,170
are the best liar.

578
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,580
Your Highness, Wan.

579
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,760
He's here.

580
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,580
Cousin Yan, are we loading now?

581
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:07,530
Not yet.

582
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,000
There are some problems
with the carriages.

583
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,460
We can't leave anytime soon.

584
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,310
How about this?

585
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,170
Have some rest with the Princess.

586
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,940
Thank you, Cousin Yan.

587
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,190
Wan! Wan!

588
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,180
Cousin Yan.

589
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,680
Xiang is missing.

590
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:21,880
Missing?

591
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,340
What happened?

592
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,520
I woke up this morning

593
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,970
and found her bed empty.

594
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,960
Then we looked for her belongings

595
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,070
and found her favorite

596
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,400
jewelry and clothes were gone.

597
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,830
Could she have been kidnapped?

598
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,340
The missing items are her favorites.

599
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,970
She must have taken them herself.

600
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,340
She took them herself?

601
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:41,810
Where could she have gone?

602
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:42,850
Xiang…

603
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,250
Xiang must have eloped
with Young Master Bai.

604
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,090
Don't move!

605
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,030
Be careful not to disturb the footprints.

606
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:19,360
Besides Mrs. Lin, there are no other maids
in the Herbal Garden.

607
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,690
And it's not yet time
to deliver breakfast.

608
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,620
These footprints must be Xiang's.

609
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,730
Wait here.

610
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,890
I'll go check it out.

611
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,000
Wanhe? Wanhe?

612
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:39,970
My Lady.

613
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,740
It is indeed a sleeping drug.

614
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:47,850
Don't go any further.

615
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,330
Be careful not to disturb the footprints.

616
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:52,440
How is it?

617
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,130
She's probably already left
the Herbal Garden.

618
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:55,960
Mr. Dong,

619
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,380
when did Young Master Bai
leave the Herbal Garden?

620
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,050
Last night,

621
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,820
Young Master Bai only told me to have

622
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,380
the food, water,
and a carriage ready by 7 a.m.

623
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,060
I don't know anything else.

624
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,810
Then they must have left not long ago.

625
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,240
I'll take some people
to chase them immediately.

626
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:07,980
Cousin Yan.

627
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:09,910
Xiang's footprints are already fading.

628
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,370
They were likely made before sunrise.

629
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,170
They must have left before 7 a.m.

630
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,680
This was planned long ago.

631
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,600
I'll take men to chase them toward Yizhou.

632
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,600
-I'll go with you.
-I'll go with you.

633
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:20,370
No.

634
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,010
What if going to Yizhou is a decoy?

635
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:24,070
How will you find the real direction?

636
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:25,200
Well...

637
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,620
Don't hesitate anymore.

638
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,310
If you keep delaying,

639
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,640
she'll get too far away.

640
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,960
Then I leave my Wan

641
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,620
in your care, Your Highness.

642
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,560
I'll prepare the carriages.

643
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,690
-Let's go.
-Come on.

644
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:37,340
Don't tell anyone else about this.

645
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:38,880
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

646
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,470
My Lady.

647
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,880
-It's cold. Take this to eat on the road.
-Okay. Let's go.

648
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,070
My Lady, what about me?

649
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:45,930
You and Senior take care of Lord Yan
and the General.

650
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:56,820
Cousin Yan,

651
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:59,140
Changfu Inn is the only way
out of the mountain.

652
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,140
Let's stop there!

653
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:00,840
Alright!

654
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,220
Stay right there!

655
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,480
Where are you going?

656
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:33,850
Let me tell you,

657
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,210
your leg injury still isn't healed.

658
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,050
And you've been investigating the case
with that injury these past few days.

659
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,790
Why don't you take a proper rest?

660
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:40,380
What?

661
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,050
You plan to stay
and spend New Year with me?

662
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,220
Sun,

663
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,550
where is Lady Wan?

664
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,010
What do you mean?

665
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,940
You don't trust my medical skills?

666
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,750
I meant no such thing.

667
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,190
Let me tell you,

668
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,280
last time it was an emergency situation,

669
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,960
so my junior disregarded propriety

670
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,980
and treated you.

671
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,040
Your Highness,

672
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,530
you should conduct yourself with decorum.

673
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:07,180
How can you take it for granted?

674
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,580
Sun, you misunderstood.

675
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:11,180
I just did a small favor for Lady Wan

676
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,970
and wanted to know
if things went as she wished.

677
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:14,030
That's why I asked.

678
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,200
That's good then.

679
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,490
Take off your clothes and get on the bed.

680
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,100
No need.

681
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:19,550
Sun,

682
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,550
it's just a surface wound,
nothing serious.

683
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,300
No need to trouble yourself.

684
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,830
Whether it's serious or not

685
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,480
is for me to decide.

686
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:27,130
Get on the bed.

687
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,130
[Changfu Inn]

688
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,680
Sir.

689
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,430
Who's there?

690
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,780
Greetings, Young Master Qin,

691
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,860
Miss Qin.

692
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,220
Alright, let me ask you,

693
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,950
have you seen a girl recently?

694
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,090
-She…
-Cousin Yan.

695
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,370
Have some snacks with Ning first.

696
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:46,920
Alright.

697
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,940
Your Highness.

698
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,550
The snow has just stopped.

699
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,880
Why didn't you wait for the roads
to clear before traveling?

700
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:00,160
Drink some hot water to warm up first.

701
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,830
Thank you, sir.

702
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,390
It's snowing heavily today.

703
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,740
How's business today?

704
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,320
There aren't many guests
even on normal days.

705
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,230
Now with the snow,

706
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,230
it's even quieter.

707
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:11,040
There's not a soul on the road.

708
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,130
Maybe

709
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:14,720
some people traveled through the night

710
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,170
and didn't stop at your inn?

711
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,210
To be honest,

712
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,830
since the incident at Sanyuan Village,

713
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,890
I've kept a mastiff to guard at night.

714
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,360
If anyone had passed by,

715
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,790
it would have barked nonstop.

716
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:26,400
But now it sleeps all day,

717
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:29,000
wasting food.

718
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,470
We've just been out
in the cold for a while.

719
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,130
Eat some to fill your stomach.

720
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:38,080
Miss Qin, how did you get Zhang family's
tea shortbread?

721
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,250
What Zhang family?

722
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:41,220
These are made by a maid
in the Herbal Garden.

723
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,300
That's impossible.

724
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,100
I saw Zhang family's mark
on these tea shortbread.

725
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:46,870
It couldn't be wrong.

726
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,160
What mark?

727
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,880
The leaf pattern

728
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,240
on the tea shortbread.

729
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:52,790
Only the Zhang family

730
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,720
can make the mark

731
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,480
look like a fresh leaf.

732
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,090
It's their family heirloom skill,

733
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:00,110
only passed down to daughters,
never daughters-in-law.

734
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:00,990
Others

735
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,030
can't make it.

736
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:06,160
Which Zhang family

737
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,340
do you mean?

738
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,380
The Zhang family at the east end
of Sanyuan Village.

739
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,680
They've grown tea for generations.

740
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,880
Everyone here knows.

741
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,330
Does the Zhang family
still have anyone left?

742
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,610
Their family line has died out.

743
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,160
Only a young girl was left.

744
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,580
But before she could marry a man
into the family to carry on its standing,

745
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,750
she was killed

746
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,610
by monsters a few months ago.

747
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,660
Now there are no descendants left.

748
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,690
Mrs. Lin's tea shortbread tastes

749
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,290
even better than locals'.

750
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,060
Many people in the tea garden
have died recently.

751
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,490
The young workers

752
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,040
mysteriously disappeared.

753
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,300
When their bodies were found,

754
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,880
their organs were all gone.

755
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,340
Cousin Yan, hurry,

756
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,150
send someone to get officers
to the Herbal Garden.

757
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,040
What happened?

758
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,440
No time to explain.

759
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,880
Ning, take me back to the Herbal Garden.

760
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,350
Okay.

761
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,670
What about Xiang?

762
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,220
You wait here,

763
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,920
in case they pass by later.

764
00:32:58,530 --> 00:32:59,310
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

765
00:32:59,310 --> 00:32:59,920
But...

766
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:07,060
Have I done anything to offend you?

767
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,160
No, don't be ridiculous.

768
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,680
Then why do you seem

769
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,490
so displeased with me?

770
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:18,960
Fine.

771
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:22,650
Let me ask you,

772
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,870
what exactly are your intentions
toward my junior?

773
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:26,940
What do you mean?

774
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,700
You knew a coroner was a lowly profession,

775
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,410
yet you claimed she was your strategist

776
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:32,320
and let her openly examine corpses.

777
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,750
If this gets out,

778
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:34,980
how will she be able
to hold her head up in society?

779
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,460
How will she be able to

780
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:38,470
practice her excellent medical skills?

781
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,470
You're clearly ruining her future.

782
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,650
Sir, do you know

783
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,020
Lady Wan already had a reputation
as the "medical fairy" in Jingzhou?

784
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,880
Then why did she become a coroner?

785
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:52,920
I know.

786
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:55,090
My junior once said that whether

787
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:58,760
practicing medicine or working as a coroner,
she can make an impact everywhere.

788
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,220
Whether dealing with the dead
or the living,

789
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,080
she can achieve great things.

790
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,830
But back then,
she was helping you secretly,

791
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,830
so her reputation remained intact.

792
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:09,030
But she's not one to care for empty fame.

793
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,110
But the world does!

794
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:11,790
She's a woman

795
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,469
burdened with deep hatred...

796
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,300
With extraordinary talent.

797
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,610
Without a good reputation,

798
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,409
what should she do in the future?

799
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,870
The Medicine King Valley
has a century-old legacy,

800
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:24,620
yet only Lady Wan takes it upon herself

801
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,420
to seek justice for the wronged.

802
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,020
How could we let worldly gossip

803
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,270
bury such a gem?

804
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,830
Women in this world have it hard enough.

805
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:34,070
That's why we must treat her
as a national treasure.

806
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:36,340
Your Highness, how long can you
protect her?

807
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,340
What I want is that

808
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,110
one day

809
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,080
she won't need my protection

810
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:42,520
to do as she pleases

811
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:45,440
and earn the world's respect.

812
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:56,600
Earn the world's respect?

813
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:05,490
I hope you remember what you said today,

814
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,480
so my junior's help won't be in vain.

815
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,910
Have you changed your bandages,
Your Highness?

816
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:20,420
Come in.

817
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:23,760
Fuling!

818
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,320
Be careful.

819
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:24,960
Fuling, help me.

820
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,760
Why has your wound gotten worse?

821
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,520
Take off your clothes so I can
take a look. Come on.

822
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,070
Let me see.

823
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:30,590
No, don't.

824
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,310
-Take it...
-Don't.

825
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:33,130
I'm fine. Really.

826
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,510
Don't worry. Look.

827
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,490
You lied to me?

828
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,390
How could I lie to you?

829
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,830
Besides, I'm really injured.

830
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:43,940
My Master is here.

831
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:46,300
I should grit my teeth
and endure the pain.

832
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:48,490
Master.

833
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,840
I have something important to report.

834
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,820
Word came from the foot of the mountain,

835
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,670
saying that Lady Wan,

836
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,020
Young Master Qin, and the Princess

837
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,150
went to Changfu Inn.

838
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,160
Why did my junior go there?

839
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,520
She said not to tell anyone.

840
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:01,580
-Including me?
-Including me?

841
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,250
Lady Xiang and Young Master Bai ran off.

842
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,430
My lady went down the mountain
to chase them.

843
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,560
When did they leave?

844
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,340
She said it was before 5 a.m.

845
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:14,220
Bai Feng,

846
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,480
order the Black Armor Guards
to search the mountain

847
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,880
for Lady Xiang immediately.

848
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,240
Yes.

849
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,680
Is there anything wrong?

850
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,360
The scouts didn't report anyone
leaving the mountain earlier.

851
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,160
So Lady Xiang must still
be near the Herbal Garden.

852
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,580
Let's split up!

853
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:50,120
Yes!

854
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:57,960
My Lady!

855
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,280
My Lady, you're finally back.

856
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,760
Fuling, where's Lord Yan?

857
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:02,970
His Highness said

858
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,150
the scouts at the foot of the mountain
saw no one going down the mountain.

859
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,630
Lady Xiang must be nearby.

860
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,800
He and Bai Feng went to find her.

861
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,950
Wait for him here.

862
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:09,760
If he returns,

863
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,300
tell him to come straight
to Renxin Clinic.

864
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,810
Have the Black Armor Guards
block all exits.

865
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:14,510
No one is allowed to leave
the Herbal Garden.

866
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,070
Alright.

867
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,520
Let's go.

868
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,130
Where are you going?

869
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,280
I dug up the animal carcass last night.

870
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,860
The killer must have noticed.

871
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,960
I'll go calm him down first.

872
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,360
I'll go with you. Come on.

873
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,900
You can't get involved in a murder case.

874
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,120
If what you said is true

875
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,550
and the killer is ruthless,

876
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,630
what if he wants to kill you?

877
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,360
How will you protect yourself?

878
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,740
I have my ways.

879
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:38,070
Little Wan'er.

880
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:39,300
we're like sisters.

881
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,280
We should value loyalty above life.

882
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:41,810
Let's go.

883
00:37:58,810 --> 00:37:59,940
Were you calling me?

884
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,690
Who are you? Why are you here?

885
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:17,250
[Bai Feijue]

886
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,720
You are Bai Feijue?

887
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,780
If you are Bai Feijue,

888
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,780
then who's that Bai Feijue outside?

889
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,620
You mean,

890
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,850
like Mrs. Lin,

891
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,020
he's a patient with a replaced heart?

892
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,120
Tell me,

893
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,930
does your sister
also have a heart condition?

894
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,030
To avoid alerting the enemy,

895
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,240
I can't save you now.

896
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,600
If you really are Bai Feijue,

897
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,770
he won't kill you.

898
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,780
Once the officials arrive,

899
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,440
I will definitely get you out.

900
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,640
Little Wan'er,

901
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,400
if he really is Bai Feijue,

902
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,400
then the person who eloped
with Qin Xiang...

903
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,790
Qin Xiang must be in grave danger.

904
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:12,420
Let's go!

905
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:12,980
Let's go!

906
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,710
Senior, here's the thing.

907
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,270
Lady Xiang

908
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:28,110
is our junior's cousin.

909
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,430
If Young Master Bai truly cares for her,

910
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,960
why didn't he go to the capital

911
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,230
to formally propose?

912
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,830
Running away with her

913
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,290
is basically eloping.

914
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,030
In the future, what if...

915
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,440
How is our junior supposed to handle this?

916
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:44,330
Have some tea.

917
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:51,440
Junior, your temper's been flaring lately.

918
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,440
This special calming incense I made

919
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,290
is just right for your symptoms.

920
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,800
Senior.

921
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,800
You care so much about our Junior.

922
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,690
About this matter,

923
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,310
I won't make things difficult for you.

924
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,780
[Benevolent Heart]

925
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,120
Swallow this pill.

926
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:35,090
Keep this one under your tongue.

927
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,370
What are these for?

928
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:39,810
One is for detoxification,

929
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:41,490
and the other is an antidote
to sedative.

930
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:42,110
Remember,

931
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:44,660
don't eat or touch anything
once we're inside.

932
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,770
I'll handle everything.

933
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:46,980
Okay. You do the talking,

934
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,380
and I'll do the fighting.

935
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,710
Senior.

936
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,960
Junior, you're here too.

937
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,880
Has your sister been found?

938
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,330
Not yet.

939
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,050
Cousin Yan worried we'd be tired,

940
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,380
so he sent us back first.

941
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,970
Senior Muqing, you're here too?

942
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,570
Yes.

943
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,250
This tea is grown in the garden.

944
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,700
Your Highness, Junior, try some.

945
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:21,010
Thank you.

946
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:28,500
Senior Brother,
I've been here for so long.

947
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,100
Why aren't you talking to me?

948
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,260
Senior?

949
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,020
Quick,

950
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,120
hold your breath.

951
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:08,200
You actually prepared
the antidote in advance.

952
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,110
Junior, you're truly vigilant.

953
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,600
Too bad you lack experience

954
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,480
and have limited knowledge.

955
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,270
Do you feel

956
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:18,030
dizzy,

957
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,400
numb in your face,

958
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,340
and unable to feel your limbs?

959
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,470
It's anesthesia...

960
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,190
Anas...

961
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:26,700
You guessed it was anesthesia.

962
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,960
No wonder Master favors you the most

963
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,830
and only taught you
the golden needle technique.

964
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:34,430
This incense,

965
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:36,170
called Yunmeng Incense,

966
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:38,820
was carefully formulated
for treating external injuries.

967
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:39,780
Its rich aroma

968
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,120
enters the brain
through the nose and mouth,

969
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,180
acting much faster

970
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,280
than mafeisan powder.

971
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:48,030
It's a pity

972
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:51,380
that you're obsessed
with those wild animal carcasses.

973
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:54,020
Otherwise, the three of us

974
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:57,180
could often practice medicine together.

975
00:42:58,270 --> 00:42:59,930
How delightful that would be.

976
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:10,790
Young Master.

977
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:15,210
Junior,

978
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,430
you shouldn't have come here.
