00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,710
Mr. Qin Liang, I'm entrusting
my daughter to you.

2
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:24,800
-Go!
-Minister Shen, don't worry!

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,460
Hurry, run!

4
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,320
Must capture Shen Yi's whole family!

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,530
Run! Just go!

-Father! Mother!
-Run!

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,240
Mother!

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,890
Don't be afraid.

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,320
Father!

10
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,860
Don't let any of them get away!

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,000
Mr. Qin Liang!

12
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,840
My daughter, Wan,

13
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,840
upon reading this letter,

14
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,400
give up seeking justice

15
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,000
and revenge.

16
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,570
Never return to the capital.

17
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:39,960
Father,

18
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,460
what kind of injustice

19
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:43,950
could be so severe as to get Mr. Qin Liang

20
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,610
and our entire family killed?

21
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,120
There's no way I'm not

22
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,840
avenging your deaths.

23
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:51,270
From today on,

24
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,090
I am no longer Shen Wan,

25
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,800
but Qin Wan, daughter of Mr. Qin Liang.

26
00:01:56,289 --> 00:01:58,150
I will try to get to the bottom of it

27
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,260
and seek justice for you all.

[Coroner's Diary]

29
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:25,270
[Episode 1]

30
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,970
Mrs. Huo, what do you mean by this?

31
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,630
Madam Qin,

32
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,470
it was a reckless promise we made

33
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,680
with your second son's wife

34
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,860
when we were young

35
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,260
[Madam Qin]

36
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,000
to make our children betrothed.

37
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,700
Madam, could you please help us

38
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,700
[Mrs. Huo]

39
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,220
cancel this engagement?

40
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,300
You're really putting me in the spot.

41
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,570
Although our Qin family hasn't
split into smaller households,

42
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,079
as their stepmother,

43
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:21,250
how can I interfere in
the second branch's domestic affairs?

44
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,250
That makes sense.

45
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,360
Mrs. Huo, as you know,

46
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,600
Qin Liang is not my biological son.

47
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,860
He hasn't been home for years.

48
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,700
His daughter's marriage

49
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,950
is not something I can decide.

50
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,140
But his wife passed away young.

51
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,320
Their daughter has been raised
in Medicine King Valley

52
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,280
without parental guidance.

53
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,870
It's been over a decade,

54
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,000
and we don't know
her temperament or character.

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,730
Mes. Huo, please rest assured.

56
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,470
When Qin Liang returns,

57
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,070
I will discuss the matter of canceling
the engagement with him.

58
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,920
Our Marquis of Devotion and his family

59
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,700
won't let a childhood joke

60
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,700
ruin the future of our younger generation.

61
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,570
Well...

62
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,210
Grandma, there's something
I need to tell you.

63
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,770
She's back? Why?

64
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,990
Greetings, Grandma.
I'm Qin Wan, your granddaughter.

65
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,850
Greetings, Madam. I'm Fu Ling.

66
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:31,920
Mother,

67
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,270
Fu Ling is the maidservant
who attends to Wan.

[Third Master Qin's Wife, Lin]

69
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,920
I saw her when the second branch
sent New Year's gifts last year.

70
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,190
Raise your head.

71
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,450
Are you really Qin Wan?

72
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,700
Grandma, I'm Wan.

73
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,860
This is Father's seal.

74
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,300
Please take a look, Grandma.

75
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,110

76
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,010
Of all times to return, you...

77
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,500
Granddaughter encountered
a shipwreck on her way home.

78
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,940
Father saved me at the cost of his life.

79
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,740
Were it not for Father's sacrifice,

80
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,400
I wouldn't have made it here
to see you, Grandma.

81
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,610
This young lady has suffered so much.

82
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,370
Indeed.

83
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,390
Grandma, this is

84
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,890
indeed Uncle Qin Liang's personal seal.

85
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,160
It's only been a few years since he left.

86
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,040
How could he be gone?

87
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,250
Oh, my poor son!

88
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,350
Madam,

89
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,270
since you have
a family affair to handle,

90
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,740
we'll leave you to it.

91
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,740
Let me return
this jade pendant to its owner.

92
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,330
I'll take my leave.

93
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,130
Well...

94
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,080
Quickly, give this jade pendant
back to them.

95
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,920
This engagement cannot be called off.

96
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,750
Hurry!

97
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,520
Oh, my poor son!

98
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,600
How could they break off the engagement
in public like this?

99
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,659
How disrespectful to our Qin family!

100
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,640
My Lady! My Lady!

101
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,550
Madam, Her Ladyship fainted!

102
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,990
Please go get a physician!

103
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,080
My Lady! My Lady!

104
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,250
My Lady, you freaked me out!

105
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,060
I thought you really fainted.

106
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,360
How could we end that dilemma
if I didn't fake passing out?

107
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,680
What took you so long?

108
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,120
The moment you fainted,

109
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,310
I was soon taken
to face Madam Qin's interrogation.

110
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,390
What did they ask?

111
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,560
Just everything

112
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,920
we rehearsed before.

113
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,900
"Madam,

114
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,310
the physician
from Medicine King Valley said

115
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,340
Her Ladyship had fully recovered.

116
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,310
So Master Qin Liang took Her Ladyship
back home for ancestral worship.

117
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,040
But on the way, we encountered a storm.

118
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,270
The boat capsized.

119
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,390
To save Her Ladyship, Master Qin Liang

120
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,110
was swept away by a wave.

121
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,240
When Her Ladyship came around,

122
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,670
Master Qin Liang was already gone.

123
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,170
Her Ladyship had no choice

124
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,190
but to ask someone to help bury
Master Qin Liang properly on the spot.

125
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,670
We made it back, starving and exhausted."

126
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,130
Fortunately, Master Qin Liang
wasn't close to them.

127
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,170
And they haven't seen
his daughter for years.

128
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,500
Or we just couldn't convince them easily.

129
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,600
Good.

130
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,820
Now tell me

131
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,470
about that engagement.

132
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:32,150
Our master's wife arranged it
with the Huos before she passed away.

133
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,030
Back then,

134
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,150
Lord Huo was just
a minor county magistrate.

135
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,010
They definitely wanted
to use this childhood betrothal

136
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,030
to build ties with the Qin family's
first branch and the Marquis of Devotion.

137
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:40,789
Later, Master Qin Liang

138
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,840
took Miss Qin
to Medicine King Valley for treatment.

139
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,909
After she passed away last year,

140
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,360
Master Qin Liang was in great agony

141
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,160
and didn't inform the Qin family.

142
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,360
Now that Lord Huo
has been promoted to prefect,

143
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,760
they surely see this engagement
not good enough for them anymore.

144
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,760
What a bunch of treacherous gits.

145
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,270
This is actually better.

146
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,510
Without this engagement,

147
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,720
we can plan better in the future.

148
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,960
But the engagement called off in public

149
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,360
has disgraced the Qin family.

150
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,390
Madam Qin won't dare
to offend Prefect Huo.

151
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,120
She'll surely take it out on me.

152
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,960
You need to be cautious too.

153
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,150
Don't worry, My Lady.

154
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,840
I was sold to the Qin family
when I was young.

155
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,970
I'm experienced in dealing with them.

156
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,450
Once the remote corner,

157
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,550
now the Buddhist pure land.

158
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,420
Master Pu'an is here.

159
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,720
May all taboos stay away.

160
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,100
Once the remote corner,

161
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,060
now the Buddhist pure land.

162
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,940
Master Pu'an is here...

163
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,760
Looks like Madam Qin thinks
I'm some kind of jinx.

164
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,910
They're holding an exorcism ritual here.

165
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,550
What...

166
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,000
How could she do this?

167
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,600
They're bullying you!

168
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,720
What are you doing?

169
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,760
Madam Qin's order—

170
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,340
Fu Ling has privately
badmouthed the master

171
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,150
and must be sold
and sent away immediately.

172
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,740
Fu Ling is my servant.
I will discipline her.

173
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,610
Leave her alone.

174
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,470
You've only been back in the mansion
for a few hours.

175
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,870
And now you already dare
to refute my order?

176
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,750
Do you have any respect for your elders?

177
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,370
Please forgive

178
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,650
my rudeness, Grandma.

179
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,730
Fu Ling accompanied me
on the long journey home.

180
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,380
I'm grateful to her
for not leaving me behind.

181
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,720
Considering her youth
and ignorance, please

182
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,520
forgive her this once, Grandma.

183
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,120
It's my fault.

184
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,440
I dare not speak out of turn again.

185
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,770
Please spare me, Madam.

186
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,560
Madam,

187
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,050
the ritual has just begun.

188
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,790
Punishing them now would be inauspicious.

189
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,800
Why don't we leave it for later?

190
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,150
Fine.

191
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,070
Given your merit
in protecting your mistress,

192
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,020
I'll spare you this time.

193
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,300
But Wan,

194
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,760
you've been lax
in disciplining your servants.

195
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,790
From today on, you shall
copy scriptures in this courtyard

196
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,340
to pray for your parents

197
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,380
with your monthly allowance
cut for a year.

198
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,380
Only when you learn to be a filial child

199
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,610
can you come out and show your face.

200
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,910
Thank you for showing mercy, Grandma.

201
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,720
It's all my fault.

202
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,830
It's alright. This isn't your fault.

203
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,760
With an intention to punish me,

204
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,920
Madam Qin can easily find ways to do so.

205
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,550
Fu Ling.

206
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,750
Miss Qin was my best friend
in Medicine King Valley.

207
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,150
I, like her, see you as a friend

208
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,440
rather than a servant.

209
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,550
So you don't need to be
a meek servant in front of me.

210
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,150
My Lady...

211
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,610
But

212
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,170
without a monthly allowance,

213
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,630
how are we supposed
to get through this year?

214
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:37,930
Don't worry.

215
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,000
Even if it's just for

216
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,730
her kind and benevolent image,

217
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,300
Madam Qin won't starve us.

218
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,160
Uncle Qin Liang,

219
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,250
you and my parents

220
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,170
all told me not to seek revenge.

221
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,300
But I won't find peace in the world

222
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,640
until the culprit who murdered you
is brought to justice.

223
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,970
Uncle Qin Liang, please

224
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,490
forgive me for using your daughter's name

225
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,150
to carry out dangerous deeds.

226
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,420
Master, please rest assured.

227
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,930
I will definitely follow your words

228
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,650
and take good care of Her Ladyship,

229
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:24,710
never leaving her.

230
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,720
Your elder brother,
the Marquis of Devotion,

231
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,140
[Third Master Qin, Qin An]

232
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,120
is now highly valued

233
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,280
by the Crown Prince in the capital.

234
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,840
Keep in touch with him regularly

235
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,730
and try to secure
an official position for Chen as well.

236
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,580
[Young Master Qin, Qin Chen]

237
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,690
Don't just mess around
in the back courtyard all day.

238
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,560
My elder brother has no time
to pay attention to me.

239
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,160
Although we have the same father,

240
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,640
he's the eldest legitimate son
of Father's first wife,

241
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,400
while I was born to Father's second wife.

242
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,000
We're from different wombs.

243
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,680
Mother!

244
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,910
So what?

245
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,330
Eight taels of silver!

246
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,390
He still has to call me Mother!

247
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,930
This old mansion

248
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,610
still relies on you
to uphold its reputation.

249
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,290
Stop bringing about
"second wife" all the time.

250
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,800
Do you want everyone to know that you
were raised by your father's second wife?

251
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,400
Even your son is grown up now.

252
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,790
Why are you still such a failure?

253
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,250
Father, please don't upset Grandma.

254
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,920
Just listen to her.

255
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:35,950
Go away.

256
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,310
Madam, Miss Qin Wan is here to greet you.

257
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,590
I won't see her.

258
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,600
Madam, today is the day
of the Second Master's funeral.

259
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,080
Miss Qin Wan went to pray
early this morning

260
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,050
and just returned.

261
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,510
Maybe you should let her in

262
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,580
in case those outsiders

263
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,660
say that you're always biased
toward the Third Master.

264
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,830
What a nuisance.

265
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,190
Let her wait!

266
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,440
My Lady,

267
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,360
the Madam is talking
with the Third Master.

268
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,560
Please wait a moment.

269
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,600
I see. Thank you, Miss Caihe.

270
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:21,240
Prince Jin committed suicide
in the imperial due to his crime.

271
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,340
Didn't they say that
no concrete evidence was found

272
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,070
to prove he killed Consort Jin?

273
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,420
How did he end up committing suicide?

274
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,750
It must be the manipulation

275
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,870
of that Minister S-Shen

276
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,530
of the Supreme Court, Shen Yi.

277
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,990
Mother, I heard that

278
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,040
-My Lady.
-the murder weapon used by Prince Jin

279
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,710
was also hidden by him.

280
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,600
Were it not for his student, Li Muyun,

281
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,940
who reported it to the court,

282
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,890
this case

283
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,520
would have been covered up

284
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,250
by him and Prince Jin together.

285
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,890
Minister Shen

286
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,030
was known as "Shen the Upright,"

287
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,840
a squeaky- clean official,
and an expert in criminal law.

288
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,370
How could he help Prince Jin

289
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,350
do such a corrupt and shady thing?

290
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,150
Was he out of his mind?

291
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,740
You know nothing about the officialdom.

292
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,550
If Shen Yi were truly an upright official,

293
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,410
why would he flee with his family?

294
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,560
I heard that His Majesty

295
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,220
was so irritated
at his fleeing to escape punishment

296
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,560
that His Majesty ordered...

297
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,020
O-Ordered his entire family
to be executed.

298
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,320
But fleeing away didn't help.

299
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,120
It's said that
they encountered a terrible storm

300
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,650
and the entire family died.

301
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,370
"Shen the Upright"? Ridiculous.

302
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,120
Who knows how many shady deals

303
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,580
he made behind the scenes.

304
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,270
This is karma.

305
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,700
He deserved to die.

306
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,440
There's no such thing
as a truly upright official in this world.

307
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,080
Shen Yi merely used his official position

308
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,670
to do some things
to please the common people

309
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,490
and build up his own reputation.

310
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,660
In the end,
he was nothing but a fame-seeker.

311
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,610
Mother, you're absolutely right.

312
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:59,210
My father would never
collude with Prince Jin.

313
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,560
Who framed him?

314
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,370
Was it Li Muyun

315
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,830
or...

316
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,640
Why did His Majesty
believe those rumors so easily?

317
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,570
Why did Prince Jin commit suicide?

318
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,950
Why?

319
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,960
I'm sorry.

320
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,430
No.

321
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,290
I must go to the capital.

322
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,660
I must go to the capital immediately.

323
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,760
Madam, are you tired?

324
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,410
I'll have someone
send us back to the mansion.

325
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,800
I can seldom be this free and at ease.

326
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,970
If the Marquis finds out about this,

327
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,410
I won't be able to sneak out again
in the future.

328
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,400
Back in the day,

329
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:36,600
I accompanied the Old Marquis
on the military campaigns...

330
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,220
Madam! Madam!

331
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,550
What's wrong, Madam?

332
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,040
Madam, wake up!

333
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,360
Young lady,

334
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,120
could you fetch us a physician?

335
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,840
Madam!

336
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,870
Miss, you'd better

337
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,360
send someone to inform
your family of this.

338
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,440
Madam!

339
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,790
No way.

340
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,890
My madam was fine just a moment ago.

341
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,790
Please go get a physician for us.

342
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,080
Madam.

343
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,440
Lay the madam down flat.

344
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,550
Hurry.

345
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,390
Your madam has
an old ailment of wind evil.

346
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,210
Her symptoms worsened six months ago.

347
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,650
Just now, her body
became rigid and unresponsive,

348
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,770
her tongue stiff, throat obstructed,
pulse sluggish, and qi stagnant.

349
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,579
It's a case of wind hysteria
due to wind evil entering the liver.

350
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:13,640
Yes, you're right.

351
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:16,200
Remember my technique.

352
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,760
Bring me paper and an ink brush.

353
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,920
Continue massaging.

354
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,470
Based on my prescription,

355
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,150
decoct and feed the medicine
to her within two hours.

356
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,030
Keep massaging according to my technique.

357
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,300
Acupuncture would work best for her

358
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,890
if there's someone skilled in it.

359
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,440
If she can break into
a heavy sweat before nightfall,

360
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,040
she'll get over this crisis.

361
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:46,920
If not,

362
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:50,360
you gotta prepare for her funeral
within seven days.

363
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,820
Thank you.

364
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,750
My Lady, where have you been?

365
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,400
I told Caihe that

366
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,350
you lost your purse
and went to look for it.

367
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,960
You didn't go
greet Madam Qin this morning.

368
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,820
She was furious

369
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,400
and confined you to quarters again.

370
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,200
Fu Ling,

371
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,640
I am Shen Wan,

372
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:23,580
not Qin Wan.

373
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,920
My Lady, you mustn't say
such things recklessly again.

374
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,580
My father neither
colluded with Prince Jin

375
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,240
nor did he flee out of fear of punishment.

376
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,800
He and my mother were set up
and killed by someone.

377
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,100
I saw it with my own eyes.

378
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,030
I also know that

379
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,240
Lord Shen

380
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,870
is an absolutely upright
and good official.

381
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,240
All those who have
slandered and framed him

382
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,830
will be hit hard by karma.

383
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,420
I want to go to the capital

384
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,590
to find my parents' bodies

385
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,980
and clear their names
of false accusations.

386
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,140
Okay, I'm going to beg Madam Qin

387
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,690
to let us go to the capital.

388
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,500
She won't let us leave.

389
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,590
I'll figure out a way myself.

390
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,310
But I can't take you to the capital.

391
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,310
The case of my father and Prince Jin

392
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,890
concerns His Majesty's will.

393
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,020
It's more treacherous than I thought.

394
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,000
It's safer for you to stay here.

395
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,960
Wan, the first day I got
to the Medicine King Valley,

396
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,890
you taught me
how to take care of Miss Qin step by step.

397
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,620
After Miss Qin passed away,

398
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,570
you kept me by your side.

399
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,240
I know I'm not much help

400
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,860
when it comes to big things,

401
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,110
but I can keep you company

402
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,500
and take care of you!

403
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,110
And I swore
before the Second Master's grave that

404
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,150
I would never leave you in this lifetime.

405
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,750
If you don't take me with you,

406
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,160
I'll go on my own

407
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,900
to find you in the capital!

408
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,670
Get up.

409
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,610
Didn't we say no more tears?

410
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,440
I promise you.

411
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,230
We will never be apart

412
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,690
in this lifetime.

413
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,930
Grandma, these fabrics are nice,

414
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:30,080
but they still can't compare
to that gold-speckled red gauze

415
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,480
[Fifth Lady, Qin Xiang]

416
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,880
from your storeroom.

417
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,360
You've got quite the eye.

418
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,760
That was a gift from the Emperor

419
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,440
to the Marquis of Devotion
and our third branch of the Qin family.

420
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,500
There were only three bolts in total.

421
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,960
How could you possibly get
to use one of them?

422
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,710
Grandma, the Marquis of Anyang's Mansion

423
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:53,160
is the most prestigious family
in all of Jingzhou.

424
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,560
It's a rare honor that we were
even invited to this wedding.

425
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,160
If I dress well,

426
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,290
won't it reflect glory

427
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,850
on the Qin family as a whole?

428
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,960
Oh, I see your little plan.

429
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,070
Fine.

430
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:09,310
Have your mother sew two
beautiful dresses.

431
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,440
You'd better wear them properly.

432
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,830
Don't go ruining them.

433
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,640
If you can catch the eye

434
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,830
of Grand Princess,

435
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,430
a good marriage

436
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,920
will naturally come knocking.

437
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,820
Xiang, what are you waiting for?
Thank Grandma.

438
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,960
Thank you, Grandma.

439
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,050
Grandma, you treat me the best!

440
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,600
-I know you.
-Madam.

441
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,470
Princess Yongning
of the Marquis of Anyang's Mansion
has come to vist.

442
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,800
Quickly, invite her in!

443
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,370
[Princess Yongning, Yue Ning]

444
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,840
Greetings, Princess Yongning.

445
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,780
Please rise, Madam.

446
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,450
There's no need for formalities.

447
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:00,570
Please have a seat, Madam.

448
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:01,900
Please, Your Ladyship.

449
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,560
Your Ladyship, may I ask what brings

450
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,620
you to our humble home today?

451
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:26,970
Lvxiu.

452
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,810
I'm here on behalf of Grand Princess

453
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:36,070
to express gratitude for
Miss Qin's lifesaving kindness.

454
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,610
You mean Wan?

455
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,510
-Let me help you.
-No need.

456
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,530
Let me do it myself.

457
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,330
Give me one.

458
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,280
Miss Qin!

459
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:46,380
Miss Qin!

460
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:47,410
Hurry up!

461
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,920
Change your robes and go to the main hall!

462
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,790
The Princess Yongning from
Marquis of Anyang's Mansion

463
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,590
has come to thank you in
person for saving her life!

464
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,160
Princess Yongning?

465
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,450
I haven't saved any princess.

466
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,590
Did you aid an elderly madam

467
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,850
on the street days ago?

468
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,310
That elderly madam

469
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,950
was none other than the Grand Princess,

470
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,750
the matriarch of the
Marquis of Anyang's Mansion!

471
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,590
Princess Yongning is Grand Princess' own
granddaughter,

472
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,720
She's come in person to
convey her grandma's gratitude.

473
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,430
You two, stop what you're doing.

474
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,100
Come help Miss Qin with these buckets!

475
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,930
-Yes.
-Hurry.

476
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,310
Please go ahead, Miss Caihe.

477
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,180
I'll be there shortly.

478
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:22,820
Yes.

479
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,350
My Lady,

480
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,310
the person you saved is the
Grand Princess—

481
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,070
His Majesty's own aunt!

482
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,480
I only thought she looked wealthy.

483
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:36,790
I had no idea

484
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,420
her status was so exalted.

485
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,450
Well then, this means

486
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,710
we might finally return to the
capital soon.

487
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,710
Then hurry and change your clothes!

488
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:47,520
No, I won't.

489
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,650
I'll go dressed just like this.

490
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,390
I want Princess Yongning to see exactly

491
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:53,740
how I've been living

492
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,330
in the Qin family.

493
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,800
Greetings, Grandma.

494
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,130
She dresses so plainly.

495
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,990
What a disgrace to the Qin family.

496
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,400
Wan, why are you so late?

497
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,830
Hurry and pay your respects
to Princess Yongning.

498
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,730
No need for formalities.

499
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,690
Miss Qin, do you remember her?

500
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,270
It's you?

501
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,470
How is your family's madam?

502
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,400
Thanks to your timely treatment,

503
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,010
Grand Princess is feeling much better.

504
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,740
I've come on her behalf to
express our gratitude.

505
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,090
What does she know about medicine?

506
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,070
It was pure luck, nothing more.

507
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:54,170
Wan,

508
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,440
you never mentioned

509
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,520
what happened that day after you returned.

510
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,330
See?

511
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,150
Miss Lvxiu has been looking
all over for you.

512
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:07,030
As long as the right person
was found, it's fine.

513
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,690
Miss Qin, come with me.

514
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,400
My grandma is still waiting
for your follow-up consultation.

515
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,700
Since the Princess has come
to invite you personally,

516
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:22,100
you must serve the Grand Princess well.

517
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,850
Don't be reckless and cause trouble.

518
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,220
Your Ladyship,

519
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,960
may I also go and pay my
respects to the Grand Princess?

520
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,140
What are you going there for?

521
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,570
My grandma doesn't even know you.

522
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,250
I...

523
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,610
Miss Qin, please.

524
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:55,920
Mother.

525
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,370
Alright, alright.

526
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,310
Your Ladyship, what are you looking at?

527
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,310
You're so young.

528
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,510
I've never seen such a
youthful divine physician.

529
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:19,050
Skill in medicine lies in talent
and experience,

530
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,440
not age.

531
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:21,920
Moreover,

532
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,040
I grew up in Medicine King Valley,

533
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,370
and trained in both medicine
and alchemy from childhood.

534
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,850
Naturally, my understanding
is a little different.

535
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:27,810
So

536
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,360
you're a medical talent?

537
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:30,720
Perfect!

538
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,460
I'm a martial arts talent!

539
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,140
My father said that

540
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,410
if I'd been born a boy,

541
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,360
I'd have outshone all my brothers.

542
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,970
My father often regrets that I
was born a girl.

543
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:40,970
Otherwise,

544
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,310
I would surely be a pillar of the state.

545
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,510
So it's a case of

546
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,340
talent recognizing talent.

547
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,670
I've finally met a kindred spirit.

548
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,390
You haven't paid yet.

549
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,520
Officer!

550
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,150
-You can't take it!
-Go away!

551
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,030
How can this soldier bully
people like this?

552
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,830
Officer!

553
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,830
There are elderly at home
waiting for money to buy medicine.

554
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,880
Officer!

555
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,860
What's wrong with me taking
a few of your chickens?

556
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,480
You just look like you need a beating.

557
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,080
Get away!

558
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:07,480
Let go! You...

559
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,440
Officer!

560
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,140
Your Ladyship, come down quickly!

561
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,450
The Shuoxi Army has arrived.

562
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,610
These soldiers

563
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,240
look battle-hardened.

564
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,150
Their fierce aura

565
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,990
sets them apart from the
provincial troops.

566
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,320
They serve under the Black
Armor Guards,
Young Marshal of Shuoxi Army.

567
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,350
The Young Marshal has
fought bloodily across Shuoxi.

568
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,850
His name strikes fear in enemy ranks,

569
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,650
and his forces are unstoppable.

570
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,030
Stop!

571
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,330
Who are you?

572
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,500
According to Shuoxi military law,

573
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,590
anyone who oppresses the people

574
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,500
shall be executed on the spot.

575
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,960
Anyone caught stealing for personal gain

576
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,900
shall be executed on the spot.

577
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,250
Executed?

578
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,790
What do your Shuoxi military laws

579
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,070
have to do with us Jingzhou soldiers?

580
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,640
Anyone who defies our superiors

581
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,770
and disobeys orders

582
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,260
shall be executed!

583
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,150
How dare you!

584
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,840
He deserves it for bullying civilians.

585
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:29,640
Send his body to the garrison commander,

586
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,910
and tell him

587
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,660
if he can't control his troops,

588
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,470
I, Yan Chi, will take over for him.

589
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,270
Yes!

590
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,260
Officer.

591
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,790
Thank you, Officer.

592
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:52,070
That's the Young Marshal of Shuoxi Army,

593
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,110
my cousin,

594
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,630
the legendary God of War, Yan Chi!

595
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,160
He joined the army at 10,

596
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,990
and by 15, he was earning
top honors every year.

597
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,520
Pretty impressive, right?

598
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,390
Indeed.

599
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,110
Thank you, Officer.

600
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,240
Thank you, Officer.

601
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,490
[Marquis of Anyang's Mansion]

602
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,950
[Grand Princess]

603
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,390
Madam.

604
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,140
The Crown Prince has returned!

605
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,100
Great Aunt,

606
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,370
I've come to pay my respects.

607
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:55,630
You old rascal! Still as playful
as ever at your age?

608
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,510
Come here.

609
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:02,160
The Shuoxi Army has heavy
duties at the border.

610
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,710
How could your father

611
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:06,000
possibly let you wander off?

612
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,790
Guess, Great Aunt.

613
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,450
You snuck out on your own,

614
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,140
didn't you?

615
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:15,360
I can never hide anything from you.

616
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,880
I had some disagreements with my father

617
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,610
over military affairs.

618
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,600
I ran back in a fit of anger.

619
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,900
Did he strike you again?

620
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,390
Why can't he ever

621
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,000
grasp a father's kindness?

622
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,350
I'm used to it.

623
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:33,290
It's only because your mother
passed too soon,

624
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,880
and you're his only son left

625
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,620
to keep him company.

626
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,780
Just cut him some slack.

627
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,780
He's been lonely most of his life.

628
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,510
He doesn't need me to back down.

629
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,060
In his heart,

630
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,210
I'm probably not even half as important

631
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,650
as the Shuoxi Army.

632
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:49,940
Chi.

633
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,370
It's been years.

634
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,140
You're looking more impressive than ever.

635
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,300
You were so decisive and

636
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,640
commanding in the marketplace.

637
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,290
Grandma.

638
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,850
Gap Tooth has grown so tall.

639
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:02,070
Let me check if your teeth are all in.

640
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:03,600
Don't call me Gap Tooth.

641
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,860
My teeth have all grown in
for a long time!

642
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,050
Come.

643
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:29,100
Chi, why are you distracted?

644
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,590
Are you looking down on me?

645
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,370
This lady looks familiar to me.

646
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,250
This is Miss Qin of the Qin family.

647
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,380
How do you know her?

648
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,050
I, Qin Wan, pay my respects
to the Grand Princess.

649
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:48,810
So you're Miss Qin of the Qin family?

650
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,920
Come here.

651
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,420
Little Medical Fairy,

652
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,480
stay away from those two.

653
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,310
Don't let them hurt you.

654
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,450
A few days ago on the street,

655
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,000
I had a relapse of my old ailment.

656
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,040
Luckily, you treated me.

657
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,820
Otherwise, Chi

658
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,490
wouldn't have been able to
see his great aunt.

659
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,550
You saved someone on the street.

660
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,740
Miss Qin, may I ask

661
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,690
where you learned your skills?

662
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,330
I grew up in the Medicine King Valley;

663
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,800
all the doctors and patients
there are my teachers.

664
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,260
So that's why Great Aunt
calls you the "Little Medical Fairy?"

665
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:23,470
Chi,

666
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,530
how long will you stay

667
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,490
in Jingzhou this time?

668
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,830
Don't worry, Great Aunt.

669
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,030
I definitely want to celebrate

670
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,960
my cousin Jia's wedding properly.

671
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,290
That's more like it.

672
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,820
By the way, Little Medical Fairy,

673
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,380
you must come to

674
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:38,020
my eldest grandson's wedding.

675
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,420
I'll send you an invitation.

676
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,950
Thank you, Grand Princess.

677
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:41,880
However,

678
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,750
it hasn't been three years
since my father's funeral.

679
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,040
We're a family of generals.

680
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,230
We don't fuss over such things.

681
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,160
Just consider it

682
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,730
as you coming to keep me
company and a chat.

683
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,640
We'll close the door

684
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,360
and have our own little feast.

685
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,610
Alright, I'll do as you say.

686
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,980
But today, you must listen to me as well.

687
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,080
It's getting late.

688
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,680
I should take your pulse and
apply some acupuncture.

689
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,210
Alright.

690
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,780
Then I'll go out and practice with Chi.

691
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,700
I still need to keep Great Aunt company.

692
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,720
No distractions allowed

693
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,410
during treatment.

694
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:11,380
Did you hear that? Let's go.

695
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,970
[Tinglan]

696
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,160
My Lady!

697
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,080
My Lady, look,

698
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,450
I got new clothes!

699
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,070
This is great.

700
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,880
No more patchwork for me!

701
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,970
This house is huge!

702
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:35,100
My Lady, why aren't you happy?

703
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,830
Tinglan House is the best
courtyard in the Qin Mansion.

704
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,240
Now it's ours.

705
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,600
It feels like a dream!

706
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,870
These were never mine to begin with.

707
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,600
What's there to be happy about?

708
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,110
Wan!

709
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,510
-Wan!
-Third Madam.

710
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,070
Miss Qin.

711
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,140
Wan, how is it?

712
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,780
Is this courtyard to your liking?

713
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,030
Thank you, Third Madam.

714
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,300
Call me Auntie.

715
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:05,750
Auntie.

716
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,770
Look at our Wan—

717
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:14,139
such a sweet voice,

718
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:16,770
that face, that figure—

719
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,630
truly the best in Jingzhou.

720
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:22,679
No wonder the
Grand Princess favors you so much.

721
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,330
I've been so busy

722
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:27,219
this past year,

723
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:30,010
so I've forgotten to bring you

724
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,440
these things I prepared.

725
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,670
Take a look; do you like them?

726
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,320
I don't need so many.

727
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:38,139
Keep them.

728
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:40,270
You can alternate between them.

729
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,070
When you're all dressed up tomorrow,

730
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,330
it'll make the Grand Princess happy too.

731
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:46,449
Thank you, Auntie.

732
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,949
We're family; no need to be so formal.

733
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,790
Alright.

734
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:52,000
I won't disturb your studies anymore.

735
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,320
Here.

736
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,360
All of you, follow me.

737
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,800
Put all these over there.

738
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:57,180
Put them all here.

739
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,850
Yes, yes, quickly put them there.

740
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,630
Such a good girl.

741
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,470
[Marquis of Anyang's Mansion]

742
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,760
Greetings, Your Highness.

743
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,210
Greetings, Great Aunt.

744
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:31,050
Greetings, Your Highness.

745
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,880
Chi,

746
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,550
what are you doing here

747
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,080
instead of sitting in the front hall?

748
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,750
Look,

749
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:39,340
you're making Wan nervous.

750
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,140
Miss Qin, this is our first meeting,

751
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:43,960
but why does it

752
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,030
seem like you're a bit

753
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:46,950
wary of me?

754
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,730
Your Highness, just a few days ago

755
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,670
I saw you display great martial skill

756
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,880
and strict discipline.

757
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,480
Naturally, I hold you in awe.

758
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,860
The fierceness of the Shuoxi Army

759
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,510
is reserved for the enemy.

760
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,410
We never harm the innocent.

761
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:06,260
Thanks to the Shuoxi Army for

762
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,320
defending the nation and
bringing peace to countless families.

763
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,450
Alright, alright.

764
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,370
You.

765
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,920
You go sit in the front courtyard, okay?

766
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,070
The two of you being all
polite back and forth

767
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:19,950
is exhausting.

768
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,770
The bridal procession hasn't arrived yet.

769
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:23,900
Let me keep you company a while longer.

770
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,080
How come it's still not here?

771
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,010
The auspicious time has passed, hasn't it?

772
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:29,410
I feel uneasy.

773
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,210
Go check outside again.

774
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:35,010
Go and check.

775
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,680
Yes, Great Aunt.

776
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,430
Wan,

777
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,600
come here.

778
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:51,460
Sit down.

779
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,230
You're such

780
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,610
a straightforward

781
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,260
girl,

782
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,950
so why do you overthink everything?

783
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,880
How did you figure that out?

784
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,880
Well, I've lived for so many years.

785
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,560
If I still couldn't read people,

786
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,690
all those years would've been wasted.

787
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,310
Actually,

788
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,710
I've already found out

789
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,650
all about the kind of life
you’ve been living

790
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,810
in the Qin family by the time
I came looking for you.

791
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:18,810
No wonder

792
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:22,100
you're so cautious, afraid to
make even the slightest misstep.

793
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,030
Luckily, fate brought us together.

794
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,490
From now on,

795
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,670
I'll try my best

796
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:29,860
to protect you,

797
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,110
so you'll never...

798
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:32,800
Look,

799
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,690
you're making yourself look
like a little old lady.

800
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,210
Be happy.

801
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,110
Smile.

802
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,040
Thank you, Grand Princess.

803
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:42,750
Hearing your words,

804
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,740
all the grievances in my heart

805
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,290
have completely vanished.

806
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:51,740
Marquis of Anyang's Mansion

807
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,010
Father,

808
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:13,020
[Yue Jia, Marquis of Anyang's Heir]

809
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,180
I was sent to escort the bride

810
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,040
and have safely brought her back.

811
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,910
I, Wei Yanzhi,

812
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:18,180
under orders from the Duke of Song,

813
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,140
[Wei Yanzhi]

814
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,000
have delivered the bride without incident.

815
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,480
Yanzhi, you've endured a long journey.

816
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,670
Thank you for your efforts.

817
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,400
Jia,

818
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,210
you've worked hard too.

819
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,380
The bride has arrived, and
the auspicious hour is here.

820
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:32,700
Young Master, please kick the sedan door.

821
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,560
Madam, please step down from the sedan.

822
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:57,390
Young Master, please kick the
sedan door again.

823
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,640
May the Master fear no domestic strife,

824
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,170
nor the Madam feign meekness.

825
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:04,160
May you love each other until old age.

826
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:09,050
Madam, please step down from the sedan.

827
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,160
The auspicious time has arrived.

828
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,430
Young Master, lift the bridal veil.
