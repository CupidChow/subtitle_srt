[Coroner's Diary]

2
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,940
[Episode 13]

3
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,460
Senior.

4
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,890
What illness does Xinlan actually have?

5
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,890
Is it something even you can't cure?

6
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,050
What she has is

7
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,420
a congenital deficiency
she's had since birth.

8
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,890
I wrote to our master about it,

9
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,890
and he confirmed that
my prescription is correct.

10
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,550
It's just that her body is too frail,

11
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,979
so the effect is a bit slow.

12
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,910
Winter is especially hard for her.

13
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,060
Sometimes, she sleeps for days;

14
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,170
other times when she wakes up,

15
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,700
she can't fall back asleep.

16
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,450
With you here, Senior,

17
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,509
I'm sure Xinlan will get better soon.

18
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,660
Thank you for your kind words, Junior.

19
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:18,850
Here.

20
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,310
Thank you, Senior.

21
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,670
Why did Senior buy such a large residence?

22
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,300
Xinlan is in poor health,

23
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,970
and logically speaking,

24
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,630
a lack of vitality isn't conducive
to recovery.

25
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,090
Look at these rooms.

26
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,570
They're specifically used by Senior

27
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,020
to shelter those poor patients.

28
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,410
It may seem quiet here now,

29
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,370
but that's only because
they've all recovered and gone home.

30
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,780
It's just a temporary lull.

31
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,440
No wonder the villagers
all respect Senior so much.

32
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,750
Senior's actions

33
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,980
truly deserve the words
"Benevolent Heart, Benevolent Skills."

34
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,660
[Benevolent Heart]

35
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,250
Senior comes from a prestigious family,

36
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,570
with exceptional medical skills
and no desire for fame.

37
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,900
He always focuses on researching incurable
diseases that others can't treat,

38
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,000
which is why his name remains low-profile.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,500
If Xinlan weren't so ill
and unable to travel,

40
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,370
he would probably

41
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,740
be traveling everywhere like me,

42
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,400
searching for rare and unusual diseases.

43
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,500
It's truly a pity.

44
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,410
I hope Senior's devotion

45
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,740
will move the heavens,

46
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,620
allowing the two of them
to grow old together.

47
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,410
Don't run! Stop right there!

48
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,790
What's that place over there?

49
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:27,760
I think it's Senior's herb garden.

50
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,250
Help! Someone's stealing herbs!

51
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,130
Help!

52
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,000
Song!

53
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:32,940
Mr. Sun!

54
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,340
-Someone was stealing herbs here!
-What happened?

55
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,300
Someone was stealing herbs!

56
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,570
The medicinal herbs Master worked so hard
to grow

57
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,740
have all been ruined by the thief!

58
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,850
Mr. Dong will surely scold me again
if he finds out.

59
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:40,810
Where's the thief?

60
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,650
I failed to catch up with him.

61
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,710
He climbed over the wall and escaped!

62
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,740
Take me to see.

63
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,100
It's right over there!

64
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,810
Right there.

65
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,900
Was it this patch?

66
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:00,970
This patch?

67
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,030
Yes. That's right.

68
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:14,340
This...

69
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,100
That person wasn't here for the herbs.

70
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,100
But I saw him bending over right there
with my own eyes.

71
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,960
If he wasn't stealing herbs,
then what was he doing?

72
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,560
If he were here to steal herbs,

73
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,690
he should have at least taken
some herbs away.

74
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,130
But the herbs in the garden

75
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,260
were all just trampled and knocked over.

76
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,860
Judging by the roots and stems,

77
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,260
there's no sign of them
being uprooted or harvested, either.

78
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,620
When you saw him,

79
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,180
he might have just climbed over the wall

80
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:46,980
and was about to stand up,

81
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,440
rather than bending down.

82
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,370
Junior, you're truly impressive.

83
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,020
No wonder that brat Yan...

84
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,830
Senior.

85
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,270
Alright, alright.

86
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,659
Did you get a good look at
that person's appearance?

87
00:04:58,659 --> 00:04:59,770
I didn't see clearly.

88
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,690
As soon as I called out,

89
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,750
he ran off without even looking back.

90
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,340
What happened here?

91
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,300
Mr. Dong, a thief broke in here.

92
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,980
We need to quickly
dispatch more people to patrol.

93
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,980
Miss Qin, you're truly thoughtful.

94
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,350
Now that winter has come,

95
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,990
life is inevitably hard for the poor
in the mountains.

96
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,790
We just need to be more vigilant.

97
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,420
Making such a big fuss,

98
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,150
what if you scare Her Ladyship?

99
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,550
Mr. Dong, I was wrong.

100
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,260
As long as you offer me food,

101
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,030
you can punish me however you want.

102
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:38,790
Look at you.

103
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,450
Come on.

104
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,370
Get up, get up.

105
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,220
I was wrong.

106
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,310
Alright, alright.

107
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,620
Don't be afraid.

108
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,510
How could I possibly starve you?

109
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,810
Don't be afraid.

110
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,250
He's also a poor child
taken in by Young Master,

111
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,510
and he was traumatized by hunger before.

112
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,000
It's getting late.

113
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,130
Young Master Sun,

114
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,330
I'd trouble you to escort Miss Qin back.

115
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,250
Mrs. Lin will bring dinner

116
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,740
to everyone's quarters later.

117
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,870
Thank you, Mr. Dong.

118
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,380
You're welcome.

119
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,420
Let's go.

120
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,030
Little Wan'er.

121
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:12,820
Wan.

122
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,370
Why are you back so late?

123
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,410
Come here. Come on.

124
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,910
-Come here. Sit down.
-What's wrong?

125
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,290
When I woke up today, you weren't here,

126
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,740
so I thought I'd go look for you.

127
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,330
I didn't expect to not find you

128
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,190
but witness quite a show instead.

129
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,370
Where did Little Wan'er go anyway?

130
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,430
Where on earth did she run off to
so early in the morning?

131
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,210
Why couldn't we find her anywhere?

132
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,740
She probably went
to hang out with her senior.

133
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,060
They're senior brother and junior sister,

134
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,720
yet they don't even know
to keep their distance.

135
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,340
Isn't this a plum forest?

136
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,960
Why does it stink so badly?

137
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,540
Look.

138
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,710
What is that?

139
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,020
Let me see.

140
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,410
What's there to look?

141
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,250
What's wrong?

142
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,560
What do you want to see?

143
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,100
What is it?

144
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,030
What are you trying to look at?

145
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,030
It's a wild animal's carcass!

146
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,980
A wild animal's carcass?

147
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,040
I'm sorry.

148
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,810
I thought it was night-blooming jasmine.

149
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:31,840
My Lady, come on.

150
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,740
Why are there so many carcasses
of wild animals here?

151
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,060
Are you alright?

152
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,880
Why didn't you stop me?

153
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,370
You just joined in watching me
make a fool of myself.

154
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,300
What kind of friend

155
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,130
are you?

156
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,100
I'm Bai Feijue.

157
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,770
Sorry for disturbing you ladies.

158
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,970
I'd like to offer my sincere apologies.

159
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,860
Shuang.

160
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,090
I'm sorry.

161
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,870
I was almost frightened to death just now.

162
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,950
That's why I lost my composure.

163
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,590
Are you okay?

164
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,690
It's alright.

165
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:42,740
Later,

166
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,380
I casually mentioned that the Bai family
is a prestigious family in Yizhou,

167
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,420
and Qin Xiang's gaze at Young Master Bai
was so intense

168
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,140
that it seemed like it could drip water.

169
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,970
Where are those animals' carcasses now?

170
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,140
I'd like to take a look.

171
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,040
Why do you want to see those things?

172
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,780
Young Master Bai had his servants
bury them right away.

173
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,300
Ning.

174
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,900
You said those carcasses
were disemboweled,

175
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,340
as if cut open by a blade, right?

176
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:03,930
Yes.

177
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,350
I would never mistake blade wounds.

178
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:09,870
My Lady.

179
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,990
Mrs. Lin has brought some pastries.

180
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,570
What kind of pastries?

181
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,050
It's tea shortbread.

182
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,570
I'd like to try some too.

183
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,070
I don't want to go back to that room.

184
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,660
Just seeing her makes me lose my appetite.

185
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,900
My skills are humble.

186
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,160
I hope you ladies won't be disappointed.

187
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,450
This tea shortbread

188
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,210
is even better than what we had
at the tea stall.

189
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,210
Come on, try some.

190
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,500
I'm glad you ladies like it.

191
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,020
Young Master has instructed

192
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,020
that I shall attend to you ladies
for the next few days.

193
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,900
Mrs. Lin, you call Senior "Young Master."

194
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,630
Are you his household servant?

195
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,460
Yes.

196
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,210
Among all the people here, only Dong and I

197
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,780
came here with Young Master.

198
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,020
The others were all cured by Young Master

199
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,750
and chose to stay voluntarily.

200
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,420
Mrs. Lin, your pastries

201
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,450
taste even better than those
made by the locals.

202
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,490
That's truly impressive.

203
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,540
Actually, I didn't know
how to make them before, either.

204
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,060
It was after Young Master cured
my heart ailment

205
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,810
that I suddenly became skilled

206
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,090
at kitchen work.

207
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,480
Dr. Sun can even cure heart ailments?

208
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,560
Indeed.

209
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,810
Young Master said I had necrosis
on my heart

210
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,570
and that cutting it out would cure me.

211
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,920
Please take your time to enjoy, ladies.

212
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,110
If you want anything to eat,

213
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,780
just let me know.

214
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,170
Mrs. Lin, let me open the door for you.

215
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:18,770
Thank you.

216
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,490
Little Wan'er.

217
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,300
Your senior's medical skills

218
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,160
seem to be even better than yours.

219
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,020
Well, he's my eldest senior,

220
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,950
so of course he's the most skilled.

221
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,880
My Lady, Your Highness.

222
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,170
Breakfast is ready.

223
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,450
Okay.

224
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,560
Junior, something terrible has happened!

225
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,970
Song was killed!

226
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,270
Wan.

227
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,460
Where are you going?

228
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,300
Something happened to
one of Senior's servants.

229
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,140
I'm on my way to check on him.

230
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:02,970
You can't go.

231
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,570
Senior has always treated me nicely,

232
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,780
and now, with such a great matter
happening in his household,

233
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,240
I can't just stand by and do nothing.

234
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,420
This is not Jingzhou.

235
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,490
No one will cover for you here.

236
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,950
If word gets out about
you examining corpses,

237
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,020
what will become of
you sisters' reputation?

238
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,850
If anyone dares
to speak ill of Little Wan'er,

239
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,540
they'll have to answer to my sword first!

240
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,070
Let's go.

241
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:17,810
But...

242
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:18,940
Wan.

243
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,630
Cousin Yan.

244
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,900
Don't worry.

245
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,760
Wan's skills

246
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,300
are admired even by Lord Yan
and Prefect Huo.

247
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,540
I'm sure her reputation won't be damaged.

248
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,210
Is that so?

249
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,630
Well then, Shuang,

250
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,850
please tell me more about it.

251
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,120
Mr. Dong.

252
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,380
Sorry for troubling you, Young Master.

253
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,520
Please don't tell my senior
about this yet.

254
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,980
Thank you for easing
Young Master's burden.

255
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,210
Song

256
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,630
is over here.

257
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,570
Ning, don't go there.

258
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,730
Fuling, go get my box
and writing materials.

259
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:03,210
Yes.

260
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,350
I'll go with you. I know martial arts.

261
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:04,880
Let's go.

262
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,490
Who could have done this to Song?

263
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,060
Send someone to report this
to the authorities first.

264
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,810
But

265
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,570
the county office is over 20 miles from here,

266
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,300
and with heavy snow and slippery roads,

267
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,780
a round trip would take
two days and two nights.

268
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,380
Even so, we still need to report this
to the authorities.

269
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,580
I'll begin the examination here first.

270
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,740
Young Master Sun, this...

271
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,060
Don't worry.

272
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,000
Junior's forensic skills are exceptional.

273
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,640
She won't make any mistake.

274
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,560
Okay.

275
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,110
I'll go make arrangements right away.

276
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,940
Senior.

277
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,500
The first three days after a crime
are crucial for investigation.

278
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,280
We can't just
wait for officials to arrive.

279
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,990
We must examine everything possible.

280
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,960
In case of delays,

281
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,010
at least we can preserve
some earliest evidence.

282
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:06,610
Alright.

283
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,930
Who discovered Song first?

284
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,730
It was me.

285
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,330
Why were you here

286
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,550
so early in the morning?

287
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,540
I'm responsible for daily cleaning,

288
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,660
and once I recover,
I'll be leaving the mountain.

289
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,730
I'm grateful to Master for saving my life,

290
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,020
so I got up early this morning,

291
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,850
thinking of sweeping the snow
for Master again.

292
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,090
But I didn't expect

293
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,070
to see a stray cat on the way,

294
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,090
so I chased after it.

295
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,420
And that's when I found Song.

296
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,850
Your body is still weak,

297
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,140
so why would you chase after that cat?

298
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,060
Young Master Bai instructed yesterday

299
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,320
that we must get rid of
all the stray cats,

300
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,890
so they won't frighten
the ladies at night.

301
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,210
You may go now.

302
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,660
But don't wander off these days.

303
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,390
The officers will come
to question you again.

304
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,430
I understand.

305
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,470
Little Wan'er.

306
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,090
Give it to me.

307
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:03,330
Let me.

308
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:04,870
Thank you, Senior.

309
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,100
Little Wan'er.

310
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,900
Your cousin Yan seems to be discussing
with the steward

311
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,060
about getting on the road immediately.

312
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,720
Given the current situation,

313
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,990
nobody can leave.

314
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,700
Senior.

315
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,600
Take notes.

316
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:32,900
Notes of what?

317
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,020
As per usual,

318
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:38,730
you talk,

319
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:39,730
I write.

320
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,090
Write down everything I say.

321
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,190
Alright.

322
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,540
Note this.

323
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,210
Initial examination.

324
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:58,940
Victim:

325
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,300
Song.

326
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,570
Approximately 16 years old.

327
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,150
Judging from the color of the bloodstains,

328
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,390
the time of death was around 1-3 AM.

329
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,770
Based on the victim's posture at death,

330
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,050
the killer likely pinned him
against the wall first,

331
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,310
then cut his limbs off.

332
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,410
Judging from the leg wounds,

333
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,140
the killer intended
to sever the arms as well,

334
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,580
but the blade became dull,

335
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,840
so the arms weren't completely severed.

336
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,870
The fatal wound is a stab to the chest.

337
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,220
No weapon was found at the crime scene.

338
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,850
Based on the wound shape,

339
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,060
the weapon

340
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,090
appears to be an iron blade capable of
both cutting and stabbing,

341
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,060
crudely made,

342
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,700
similar to...

343
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,270
A billhook.

344
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,490
Could the killer be

345
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,450
a madman who enjoys torture and murder?

346
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,260
Why would someone harbor

347
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,660
such hatred toward Song?

348
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,970
The motive for this crime
requires further investigation.

349
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,260
Please have your men
seal this area off first

350
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,420
and guard it day and night, Senior.

351
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,810
The body should not be collected until

352
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,350
after official investigation.

353
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,150
Leave it to me.

354
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,570
Song lost both his parents

355
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,660
and was an orphan.

356
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,280
He suffered from heart disease too,

357
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,590
just like me.

358
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,620
Since childhood,

359
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,050
he was pushed around by those relatives,

360
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,540
with no place to call home.

361
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,140
He had such a miserable life.

362
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,570
Later, after Young Master
cured his illness,

363
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,850
he decided to stay.

364
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,490
I was even thinking of
adopting him as my godson.

365
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,250
I'd raise him as a kid,

366
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,810
and he would care for me in my old age.

367
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,070
Who would have thought

368
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,180
he'd be killed by someone?

369
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,280
Mrs. Lin.

370
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,630
Has Song had any conflicts
with anyone recently?

371
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:49,300
No.

372
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,900
He was always such an obedient kid.

373
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,830
How could he have offended anyone?

374
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,590
Offend anyone...

375
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,920
Ning, check the wall for
any new footprints.

376
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,569
Got it.

377
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:17,270
The top of the wall is covered with snow.

378
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,390
Little Wan'er.

379
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,829
What would new footprints look like?

380
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,069
Why did it have to snow last night?

381
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,619
Regardless of whether they're old or new,

382
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:28,150
check if there are any footprints
in the snow.

383
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,860
There aren't any.

384
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,140
Junior.

385
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,010
Junior.

386
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,450
You suspect it was the thief
from yesterday?

387
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,420
Mrs. Lin said

388
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,480
Song never made enemies with anyone.

389
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,380
But the thief from yesterday

390
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,860
was discovered by Song,

391
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,710
so he had to take precautions.

392
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,450
Song ruined that thief's plans yesterday,

393
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,250
and that's why he did such ruthless things
to Song.

394
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,420
The motive is the hardest thing
to investigate,

395
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,880
and we don't have enough evidence
to make any conclusions yet.

396
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,580
If it really was that thief,

397
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,290
he should have climbed over the wall

398
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,580
before 5 AM

399
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,510
for the footprints to be completely
covered by snow.

400
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,870
So what should we do now?

401
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,580
Find the murder weapon.

402
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,240
Has the murder weapon been found?

403
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,040
A billhook is indeed missing
from the storage yard.

404
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,150
If the killer took the murder weapon
with them,

405
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,450
there's a high chance they might
commit another crime.

406
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,770
But with the heavy snow,

407
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,090
the mountain roads are difficult
to traverse.

408
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,340
The government officials

409
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,290
won't arrive until tomorrow evening
at the earliest.

410
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,420
For now, we can only rely on ourselves.

411
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,290
We don't have many guards with us,

412
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,530
and if everyone stays
in separate quarters,

413
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,050
we won't be able to protect everyone.

414
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,210
Tell Senior that

415
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,960
if his wife can be moved,

416
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,510
they'd better stay with us.

417
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,450
Okay.

418
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,820
I'll go inform Young Master right away.

419
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,340
Junior.

420
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,620
What about me?

421
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,480
What's my task?

422
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,010
Such heavy snow

423
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,620
can cover up many traces.

424
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,820
There are no guards in the mansion,

425
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,340
so outsiders could've sneaked in,

426
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,210
but we can't rule out the possibility
of an inside job.

427
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,250
Let's split up and question

428
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,690
the servants about their whereabouts
last night.

429
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,930
Anyone whose story doesn't add up

430
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:07,790
is a suspect.

431
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,240
Brilliant.

432
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,820
I learned this method from Lord Yan.

433
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,010
You know, Junior,

434
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,620
at this very moment,

435
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,020
I actually miss him a bit.

436
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,150
Ning?

437
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,450
Why are you here?

438
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,910
I'm guarding the gate for you.

439
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:49,170
I believe I'm better at guarding the gate
than Fuling, right?

440
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,240
What about you?

441
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,740
Have you found anything?

442
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,600
Everything adds up

443
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,510
perfectly.

444
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,290
All testimonies match,

445
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,570
with nothing suspicious at all.

446
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,250
Young Master Sun, Miss Qin.

447
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,820
Young Master said it was inconvenient
for Young Madam to be moved,

448
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,380
and he'd ensure her safety.

449
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,030
I'll go talk to Senior.

450
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,420
What's wrong?

451
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,340
I miss Chi. What about you?

452
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,110
He...

453
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,590
He has his own matters to attend to.

454
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,440
I used to

455
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,900
think

456
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,450
I was very capable,

457
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,490
but I couldn't even tell
if a footprint was new or old.

458
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,160
Am I completely useless?

459
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,440
So that's what you were talking about.

460
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,570
What did you think I was talking about?

461
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,450
Nothing.

462
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,030
The first time I treated a patient,

463
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,850
I also thought I was really good,

464
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,020
but I misdiagnosed even a simple cold.

465
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,410
Even the medical fairy
made mistakes before?

466
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,610
Everyone in this world makes mistakes.

467
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,490
You only make fewer mistakes
with more experience.

468
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,380
The same applies to you.

469
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,840
We're both exceptionally gifted after all.

470
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,100
I like hearing that.

471
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,660
When I mentioned Chi just now,

472
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,660
why did you blush?

473
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,620
I didn't.

474
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,500
It was the cold weather.

475
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,620
If you say so.

476
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,100
Anyway,

477
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,860
I really miss him.

478
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,010
I also...

479
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,130
Miss him quite a bit.

480
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,590
The Herbal Garden.

481
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,660
Master.

482
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,520
Master!

483
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,950
Are you alright, Master?

484
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,430
I'm okay.

485
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,600
Let me rest for a while.

486
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,340
Wan.

487
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,770
I'm here.

488
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,390
Hurry! Hurry!

489
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,750
Alright.

490
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,580
Leave it to me.

491
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,460
Fortunately we found them in time,

492
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,900
so the frostbite isn't too severe.

493
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,730
They're currently soaking
in medicinal baths,

494
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,140
but they haven't regained
consciousness yet.

495
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,270
Still unconscious?

496
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,410
Lord Yan has been stationed
at the border for years

497
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,100
and knows well how to march through snow.

498
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,010
How could his body
be damaged to this extent?

499
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:02,970
Who knows?

500
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,900
If it weren't for
his horse's intelligence...

501
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,770
-Be careful.
-It's okay.

502
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,430
They might have frozen to death
at our doorstep.

503
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,180
His Highness must have overexerted himself

504
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,880
and depleted his vital energy.

505
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,220
I'll go prepare a few doses of

506
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,180
Four Gentlemen Decoction for him.

507
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,440
Senior. His Highness has always been

508
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,420
in good health with strong
Qi and blood energy, so it's unsuitable

509
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,280
for him to take nourishing medicines like
Four Gentlemen Decoction.

510
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,050
That's right.

511
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,450
Medication should be tailored
to the individual.

512
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:39,340
No wonder Master says I'm book-smart
but lack practical wisdom.

513
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,650
They must have had irregular meals
while traveling,

514
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,860
causing cold invasion and Qi stagnation.

515
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,050
Senior, you could prepare some
navel-warming plasters

516
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,730
for external application
to warm the interior and dispel cold,

517
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,210
promoting Qi circulation
and relieving pain.

518
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:51,410
Yes, that's what I was thinking as well.

519
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,620
I'll go prepare some plasters
for him then.

520
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,940
I'm better than you at this, Junior.

521
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,620
My Lady, the medicine is ready.

522
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,970
Mrs. Lin, please prepare
two bowls of sugared water for me,

523
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:05,970
not too sweet,

524
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:07,580
and also boil some rice oil
to have on hand.

525
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,100
Got it.

526
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:12,650
Senior, why don't you go
attend to General Bai?

527
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:13,650
Why?

528
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:17,130
You want to apply the medicine
on him yourself?

529
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,340
Yes.

530
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,500
He's completely naked right now.

531
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,660
Don't you care about your reputation?

532
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,880
A physician should see no difference
between men and women.

533
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,310
If there's no difference,

534
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,750
then you go attend to General Bai,

535
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,810
and I'll handle this one.

536
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:29,730
Why is that?

537
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:30,830
He...

538
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,100
I saw how this guy
looked at you last time,

539
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,510
with questionable intentions.

540
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,570
What if he becomes obsessed with you?

541
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,380
Why would a young lord like him
be obsessed with me?

542
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:44,000
Besides, I've treated his wounds before
when he was undressed.

543
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,640
If he wanted to do anything,
he would have done so already.

544
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,200
But

545
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,420
he...

546
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,010
He's completely naked now!

547
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,800
If you really feel that uneasy, Senior,

548
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,250
I'll go attend to General Bai instead.

549
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:53,970
No, no, no.

550
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,620
That guy's naked too.

551
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,440
Since you've treated him before,

552
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,010
alright then.

553
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,730
This guy is really getting lucky.

554
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,800
Your Highness, you're awake.

555
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,500
Is there anything you need, Your Highness?

556
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,560
I can get it for you.

557
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:46,420
I...

558
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,180
I'll go check on Bai Feng.

559
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,140
General Bai is out of danger now.

560
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,660
Your Highness should focus on
your recovery.

561
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,870
Miss Qin, where are my clothes?

562
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,960
They were removed.

563
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,720
You were nearly frozen,

564
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,620
so we had to give you a warm bath
before applying medicine.

565
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,690
Who undressed me?

566
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,140
It was Senior.

567
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,780
And I applied the medicine.

568
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,670
Thanks a lot.

569
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,630
Your Highness, don't worry.

570
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:34,160
Just two more treatments,
and you'll be fine.

571
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,170
Thank you, Miss Qin.

572
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,940
I'm almost fully recovered.

573
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,010
Perhaps after I get dressed...

574
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,530
I'll be the judge of that.

575
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,320
Lie down now. I'll apply the medicine
for you.

576
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,480
Please don't trouble yourself, Miss Qin.

577
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,460
I'm completely healed.

578
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,420
I truly am!

579
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:48,420
Lie down now.

580
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:49,210
That won't be necessary.

581
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,620
Master! Master!

582
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,700
Miss Qin.

583
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,030
Come on, let me check your wounds.

584
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,290
I'm not wearing pants.

585
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,210
It was my negligence.

586
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,080
Please punish me, Master.

587
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,970
This isn't the time for that.

588
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:05,560
Get up.

589
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,450
I won't get up until
you punish me, Master.

590
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,730
Who said you could get out of bed?

591
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:09,420
Go back now.

592
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,680
We can discuss this after you've healed.

593
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,660
Miss Qin.

594
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,100
Master's injuries are more serious
than mine.

595
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,530
In order to catch up with you,

596
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,770
he left his guards behind
and traveled day and night,

597
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:20,570
-without even having a single warm meal.
-Shut up.

598
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,400
Keep talking.

599
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,290
Later, when he heard you were
at the Herbal Garden, Lady Wan,

600
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,770
he didn't even stop for water

601
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:29,990
and rushed up the mountain.

602
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:32,000
We didn't stop to rest until
we reached the yard gate.

603
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,200
But during that rest,

604
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,730
I fell into a deep sleep,

605
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:38,810
and that's how I ended up causing
Young Master to fall into danger.

606
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,020
So Your Highness

607
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,000
did all that for me.

608
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,820
Well, I never expected

609
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,120
the central plains to be so cold.

610
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,980
Master, let me check your wounds.

611
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,620
So you're the only one with a mouth, huh?

612
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,730
Spouting nonsense over there.

613
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:07,660
I had to speak up.

614
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,420
If I didn't tell Lady Wan,

615
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,010
how would she know
how much you did for her?

616
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,810
Your suffering would be in vain.

617
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,750
Get out of here now.

618
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:14,770
Get out!

619
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,250
I'll go check on Chi.

620
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:29,660
It's time for General Bai
to take his medicine.

621
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,720
I'll go remind him.

622
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:36,860
My Lady.

623
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,590
His Highness rushed over here,
risking his life.

624
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,660
-Such devotion...
-But what about the future?

625
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,360
Fuling.

626
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,530
In what capacity should I
accept this kindness,

627
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,090
Qin Wan or Shen Wan?

628
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,380
If my father's wrongful conviction
cannot be cleared,

629
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,140
how am I supposed to stay by his side?

630
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,520
Am I supposed to live out my life

631
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,650
as Qin Wan?

632
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:54,900
My Lady...

633
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,490
Fuling.

634
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,940
There's no need to say anything more.

635
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,400
My mind is a mess right now.

636
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:02,180
Lady Wan, the officials have arrived.

637
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,110
Mr. Dong is taking them to see Song.

638
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:04,870
Let's go.

639
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,320
Butler Dong.

640
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,730
Isn't your Dr. Sun's medical skill

641
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,580
supposedly able
to bring the dead back to life?

642
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,080
How come

643
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,780
he failed to save him?

644
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,180
Constable Song, you jest.

645
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,170
When we got here,

646
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,820
the young man was already dead.

647
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,970
That's why I say,

648
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:19,900
and this proves,

649
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,340
that even the greatest physicians

650
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,100
need help from us sometimes.

651
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,250
Too bad Dr. Sun doesn't have

652
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,340
any respect for minor officials like us.

653
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,620
That's not a very fair thing to say, Sir.

654
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,530
Alright, alright.

655
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:31,530
Examine the body.

656
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,710
But don't overdo it.

657
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,660
This Herbal Garden is isolated
from everywhere.

658
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,530
It's likely one of their own people
did it.

659
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:39,460
Constable Song.

660
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:40,860
I've already made inquiries.

661
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,460
No one at the Herbal Garden had any grudge
against this young man.

662
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,090
Lady Wan, please don't go over there.

663
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,770
The officials are examining the body.

664
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:52,490
Okay.

665
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,010
Chief, we've finished the examination.

666
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,730
The victim died from stab wounds
to the chest and abdomen.

667
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,790
His clothes are relatively intact,

668
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,530
suggesting he didn't struggle much
before being killed.

669
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,820
The killer was likely someone he knew.

670
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:20,550
Look.

671
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,010
Didn't I say so?

672
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:23,699
It was someone he knew who did it.

673
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:25,260
Take everyone from the garden
back to yamen

674
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,170
and interrogate them one by one.

675
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,350
Under torture, there's no way
they won't confess.

676
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,469
As a constable,

677
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,030
is this how you investigate cases?

678
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,949
Who are you?

679
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,790
A young lady should be embroidering
in her room,

680
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,739
not meddling in affairs here, alright?

681
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:38,389
I'm here investigating the case
on behalf of yamen.

682
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:39,159
Go away.

683
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:40,290
You're in no position to speak here.

684
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:42,090
To judge it as being committed by
an acquaintance based solely on

685
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,860
whether the clothes are disheveled—

686
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,750
With such a crude investigation, how
are you worthy of being called officials?

687
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,380
Insulting officials, huh?

688
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:48,739
I...

689
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:49,420
I dare you!

690
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,170
I do dare!

691
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,739
This is Miss Qin Wan from the Qin family.

692
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:56,219
The Qin family?

693
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,290
That's what I thought.

694
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,840
No wonder Miss Qin has such presence.

695
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:03,900
However, since Miss Qin is
a sheltered lady,

696
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,820
she surely knows nothing
about criminal law.

697
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,950
If Miss Qin Wan knows nothing about it,

698
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:11,590
then perhaps no one in this world
would dare claim they do.

699
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,610
Who is this?

700
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,170
Where's the token I gave you?

701
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,140
Why didn't you use it?

702
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,300
It slipped my mind

703
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:21,320
for a moment.

704
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,320
Take it out and try it now.

705
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,480
[Yan]

706
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,290
Heir of Prince Rui's token?

707
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,380
It was my fault for being blind!

708
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,130
I beg your forgiveness, My Lord!

709
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:37,900
What "Lord"?

710
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:38,740
This is

711
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,860
the Heir of Prince Rui himself.

712
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,120
Saying you were blind?

713
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,670
I think you simply never had eyes
to begin with!

714
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,230
Yes.

715
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:49,500
Miss Qin Wan has profound knowledge
in criminal law.

716
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,940
She's a strategist I specifically hired.

717
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,600
To receive her guidance today

718
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,370
is your great fortune.

719
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,110
You may rise.

720
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,610
It was all my fault for being so ignorant.

721
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:04,970
Please forgive me, Miss Qin.

722
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:08,090
Miss Qin has a heart full of loyalty
to His Majesty and love for the people.

723
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,170
It's because of this that
she disregarded the criticism

724
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:11,200
and assisted me in inspecting
the criminal cases of various states.

725
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,300
You should respectfully address her as

726
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,260
"Master Wan."

727
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:15,560
Yes.

728
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,720
Please allow us

729
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,960
to pay our respects to you, Master Wan.

730
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,560
Respects to you, Master Wan.

731
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,400
Please, no need for formalities.

732
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:35,950
Fuling.

733
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,770
The box.

734
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:37,860
Yes.

735
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:40,910
Senior.

736
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,260
Please escort His Highness and General Bai

737
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,320
back to rest first.

738
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,100
No need.

739
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,090
Bai Feng and I will go examine
the crime scene.

740
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:49,740
We'll let you know if we find anything.

741
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,800
But your wounds...

742
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,860
I'll apply more medicine for him.

743
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,340
As long as it's properly treated,

744
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,270
he should be able

745
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,140
to survive.

746
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,810
The murder weapon hasn't been found yet,

747
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:21,210
and the killer might commit another crime.

748
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,340
This inspection must uncover the reason

749
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,130
why the victim appeared
in the storage yard at midnight.

750
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:25,900
Right. Right.

751
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:26,900
Did you hear that?

752
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:28,970
Master Wan.

753
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:30,010
We've finished cleaning.

754
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:30,300
Okay.

755
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,450
Step back then.

756
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:43,220
Note this.

757
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:44,870
Quickly, write it down.

758
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:45,420
Yes.

759
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,990
Abrasion on the left cheek.

760
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,880
Fell backward on right shoulder,
showing abrasions.

761
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,840
Bruising and stab wounds
on the chest and abdomen.

762
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,610
Knees

763
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:12,900
and front of lower legs show
bruising and abrasions.

764
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,130
Cut wounds on both palms.

765
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,060
Blood stain on the right wrist.

766
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,540
Where are the victim's clothes?

767
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,200
Here, here.

768
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:00,480
Mr. Dong.

769
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,860
Do the servants at Herbal Garden

770
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,990
have winter clothes of this material?

771
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,130
No.

772
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:12,340
Young Master has always treated
us servants well

773
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:15,740
and would never use such coarse cotton
to make clothes for us.

774
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,670
This...

775
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:18,630
Where are the victim's shoes?

776
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,220
Shoes!

777
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,490
Master Wan.

778
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,230
The victim's shoes were completely
soaked in blood,

779
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,430
yet the soles are dry.

780
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,700
Dry?

781
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:33,880
Master.

782
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:35,570
This is Song's room.

783
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,240
Master.

784
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:51,010
Is there a latrine to the front left?

785
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,860
There's a servants' latrine not far ahead.

786
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,450
Let's go

787
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,860
and find the spot where the victim
encountered the killer.

788
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,860
This way, Master.

789
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,380
Master.

790
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,680
Where does this corridor lead to?

791
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,280
It's not marked on Mr. Dong's map.

792
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,180
I'll go check.

793
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:15,610
Take it slow.

794
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,860
We're in no hurry.

795
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,060
Don't worry, Master.

796
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,570
Your Highness, Miss Qin has finished
examining the body,

797
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,630
and I've specially come to guide you.

798
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:24,870
Your Highness.

799
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,650
I'm here to deliver the postmortem report

800
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:28,210
on Master Wan's orders.

801
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,380
Is anyone protecting Master Wan
over there?

802
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,050
Yes, there is.

803
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,050
I've arranged it.

804
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,220
With me here,

805
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,220
Master Wan won't even get a scratch.

806
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,050
The soles are dry?

807
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,080
Master.

808
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:52,650
Master.

809
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,860
Up ahead the corridor is a pharmacy.

810
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:55,650
Although the door is locked,

811
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:56,780
there's a strong medicinal smell.

812
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,640
Further ahead,

813
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:59,780
there are several forking paths.

814
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,130
The pharmacy is indeed down the corridor,

815
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:03,990
and further ahead is Young Master's
Renxin Clinic.

816
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,540
Killed on a snowy night,

817
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,870
yet the soles are dry.

818
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:10,420
This indicates that everywhere
the victim went was either corridors

819
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,360
or places with some form of cover.

820
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:11,950
The map.

821
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,000
In the cold of midnight,

822
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,940
the victim may have gone out
to use the bathroom,

823
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,670
passing through the corridor.

824
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:42,130
However, upon reaching this spot,
he encountered the murderer.

825
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:43,800
Seeing the murderer's suspicious behavior,

826
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,730
he followed him.

827
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,720
Realizing he was being tailed,

828
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:15,070
the murderer deliberately led him
to a secluded area.

829
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:15,780
Until...

830
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:23,190
Isn't that exactly
where the victim was killed?

831
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:25,680
On our way here,

832
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:27,420
besides the corridor,

833
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,170
there was only that covered walkway.

834
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:31,360
The eaves above the walkway are connected,

835
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,020
perfectly blocking the snow,

836
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,700
which explains why
the victim's soles are dry.

837
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:38,400
As for the murder weapon
Master Wan identified,

838
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,740
it should be something like a billhook.

839
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,600
Your Highness.

840
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:43,230
This is the storage yard,

841
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,780
which is usually never locked.

842
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,610
After Song sharpened the billhooks,

843
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:48,570
he'd store them by the yard entrance.

844
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:49,570
That makes sense.

845
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:52,740
The killer must have entered
the storage yard first,

846
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,640
grabbed a billhook, and waited
for the victim to follow.

847
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,360
But if the killer acted on impulse,

848
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,940
why was the attack so brutal?

849
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:03,420
Perhaps the killer didn't act on impulse.

850
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:06,570
It's possible that the person
he intended to kill

851
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:07,630
wasn't the victim.

852
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,970
[Benevolent Heart]

853
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:11,150
Your Highness.

854
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,530
Are you suggesting that

855
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:14,730
the killer's target was Renxin Clinic?

856
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:16,860
That the one they wanted to kill
was our Young Master?

857
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,320
It's just my speculation.

858
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:20,170
The victim's unexpected intervention

859
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:21,780
disrupted the killer's plan,

860
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:22,860
resulting in his brutal murder.

861
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:23,900
That's impossible.

862
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,700
Our Young Master is dedicated
to saving lives and healing people,

863
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,700
providing free medicine and treatment
to the locals.

864
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,780
It's impossible that anyone would

865
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,090
harbor murderous intentions toward him.

866
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:31,550
Until we catch the killer,

867
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,000
we must consider all possibilities.

868
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,610
But no matter what,

869
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:37,220
the victim was just a young man.

870
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,100
In the dead of night, seeing someone
acting suspiciously,

871
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,100
why would he dare to approach alone?

872
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:43,530
Song was kind-hearted and sincere.

873
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:46,020
He had long seen Young Master
as his savior.

874
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,170
If he had discovered that
the killer's target

875
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:49,530
was Renxin Clinic,

876
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:51,060
no matter how scared he was,

877
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,790
he would still have followed them.

878
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:54,320
If my concerns are correct,

879
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:57,400
our top priority now is
to protect Young Master Sun.

880
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,420
My Black Armor Guards won't arrive
for another few hours.

881
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,350
Constable Song.

882
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:03,750
I'll leave the safety of Renxin Clinic
in your hands for now.

883
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:05,350
At Your Highness's command.

884
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:06,340
Go now.

885
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:06,900
To Renxin Clinic.
