1
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,476
Please don't come any closer.

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,602
It looks like blood.

3
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,354
Wait. What is that?

4
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:22,939
What?

5
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:23,898
Sir.

6
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:29,446
God, what kind of blood is this? 
The smell is so pungent.

7
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,281
I don't think it's human.

8
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,284
This is practically a terror attack.

9
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:36,786
Why aren't you with the victim?

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,955
The victim asked us

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,125
to contact Detective Jin Dae-su 
in Namil Police Station.

12
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,877
-Namil Police Station? 
-Yes.

13
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,714
Please contact Detective Jin Dae-su 
in Namil Police Station.

14
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,300
My husband died a few days ago.

15
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:53,803
I'd like to talk to him 
as this seems related to that case.

16
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:13,948
Security footage shows you 
visiting her apartment around 10:40 p.m.

17
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,500
Why were you at Ms. Yoon's residence?

18
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,422
I did go to my sister's place,

19
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,758
but…

20
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,885
So you were there.

21
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,971
You terrorized her with blood, right?

22
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:39,849
Terrorized?

23
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,437
I went there to make 
a talisman for my sister.

24
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,481
I'm sorry?

25
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,691
A samjaebu talisman to ward off disasters.

26
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,611
That was chicken blood.

27
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,198
Chicken blood is good 
for driving away evil spirits.

28
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:01,871
A lot of bad things have been happening 
to my sister lately.

29
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,209
That means she's surrounded 
by evil spirits.

30
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,378
Evil spirits?

31
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,134
We're questioning 
Mr. Kim Young-ho right now.

32
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:17,637
He's claiming that 
it's a talisman to ward off bad spirits.

33
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,181
And you seriously believe that?

34
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,058
I understand.

35
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,603
That's why we asked an expert 
on Korean shamanism.

36
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:29,065
They gave us a similar explanation. 
This talisman is called samjaebu--

37
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,360
I don't even know 
who murdered my husband or how.

38
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:36,489
How can you just accept 
that he drew a talisman on my front door?

39
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:41,077
Well, Mr. Kim confessed right away, 
and he seems to be sorry for what he did.

40
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,664
I don't think he had any intention 
of harming or scaring you.

41
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,750
Well, it felt threatening enough to me.

42
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:51,880
Who knows what he'll do to me next? 
Will you take the blame when that happens?

43
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:57,385
Well, we can't exactly arrest him 
over this incident.

44
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:03,683
How about filing a complaint 
for property damage?

45
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,768
We can help you with that.

46
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,273
Are you a shaman, Mr. Kim?

47
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,281
Well, I'm not divinely possessed.

48
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:23,745
But I used to help at a shaman's house, 
so I know all about it.

49
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:27,123
If you wanted to give her a talisman, 
you could've given her a paper one.

50
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:31,127
You can't just smear chicken blood 
on someone else's front door, okay?

51
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:35,381
She was already living in fear 
after her husband's murder.

52
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,010
Didn't you ever think 
that would scare her even more?

53
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,684
You're right.

54
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,812
I didn't think of that.

55
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:51,940
What should I do?

56
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,902
I didn't mean to scare her.

57
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,617
-I'm sure that guy is the killer. 
-Sorry?

58
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:07,121
I was given the family burial ground, 
then my husband died.

59
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,873
Isn't it obvious?

60
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,875
He is after the inheritance,

61
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,379
so he's killing people one by one 
like a lunatic.

62
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:19,050
Ms. Yoon, I've already told you, 
Mr. Kim has a solid alibi.

63
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,511
There's nothing unusual 
about the people around him.

64
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,013
This is his recent call history.

65
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,183
We didn't find 
anything out of the ordinary.

66
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,356
My father had a hunting rifle.

67
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,025
A gun?

68
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:40,863
I remember him cleaning a hunting rifle 
when I was little.

69
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,950
How old were you then?

70
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,285
Six years old, no…

71
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,203
Maybe seven?

72
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,330
That makes it about 30 years ago.

73
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,416
Are you certain about this?

74
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,459
So that gun…

75
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,139
Why? What's the matter?

76
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,976
An empty shell was found 
next to your husband's body.

77
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,811
We discovered that

78
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,731
it was manufactured 30 years ago.

79
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,578
When you were living with your father,

80
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,581
did you ever see his hunting rifle?

81
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:45,470
Ms. Yoon said she saw him 
with a hunting rifle when she was young.

82
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,973
And since you lived with him 
for a long time,

83
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,768
you must have seen it too.

84
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,320
Wake up, Mr. Kim. Did you see it or not?

85
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:04,906
I saw no such thing.

86
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,619
Do you think I killed my brother-in-law?

87
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,871
I never said anything like that.

88
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,874
Why would I kill my brother-in-law?

89
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:19,379
Are you saying I killed a family member 
so I could take the inheritance?

90
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,467
Tell me, am I in debt? 
Am I being chased by loan sharks?

91
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:32,934
See if you can find that gun in my house 
if you don't believe me.

92
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,437
THE BEQUEATHED

93
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,787
-Did you see how that bastard reacted? 
-Yes.

94
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,040
He knows about the rifle for sure.

95
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,461
Jung-hyun, start tailing that guy.

96
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,129
Yes, sir.

97
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,499
Sis.

98
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,001
Sis.

99
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,517
Mr. Kim?

100
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,936
Can we talk for a sec?

101
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,117
Kim Young-ho.

102
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,452
Yoon Seo-ha.

103
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,121
Why are your surnames different?

104
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,208
Your father is a Yoon. 
Where did you get your name?

105
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,754
I hope my sister doesn't suspect me.

106
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,550
She may suspect you

107
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,219
if you're not forthcoming.

108
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,643
The children's home director named me.

109
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,395
Oh, the children's home?

110
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,482
Did you live with your father 
after you left that place?

111
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,859
What about your mother?

112
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,111
I don't know about Mom.

113
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,780
Your father never told you about her?

114
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:38,411
When your father died, 
he was still married to Ms. Lee Suk-ja.

115
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,163
Ms. Yoon Seo-ha's mother.

116
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,167
Did you know 
that your father had another family?

117
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:47,920
Yes.

118
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,840
He sometimes said that he missed Seo-ha.

119
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:57,763
So, even though he dearly missed Ms. Yoon, 
he chose to live with you.

120
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,893
Then why didn't he include you 
in the family register?

121
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,729
You were his precious son.

122
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,193
Is it that important 
to have my father's surname?

123
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,531
Even without it, 
I'm still a part of my father's family.

124
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,203
Did you hear about the burial ground 
from your father?

125
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:23,789
Yes.

126
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,209
My father should have inherited it.

127
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:31,297
It was meant to be passed down to him, 
but Uncle Myung-gil took it.

128
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,549
I also have a right to that burial ground!

129
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,969
I'm telling the truth. 
Father kept telling me that.

130
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:38,929
Right.

131
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,099
You have the right 
as the eldest son's child.

132
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:48,689
By the way, 
where did you learn to make talismans?

133
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,025
Your drawing skill is quite something.

134
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,569
A Buddhist temple.

135
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,240
I was a divine disciple 
under a monk a long time ago.

136
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,118
Oh, you learned it from a monk!

137
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,371
I didn't know monks made divine disciples.

138
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,081
What does it matter to you?

139
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,292
It doesn't matter at all.

140
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,378
Good talk.

141
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,516
SAVE RECORDING - KIM YOUNG-HO

142
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,518
A monk who practices shamanism?

143
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,936
SHAMAN MONK

144
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,291
Come out! You evil spirit, come out!

145
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,211
-Come out here! 
-Fuck!

146
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:55,089
-Come out, you evil spirit! 
-I'm not possessed!

147
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,758
Fucking hell! There's no evil spirit!

148
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,138
Fuck! Let me go!

149
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,932
-Boy, you are demented! 
-Get off!

150
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,183
Fuck!

151
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,561
Piss off!

152
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,524
The spirit is infuriated!

153
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,360
Your family is done for!

154
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:27,997
Myung-ho!

155
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,707
You can't do this to your father!

156
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,916
Put that sword down.

157
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,001
Put it down!

158
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,753
Don't fuckin' get in my way!

159
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,713
-Please! 
-Honey!

160
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,592
Myung-ho! Please stop this!

161
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,636
In front of Seo-ha? Aren't you ashamed?

162
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,686
Shit!

163
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,449
Daddy!

164
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,158
What?

165
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,244
DEMOCRATIZATION AND MINJUNG ART 
PROF. KIM CHANG-SEOK

166
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,423
Professor. It's me, Seo-ha.

167
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,551
I'm at the campus,

168
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,595
but your books are all outside 
for some reason.

169
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,638
Hey, Yoon!

170
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:11,308
You told me to write that book, 
and now it's gotten me in a pickle!

171
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,811
Pardon? What do you mean, Professor?

172
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:17,064
The school website is blowing up right now 
about how you wrote my book!

173
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,567
We can get into big trouble 
for ghostwriting nowadays!

174
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,484
What?

175
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,404
I told you to watch it. 
Who the heck did you tell about this?

176
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,282
-Wait-- 
-Do you know who I'm about to meet?

177
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,033
The principal of the college!

178
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,036
Shit, this is making me nuts. 
Don't bother me!

179
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,539
No, wait, Professor!

180
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,756
KYUNGSIN UNIVERSITY

181
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,175
KYUNGSIN AGORA

182
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,680
OPEN FORUM 
HEAR, PROFESSOR K IN DEPARTMENT C!

183
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,724
YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW BETTER

184
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,851
GHOSTWRITING, SERIOUSLY? 
(FEAT. INSTRUCTOR Y)

185
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,900
HE PROMISED TO MAKE HER FULL-TIME

186
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,067
GUESS HE LIED

187
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,153
I HEARD THE NEW H PROF EXPOSED IT

188
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,487
SO DID I. IS IT TRUE?

189
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,171
THE STAR OF FINE ARTS 
PROFESSOR HAN NA-RAE

190
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,089
You.

191
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,927
You can leave it there.

192
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,430
Han Na-rae. It was you, wasn't it?

193
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,641
What are you on about?

194
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,727
You're the one who posted 
that I was the ghostwriter

195
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,105
of Professor Kim Chang-seok's book 
on the school website!

196
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,150
So, you did ghostwrite it?

197
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,444
It's interesting that you brought it up.

198
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,112
I thought you wrote that post.

199
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,781
What?

200
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,410
I thought it had to be you.

201
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:56,038
You felt it was unfair. 
Isn't that why you exposed it?

202
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,332
Do you think I'm crazy? 
Why would I do that?

203
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:01,085
Because even ghostwriting 
couldn't make you full-time.

204
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,212
I thought you did it 
because you felt wronged.

205
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,298
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

206
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,344
You can just say no.

207
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,305
But hey, it really wasn't me.

208
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,308
What would I have to gain from it?

209
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:22,815
I get you're in a tough spot right now, 
but please try to use your head.

210
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,568
What did you say?

211
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,072
Use my head?

212
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,908
I have to get to class now.

213
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,744
Let's talk again 
at the faculty dinner tomorrow.

214
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:41,250
NAMIL POLICE STATION

215
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,836
A samjaebu talisman to ward off disasters.

216
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,588
That was chicken blood.

217
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,510
Chicken blood is good 
for driving away evil spirits.

218
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,638
A lot of bad things have been happening--

219
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,934
A fake shaman gaslighted a woman 
and tried to get her

220
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,353
to murder her own mother for money.

221
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,022
We see this as an instigation.

222
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:06,108
But is it actually possible 
for a shaman to gaslight a daughter

223
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,943
to kill her very own mother?

224
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,445
Well, it's definitely possible.

225
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:14,366
Because in the daughter's eyes, 
that fake shaman is an absolute being.

226
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,537
For her, following the shaman's words 
is like following the will of God.

227
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,749
When the shaman ordered her 
to eliminate her mother,

228
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,418
she believed 
it was the will of the divine.

229
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:28,005
Cases of shamans gaslighting people 
are quite common.

230
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,923
The one reason why this is toxic…

231
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:30,924
ACTUAL CRIME SCENE

232
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:35,054
…is that the victims don't even realize 
that they are being gaslighted.

233
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:39,683
We should be on guard 
against gaslighting within a religion.

234
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:43,937
It's a bit different 
from other kinds of gaslighting.

235
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,856
It is very serious and…

236
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,957
Yes. I'm here to meet her now.

237
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:04,958
Sure.

238
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:09,713
I'll persuade her so you can sell 
the building as quickly as possible.

239
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:13,592
Hey, what if that woman goes around 
asking about the market price?

240
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,012
That lady knows nothing 
about the market or anything else.

241
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:17,930
Is that right?

242
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,640
I told the real estate agencies

243
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,601
not to say anything 
about your building to anyone.

244
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:26,021
I'm serious. That woman is my only chance!

245
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,358
Unless I can palm it off on her, 
the building will go up for auction.

246
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,693
Hey, this is really my last shot.

247
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,029
My daughter's wedding depends on this!

248
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:38,700
Don't worry. 
She's in a bit of a mess right now.

249
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,369
She's completely out of it.

250
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,831
Why else would she have asked a detective 
to meet her at her workplace?

251
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,624
Just be patient.

252
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:49,044
Hong-sik, just hurry up. 
I'm in a real rush, man!

253
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:53,465
Bro, my daughter keeps calling me, 
to ask if I'm looking for a clinic!

254
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,259
All right! God.

255
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,177
Hey, she's here now.

256
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,389
I'll talk with her and call you back.

257
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,057
Yes, bye for now.

258
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,476
Ma'am!

259
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,061
Hello.

260
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,896
-Hi. 
-Let's talk in the car.

261
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:14,862
It's nice to look around a college campus 
thanks to you, ma'am.

262
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,948
I've been dealing with a lot.

263
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:20,284
This spot has the least foot traffic.

264
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,244
What did you find out?

265
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:27,332
From what I found out, this guy lived 
with your father for a long time.

266
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,334
For a long time?

267
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,004
The whole time after your father left you.

268
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,340
But this guy is a complete scoundrel.

269
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,927
He's been cooking up a cunning plan 
to take the ground all for himself.

270
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,431
The lawyer said that having evidence 
of living together with his father

271
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,350
would work in his favor 
to help him take over the ground.

272
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,980
So, where does 
our investigation go from here?

273
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:53,066
Well, first, we need to gather 
any relevant evidence

274
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:57,654
and find out what Kim's been up to 
so we can build a solid case.

275
00:19:58,906 --> 00:19:59,990
How about this?

276
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:04,620
"My father once had a hunting rifle."

277
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:09,208
"My husband was killed with a gun, 
and the shell was made 30 years ago."

278
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,754
I know for sure 
that the bastard has my father's gun.

279
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,839
If we can find it, we can end him.

280
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,090
Yes, you're right.

281
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,384
What could be better proof than that?

282
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,762
I'll take a good look around.

283
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,765
Securing evidence 
is the most important thing right now.

284
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:25,974
-Yes. 
-Ma'am.

285
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,643
I'll leave it to you, Mr. Kang.

286
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,853
You know I'm an expert in this field.

287
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,105
There's no need to stress.

288
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,565
And,

289
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:39,238
how are things going with the building 
I mentioned to you before?

290
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,906
My friend keeps calling me.

291
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,326
I haven't had a chance 
to think about it properly.

292
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,746
I just can't make any decisions 
before the burial ground issue is settled.

293
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:52,501
Well, then, I'll take care of it quickly 
so you'll have time to think about it.

294
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,962
Just wait a bit longer.

295
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,172
Okay.

296
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,929
Thank you for coming all this way.

297
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:07,349
I'd love to treat you to a meal, 
but I have a prior engagement today.

298
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,768
You can treat me to a meal 
once this is all done.

299
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:14,648
I'll give you a bonus when things go well 
with the building and the burial ground.

300
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,694
Please take care of this for me. 
You're the only one I can trust.

301
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:22,364
Gosh, don't worry. 
I'll be in touch with some good news soon.

302
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,283
Thank you.

303
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:35,419
Hello, Ms. Yoon.

304
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,131
Oh, yes.

305
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:40,674
Hello.

306
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,676
Can we talk for a bit?

307
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,188
KIM YOUNG-HO'S ADDRESS 
IT'S NEAR WHERE YANG JAE-SEOK DIED

308
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:02,821
Why are you here?

309
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,365
Did you find evidence 
that Kim's the killer?

310
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,910
Evidence? We're working on that.

311
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,375
You seem busy. Let's talk while we walk.

312
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:17,419
Sure.

313
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:22,132
I'm not sure if you remember 
because you were so young,

314
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,719
but how old were you 
when your father left home?

315
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,472
I already answered all this.

316
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,307
I was seven.

317
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,060
It was right after the spring picnic 
at my kindergarten.

318
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,645
Do you know why your father left?

319
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:39,399
I'm curious about that too. 
He's probably the only one who knows.

320
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:44,071
Was your father a member 
of a shamanistic cult at that time?

321
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:45,906
No way.

322
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:53,246
Detective, this case is 
about Kim Young-ho killing my husband.

323
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,083
Shouldn't you be chasing him 
instead of bothering me?

324
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:59,753
He's currently under investigation. 
That's why I have questions for you.

325
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:04,633
According to Mr. Kim, 
your father used to talk about you often.

326
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:10,514
Based on what he said, 
your father seemed quite affectionate.

327
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,933
What kind of person was he?

328
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:17,062
I remember him 
as an ordinary breadwinner of a family

329
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:20,982
who then left for no reason at all. 
That's all he was.

330
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:22,943
Affectionate?

331
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,862
You never truly know someone.

332
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,698
How they act at home 
cannot be seen from outside.

333
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,245
So, you don't have 
any good memories of your father?

334
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:37,124
Do you happen to have children?

335
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,209
Yes.

336
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,128
Then you ought to know.

337
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:48,176
Not all fathers are remembered 
by their children as a good person.

338
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,388
I guess the same applies 
the other way around.

339
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,768
Yes, you're right. 
I don't have good memories of my father.

340
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,938
I don't care where he lived 
and who he lived with.

341
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,857
I don't want to hear about it.

342
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,192
It makes me uncomfortable.

343
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,570
Does that answer your question?

344
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,030
I have plans, so excuse me.

345
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,337
Yes, sir.

346
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,756
Yes, I'm still watching him.

347
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,342
No, nothing unusual.

348
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:14,262
Keep a close eye on him. 
If something happens, let me know.

349
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,014
Yes, sir. I'll be in touch.

350
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,479
Damn, I guess I'm not going home.

351
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,151
What's going on?

352
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,041
What? What did they give him?

353
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,803
I gotta go to the bathroom.

354
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,137
Yes, sir. Go ahead.

355
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:06,898
Ms. Yoon.

356
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:08,608
Professor.

357
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:13,321
-Sit here for a while. 
-Oh my. You seem quite drunk.

358
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,865
Ms. Yoon,

359
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,451
I can't believe what's happening.

360
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,037
Did you really do that?

361
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,125
No, it really wasn't me, Professor. 
I'm innocent.

362
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,376
Right?

363
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,837
You would never do that to me.

364
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:30,547
I know.

365
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:34,593
I…

366
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,304
I believe you.

367
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,973
Who on earth would write such a post?

368
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,975
Just wait 'til I catch them.

369
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:51,067
It must be hard, losing your husband 
when you're still so young.

370
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:52,986
Oh dear.

371
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,197
Ms. Yoon, if you're having a hard time,

372
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,199
you can always talk to me.

373
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,952
You know I care about you a lot, 
don't you?

374
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,174
Oh, Professor Han.

375
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,384
Yes.

376
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,971
I'll be inside.

377
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:21,681
Okay.

378
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,232
Ms. Yoon, what was that just now?

379
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,985
I didn't know you were 
in such a relationship with him.

380
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:35,820
What?

381
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,657
I mean, that must be 
why he let you write his book.

382
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,494
Just shut your mouth, okay?

383
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,663
What, getting all riled up again?

384
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,039
I was just kidding.

385
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,416
But hey,

386
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,503
do you think 
you can keep working at our school?

387
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:56,257
Even the students know 
that you ghostwrote for him.

388
00:27:56,925 --> 00:28:02,013
I even heard some freshmen saying 
that you are Professor Kim's mistress.

389
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:04,516
Hey.

390
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:08,269
You should really cut it out, okay?

391
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,270
Excuse me?

392
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:13,525
I'm just worried that your name 
might get dragged through the mud.

393
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,194
Why don't you just quit the school?

394
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:20,949
Leaving the school at this point 
would be a much better option for you.

395
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,703
I really feel sorry for you.

396
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,094
Hey!

397
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,681
Ms. Yoon! What are you doing?

398
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,185
Shut up, all of you!

399
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:03,241
I've just met you today

400
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,411
But you're my one true love

401
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,671
I have to find something here

402
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,759
so that woman buys the building, 
and I get my pockets filled.

403
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:24,679
You have reached your destination. 
Ending navigation.

404
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:50,288
Damn. Just my luck.

405
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:58,046
Anyone home?

406
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,148
What's this?

407
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,090
All these talismans…

408
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,599
You scared me, you little shit.

409
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,310
Shoo! Get lost.

410
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,357
What's that there?

411
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,528
Stop it!

412
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,246
Damn it.

413
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,038
What's that smell?

414
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:22,482
For real?

415
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,628
I knew it.

416
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,607
SKY, WIND, STARS, AND POEM

417
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,693

00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:11,531

419
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,517

There she is.

426
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,366
A monk doing shaman's work.

427
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:53,091
It doesn't look like 
this prick is living by himself.

428
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:23,913

A samjaebu talisman? Yeah, right.

432
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,428
Shit.

433
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:22,763
What was that?

434
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,395
Shit.

435
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,528
Damn it.

436
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:46,829
A pot?

437
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,767
Fuck, my leg!

438
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,229
You shot me!

439
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,981
Hey, you shot my fuckin' leg!

440
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,943
You crazy bastard!

441
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,820
Hey, wait!

442
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,365
Help!
