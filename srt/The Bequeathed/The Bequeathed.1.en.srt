1
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,937
Damn it.

2
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,605
Those bastards.

3
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,775
Hey, you know who I am?

4
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:32,198
You fuckers.

5
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:34,451
Shit.

6
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,995
THE BEQUEATHED

7
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,298
Hello.

8
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,550
Hello.

9
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,468
-Is that the last one? 
-Yes.

10
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,970
Put them down neatly.

11
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,567
Good job. 
Get yourselves something to drink.

12
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,068
Okay.

13
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,743
DEMOCRATIZATION AND KOREAN MINJUNG ART

14
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,624
Hello, sir.

15
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,544
Hey, what's all this?

16
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,592
Well, Professor,

17
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,510
your book is out.

18
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,428
Book?

19
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,641
So this is it.

20
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:07,145
They could've photoshopped 
the gray hairs at least.

21
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:10,064
"Korean Minjung art as read 
by Professor Kim Chang-seok,

22
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,608
the intellect of this age."

23
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,610
It sounds great.

24
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,862
Intellect? That's an overstatement.

25
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,655
Anyway,

26
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,575
good job writing the book, Ms. Yoon.

27
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:23,536
But I didn't write the book, sir.

28
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,457
All I did was organize 
the things you usually said.

29
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,627
Look, it says here, 
"Written by Kim Chang-seok."

30
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,422
Sure. Anyway, well done.

31
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,800
What would I do without you?

32
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,928
Please keep taking care of things, okay?

33
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,639
Yes, of course. Just say the word, sir.

34
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,225
I'd love to continue to assist you,

35
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,560
so it'd be great if you could help me.

36
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:49,979
Sure.

37
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,815
-You can go now. 
-Yes, sir.

38
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,653
Oh, Ms. Yoon.

39
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,030
-Yes? 
-Wait a minute.

40
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,715
TO YOON SEO-HA 
A PLUM BLOSSOM IN MY EYES

41
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,926
Professor. Thank you so much.

42
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:21,803
Go on now.

43
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:25,223
Okay, sir. I'll leave you to it.

44
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,202
KANG HONG-SIK, DETECTIVE AGENCY

45
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,869
MA'AM, I TOOK PICTURES 
OF YOUR HUSBAND ENTERING THE MOTEL

46
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:28,870
SHOULD I CONTINUE?

47
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:41,674
NO, THAT'S ENOUGH FOR TODAY

48
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,141
Hello?

49
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,185
This is Namil Police Station.

50
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,479
Am I speaking to Ms. Yoon Seo-ha?

51
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,814
Yes, but why would the police…

52
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,734
We're calling because Mr. Yoon Myung-gil 
has passed away.

53
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:04,072
Please come to the station when you can 
to proceed with the body collection.

54
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,239
Yoon who?

55
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,117
Don't you know Mr. Yoon Myung-gil?

56
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,703
He's your paternal uncle.

57
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,121
Uncle?

58
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,041
Are you telling me that I had an uncle?

59
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,836
Yoon Myung-gil, 75 years old.

60
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,673
A makgeolli bottle was next to his body, 
and thallium was found inside it.

61
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,133
What's thallium?

62
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,718
It's a poisonous substance.

63
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,222
They detected a small amount 
but not enough to be lethal.

64
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:32,975
Is thallium a common component 
in regular makgeolli?

65
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:33,893
It's not, sir.

66
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,898
Then we have reason to believe 
this may be a homicide.

67
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:42,527
Well, we'll need to wait 
for the autopsy results to find out.

68
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,827
Where is Sung-jun?

69
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,685
Excuse me.

70
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,479
I'm from the police.

71
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,555
Jesus Christ.

72
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,812
Damn dog. Be quiet.

73
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,646
PESTICIDE

74
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:57,203
YEONUNSAN AREA, JINSEONG-RI 
JOINT CONSENT FOR GOLF COURSE CONSTRUCTION

75
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,753
Who's there?

76
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,718
Hello. I'm a police officer.

77
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,638
Police? What brings the police here?

78
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:20,184
But who are you, ma'am? 
I heard that Mr. Yoon lived alone.

79
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,478
I'm a local resident.

80
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,565
Are you close with Mr. Yoon?

81
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,401
Well, he's just a neighborhood friend.

82
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:34,699
It seems Mr. Yoon has no family. 
How long has he been living on his own?

83
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:39,036
Well, he's been alone for a long time.

84
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,455
Oh, he had an older brother.

85
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,375
A crazy guy, but I heard he died.

86
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,670
I see.

87
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,881
Did Myung-gil do something wrong?

88
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:51,966
What's going on?

89
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,969
No, well, he didn't do anything wrong.

90
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,017
What's all that?

91
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,308
I see you're already here, sir.

92
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,903
Forensics, check for signs of intruders 
and secure all fingerprints.

93
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,279
-Yes, sir. 
-Dong-su.

94
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,991
See if you can find any white powder 
that looks like thallium.

95
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,661
-Hey, hurry up. 
-Can someone get over here?

96
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:05,581
-Hey, be careful with that. 
-What in the world is going on?

97
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,791
Help me move this stuff!

98
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:10,294
Mun-ho, see if you can find 
makgeolli bottles here first.

99
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,337
Yes, sir.

100
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,005
Look in the back too.

101
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,090
Sung-jun.

102
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,343
Who said you could come here first?

103
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,847
We're not even sure 
if Mr. Yoon was murdered or not.

104
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:27,019
Murdered? 
Did you say Myung-gil was murdered?

105
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,855
No, it's not confirmed. 
We need to investigate.

106
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,357
Go on. Escort the lady.

107
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,443
-Ma'am, how about we talk outside? 
-Let's go, ma'am.

108
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,028
Answer me, will you?

109
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,948
Who told you to come here?

110
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,159
I was just trying to be quick, that's all.

111
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,786
Be quick for what?

112
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,791
All right. 
Next time, I'll report to you first.

113
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:49,709
What is it?

114
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:54,088
You don't like taking orders from a guy 
who used to be lower in the ranks?

115
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:58,008
Or are you just desperate for a promotion 
like in the old days?

116
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,513
Gosh, why is my dear boss 
in such a foul mood today?

117
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,351
You can quit if you don't like it.

118
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,187
Just quit and relax at home,

119
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,982
instead of taking shit from your junior.

120
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,361
I won't let you down, sir.

121
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,738
And the autopsy results?

122
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,073
Call the National Forensic Service.

123
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,547
Honey, I'm back.

124
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,760
What's this? The book is out.

125
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,512
Let's take a look.

126
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,641
Professor Kim, 
I hate how this asshole looks.

127
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,394
What? "Plum blossom"?

128
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,189
Screw you, fucking sleazeball.

129
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,609
How do people put up with this guy?

130
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,945
So, what did that asshole say?

131
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,699
Is he gonna make you a full-time employee? 
Is that even possible?

132
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,452
Going somewhere?

133
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,997
You should get changed too.

134
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,541
What? Why?

135
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,669
Apparently, Uncle passed away.

136
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,963
I don't have an uncle.

137
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,509
Your late mother had no siblings either. 
So, what uncle?

138
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,137
I guess my dad had a younger brother.

139
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:30,142
He passed away, so I have to collect 
his body from the police station and all.

140
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,477
Your dad?

141
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,980
You mean the dad who abandoned you 
when you were seven?

142
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,817
But he never even called you. 
Wasn't he dead?

143
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,235
I don't know.

144
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,321
Just go and get changed. We have to leave.

145
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,491
Yes, ma'am.

146
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,327
Uncle?

147
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,510
Hey, about that uncle of yours,

148
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,012
I hope he didn't leave any debt.

149
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,056
Man.

150
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,977
Holding a funeral for the brother 
of your estranged father?

151
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,688
I guess blood is thicker than water.

152
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,826
HYESEONG HOSPITAL

153
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,915
Man, that's gross.

154
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:39,128
This is your uncle, Mr. Yoon Myung-gil. 
Do you recognize him?

155
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:45,551
I already mentioned over the phone 
that I basically cut ties with my father.

156
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,761
I didn't even attend his funeral.

157
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:51,640
Of course, I had no idea 
he had a younger brother.

158
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,311
We'll have to wait 
for the autopsy results,

159
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:59,064
but a small amount of thallium was found 
in a makgeolli bottle next to the body.

160
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,401
So we're not dismissing 
the possibility of a homicide.

161
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:08,490
Again, whether he was murdered or not, 
he had nothing to do with us.

162
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,076
Even so, you are his only blood relative.

163
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,414
As my wife said, 
this person has nothing to do with her.

164
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,000
What is the meaning of this?

165
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:22,755
Then,

166
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,133
you can ask to disclaim your inheritance.

167
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:29,678
Inheritance?

168
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,016
What's he on about?

169
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,645
Mr. Yoon left behind 
a family burial ground.

170
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:43,317
As of now, you two 
are the only inheritors of that property.

171
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,945
What?

172
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:05,839
What do you think?

173
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,552
Well, there's nothing off about them.

174
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,013
It seems they really didn't keep in touch.

175
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,147
-It's freezing! 
-Cold!

176
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:26,735
-Hey. 
-Yeah?

177
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,195
That old man finally died.

178
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,698
Yeah, he was so stubborn.

179
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,324
Your folks must be happy too.

180
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,743
They wanted to run a store 
in the chief's building.

181
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,744
Yeah, I know.

182
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:39,999
What if your mom asks you to help 
at her store after you graduate?

183
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:43,460
Hell no! I'm going to leave this village, 
no matter what.

184
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,503
The bus is here.

185
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:48,298
What's wrong with this place? 
It's gonna get busy with people now.

186
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,300
-Nah. 
-It'll be more fun than it is now.

187
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,552
No way.

188
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:52,469
Hurry up!

189
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,138
-Hi! 
-Hello!

190
00:16:57,307 --> 00:17:00,561
VILLAGE CHIEF'S BUILDING 
(SHOP LEASE BY FEMALE STUDENT'S PARENTS)

191
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:06,984
Family burial ground?

192
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,862
Burial ground?

193
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,533
Well, at least 
he didn't leave any debt behind.

194
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:19,955
But it's just a plot in the countryside. 
How much could it be worth?

195
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,291
Maybe 100 or 200 million won?

196
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,461
How should we deal with the funeral?

197
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,963
Contact a funeral company?

198
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,632
We should, right?

199
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,470
But what if we get bombed 
with the inheritance tax?

200
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,971
Ms. Yoon Seo-ha?

201
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,725
Yes. Who are you?

202
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,810
It is you, isn't it?

203
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,731
Yes, I can see the resemblance 
between you and Myung-gil.

204
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,567
I'm the village chief of Jinseong-ri

205
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,445
where Myung-gil lived.

206
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,322
Oh, I see.

207
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:57,117
I heard you will be dealing 
with Myung-gil's body and his funeral,

208
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:01,705
so I asked the police about you 
and came to meet you.

209
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,123
For what reason?

210
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,709
Well,

211
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,880
Myung-gil was very close 
with the people in the village, you know?

212
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:14,760
You'll need to make a lot of calls 
and whatnot to hold his funeral.

213
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:19,181
But since you and your uncle 
didn't keep in touch,

214
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:23,060
I thought you might be a bit overwhelmed, 
so I came to help out.

215
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,771
This is great.

216
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,857
In fact, we were just wondering 
what to do.

217
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,694
Oh dear.

218
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,907
He was such a kind neighbor. 
I can't believe he passed away like…

219
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,246
Those damned bastards!

220
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:45,958
They said that only his immediate family 
was allowed to collect the body.

221
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:51,296
But the truth is, the people 
in our village were his real family.

222
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:52,798
You know?

223
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:59,304
Anyway, we've already prepared the funeral 
at the Jinseong-ri Village Hall.

224
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,390
So, as his immediate family,

225
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:05,686
all you need to do 
is sign your name at the morgue.

226
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,991
What are you doing?

227
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,492
-What? 
-What?

228
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,245
You're peeling the perilla leaves for her.

229
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,748
I like them, too, 
but I don't see you peeling them for me.

230
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,584
This is a very sensitive topic.

231
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:30,752
Detective Choi!

232
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,632
You're doing a good job.

233
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,092
Everything okay?

234
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,678
Yes, the forensics team did 
a sweep of the area.

235
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:44,099
I just stopped by to take a look. 
Don't mind me.

236
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,895
Get back in and rest. It's cold.

237
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,272
Yes, sir.

238
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,409
Hello, residents of Jinseong-ri.

239
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,995
This is your chief, Yuk Sung-soo.

240
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,165
I am sad to announce that our neighbor,

241
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,835
Mr. Yoon Myung-gil, has passed away.

242
00:20:53,919 --> 00:21:00,175
His funeral will be held 
at Jinseong-ri Village Hall.

243
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,427
If you have time…

244
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,430
Yes, please do your best to attend

245
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:10,310
so that we can bid farewell 
to our neighbor,

246
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,187
Myung-gil, okay?

247
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,689
What's that nice smell?

248
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,320
JINSEONG-RI VILLAGE HALL

249
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,740
CONDOLENCES 
MAY THE DECEASED REST IN PEACE

250
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,909
The kids are just excited.

251
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,245
Bring me some dongtaejeon here.

252
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,176
I feel great, so let's drink all night!

253
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,845
My goodness, you're here!

254
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,559
Good work.

255
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,894
Have a nice cold drink!

256
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,398
-Here. 
-Come here, quick!

257
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,816
Pour me a drink, then.

258
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,723
I'm Detective Choi Sung-jun 
from Namil Police Station.

259
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,309
I see.

260
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,228
My condolences to you.

261
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,532
CONDOLENCE BOX

262
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,538
Well done, you.

263
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:34,913
Jae-seok.

264
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:36,957
Oh my!

265
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,751
-What are you doing? 
-My sister.

266
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,754
What? Let me go, and please calm down.

267
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:43,672
Sis.

268
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:47,843
My name is Young-ho. 
I'm your younger brother.

269
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:51,012
-What are you talking about? Let go! 
-What's the matter?

270
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:57,144
I'm your brother. Your half-brother.

271
00:23:57,227 --> 00:24:00,605
Your father brought me into this world!

272
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,858
What are you saying? Let go!

273
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,860
-We finally meet. 
-What are you doing?

274
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,778
-You're looking nice. 
-Let go of her.

275
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:10,240
Look how miserable I am on the other hand!

276
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,324
Excuse me!

277
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,041
What, you don't believe me? 
Because I look awful?

278
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,085
Do a DNA test.

279
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,838
-This is a sacred funeral hall. 
-I really am your brother!

280
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,840
-Stop it! 
-Check my DNA!

281
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,635
I'm her younger brother!

282
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:34,347
I have just as much of a right 
to my uncle's burial ground as she does!

283
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:59,581
The cause of Yoon Myung-gil's death 
was a lethal dose of thallium,

284
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,542
the substance detected 
in this makgeolli bottle.

285
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,462
At Yoon's house, 
a significant amount of thallium…

286
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:06,630
ANGINA MEDICATION PRESCRIBED

287
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:10,008
…was also found in his prescription drugs 
and commonly used items.

288
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:13,094
He likely died 
without even knowing he was poisoned.

289
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,012
Correct.

290
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:17,098
Who on earth would have gone that far?

291
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,975
Did you look into his family?

292
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,560
FAMILY INFORMATION

293
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:24,439
-Yes, seems he had no spouse or children. 
-Sir, take a look at this.

294
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,858
Yoon had an older brother.

295
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:32,155
But Myung-gil had inherited the land 
and had been managing it afterward.

296
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:36,952
Yoon's older brother, Yoon Myung-ho, 
Yoon Seo-ha's father, is deceased.

297
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:40,872
And Yoon Myung-hee, his younger sister, 
also passed away in 1992.

298
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,668
We thought Yoon Seo-ha 
was his only remaining relative,

299
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:47,671
but someone claiming to be her sibling 
has suddenly shown up.

300
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,130
That would be Kim Young-ho.

301
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,925
The one who caused a scene 
at Yoon Myung-gil's funeral.

302
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,263
But are they really half-siblings?

303
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:59,057
We ran a DNA test to check that.

304
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,851
Comparing Yoon Myung-ho's DNA 
from his keepsake

305
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:04,271
and Kim Young-ho's DNA 
showed they are related.

306
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,480
GENETIC SIMILARITY 99.999998%

307
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:09,985
This means that Kim may file a lawsuit 
for his share of the family burial ground.

308
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,468
Hi.

309
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,054
Sweetie, you're back!

310
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,807
Say hello. 
This is the man I told you about.

311
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,601
Is this your kid?

312
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,604
You're pretty, just like your mom.

313
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,409
CONGRATS ON ENTERING SCHOOL 
FROM YOUR FATHER

314
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,629
Seo-ha, sit down for a minute.

315
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:21,765
Seo-ha.

316
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,477
What do you think of that man?

317
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:28,605
What about him?

318
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,483
We might end up living with him.

319
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,611
He's a rich man.

320
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:37,947
Remember the new apartment in the city? 
He lives there.

321
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,033
We will be living there too.

322
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,787
You know we're behind on rent, 
and we used up the deposit.

323
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,915
If we get kicked out of that man's house,

324
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,334
we'll have nowhere to go!

325
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,840
Yoon Seo-ha! Where are you going?

326
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,691
YOON MYUNG-HO

327
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,984
FROM YOON MYUNG-HO 
TO YOON SEO-HA

328
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,487
Yes, that's it!

329
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,905
One, two, three!

330
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:22,242
Imagine you have training wheels. 
Just step on the pedals.

331
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,869
That's right. Way to go, my boy!

332
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,707
You're doing great!

333
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,716
Oh gosh, Young-ho!

334
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,635
Are you all right? 
You're fine. Stop crying.

335
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,722
Daddy will be coming in soon. 
Go wait inside.

336
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,060
There, there. It's okay.

337
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,230
I really am your brother.

338
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:55,984
I have just as much of a right 
to my uncle's burial ground as she does!

339
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,658
It's obvious, isn't it?

340
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:07,162
Half-siblings fighting 
over a family burial ground.

341
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:12,709
First, let's find someone 
who knows about the deceased's family.

342
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:16,463
Check on the biological mothers 
of Kim Young-ho and Yoon Seo-ha too.

343
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,339
Actually, we already checked.

344
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,759
Yoon's birth mother is deceased.

345
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:24,679
Kim was raised by his father, 
so his birth mother is unknown to him.

346
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,764
Is that so?

347
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:29,934
That means only those two have rights 
to the burial ground, right?

348
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:30,935
Yes, sir.

349
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:37,400
Where did Sung-jun run off to this time?

350
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,903
Did he give you any orders?

351
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,947
He asked me to find out 
the village population,

352
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:46,201
the number of nearby gas stations, 
and if the chief owns any buildings,

353
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,327
but I haven't finished.

354
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,579
Why does he keep doing 
these pointless things?

355
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,498
We're too fuckin' busy for this.

356
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,749
Sorry, sir.

357
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:54,959
Hey.

358
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:56,836
Listen carefully.

359
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,673
Don't do any of the stupid things 
Detective Choi asks you to.

360
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,927
Just do what I ask you to properly.

361
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,012
Got that?

362
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:08,431
-Yes, sir. 
-Yes, sir!

363
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,142
For fuck's sake.

JINSEONG-RI GOLF COURSE 
DEVELOPMENT PLAN CONFIRMED!

370
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,402
VILLAGE CHIEF YUK SUNG-SOO

371
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:01,961
Wow, you're here early.

372
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,424
Hello.

373
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,181
Magnificent, isn't it?

374
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:18,436
This tree is over 200 years old.

375
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,189
It's basically the guardian tree 
of our village.

376
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,524
What's the name? A jangseung!

377
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,610
It's like the village guardian.

378
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,492
That's a grave.

379
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,038
Why is it in the middle of a field?

380
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,083
They didn't want to pay for a columbarium,

381
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,293
so they buried the deceased 
next to their house.

382
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:46,214
It's convenient too. 
Many people here do that.

383
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:51,678
It was very wise of you to store

384
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:55,431
Mr. Yoon's ashes in a columbarium.

385
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,184
Oh, thank you for your help with that.

386
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:02,021
It's nothing. 
We should help each other out, you know.

387
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,277
Goodness. There he is.

388
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,030
Over here!

389
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,658
Move it!

390
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,041
Hey!

391
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:26,212
You can't show up late 
when we have an important guest here.

392
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,130
Oh, my bad.

393
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:30,258
Sorry to keep you waiting. 
Are you Ms. Yoon Seo-ha?

394
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,884
-Yes. 
-Nice to meet you.

395
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:35,722
I'm Kim Kwang-soo, the head of development 
at Jijo Construction.

396
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,140
Oh, okay.

397
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,392
What did you want to talk about?

398
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:42,270
I heard that some pesky business 
has sprung up on you.

399
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:47,150
My company is happy to take 
that pesky burial ground off your hands.

400
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:29,252
You've done a great job 
for such a long time, ma'am.

401
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,880
You know exercise always pays off, right?

402
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,758
I'll see you tomorrow at 6 p.m. Take care.

403
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:36,676
Sure.

404
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:39,428
-Goodbye, ma'am. 
-Bye.

405
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,477
Why haven't you been answering my calls?

406
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:49,564
I told you 
Professor Kim's birthday party is today.

407
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,732
We can't be late. 
Get changed so we can go.

408
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:56,571
God, I just don't get why that old geezer 
is having a birthday party.

409
00:35:58,531 --> 00:35:59,699
Okay.

410
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,493
Okay, ma'am.

411
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,425
-This place is nice. 
-I'll say.

412
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,969
-Oh, give me the whiskey. 
-Here.

413
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,764
-How old is this whiskey? 
-What?

414
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,183
Seventeen years old.

415
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,102
I told you to buy a 30-year-old one.

416
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,022
Who buys a 30-year-old whiskey 
for a birthday present?

417
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,940
That's beyond our budget.

418
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,026
You never listen to what I say.

419
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,279
Oh, come on.

420
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,824
Happy Birthday! 
Congratulations, Professor.

421
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,577
I thought we were the only guests.

422
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:48,748
-Hey, Ms. Yoon. 
-Professor, happy birthday.

423
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:51,000
Thanks. You came together? Come in.

424
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:51,918
Sure.

425
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,295
Let's sit.

426
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:59,467
Happy birthday, Professor.

427
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,220
What? A 30-year-old Ballantine's?

428
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:06,557
-Professor, allow me to pour you a glass. 
-Good lord.

429
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:09,685
Thanks to you, 
I get to taste some expensive liquor.

430
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:13,105
Actually, my dad told me 
to give it to you.

431
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:16,442
Really? My, he didn't have to.

432
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:19,362
Oh, right. His blood circulation 
has improved a lot, hasn't it?

433
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,739
Yes, he's feeling a lot better now.

434
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,075
He goes golfing every week.

435
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,993
Now, that's the feisty man I know!

436
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,453
-Let me-- 
-No, I'm driving.

437
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:31,791
Oh, I know it's my birthday today, 
but we're actually here for Professor Han.

438
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,835
She's been appointed 
as a full-time professor.

439
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,546
It's great to celebrate together 
on a day like this.

440
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,801
I haven't told you yet, have I?

441
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:46,347
When Professor Seo retires, 
Professor Han will take over the position.

442
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,600
I invited you all to celebrate today.

443
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:51,894
Let's have a drink!

444
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,396
Congratulations.

445
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,731
Professor Han, congratulations.

446
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:56,816
Thank you.

447
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,282
-Impressive, isn't it? 
-Wow. Indeed.

448
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:07,201
Professor, I'll work really hard. 
You can count on me.

449
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,621
Hey, you don't have to flatter me.

450
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:14,667
-Just think what's best for the students. 
-I will, sir.

451
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,502
I'll be on my way now.

452
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:17,420
Sure.

453
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,812
Aren't you leaving?

454
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,732
I'll leave after I see you off.

455
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:41,027
I feel sorry for you, Ms. Yoon.

456
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:46,991
You know very well 
that I can't do anything without you.

457
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:51,162
You said you wanted my help 
so you can continue assisting me.

458
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:55,791
Now is just not the right time, 
so wait a little longer.

459
00:38:56,375 --> 00:39:00,588
Next time, 
it will be your turn for sure, okay?

460
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,256
-Yes. 
-I should go now.

461
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:03,883
Okay.

462
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,384
All right, let's go.

463
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,100
Goodbye, Prof--

464
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,697
What's this? Has everyone left already?

465
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,201
Wow. Quick as lightning.

466
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,246
Hey, about the professor position…

467
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,666
Damn it.

468
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,253
Let's just not talk about it.

469
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:46,050
NAMIL POLICE STATION

470
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,179
Are you the husband?

471
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,398
Dad.

472
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,604
YOON MYUNG-GIL CASE REPORT

473
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,024
GOLF COURSE AERIAL VIEW

474
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:11,904
JINSEONG-RI

475
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:14,240
YOON'S BURIAL GROUND 
JIJO GOLF COURSE CONSTRUCTION

476
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,715
Dae-su. Gather everyone in the office now.

477
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:35,594
The gas station 
and the public transportation show

478
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:40,349
that outsiders rarely visit Jinseong-ri, 
and there is hardly any economic activity.

479
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:45,604
But right after Yoon Myung-gil's death, 
the village seemed oddly excited.

480
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,733
People were acting 
as if the place was about to be developed.

481
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,570
Despite this area being less developed,

482
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:56,615
this mountain in Jinseong-ri 
is a prime location for a golf course.

483
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:01,829
The construction company managed 
to acquire most of the land,

484
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,999
except the family burial ground 
owned by Yoon Myung-gil.

485
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:09,044
That's how the golf course development 
was indefinitely suspended.

486
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,213
And this abandoned building.

487
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:14,216
It seems to be a commercial building 
that was supposed to be used

488
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,802
by people visiting the golf course 
after it was built.

489
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:20,514
But it turns out that the construction 
came to a halt due to unpaid debts,

490
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,559
and the construction company 
has been exercising its lien.

491
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:26,979
As Mr. Yoon continued to resist 
selling his burial ground,

492
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:29,773
the construction company 
and its employer grew anxious.

493
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,610
And the owner of that building is…

494
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,403
"Yuk Sung-soo"?

495
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,196
The village chief.

496
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,744
What's more, thallium is hard to come by. 
You can't buy it in small volumes.

497
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:46,457
They hid the thallium in the building, 
disguising it as construction material.

498
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:50,628
Let's move quickly. 
We need to make Yuk Sung-soo squeal.

499
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,254
Yes, sir.

500
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,133
That construction site…

501
00:43:56,634 --> 00:44:00,095
-I'll check there first. 
-I'll go to the village chief's house.

502
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,228
You got pushed aside again.

503
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,606
When will you ever be a full professor?

504
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:15,653
Wow, for the next professor to retire, 
we'll have to wait only ten years.

505
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,365
You tricked me into marriage, 
you know that?

506
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:22,868
When you first came to my yoga studio, 
you told me you were a professor!

507
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:25,829
Professor, my ass. 
An instructor isn't a professor.

508
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,884
Hey, are you nuts? Don't drive like that!

509
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:40,260
Let's get divorced.

510
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:42,888
What? Divorced?

511
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,391
I must've been insane.

512
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:48,477
I married you without realizing 
what kind of man you really are.

513
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,730
I really wanted to just live 
a normal life like everyone else,

514
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:54,983
so I gritted my teeth 
whenever I felt like getting a divorce.

515
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,819
-But I can't stand this anymore. 
-Hey.

516
00:44:56,902 --> 00:45:00,739
You begged me to marry you, 
going on about your professor crap.

517
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:03,325
But look, you're not a professor. 
You get paid peanuts.

518
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,077
What have you ever done for me?

519
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:06,995
And now you want a divorce?

520
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,831
This is ridiculous. Hey.

521
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:11,417
No way I'd grant you a divorce now.

522
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,668
-What? 
-Burial ground!

523
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:15,587
I won't divorce you 
until the inheritance is settled.

524
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:16,964
I also have a right to that.

525
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,258
You're absurd. The burial ground?

526
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:20,175
Yeah!

527
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,761
Don't even think about it. 
I won't let you have it!

528
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:26,014
This is so ridiculous. 
I'm never going to let you divorce me.

529
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:28,183
We are a married couple!

530
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:32,104
Half of that land belongs to me. 
Have you heard of community property?

531
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:33,605
Mr. Yuk Sung-soo!

532
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,900
Mr. Yoon Myung-gil refused 
to sell his burial ground.

533
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,736
The construction kept getting delayed.

534
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:41,655
You grew impatient 
and put thallium in his drink, didn't you?

535
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,158
No. I told you it wasn't me.

536
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:53,959
This thallium was found in your building 
at the construction site.

537
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,086
Are you still going to deny it?

538
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,588
Detective Jin.

539
00:45:57,671 --> 00:46:01,258
The evidence clearly shows he's guilty. 
Hand that punk over to the prosecution.

540
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:04,136
Yes, sir.

541
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,053
Detective.

542
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:08,182
I'm innocent. 
I just did what Kwang-soo told me to do.

543
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,809
Kwang-soo? Who the hell is that prick?

544
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:13,145
Kim Kwang-soo, my friend from college.

545
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,650
He works at Jijo Construction.

546
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:22,905
He told me he'd cut me a share 
if I made people sell their land.

547
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:25,908
But Myung-gil, for fuck's sake,

548
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:27,951
kept refusing to sell his land!

549
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:30,788
It's that bastard!

550
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,956
He's the one who killed him.

551
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,626
The thallium, the makgeolli, 
it was all him!

552
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,836
He's the one who planned everything!

553
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,298
The burial ground? Are you serious?

554
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:44,968
What are you doing?

555
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,763
-How dare you, after what you did? 
-Oh my God.

556
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:52,976
I thought women only spied 
on their husbands in TV shows.

557
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,228
Fuck! So what?

558
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:57,231
You must have been really busy, 
sleeping with your yoga students!

559
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,273
-Hey! 
-What?

560
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,609
I'm trying hard 
not to beat you to death. Get out.

561
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:04,947
Stop overreacting, seriously.

562
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,990
I don't want a slut in my car, so get out.

563
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,784
What the fuck did you just say? Slut?

564
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:11,703
-Yeah. 
-Slut? Fuck! I should just…

565
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,121
-Let go. 
-Fuck.

566
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,915
-I won't. 
-Did I hurt your pride?

567
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,166
Let go!

568
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:19,419
-Let go! Get out! 
-Fuck! Please!

569
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,672
Piss off, you bastard!

570
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,257
Fucking hell!

571
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,511
Fucking hell.

572
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:32,224
Hey!

573
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,688
Fuck, Yoon Seo-ha!

574
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,023
Fuck!

575
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:43,026
She's actually fucking leaving. Damn it!

576
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:53,787
Good men of Jinseong-ri! 
Fill up your glasses.

577
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,831
You've all waited a long time.

578
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:58,333
You've overcome the first hurdle now.

579
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:01,795
I guarantee that you will all become rich.

580
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:05,799
All right! Let's go, Jinseong-ri!

581
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,887
We can do it, Jinseong-ri!

582
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,264
-Jinseong-ri-- 
-Hey!

583
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,473
-Freeze! 
-Stop!

584
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,726
-Don't move! 
-Stay right there, asshole!

585
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:16,810
Face down, hands up!

586
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,896
Mr. Kim Kwang-soo? You are under--

587
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:23,942
Fuckin' idiot!

588
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:27,946
Damn you!

589
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,031
Motherfucker!

590
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,282
You bastard!

591
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:34,995
Get him! Where is he?

592
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:37,080
-There! 
-Run!

593
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:39,291
Stop right there!

594
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:41,627
-Oh! 
-Jeez, what in the world? Sir!

595
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:43,921
Hey!

596
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,756
Hey, get in!

597
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:08,320
Keep still, you bastard!

598
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:09,821
Boss, I'll take over.

599
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,283
Kim Kwang-soo.

600
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:18,497
You have the right to remain silent, 
you have the right to an attorney…

601
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,211
Shit.

602
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,798
The adultery law was abolished. 
No way I'm backing out.

603
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,594
I'll fuckin' give you a dogfight.

604
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,392
Baby, I got caught!

605
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,290
Fucking assholes.

606
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,153
That's strange.

607
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:29,724
