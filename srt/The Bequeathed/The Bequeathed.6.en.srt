1
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:25,734
CHEONGSU PRISON

2
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:47,964
Mr. Yuk Sung-soo.

3
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,968
The old lady with a scar on her lip.

4
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,137
Who is she?

5
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:55,972
Who?

6
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,350
There are old ladies like that everywhere.

7
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:02,979
She came to the funeral 
wearing a green cardigan.

8
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,940
She has a scar on her upper lip.

9
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,070
You mean

10
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:14,074
the quack shaman who lives on the hillside 
at the edge of the village?

11
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,283
Quack shaman?

12
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:20,246
The villagers sometimes go to her 
for fortune-telling and such,

13
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,499
but I barely even know her.

14
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,710
Where is that shaman's house?

15
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:32,050
There's a road opposite the village hall 
that leads up to the mountain.

16
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:36,137
Her hut or something 
is somewhere around the middle of it.

17
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,640
I wonder if it even has an address.

18
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,436
Yeah, Dae-su.

19
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:47,899
There should be a hut on the slope 
of the mountain opposite the village hall.

20
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,068
Send some officers now.

21
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,882
KIM YOUNG-HO

22
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,580
THE BEQUEATHED

23
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,023
Don't hold onto regrets or grudges

24
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:56,319
when you go off to the afterlife.

25
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,155
When you go there…

26
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,660
be happy with your mother.

27
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,508
Who are you?

28
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,401
You poor thing!

29
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,821
Such a pity that you were born!

30
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,241
My niece,

31
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,076
I'm sorry.

32
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,455
I'm sorry.

33
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,082
Niece?

34
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,002
What do you mean, niece?

35
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,588
Who are you?

36
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,007
Me?

37
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,176
I'm your aunt.

38
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,013
I guess I should say that I'm your aunt.

39
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,515
My aunt?

40
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,644
I was told my aunt died.

41
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,358
I'm sorry!

42
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,696
I'm sorry that things have come to this.

43
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,448
Wait.

44
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,657
Wait a minute.

45
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,868
Yes, that gun.

46
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,498
So, it was you, huh?

47
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:17,877
My husband and Mr. Kang. 
You killed them, didn't you?

48
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,004
But why?

49
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:25,301
Why else? 
For the burial ground, of course.

50
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,470
The burial ground?

51
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,517
But if you needed that, 
you could've just come forward!

52
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,685
You can't just kill people for it!

53
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,854
Why did you have to take it so far?

54
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,565
I'm near the end of my life.

55
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,485
Why would I need that piece of ground?

56
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,655
I'm just trying to give it to my Young-ho.

57
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,407
"My Young-ho"?

58
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,327
Kim Young-ho?

59
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,413
Kim Young-ho?

60
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,042
I'm Young-ho's mother.

61
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,670
Young-ho's mother?

62
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,633
You can't be his--

63
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,302
Kim Young-ho is my dad's son.

64
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,930
You said you're my aunt on my dad's side.

65
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,562
I'm also Young-ho's mom.

66
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,022
And I'm also

67
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,442
your dad's wife.

68
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,614
This is crazy. What are you saying?

69
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,284
You must be out of your goddamn mind.

70
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,995
That makes no sense!

71
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:36,873
What did you do?

72
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:42,378
What kind of disgusting thing 
did you two do?

73
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,556
My dear niece, 
you shouldn't talk like that!

74
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,101
I brought you here before you die

75
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,687
and even prayed 
for your rebirth in Sukhavati!

76
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,535
Anyway,

77
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,039
you are one of our own,

78
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,374
so you should know the truth.

79
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,503
We're not disgusting.

80
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,215
Our Young-ho is a child born out of love.

81
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,051
Your father and I…

82
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,180
were in love, you know.

83
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,396
Do you know what kind of rumor 
is going around the village?

84
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,235
People are blabbering about 
how you and Myung-hee are a thing!

85
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:50,905
Do I really have to put up 
with crazy talk like that?

86
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,782
You take care of your wife and kid

87
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,368
instead of that brat, Myung-hee!

88
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:59,997
And you! Pack your bags right now 
and go after that prick!

89
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,874
That bastard already ran away.

90
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,876
How is she supposed to find him?

91
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,630
He took the wedding gifts from us, 
so he should take her with him, you idiot!

92
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,298
You know everything now, Father.

93
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,342
He's been with another woman all along!

94
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,929
Do you think he'll welcome her 
if she goes to see him?

95
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:19,267
Do you know how much money I spent 
to convince him to marry that brat?

96
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,770
He's the one that took my money. 
If he doesn't take her, who will?

97
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,897
If she goes after him,

98
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,276
he might at least 
let her stay and sleep at his house!

99
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,236
Myung-hee!

100
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,238
Yoon Myung-hee!

101
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,716
Myung-hee!

102
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,095
Yoon Myung-hee!

103
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,269
Myung-hee!

104
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,273
Yoon Myung-hee!

105
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:10,735
What are you doing?

106
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,196
-No! 
-Let go!

107
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,865
No. It's okay.

108
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,537
Myung-ho, I just want to die.

109
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,039
No, you can't!

110
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,124
Father wants me to disappear too.

111
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,626
No, it's not like that!

112
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,795
You pretend not to be, 
but you're embarrassed by me!

113
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,881
Please don't think like that!

114
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,218
Myung-ho.

115
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,679
I don't want to go to that man.

116
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,765
Don't you worry.

117
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,975
I'll talk to Father again, so don't worry.

118
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,518
I want you to save me.

119
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,395
Please keep me safe.

120
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,232
Can't I just stay by your side forever?

121
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,818
Let's be together forever. Please.

122
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,657
You'll protect me, right?

123
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,742
Right?

124
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,415
Myung-ho, please keep me safe.

125
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,756
Though the world

126
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,051
may have judged us…

127
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,890
the love we shared was truly splendid.

128
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,185
Splendid?

129
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,021
Did you say splendid?

130
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,274
You all are just fucking nuts!

131
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:40,282
Damn, I wondered where my life went wrong. 
Now I know that it was your fault.

132
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:44,286
You disgusting people are the ones 
who screwed up my life!

133
00:11:56,382 --> 00:12:00,052
It's a shame that is how you think of us.

134
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,705
-Hey, what's that? 
-There's something up ahead.

135
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,750
-Let's get out here. 
-Okay.

136
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,761
What is all this?

137
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,930
Why would anyone live here?

138
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:53,522
Be quiet.

139
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:56,984
What is that?

140
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,467
Shit.

141
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:30,601
Yes, what happened?

142
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:31,894
-We got here. 
-And?

143
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,896
The shrine's lit up, but no one's here.

144
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,773
-We'll look around more. 
-Okay.

145
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:39,318
There's no one at the house 
that Yuk Sung-soo mentioned.

146
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,822
We need to find Kim Young-ho quickly.

147
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,990
What I don't get is why Yoon Myung-hee

148
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,285
would go as far as to commit murder 
for that burial ground.

149
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:52,665
If she had shown up, 
the burial ground would've become hers

150
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,000
and then she could've passed it on to Kim.

151
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,421
She's protecting her son.

152
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:05,845
If she steps forward, it will be revealed 
that Kim was born out of incest,

153
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,514
and people will mock him.

154
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,518
For her whole life, 
Yoon has been hiding away from ridicule.

155
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,438
She probably tried to protect her son…

156
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,860
from all the ridicule she received.

157
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,196
I spent my entire life

158
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:30,035
guarding against every misfortune 
because I was worried

159
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,873
my sins would come back 
as bad karma to my son.

160
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,667
I did everything I could

161
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,420
to keep Young-ho safe.

162
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,382
He never made it onto the family registry,

163
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,218
so he must inherit that burial ground.

164
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,303
YOON SEO-HA 
YOON YOUNG-HO6

165
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:51,390
Only then will he truly become 
Yoon Young-ho.

166
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,769
I already talked it out 
with Myung-gil too.

167
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,187
Myung-hee!

168
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,398
But then he died just like that.

169
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,484
That's how it's come to this mess.

170
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,155
I'm sorry.

171
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,868
Your son might die!

172
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:13,871
What did you say?

173
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,832
Yes, that's right.

174
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,502
I have to be the one to call them 
to save Kim Young-ho.

175
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:24,423
I have to call and tell them to stop 
if you want to save him.

176
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,717
What do you mean? Where…

177
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,345
Where is Young-ho right now?

178
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:33,015
I was just going to make him sign 
an agreement and let him go. I swear!

179
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,351
But something seems to have gone wrong.

180
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,270
So, let me try and contact him.

181
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:42,733
Give me my phone. 
If I die, your son dies too!

182
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,944
Young-ho is going to die?

183
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:48,113
No, he's not! But I've got to make a call.

184
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,616
I'll save Kim Young-ho, no…

185
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,203
I mean, your son. I'll save your son!

186
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,790
Who are you to do that? 
Who do you think you are?

187
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,014
Mr. Choi.

188
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,058
Put him there.

189
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:19,979
Damn it.

190
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,065
Fuck! You motherfucker!

191
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,986
Stupid asshole, have you lost it? 
You fucking idiot!

192
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,657
Sir, should we start?

193
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,119
This won't leave any trace, right?

194
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:40,708
If he's burned with the urns for two days, 
only his ashes will remain.

195
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:45,295
Then I'll sweep them up 
and put them in an urn for you.

196
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,673
Fucking hell.

197
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,092
You're a nasty old man.

198
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,682
PROFESSOR YOON SEO-HA

199
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:59,184
This bitch never stops calling me!

200
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,894
Goddamn it!

201
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,237
Ms. Yoon, I forgot to call you.

202
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,448
I've been busy. Why? What's up?

203
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,200
Sir, where's Kim Young-ho right now?

204
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:19,038
I told you we'd take care of things here. 
What's wrong with you?

205
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,540
No, please don't do that.

206
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,626
You haven't done anything, have you?

207
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,879
Where is Kim Young-ho? Where are you?

208
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,130
Tell me now!

209
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,466
Ms. Yoon.

210
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,385
You really don't trust me, do you?

211
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,972
Release Kim Young-ho right now.

212
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,516
Do it or I'll report you to the cops.

213
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,852
What the hell is wrong with you?

214
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:47,191
Ms. Yoon. 
My patience is wearing thin, okay?

215
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:50,611
Do you think I'm bluffing? 
I've got absolutely nothing to lose.

216
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,072
For fuck's sake!

217
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,616
All right!

218
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,160
Don't call the cops. Come here for now.

219
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,454
Let's talk in person.

220
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,874
Okay? We're at 250, Hoseong-ri.

221
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,751
-No. 
-You must come alone.

222
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,836
Okay. I will.

223
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,674
Get up. Get out of here now.

224
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,093
Hurry!

225
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,054
This way.

226
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:21,683
Quickly!

227
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,940
Mister, not my sister.

228
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,609
Spare my sister, please!

229
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,694
Look at this fucking loser. Hey, grab him.

230
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,612
Yes, sir.

231
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,073
You damn bastard! Son of a bitch!

232
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,825
Let go, you son of a bitch!

233
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,994
You fucking clown!

234
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,540
It's all your fault, son of a bitch!

235
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,043
You're the one who made this fucking mess.

236
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:55,092
Hey, if you want two people in the fire, 
we have to put them in at the same time.

237
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,009
What?

238
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:00,806
If we open the kiln midway, it will take 
a few more days for them to turn to ashes.

239
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,641
Make up your mind now.

240
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,105
Not my sister.

241
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:11,900
No.

242
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,527
-No. 
-Hey.

243
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,905
When that bitch comes,

244
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,367
roast her along with this guy.

245
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,290
Get in here.

246
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,791
Hurry!

247
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,807
HOPEFUL CORRECTION 
OPENS UP A BRIGHT FUTURE

248
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,440
Kim Young-ho was kidnapped.

249
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,863
Who could possibly have kidnapped him 
in this situation?

250
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,909
Maybe guys hired by Yoon Seo-ha?

251
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,786
She hired the private detective before.

252
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,623
She may be up to something again.

253
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,712
-Dae-su. 
-Yes, Detective.

254
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:18,175
We found Yoon Seo-ha's car. 
It looks like there was an accident here.

255
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,928
There's a piece of sign 
stuck under the rear wheel.

256
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,679
-And Yoon Seo-ha? 
-We can't find her.

257
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,598
She's not answering her phone either.

258
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,726
But the ignition was on in her car. 
Something seems a bit off.

259
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,978
Where could she have gone?

260
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,314
Search the surrounding area 
and get back to me.

261
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,398
Yes, sir.

262
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,903
She was Yoon Myung-hee's next target 
just as I suspected.

263
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,571
Do you have her number?

264
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:40,739
-Yes. 
-Show me.

265
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,824
Here it is.

266
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:43,992
YOON SEO-HA

267
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,036
Yoon Seo-ha doesn't know my number.

268
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,888
She rejected me. 
Could it be Yoon Myung-hee?

269
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,224
Wait a minute.

270
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,937
Yoon Myung-hee 
is Kim Young-ho's mother, right?

271
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,023
Let's use that.

272
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,411
CALL ME NOW OR KIM YOUNG-HO WILL DIE

273
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,750
Is this gonna work?

274
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,588
If she has indeed caused all this 
because she is Kim Young-ho's mother,

275
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,758
she will respond irrationally 
when it comes to her son.

276
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,510
We'll have to bank on that.

277
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:55,355
If you hurt my Young-ho

278
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,190
before I get there,

279
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,360
I will kill all of you.

280
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,033
You should be here already.

281
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,160
Do you even have the correct address?

282
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,495
It's 250, Hoseong-ri.

283
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,206
I'm almost there!

284
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,792
So stay right where you are.

285
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,670
We'll be waiting.

286
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,260
Have the others meet us there.

287
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:09,554
Get out.

288
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,223
Okay, I'm coming.

289
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,192
But didn't he tell me to come alone--

290
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,035
Looks like she's here.

291
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,579
-Go out and check. 
-Yes, sir.

292
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,872
-Let's go. 
-Yes, sir.

293
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,042
-See if anyone followed her here. 
-Yes, sir.

294
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,420
No.

295
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,007
Hurry it up, man.

296
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,845
Yoon Myung-hee is not in her right mind 
after hearing about her son.

297
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,514
Things could get dangerous for all of us.

298
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,518
She did all this for her son. 
She even killed people.

299
00:23:57,018 --> 00:24:01,022
But now her beloved son is in danger, 
there's no way she can think straight.

300
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,445
Jun-hyung

301
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,281
misses you.

302
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,076
I visited him recently.

303
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,038
You're so stubborn, man.

304
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:21,001
How can you not visit your son 
in prison even once?

305
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,297
He asked me if you're doing well.

306
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,384
You should go see your son.

307
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:49,905
-What the hell? 
-What?

308
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:51,823
What happened here?

309
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,704
-What do we do? 
-The car's empty.

310
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,539
Let's take her for now. Bring her.

311
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,874
Lift her up.

312
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,142
-Is that the professor? 
-Yes.

313
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,353
Why is she like this?

314
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,355
She was just passed out in the front.

315
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:24,773
What?

316
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,027
Did you check if anyone came with her?

317
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,695
Well, there was no one.

318
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,698
That doesn't make any sense! 
Go out and check again.

319
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,618
And put this bitch in the kiln now.

320
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:37,536
Yes, sir.

321
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,374
Start stacking the bricks!

322
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:53,635
Sis.

323
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:55,887
Sis.

324
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,807
You, smear this on there.

325
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,227
Sis.

326
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,067
Sis. Wake up, Sis.

327
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,319
-Damn it! 
-Sis.

328
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,114
This is going to take forever. Shit.

329
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,747
It's going to take ages 
to roast both of them.

330
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,666
Let's get a move on, old man!

331
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:40,223
Hurry up.

332
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:02,120
It's ready, so fire it up quickly.

333
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,076
Damn! What the fuck?

334
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,994
Mr. Choi!

335
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,498
Mr. Choi! The car's on fire!

336
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:47,999
What? Fire?

337
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,502
Fuck! Are you kidding me?

338
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,421
Fucking hell. Put it out!

339
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,721
Goddamn it!

340
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,392
Fuck! Who was that?

341
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,228
Hey, wait for me!

342
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:09,354
We're screwed.

343
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,504
My baby!

344
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:44,264
Young-ho, no!

345
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,901
This is driving me crazy!

346
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:03,867
What the hell?

347
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,584
Fuck. Did this old woman come with her?

348
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,172
Holy fucking shit!

349
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,048
Is she the shooter?

350
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:23,595
This bitch was 
the one shooting at us, right?

351
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:25,972
Fuck.

352
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,852
You lousy fuckers!

353
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,980
You must think I'm a fucking joke!

354
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,024
Why isn't this working?

355
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,511
Hey, Young-ho. Wake up.

356
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,846
Snap out of it!

357
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,516
Hey. Get up, Young-ho!

358
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,480
Hey! Kim Young-ho!

359
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,909
-Where are our guys? 
-They'll be here in five minutes.

360
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,287
Looks like Yoon Myung-hee's car.

361
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:39,546
Found something?

362
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,797
LANDLORD CHOI TAE-SEONG

363
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,924
It's Yoon Seo-ha's phone.

364
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,093
We don't have time to wait. Let's just go.

365
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,144
Damn it.

366
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,188
What do we do now?

367
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,190
What are you waiting for? 
Torch this place!

368
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,567
You can't do that!

369
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,153
What are you doing? Let me go!

370
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,322
He said he'll compensate you!

371
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,704
Young-ho.

372
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,312
Kim Young-ho. Hey, wake up.

373
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:38,980
Wake up!

374
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:20,063
Young-ho!

375
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,148
-Young-ho! 
-Who's there?

376
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,733
Young-ho!

377
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,611
Over here! We are alive!

378
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:31,449
Kim Young-ho is here! Help me!

379
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:39,874
Young-ho!

380
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,212
Young-ho!

381
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:59,978
Young-ho!

382
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,410
Don't move! Step back.

383
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,537
-Damn it! 
-On your knees, asshole!

384
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,056
-Let go, you bastard! 
-Stay still, asshole!

385
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,100
Watch out, Sung-jun!

386
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,810
Wait!

387
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,645
I'll stay still!

388
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,148
Fuckers!

389
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:47,984
Sang-min!

390
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,450
Young-ho!

391
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,954
No, Young-ho! Wake up!

392
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,624
Young-ho, wake up.

393
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,677
Young-ho.

394
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,852
Young-ho!

395
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,741
Young-ho.

396
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:39,243
Yes. Open your eyes.

397
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,620
Look here, it's Mom.

398
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:44,248
My baby! My poor baby!

399
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,795
My Young-ho. Young-ho?

400
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:50,922
Young-ho!

401
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:56,677
We don't have time for this. 
We need to get out. Untie him now!

402
00:34:58,763 --> 00:34:59,722
Hurry up!

403
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,285
How did it come to this?

404
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:29,877
What the fuck?

405
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:33,881
Fuck!

406
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,936
Hands up! 
Drop the gun and raise your hands!

407
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,481
Drop the gun!

408
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,316
Okay, damn it!

409
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,901
Drop it! On your knees!

410
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,778
Fuck this.

411
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,113
I said drop the gun!

412
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,494
Cuff him.

413
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,664
Hey, excuse me.

414
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,499
Let me just make one call, okay?

415
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:13,004
Hey, there's a phone in my pocket. 
Let me just make one call.

416
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,089
-I have to call my daughter. 
-Just go.

417
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,258
Let me make one call, you motherfucker!

418
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,342
Move!

419
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,011
Fuck this shit!

420
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,430
Sang-min!

421
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:25,766
Are you okay?

422
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:29,979
Sung-jun, go and find 
Yoon Seo-ha and Kim Young-ho.

423
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:33,024
Leave the others to us.

424
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:36,986
And from this day on, my leg is like this,

425
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,698
because that bastard shot me.

426
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,117
Do you get what I mean?

427
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:44,535
Come on, man.

428
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,079
Now go, Sung-jun.

429
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,834
You just never listen 
to your boss, do you?

430
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,128
Hang in there.

431
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:04,847
Young-ho.

432
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,896
-I'm sorry. 
-Mom.

433
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,233
Mom.

434
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,735
-Mommy's sorry. 
-Mom!

435
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:19,737
Mom!

436
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,052
Mom.

437
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,096
Let's go.

438
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,603
Mom, let's go.

439
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:54,563
Let's go!

440
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:56,983
Let's go.

441
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:02,613
Let's go.

442
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,949
Let's go now.

443
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:08,160
Mom.

444
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:11,330
Mom.

445
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,427
Ms. Yoon Myung-hee!

446
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,012
Ms. Yoon!

447
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,439
Mom, no.

448
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,569
-No! 
-Yoon Myung-hee! Yoon--

449
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,280
Ms. Yoon!

450
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:57,084
Mom!

451
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,608
Mom.

452
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,320
Mom!

453
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,142
Now, everyone, 
when you're drawing plum tree branches,

454
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:59,814
you should tilt the brush a little more 
and let the curves flow out.

455
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:06,070
And there's a point where all the energy 
that was gathered suddenly spreads out.

456
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,489
You should focus on expressing that.

457
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,909
Then you can move on to shaping your tree,

458
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:17,498
and make sure to leave gaps in between 
where the flowers will bloom later on.

459
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:33,848
How's the studio going?

460
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:35,933
It's going okay.

461
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,269
It's kind of fun.

462
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,438
You look good.

463
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,110
You don't need to be nervous.

464
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,195
I'm not a cop anymore.

465
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,072
I quit.

466
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,784
Then why are you here?

467
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,954
Do you know that the thugs from the scene 
are still on trial?

468
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,874
Yes, I heard about it.

469
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,293
The abduction charges have been dropped.

470
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,213
Mr. Kim Young-ho strongly denied 
that he had been abducted.

471
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:11,177
Well, thanks to that, 
you were also cleared of charges.

472
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:15,181
At the scene that day, 
a burnt body was found, right?

473
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:19,018
It was so charred 
that DNA couldn't be detected.

474
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,312
Far away from the site,

475
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,482
they found this photo.

476
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,952
Are you still in touch with Mr. Kim?

477
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,998
No. We don't really have any reason 
to keep in touch.

478
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,125
I see.

479
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,172
But it's not like I'm avoiding him either.

480
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:52,468
That's what families are like. 
Like family, like strangers.

481
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,096
I suppose you're right.

482
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,808
I'll have to get going now.

483
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:01,227
Sure.

484
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:07,358
What did you decide to do 
with the burial ground?

485
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:10,277
For now, it's going to stay.

486
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:15,449
It's been passed down through generations. 
Selling it off seems inappropriate.

487
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,494
Goodbye, then.

488
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:20,598
Is the food…

489
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:23,601
okay?

490
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:28,188
Yes.

491
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,484
Any health issues?

492
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,364
I'm okay.

493
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,453
That's a relief.

494
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,877
I quit being a detective.

495
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:54,131
I won't be working for a while.

496
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,054
So I have a lot of time.

497
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:08,729
Jun-hyung.

498
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:15,944
I'll come by often.

499

504
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,361
Please hold.

505
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:28,058
Excuse me. How are these people related?

506
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:41,613
Family. They are family.

507
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:46,076
Okay, we'll cover it up now.
