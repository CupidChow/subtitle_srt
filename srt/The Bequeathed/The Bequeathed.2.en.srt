[exhales]

3
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,312
Oh, whew.

4
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,190
[groans] Jeez.

5
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:25,900
Jesus.

6
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:27,777
Oh, it's cold!

7
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:33,033
Sung-jun, it's cold. I brought you this. 
Hope you like it.

8
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,117
Thank you.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,453
Hey, why'd you get a cold drink, 
you idiot?

10
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:38,288
[laughs] Just drink it.

11
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,749
-[Sung-jun] Jesus. 
-[Sang-min] Hey, hey. Cheers.

12
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,042
God.

13
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,759
Hey, Sung-jun, I meant to ask.

14
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:52,969
You guys talking?

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,722
[clicks tongue, sighs]

16
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,102
Ever since she, um…

17
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,646
He's been distant, huh?

18
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,652
I'm not sure when everything started.

19
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,573
I think you need to open up 
with him first, you know?

20
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,158
He's still a kid.

21
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,411
[phone buzzing]

22
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,829
Who's that?

23
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:21,873
Who could it…

24
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:25,668
Yes, Captain.

25
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,088
Yeah?

26
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,007
Yes, I understand, sir.

27
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,550
-Shit. Damn it. 
-What is it?

28
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,930
He said that one of us is enough, 
the other should head back to the station.

29
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:39,766
Good, this was really annoying. 
I'll head in.

30
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:40,683
Sung-jun.

31
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,685
-I should go first. 
-Hey, jackass.

32
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,814
-There's such a thing as seniority. 
-[laughs]

33
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,148
Stay here and relax.

34
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,274
Ah, Sung-jun.

35
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:51,694
Then just tell the Captain that 
this probably isn't the right place, huh?

36
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,612
Just do as your told…

37
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,239
-Huh? 
-…dumbass.

38
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,366
Come on.

39
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:57,909
See you later.

40
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:03,665
[scoffs]

41
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,168
[groans]

42
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,963
I'm supposed to stay here all night?

43
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,383
[breathes deeply] It's freezing.

44
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,723
God, I'm tired.

00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,602

00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,065
[phone chimes]

47
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:33,361
He really forgot his phone? 
Detective, my ass.

48
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,073
DAD, SAVE ME

00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,075

[sirens wail faintly]

57
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:40,637
[boy] I didn't fucking stab anyone. 
Why would I stab a cop, huh?

58
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,972
Let's go. Keep your mouth shut.

59
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:00,990
Did you do it?

60
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,080
Answer me, Jun-hyung!

61
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,749
[chuckles softly]

62
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,210
You little shit.

63
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,880
Detective Choi, come on, sir. 
That's enough.

64
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,385
-[officer] You shouldn't have done this. 
-[Jun-hyung] Fuck you.

65
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,476
You fucking disgrace.

66
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,146
[woman on TV] …all over Europe.

67
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:36,859
And this amazing piano is here today, 
exclusively on MH Home Shopping.

68
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,113
I'm so excited that we're the first 
to be able to show you this.

69
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,155
[phone buzzing]

70
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,783
There's something special 
about this piano we're about to show you.

71
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,327
You already know 
that a difference in touch

72
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,954
makes a difference in sound.

73
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,330
Hey, what is it?

74
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,666
[Jung-hyun] Where are you, sir? 
There's been an incident.

75
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:52,834
We need you here, sir.

76
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,503
Yoon Seo-ha's husband was found dead.

77
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,883
So, you-- You're saying he's really dead?

78
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,220
-[Dae-su] Yes. 
-How did he die?

79
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,269
Well…

80
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,314
He was found by the rice paddies 
near Jinseong-ri.

81
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,900
He was already dead. He had a…

82
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,444
gunshot wound to his face.

83
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:22,363
It seems that someone shot him 
with a gun at close range.

84
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,490
Gun sho…

85
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,368
[breathing heavily]

86
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,331
I… I don't understand. What gun?

87
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,250
In order to learn more, 
we'll need an autopsy.

88
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,003
It seems like 
it was a hunting rifle though.

89
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,129
Judging from appearance.

90
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,381
[sobs softly]

91
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,099
[sobbing]

92
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,187
[sobbing] Even at the end…

93
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,651
Well… [clears throat]

94
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,237
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

95
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,283
So, you came out of the restaurant 
around 10:00 p.m. yesterday

96
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,536
and then you and Mr. Yang, your husband, 
left together, is that correct?

97
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,622
[sniffles] Yes, that's right.

98
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,916
We left around then 
and started heading home,

99
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,210
and then we had an argument on the road.

100
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:20,671
So I just dropped him off on the way 
and just headed home by myself.

101
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,882
I don't know what happened after that.

102
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:26,260
So you're saying he got out of the car

103
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,721
around Jinseong-ri village, am I right?

104
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,182
I can't really tell you for sure

105
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,434
but I think it was around there, yes.

106
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,311
[sniffles]

107
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,229
Well…

108
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:43,569
Your husband, the last person he called 
was a woman he was having an affair with.

109
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,449
And was she questioned as well?

110
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,994
Yes, she was questioned 
earlier this morning and released.

111
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,288
I guess you already knew about her.

112
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:57,083
How did you find out 
he was having an affair?

113
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,419
Did you run your own investigation?

114
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,088
No, that's… I mean…

115
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,090
He had been acting weird lately,

116
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:07,510
so I hired a private investigator 
to look into it, yeah.

117
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:13,099
I mean, he just kept coming home later 
and later and I…

118
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,184
as his wife, was getting fed up 
and wanting answers.

119
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,436
What's wrong with that?

120
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,356
Right, so could you prove 
you returned to your house

121
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,150
at around the time you said you did?

122
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,485
Uh, your place 
has security cameras, right?

123
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,572
[tense music playing]

124
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,324
Am I a suspect right now?

125
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,036
We're just investigating thoroughly.

126
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,585
And Kim Young-ho?

127
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,420
Who?

128
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,964
Kim Young-ho, 
the man who said he's my brother.

129
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:45,965
Did you talk to him?

130
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,427
Oh, yes, of course. 
We already finished questioning him.

131
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,054
He had an alibi. We already followed up.

132
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,098
He was with 
an acquaintance of his last night.

133
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:55,850
Are you sure?

134
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,645
Without a shadow of a doubt, you're sure?

135
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,898
[Seo-ha breathing heavily]

136
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,983

INTERROGATION ROOM

138
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,324
We'll be in touch, Ms. Yoon. 
Get home safely.

139
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,241
Okay.

140
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,625
[tense music playing]

141
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,170

THE BEQUEATHED

146
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,033
[loud crunching]

147
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,957
[crunching continues]

148
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,796
Ugh, this is so annoying, Jesus!

149
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,549
Hey, who the hell let him in?

150
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,387
Detective Choi, mind waiting outside, huh?

151
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,141
I'll explain everything once I'm done. 
Why are you even in here, huh?

152
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,101
What do you think 
will help me solve the case?

153
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:48,022
You think a simple, quick explanation is 
as good as seeing the process, you idiot?

154
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,065
Who's an idiot?

155
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,359
That's something 
my older brother used to say.

156
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,027
There's truth to it, I have to admit.

157
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,612
God, you're such a dick.

158
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,491
Do me a favor. Keep your mouth shut. 
How can you even eat that in here?

159
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,952
The sound of you loudly eating chips 
is making me miss all the clues.

160
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,204
I can't stop. It's addicting.

161
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,165
This was my breakfast.

162
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,541
Mm.

163
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,088
So? What'd you find?

164
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,715
[pathologist] Well, 
he was shot with shotgun pellets.

165
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,926
The kind you use for hunting, actually. 
Buckshot.

166
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,428
Buckshot? What else?

167
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,723
Well, you see those abrasions over there? 
Those were caused by small rocks.

168
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:26,185
Judging by the angle, 
he was pulled by his collar and dragged.

169
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:29,647
And if he was dragged like that, 
we might find some DNA.

170
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,649
-[camera shutter clicks] 
-With any luck, that is.

171
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,986
-So, you're telling me, just wait and see. 
-That's right.

172
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,073
What about missing clues 
'cause of my chewing then, huh?

173
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,659
-Jeez, talk about being sensitive. 
-[chuckles]

174
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:46,706
Oh, hey, I heard they were gonna 
start downsizing over at your station.

175
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,791
Really? First I'm hearing about it.

176
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:52,128
I heard they're going to reduce personnel 
and reassign teams.

177
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,965
Oh, is it 'cause 
the population's shrinking?

178
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,677
I guess it's rare for this area 
to handle a murder case.

179
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,470
Although…

180
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,515
If they're cutting people,

181
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,351
wouldn't that useless Captain Park 
be first to go?

182
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,688
And with things looking the way they are…

183
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,441
The captain getting cut 
will be a good thing, right?

184
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,692
At least for you.

185
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,528
You lose your mind, old geezer? Hmm?

186
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,406
Quit your yapping 
and do the autopsy already.

187
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,366
I'm older than you. 
Show some respect, punk.

188
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,826
That's why I said it!

189
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:24,952
[Sung-jun clicks tongue]

190
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,204
Digging up someone else's shit.

191
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:29,665
My bad.

192
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,211
What will become of the captain now?

193
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,629
[Ji-hun scoffs]

194
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,550
[man on video] …checking every detail 
of the swing like this

195
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,094
is really important for getting it right.

196
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,513
So, hold your left hand like this

197
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,391
and grab it with your right hand, 
like this…

198
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,393
Sir, um…

199
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,610
We'll investigate the Yang Jae-seok case 
separately from the Yoon Myung-gil case.

200
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:58,736
YOON MYUNG-GIL CASE REPORT

201
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,821
[Chief] Okay, go ahead.

202
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,448
[laughs]

203
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,742
Detective Choi wrote this one, didn't he?

204
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,661
Sung-jun was always good at this.

205
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:11,499
He organized his reports 
with military-style precision, didn't he?

206
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,584
[Chief laughs]

207
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:20,591
CHIEF'S OFFICE

208
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,305
[Jung-hyun] Sir, I heard that 
Captain Park might get cut

209
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:29,892
during this round of restructuring. 
I don't know though.

210
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,021
'Cause even on this one, 
Captain Park was the one who cracked it,

211
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,816
so out of everyone, shouldn't it be 
Detective Choi getting cut?

212
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:37,733
Hey.

213
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,737
So you're telling me 
you think Captain Park cracked this case?

214
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,655
Mm-hmm.

215
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,408
Sung-jun cracked this case, 
not the captain.

216
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:50,663
What are you saying? Detective Choi 
was absolutely useless here,

217
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,791
and Captain Park was the one 
who cracked this whole case wide open.

218
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:57,253
[Dae-su] Detective Choi is the one 
who investigates and solves

219
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,756
all of Captain Park's cases. 
It's been like that for quite a while now.

220
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:05,052
If someone were to be let go, 
it would definitely be the captain, okay?

221
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,638
If they choose to keep Captain Park 
over Detective Choi,

222
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,306
then they're losing their best asset.

223
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,683
It's stupid and unfair.

224
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:14,937
All right then, so the cases so far 
that the captain solved

225
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,690
were actually Detective Choi's. 
I have that right?

226
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,151
So something must have happened.

227
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,990
Back then, those two 
were actually quite close, yeah,

228
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,158
before everything went down.

229
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,539
[tense music playing]

230
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,471
[Dae-su] Detective Choi's son 
used to hang out

231
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,807
with these delinquent pieces of shit.

232
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,897
Then one day these bastards found out 
that his dad was a police officer,

233
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,399
so they started bullying the kid.

234
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,154
I don't know if they made 
some kind of bet or something…

235
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:06,697
Jun-hyung.

236
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,086
[tense music rising]

237
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,887
Let go!

238
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,102
[Sang-min groans]

239
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,609
[boy 1] Hey, motherfucker! 
That all you got?

240
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,779
I said, are you done, huh? Are you?

241
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:48,906
Hey!

242
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:52,201
Stop being a little bitch cop-lover, 
and stab your dad, you pussy!

243
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,411
[boy 2 laughing] This little bitch 
can't do anything.

244
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,668
[Sang-min groaning]

245
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,757
[boy 1] Fuckin' A, 
see that's what I'm talking about.

246
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,801
[boys laughing]

247
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,097
[gasping, groaning]

248
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,976
-[drops knife] 
-[Sang-min coughing]

249
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,020
[gasping]

250
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,442
Jun-hyung?

251
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,240
Why did you do this? Huh?

252
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,617
[Dae-su] Captain Park 
was the one who got hurt

253
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,160
instead of Detective Choi.

254
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,832
[Jung-hyun] Oh, I saw that on the news.

255
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,292
Wow, that was Captain Park 
and Detective Choi?

256
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:49,008
And that's the reason Captain Park 
walks with a limp and needs a cane.

257
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:54,388
He was really depressed for a while 
and his wife ended up divorcing him.

258
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,184
And now he won't even 
show his face to his kids.

259
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,938
What happened to the detective's kid? 
What's he doing now?

260
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:07,192
Locked up I bet, 
'cause he got around five years, I think,

261
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,902
since he was in high school, more or less.

262
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,739
Man, that's crazy, really, Jesus.

263
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,323
And even after all that, those two,

264
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,201
Detective Choi and Captain Park, 
they still… Jesus.

265
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,620
It's what's in the cards, I guess.

266
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,332
Then there's a chance Captain Park will be 
getting laid off because of staff cuts.

267
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,292
Isn't there, sir?

268
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,545
A small fry like you should keep 
your head down and your mouth shut.

269
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:27,963
A small fry like me hears things--

270
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,131
Captain.

271
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,594
Oh, have you guys had lunch?

272
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,345
Yes.

273
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,639
I'm gonna go take my lunch now, then.

274
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,142
Why don't we all meet 
in the office at 3:00?

275
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,227
-Yes, sir. 
-Understood. Enjoy your lunch.

276
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,812
-Thanks. 
-Enjoy your meal, sir.

277
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,276
[Jung-hyun] You don't think 
he heard us, do you?

278
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,403
-[Dae-su] Of course he heard us. 
-[Jung-hyun] Shit.

279
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,323
[Dae-su] Ugh, we're screwed now. 
God, we're gonna get it later.

280
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,407
[Jung-hyun] Damn it.

281
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,750
[Dae-su] The investigation confirmed 
that Kim Young-ho

282
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,795
was purchasing dog cages 
at an outdoor market at around 5:00 p.m.

283
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:11,298
After that, he was seen drinking with 
acquaintances until around 11:00 p.m.,

284
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,466
and there are witnesses.

285
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,675
[Sang-min] Dog cages?

286
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,721
Kim Young-ho is involved in supplying 
ingredients for boyangtang.

287
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,599
And the deceased's mistress 
was on the phone with him

288
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,101
at his time of death.

289
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,395
But she was with her family, 
at their home in Uijeongbu at the time.

290
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,064
YANG JAE-SEOK MURDER CASE

291
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:30,150
Security cameras confirmed the owner 
of the detective agency, Kang Hong-sik,

292
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,319
was at his Seoul office 
until late at night.

293
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:33,487
Did you find anything else?

294
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,908
Yes, uh, we found empty cartridges 
not too far from the body.

295
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:41,578
They were shotgun shells. 
Remington, imported from America.

296
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,580
Then, we should look at the village

297
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,791
to see who around there 
owns that kind of gun.

298
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,585
Yes, sir, we already looked. 
No one there owned a weapon like that.

299
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,755
Also, there's never been hunting grounds 
in or around that area.

300
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,883
But if you look at this, 
you can see that the shell

301
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,677
was produced in 1991.

302
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:02,474
The murder weapon is over 30 years old?

303
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,979
What else? You find anything else?

304
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,857
No, sir, but we'll know more 
once the DNA results come back.

305
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,610
[sighs]

306
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,280
Call me as soon as they come back.

307
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:17,781
Yes, sir.

308
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,243
Uh, excuse me, sir.

309
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,413
I got in touch with someone, sir.

310
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,665
They claim they were close 
to Yoon Myung-gil's family.

311
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,333
Should I follow up, sir?

312
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,212
Everyone's already dead in that household,

313
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:35,048
so don't focus your investigation 
on Yoon Myung-gil's family.

314
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,509
Concentrate on Yoon Seo-ha 
and Kim Young-ho.

315
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:41,513
Those two are going to give us 
the answers we need in this case.

316
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,765
And their motives are clear.

317
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,392
Understood.

318
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,108
Sung-jun, come in to my office now.

319
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,630
What the hell is this?

320
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,672
YOON MYUNG-GIL CASE

321
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,132
What?

322
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,050
Oh, that?

323
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,219
"Oh, that?"

324
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,972
Detective Choi.

325
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:25,974
Sung-jun.

326
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:29,937
Do you remember what you told me 
when I was just a rookie?

327
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,022
You make your subordinates follow,

328
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,775
so there's no confusion 
during an investigation.

329
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,777
Just follow orders and pipe down.

330
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,904
I don't think I said anything like that.

331
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,241
More like, I think I just said, 
"Do as you're told."

332
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,245
"While investigating the village 
on Captain Park's orders,

333
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:50,582
we discovered a large quantity of thallium 
in Yuk Sung-soo's construction site."

334
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,461
I never gave you a command like that.

335
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,090
You don't have to spell out every order.

336
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,884
Subordinates should know 
their captain's intentions

337
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,678
and follow through accordingly.

338
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:18,986
[sighs]

339
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,365
Am I a joke to you?

340
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,037
I'm just an idiot 
who can't even solve a fucking case.

341
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:33,375
You took over the case because 
I was steering us towards a dead end.

342
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,003
And even those files…

343
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:41,091
You even filed the report 
so I wouldn't fuck it up, right?

344
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:45,595
Hey, I think you're getting a little 
too dramatic over a police report.

345
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,223
-That wasn't my intention, Sang-min. 
-What?

346
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:50,809
"Sang-min"?

347
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,812
[shouting] I'm your damn captain!

348
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,190
Rewrite the report exactly how it was!

349
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,943
"My idiot captain 
sent us on a wild goose chase,

350
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,528
so the investigation failed!"

351
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,196
Just write it how it was!

352
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,575
I-- Listen Sang-mi--

353
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,286
Captain, sir--

354
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,788
Get out. Get out and rewrite it all!

355
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,255
[sighs]

356
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,264
I'm sorry if I was out of line.

357
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,025

358
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,578
PROFESSOR KIM CHANG-SEOK

359
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,872
[line calling]

360
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:03,590
-Oh! Hi, Ms. Yoon. 
-Hi, Professor Kim.

361
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:06,218
I was wondering 
if you were free to talk right now.

362
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:07,719
Sure. What's going on?

363
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,722
Huh? What is it?

364
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,642
Well, the thing is… it's…

365
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,770
Seriously, what's going on?

366
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:21,441
I just, it's… 
There's been another death, so…

367
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,068
I… I wanted you to know.

368
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:26,238
Death? Oh, no, who passed away?

369
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:28,573
Well…

370
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,492
It's…

371
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,328
Well, my husband, he had an accident.

372
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:36,415
What? What do you mean? Oh, my gosh.

373
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,001
What kind of accident? Why? What happened?

374
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,424
Well, the thing is, 
the police are still investigating,

375
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,925
so I don't know all the details yet.

376
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,427
Oh, my goodness.

377
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,054
Oh, Ms. Yoon, I'm so sorry to hear that.

378
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,265
Hang in there, Ms. Yoon.

379
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,517
-Yeah. 
-Oh, my gosh.

380
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:59,020
This is terrible. 
You have to be strong, Ms. Yoon.

381
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,941
Yes, yes, sir, thank you. 
I'm doing my best.

382
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,360
Forget everything else.

383
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,320
Just let me know 
where the funeral will be,

384
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,697
and I'll definitely make it.

385
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,618
Yes, sir, I will. Goodbye then, sir.

386
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:15,871
Okay.

387
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,778
[sighs]

388
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,209
Shit.

389
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,757
Shit.

[sighs]

392
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,560
Why did you…

393
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:24,606
Why'd you have to stick it in there 
of all places, you fucking--

394
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:28,401
Why? Why? Why? Why?

395
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:32,781
Why did you do this to me? Why? Why?

396
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:37,160
[sobbing] Why? Why?

397
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,663
[melancholy music playing]

398
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,043
[Dae-su] Your husband was shot and killed.

PROFESSOR KIM CHANG-SEOK 
CHAIR, DEPARTMENT OF FINE ARTS

409
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,567
[Seo-ha retching]

410
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:21,616
[coughing]

411
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,873
[panting]

412
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:32,210
[toilet flushing]

413
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,505
[woman] How on earth did this happen?

414
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,759
Didn't someone else in her family 
just pass away?

415
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:43,388
Freaky, right? I got goosebumps 
when I got the call.

416
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,931
[woman] Two consecutive deaths.

417
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,600
Ms. Yoon's so unlucky, Jesus.

418
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:51,062
Mm. It seems like luck 
just isn't in the cards for her.

419
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,481
Her husband, I heard it was murder.

420
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,566
[woman] Really?

421
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,985
[Professor Han] You think she did it?

422
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,154
[woman] Hey now, what are you saying?

423
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,197
[Professor Han] I'm just kidding.

424
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,825
She does have a dark side to her, though.

425
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,412
And a strange family situation.

426
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:11,124
It's like her whole family is suffering 
from some bad karma or something.

427
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,041
[scoffs]

428
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,794
Maybe this wouldn't have happened 
if they were normal.

429
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,005
[woman] It's so unfortunate.

430
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,299
Yeah, but what can we do, right?

431
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:23,178
She was just born into such an odd family, 
it is what it is.

432
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:24,888
Let's go.

433
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,313
Oh? It's finally here.

434
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,358
Ms. Yoon, I ordered this one.

435
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,610
PROFESSOR HAN NA-RAE

436
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,905
Jae-seok wasn't a company man, 
so I figured we could use more wreaths.

437
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,367
-Get it out of here. 
-What?

438
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,662
Take it away. I won't accept this wreath.

439
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:54,042
I don't need something like this, 
so take it away and go.

440
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,251
Instructor Yoon.

441
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:57,504
Hello, ma'am.

442
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,467
Kang Hong-sik 
from the Cheolwon Detective Agency.

443
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,803
Oh, yes, hello, Mr. Kang.

444
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:06,930
Let's talk over here.

445
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,812
[man 1] Jae-seok died so suddenly. 
Have you heard anything?

446
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,815
[Hong-sik] Oh, the yukgaejang here 
is good.

447
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:19,234
It's not even a yukgaejang place.

448
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,028
-Really? Would you like another? 
-No, no. Thank you.

449
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:25,406
Jeez. I mean, what happened?

450
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,243
I'm not sure.

451
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,329
Well, on the way here, 
I was questioned by the police…

452
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,414
[laughs] …for the first time in my life.

453
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,084
Oh, I'm sorry. That's my fault.

454
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,836
Aw, no, don't blame yourself.

455
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,006
It seemed like 
the mistress was also investigated.

456
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,844
-[man 1] Why is it so empty here? 
-[man 2] I can't believe this happened.

457
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,512
It'll all be resolved soon, miss.

458
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,514
Yes, of course it will.

459
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:53,726
Anyway, thank you so much for coming. 
You must be feeling uneasy.

460
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,688
Oh, no, no. I'm fine. Mm.

461
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,858
While I was there, I heard the police say

462
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:03,069
you inherited the family resting grounds 
from your late uncle.

463
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,363
[sinister music playing]

464
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:06,281
Yes.

465
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,742
The police told you all that?

466
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,327
Mm, no.

467
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,163
Actually, I think 
it was a theory of theirs.

468
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,874
Like maybe you two were fighting

469
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,668
because of the burial ground 
or something, you know…

470
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:21,337
[sighs in exasperation]

471
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,716
-I really can't believe this. 
-Yeah, it's not true, is it?

472
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,885
I know you, Ms. Yoon. 
You wouldn't kill someone.

473
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:31,931
Well, the police are just… 
considering all of the possible angles.

474
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,976
[laughs awkwardly] 
I shouldn't have brought it up.

475
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,688
You-- You're uncomfortable.

476
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:41,441
Uh-uh. No, I get that 
they're looking for answers.

477
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,736
It was a surprise inheritance, so…

478
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,491
I should probably head home now.

479
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:55,204
If you need anything, 
feel free to contact me anytime.

480
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,122
Yes.

481
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,543
[unsettling music playing]

482
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:02,962
Oh, ma'am.

483
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:04,422
[Seo-ha] Yes?

484
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:07,592
There's a guy I know… 
Actually, he's a close friend of mine.

485
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:08,968
He owns a building.

486
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:11,179
He keeps it in great condition

487
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,598
and his tenants 
always pay their rent on time.

488
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:17,852
Well, he wants to sell his building 
to someone who's educated, an academic.

489
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:21,648
And I know that you're highly educated. 
You're a great educator, I mean.

490
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,567
It just crossed my mind, 
so I thought I should mention it to you.

491
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,904
Since you already have a burial ground, 
I just thought that…

492
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:31,532
Well, since you weren't really 
on great terms with your family,

493
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,661
wouldn't getting rid of it be better?

494
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,788
It's probably bad luck, don't you think?

495
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:41,334
-Hmm. Yes, well… 
-Do you want to hear about the offer?

496
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,503
-Hmm. 
-Well, just give it some thought.

497
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,089
-Sure. Good night, then. 
-Yes.

499
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,650
Mr. Kang.

500
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,740
You see, my friend has a daughter… 
who met this doctor fella.

501
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,492
Wouldn't you know it? She gets pregnant.

502
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,536
Now they're getting married,

503
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:19,330
but the boy's family 
wants my friend to buy him a clinic.

504
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:23,584
That's the reason he's in such a hurry 
to sell off his nice building.

505
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,254
But he needs money 
so he can't go below cost.

506
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:29,340
He can't sell it for anything 
under its price, can he?

507
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,802
That's why it seems 
like your situations are just right.

[ATM beeping]

531
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:02,511
You didn't even tip me after all that, 
you cheap sons of bitches. [groans]

532
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,022
Hello?

533
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,275
[faint chatter, laughter]

534
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,113
[man 1] You should have handled it 
before he passed out.

535
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,698
Get him the hell out of here!

536
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,367
Damn it.

537
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:27,495
[man 2] Ah, shit! Get up, you bastard.

538
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,206
Oh. Hey, you guys get out.

539
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,794
Oh, you're… Yoon.

540
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,214
Ah, it was Yoon, right?

541
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,258
You're Ms. Yoon Seo-ha, the professor?

542
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,342
[Seo-ha] Yes.

543
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,010
Hello. I own this building.

544
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:44,845
Ah, right, hello.

545
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:45,846
[chuckle]

546
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,475
Hong-sik, actually. 
I heard a lot about you from Mr. Kang.

547
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:53,020
-A pleasure. 
-Yes. Where shall we talk?

548
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:56,190
Ah, yes. Here. This way. Just over here.

549
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,528
Place was easy to find, wasn't it?

550
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:04,907
It's really a great location here.

551
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:13,874
Ms. Yoon.

552
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,420
This building, 
it might need a bit of work,

553
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:20,006
but if you're speaking of locations, 
nothing compares.

554
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,551
The street's always busy 
and this corner here…

555
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:24,927
If you were to redevelop,

556
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,763
we're talking a billion, 
even more, easy, you know?

557
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:32,268
Then why would you want to sell 
a place like this when it's worth a lot?

558
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:36,314
[groans] This daughter of mine 
is getting hitched, so that's the reason.

559
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,859
But the boy's family is a bit classy.

560
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,820
Blue bloods you could say, 
yeah. [chuckles]

561
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:47,450
I've just been working all this time, 
so I didn't have time to get classy.

562
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:50,202
Now though, with the in-laws 
scrutinizing me and everything,

563
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:53,706
I wanna show that 
we too can be classy if we want to.

564
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,917
So how much are you asking 
for this building?

565
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:00,129
Well, I won't ask for a deposit 
for the bar, you see?

566
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:04,300
I just wanna sell the whole building 
for three billion. How's that sound?

567
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,428
Mr. Kang told me you're highly educated,

568
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,805
and that's a huge plus 
for me to sell to you.

569
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,057
Three billion.

570
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,478
I couldn't prepare 
such a large sum of money out of the blue.

571
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,355
No, no, thank you.

572
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,024
You've inherited a plot.

573
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:23,110
Man, I wish my ancestors 
just passed down land to me.

574
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,863
Wouldn't that be great? [chuckles]

575
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,657
I heard the gist of it from Mr. Kang.

576
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,704
The land you got 
should be worth a billion and a half won.

577
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,539
And I heard you're a faculty member.

578
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,875
You're salaried, 
you should have no problem getting loans.

579
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:40,586
Use this building for collateral too.

580
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,506
That makes a billion and a half simple.

581
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:49,261
Right, yes, um… 
The inheritance will be awhile actually.

582
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,014
It'll be a bit longer than I expected.

583
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:52,973
Hmm?

584
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,434
There's a case related to the inheritance 
that's pending.

585
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,602
A case?

586
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:58,896
What case?

587
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,780
I mean, if we know this place of mine 
is to your liking

588
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,448
and you want to buy the building,

589
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:12,034
inheritance or any such issues…

590
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,371
well, you're lucky to have me, 
I'll get rid of it for you.

591
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,795
If there are any issues, 
Mr. Kang can handle it for you.

592
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:24,630
If you need assistance with anything.

593
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,715
Thank you. Okay. Have a good night.

594
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,300
Yes, let's talk again soon.

595
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,301
-Okay. 
-Bye now.

596
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:34,598
[faintly] Hey, sweetie.

Look me in the eyes, 
you nasty, disgraceful, haunting spirit!

608
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,442
You're stealing someone else's body,

609
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:53,070
and committing evil deeds in their name, 
so get out.

610
