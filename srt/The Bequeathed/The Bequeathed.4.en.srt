1
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:21,187
How am I supposed to go up against fate?

2
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:25,525
We'll all die if I don't do as I'm told. 
What am I supposed to do?

3
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,360
Fucking hell.

4
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,530
The burial ground.

5
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,784
I was told that I had a right to it too.

6
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:03,039
No.

7
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,417
I really need to have it.

8
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,963
That's the only way I can live.

9
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,510
I'm doing everything 
you're telling me to do.

10
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:20,932
I'm following all your orders, but why?

11
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,689
Why?

12
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,486
Dad.

13
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,907
Dad, please say something.

14
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:42,704
I'm your child, just like Seo-ha.

15
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:49,752
It makes me sad, too, 
that my brother-in-law died like that.

16
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,590
It breaks my heart too.

17
00:02:55,717 --> 00:03:00,722
I don't want to live like this anymore!

18
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,913
Please.

19
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,539
YOON SEO-HA AND KANG HONG-SIK WILL DIE

20
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,792
Please stop doing this. Please!

21
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,826
THE BEQUEATHED

22
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,567
You are off course. Recalculating route.

23
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,444
What's wrong with this?

24
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,155
Shit, where do you want me to go?

25
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,574
The map's out of control--

26
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,496
Who's that? A monk?

27
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,374
Shit, that was close.

28
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,378
Thank the Buddha, huh?

29
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:15,083
Sir, Kim Young-ho is on the move. 
I'll follow him closely.

30
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,973
You have reached your destination. 
Ending navigation.

31
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,059
Here it is. Gyeongamsa Temple.

32
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,143
GYEONGAMSA TEMPLE

33
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,090
Is this a temple or a house?

34
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,136
Or a fortune-telling place?

35
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:13,015
GYEONGAMSA TEMPLE 
RITUAL

36
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,688
They do all kinds of rituals…

37
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,692
and talismans too.

38
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,617
Hello?

39
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,456
Is anyone here?

40
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,193
KANG HONG-SIK: I'M AT KIM YOUNG-HO'S PLACE

41
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,863
DID YOU FIND ANYTHING?

42
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,032
PLEASE CONTACT ME WHEN YOU SEE THIS

43
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,368
YOU DIDN'T GET CAUGHT BY KIM, DID YOU?

44
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,577
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

45
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:08,673
Damn it!

46
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,509
What's going on? This is bothering me!

47
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,060
READ

48
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,445
JUST SAW YOUR MESSAGES 
ALL IS WELL

49
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,364
I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO TELL YOU IN PERSON

50
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:43,708
WHERE SHOULD I GO?

51
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:50,381
PLEASE COME TO THE FOLLOWING ADDRESS

52
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,960
Sir, Kim Young-ho 
is currently following Yoon Seo-ha.

53
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:31,380
Stay close to him. 
We don't know what that bastard might do.

54
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,381
Yes, sir.

55
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,259
Traffic congestion two kilometers ahead.

56
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,594
ARRIVING AT 10:55 A.M.

57
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,513
It is expected to last 
for approximately ten minutes.

58
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,474
MA'AM, I'LL SEE YOU AT 11 A.M.

59
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:44,226
Traffic congestion two kilometers ahead.

60
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,895
-Why is the time adding up? 
-Drive safely.

61
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:46,979
ARRIVING AT 11:05 A.M.

62
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,693
Sis!

63
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,115
What's he doing here?

64
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,742
Sis!

65
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,415
Shit!

66
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:46,784
Who are you?

67
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,303
Sis, open the door.

68
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,513
Fuck, I didn't tell him to do it!

69
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,933
-You're gonna die! 
-I didn't fuckin' do it! Get lost!

70
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:58,230
Please open the door, sis!

71
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,607
Sis!

72
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,275
Sis!

73
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,988
Sis! Please!

74
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,406
Kim Young-ho! Stop it!

75
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,449
Sis!

76
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,868
-Sis! 
-Hey, stop!

77
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,786
Stop it, bastard!

78
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,371
Stay still.

79
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,708
Please let me have the burial ground.

80
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:18,959
Be quiet.

81
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,879
It's the only way you'll live!

82
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:22,963
Back off.

83
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,758
Sis, do you want to die?

84
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,302
Stop moving.

85
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,971
If you want to live,

86
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,809
please give up on the burial ground!

87
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,113
Hey, you okay?

88
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,406
I feel like I'm gonna die.

89
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,076
-Come out, you bastard. 
-Damn!

90
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,954
Let's go. Move it, prick.

91
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:00,709
Sir, where are you? 
Kim Young-ho is in custody.

92
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,880
I knew that asshole would make a move. 
Where are both of them?

93
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:09,134
Kim's in the interrogation room. 
Ms. Yoon is resting in the waiting room.

94
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,973
Dae-su, did you check 
the address Ms. Yoon received?

95
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,558
Yes, the address was 34, Miha-ri.

96
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,144
Officers have been dispatched 
from a nearby station.

97
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,312
Okay, good.

98
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,431
Man, what kind of address is this?

99
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,102
This is 34, Miha-ri?

100
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,427
Sir!

101
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,263
Sir!

102
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:23,894
Anyone from forensics?

103
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,146
-Coming. 
-Please handle the body with care.

104
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,524
-Up! 
-Yes, I got it!

105
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,775
Back up slowly.

106
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,071
Please get out! You can't be here.

107
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,076
A body was found by that stream recently.

108
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,160
Maybe a serial killer?

109
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:43,705
The car is burnt to a crisp. 
There might be nothing left.

110
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,542
I found a cell phone!

111
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,667
This place looks different 
from the pictures on the Internet.

112
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,921
They were taken ten years ago, silly.

113
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,507
Why are you here?

114
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,844
You don't seem the type 
to come and pray at places like this.

115
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:43,515
There are talismans hanging outside. 
It seems you perform rituals here.

116
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,436
I hope there are no legal issues 
with a Buddhist temple doing these things.

117
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:52,024
Monks are human too. 
We have to make a living.

118
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,818
Well, I didn't come here to argue.

119
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,529
I'm just here to ask you a few things.

120
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,156
Well…

121
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,492
do you…

122
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,788
recognize this talisman?

123
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,425
What is this?

124
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,594
What was it drawn with?

125
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,054
Chicken blood, why?

126
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,974
Disciples don't use chicken blood 
very often these days.

127
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,811
Is this meant to be a samjaebu?

128
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:37,486
It's an old-fashioned method. 
I'm not really sure what this is.

129
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:39,988
Oh, really?

130
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,243
Then, could you take a look at this one?

131
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,667
Did this person ever stay here?

132
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,338
I heard he lived here 
for some time when he was young.

133
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,882
If it was when he was young, 
I wouldn't know him.

134
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:02,469
I only inherited this temple 
from my spirit mother 15 years ago.

135
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:03,720
Your spirit mother?

136
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,682
She wasn't in good health,

137
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,018
so she passed it down to me 
when I was a disciple here.

138
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:16,441
Come to think of it, my spirit mother 
may have used an old method like this.

139
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,986
Where is your spirit mother now?

140
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:22,072
She has dementia. She's in a nursing home.

141
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,573
Monk,

142
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,451
would you like to go for a drive with me?

143
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,455
Mr. Kim,

144
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,582
why were you following Ms. Yoon?

145
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,046
I was worried about her getting hurt.

146
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,216
And why did you think she would get hurt?

147
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:45,012
For my sister, that burial ground is…

148
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:47,973
What did you say?

149
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,896
That burial ground 
is wrapping around all her energy.

150
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,440
Her energy?

151
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,945
Stop spouting bullshit 
and focus on my questions, Kim.

152
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:06,033
I gave a clear warning 
that this has to stop now.

153
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,118
Stop, this can't happen--

154
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:11,163
Hey, Kim Young-ho. 
Look at me and answer my question!

155
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:14,708
Stop.

156
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:18,337
Stop.

157
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,006
Stop.

158
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:25,802
-Sir, a word? 
-Stop.

159
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:32,768
Stop.

160
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,939
Kang Hong-sik was found dead.

161
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:42,152
Fuck! This is just like 
the Yang Jae-seok case.

162
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,446
What did forensics say?

163
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,448
The body was set on fire,

164
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,993
so the exact time and cause of death 
might take a while to confirm.

165
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,038
Did they find Kang's phone?

166
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,791
Yes, it was found by the passenger seat,

167
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,377
but the messages exchanged

168
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,629
between Kang and Yoon 
seem quite suspicious.

169
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:05,550
Apparently, Yoon Seo-ha had Kang 
following Kim Young-ho all this time.

170
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,177
What?

171
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,686
What in the world is going on here?

172
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:21,942
Have some warm water.

173
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:22,943
I'm fine.

174
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,405
Detective, what about Kim Young-ho?

175
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,076
-Ms. Yoon. 
-Yes?

176
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,205
Mr. Kang Hong-sik was found dead 
this morning.

177
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,254
A few nights ago, 
the last message you received from him

178
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,256
said that he was going to Kim's house.

179
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:47,884
And this morning, you received 
a message with an address, right?

180
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:51,847
Yes, that's right.

181
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,184
Why did Mr. Kang 
go to Kim Young-ho's house?

182
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,272
I don't know anything about that.

183
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,278
There's a message on Mr. Kang's phone 
showing that you asked him for a favor.

184
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,363
You must tell me the truth.

185
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:15,370
But shouldn't you have at least suspected 
Kim Young-ho at some point?

186
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:19,791
Even so, that doesn't mean you can use 
illegal methods to tail and watch people.

187
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:23,253
You're partly responsible 
for Mr. Kang's death!

188
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:27,674
But I felt like I was in danger 
because of my stepbrother

189
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,593
or whatever he is, you know.

190
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:33,680
And you cops 
never even bothered to help me!

191
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,685
Well, I mean,

192
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,481
I'll tell you the truth, Detective. 
The thing is,

193
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:47,360
Mr. Kang went to Kim Young-ho's house, 
and then I lost contact with him,

194
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,945
so I was worried too.

195
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:52,449
But then he suddenly asked to meet me, 
so I was on my way to see him,

196
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:55,035
and Kim Young-ho showed up 
and tried to kill me!

197
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,204
Ms. Yoon. Please calm down and--

198
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,498
I'm sure I'm next. Yes, I'm next.

199
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,959
This would never have happened 
if you had locked that guy up.

200
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,878
Now he's even got to Mr. Kang.

201
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:10,008
Ms. Yoon, the detectives on the team 
are doing their best to investigate.

202
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,593
If you could just wait a bit--

203
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,346
So you can keep idling 
and let him escape again?

204
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:17,516
Release him again? 
You cops are always like this.

205
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,269
We do have circumstantial evidence 
that makes Kim Young-ho a suspect.

206
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:25,941
But we still need to find 
concrete evidence!

207
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,108
I knew it.

208
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:31,446
It was him all along.

209
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:39,496
It wasn't me. It really wasn't me.

210
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:42,707
I don't even know who Kang Hong-sik is.

211
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,795
Why would I kill someone 
that I don't even know?

212
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:53,843
You went to the funeral of Yang Jae-seok, 
Yoon Seo-ha's husband, right?

213
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,847
You met Kang Hong-sik there.

214
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:01,768
I've never seen Kang Hong-sik 
or anyone like that.

215
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,358
Kang Hong-sik was also there that day.

216
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,860
He talked with Yoon Seo-ha for a while.

217
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,490
You and Kang Hong-sik 
were both at the funeral home

218
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,159
at around 8:15 p.m. 
The times coincide perfectly.

219
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:21,413
But you never fuckin' saw him?

220
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:29,087
Look me in the eye, you son of a bitch.

221
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:35,010
Yoon Seo-ha paid Kang to dig into you, 
and then he was murdered.

222
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,389
What are you saying?

223
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,975
Why would my sister do that to me?

224
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:47,689
If at your place we find a shotgun 
and some Remington buckshot shells

225
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:51,735
and trace the location of Kang's phone 
before he died, you're finished!

226
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,865
You killed Yang Jae-seok 
and Kang Hong-sik with these hands!

227
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,700
No!

228
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,661
It wasn't me! No!

229
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:05,874
Go to this bastard's house right now, 
and search for bullets and empty shells!

230
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,375
This asshole…

231
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,252
It wasn't me.

232
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,837
…is the culprit, I'm sure.

233
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:17,510
I said I didn't kill them, motherfucker.

234
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:19,888
It wasn't me.

235
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,099
Goddamn! It wasn't me!

236
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,644
Not me!

237
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,145
Stop it, asshole!

238
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:28,730
Hey!

239
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,524
Hold still, you bastard!

240
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,404
I'll get that warrant, no matter what!

241
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,531
Get ready for the search and seizure!

242
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:46,998
DASARANG NURSING HOME

243
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:56,758
Mom!

244
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,511
Your disciple is here.

245
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:03,264
Honey, why did you come so late?

246
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,518
I've been waiting for you 
with your birthday meal ready.

247
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,604
Hello, ma'am.

248
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:14,025
Here, please have a look at this photo.

249
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,278
Honey, who is this person?

250
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,114
I'm scared.

251
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:23,284
Ma'am, do you perhaps 
recognize this talisman?

252
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,209
Wait, this is the samdumae.

253
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:37,298
But hang on. 
An amateur must have drawn this.

254
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:42,387
What matters most is the mindset 
of the person drawing the talisman.

255
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,474
Look at this.

256
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,977
This hawk has two legs, right?

257
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,730
This is unacceptable!

258
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,066
"Three-headed, one-legged hawk."

259
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,653
It's a talisman to ward off 
three types of disasters.

260
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:03,867
There should be three heads, 
one body, and one leg.

261
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,411
Who drew this?

262
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:10,665
What kind of a stupid shaman 
drew such a sloppy talisman?

263
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,085
My mom is so clear-headed.

264
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,379
She's still got it!

265
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,466
I think I know who drew this.

266
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,384
Who?

267
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:24,429
You drew it, bitch!

268
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:28,349
I told you never to draw 
your talismans like this!

269
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,185
But you messed it up again!

270
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:34,981
If you keep being lazy in your training, 
you'll never become my disciple.

271
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,233
I won't?

272
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:42,113
You brought your child here and begged me.

273
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:45,200
It was such a pitiful sight, 
so I let you stay.

274
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:50,121
But how do you expect me to accept 
a lazy student like you as my disciple?

275
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:54,626
Besides, your son doesn't have 
the divine illness.

276
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:58,087
Son? My son? You mean Kim Young-ho?

277
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:02,801
If he really has the divine illness, 
he should be sick, feverish, and dreaming.

278
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:06,888
But that boy of yours is healthy and calm.

279
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,474
There's no way he's been possessed.

280
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,644
He's not going to be a shaman!

281
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:18,983
You think I don't know that you're trying 
to step into this game by using a child?

282
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,069
I know. I'm sorry about that.

283
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,363
So, my son is Kim Young-ho, right?

284
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,948
Whatever!

285
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:29,869
You can't even draw a proper talisman, 
so I want you and your son to leave now!

286
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:33,540
It's true that my son and I 
stayed with you, right?

287
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,917
Get out! Leave, you bitch!

288
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,253
Please go if you've got what you need!

289
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,255
-My goodness! 
-She needs to rest.

290
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,340
-The bitch can't even write a talisman. 
-Mom.

291
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,510
Yes, Prosecutor Kim.

292
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:50,682
As long as a warrant is issued, 
we will have no problem securing evidence.

293
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:55,854
Why, of course! 
I guarantee everything about this case.

294
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:57,897
Yes.

295
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,984
Then I trust 
we'll get the warrant right away.

296
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,527
Sure.

297
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,779
Take care, Mr. Kim.

298
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,121
Are you sure Kim Young-ho is the culprit?

299
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:16,040
Something's definitely wrong with him. 
I'm sure of it.

300
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,626
Please just trust me this once, Chief.

301
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,337
You better not be wrong this time.

302
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,548
If you are, I'll make sure you get fired.

303
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:24,465
Now get out.

304
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:26,551
Thank you, sir.

305
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,483
Hey, let's move it!

306
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:48,698
Listen up, everyone.

307
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:52,201
Look for a shotgun, Remington shells, 
bullets, photos, notebooks,

308
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,537
fingernails, toenails, strands of hair,

309
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,956
or anything 
that could be used as evidence.

310
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,708
Let's stay focused.

311
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,503
We have to find that shotgun.

312
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,257
This way, sir.

313
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,689
What's this? 
Hey, take a closer look inside.

314
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:28,029
Here's a syringe. Give me a bag.

315
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,413
Detective Seo! 
I think I've found something.

316
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:38,373
What's this?

317
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,044
Forensics!

318
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,376
What's that fucking noise?

319
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,224
Crazy asshole.

320
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,026
YOON SEO-HA 
YOON YOUNG-HO

321
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,114
"Yoon Young-ho"?

322
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:28,042
-Did you get Kim's location history? 
-Yes, sir.

323
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,711
Kang Hong-sik's last pinged location

324
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,631
matches the address of the field 
where the body was found.

325
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:36,968
We discovered that he had set Kim's house 
as the destination on his GPS.

326
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,553
-And… 
-And?

327
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,389
I also checked 
Kim Young-ho's phone location history.

328
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:44,308
I was right, huh? 
Their routes should overlap.

329
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,393
Well,

330
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:46,853
I'm sorry, sir.

331
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,939
They don't overlap in the same time frame.

332
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:50,857
What?

333
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,402
Are you sure you checked it right?

334
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,988
That doesn't make any sense.

335
00:35:57,071 --> 00:36:01,200
Yes. I've looked everywhere, 
but there's no section where they overlap.

336
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,953
What about Kim Young-ho's car?

337
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:06,080
There must be something in his car!

338
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:06,998
Yes.

339
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:10,835
But there was nothing 
like a firearm or a bloodstain.

340
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,094
Sir.

341
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,849
We swept the greenhouse, 
the living room, and the rooms,

342
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,185
but there was no evidence to be found.

343
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,770
But the shotgun must be here.

344
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,190
I checked the backyard too. 
There's nothing.

345
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,942
Dig up the ground 
if you have to, you idiot!

346
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,070
How could there be nothing?

347
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:46,162
If we don't find anything here…

348
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,874
we are all screwed.

349
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,667
Do you understand me?

350
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:52,710
Yes, sir.

351
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:03,387
YOON SEO-HA 
YOON YOUNG-HO

352
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,723
Besides, your son doesn't have 
the divine illness.

353
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:08,517
Son? My son? You mean--

354
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,105
Hey, did you find anything?

355
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,441
It's just like we discussed

356
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,985
during Yang Jae-seok's autopsy.

357
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:18,903
Yeah.

358
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:21,239
A few DNA samples 
were found around the neck.

359
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,156
Really?

360
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:30,998
YOON SEO-HA

361
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,296
-Yes? 
-Ms. Yoon.

362
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,091
This is Detective Park 
from Namil Police Station.

363
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,927
Regarding the recent incident 
with the blood,

364
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:47,181
you should file a complaint against Kim. 
I'm sure he's the culprit.

365
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,892
You haven't found any evidence, have you?

366
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:52,937
Give us a bit more time.

367
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:58,109
As long as we have reason to hold him, 
we will be able to find solid evidence.

368
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,195
Please trust us 
and proceed with your complaint.

369
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,616
I'm not going to file a complaint.

370
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,287
Hello?

371
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,414
Hello?

372
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,291
Shit!

373
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,064
-Sir. 
-Get off!

374
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,151
Move! Damn it!

375
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:25,571
CHIEF KIM MU-SEON

376
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,490
HOW'S THE SEARCH GOING? 
FOUND ANYTHING?

377
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,658
I HEARD ABOUT KANG 
AND KIM'S PHONE LOCATIONS

378
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:37,500
WE'RE STILL LOOKING, SIR

379
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,882
I WAS AN IDIOT FOR TRUSTING YOU

380
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:45,966
YOU WORTHLESS SHIT

381
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:52,264
HAVE KIM YOUNG-HO RELEASED IMMEDIATELY 
AND RETURN TO STATION NOW

382
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:59,772
Yeah. Two DNA profiles were detected.

383
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,899
One was confirmed to be Yang Jae-seok's,

384
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,026
and the other is still being identified.

385
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,613
You said that this might be related 
to Yoon Myung-gil's burial ground, right?

386
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:08,614
I did.

387
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:10,991
So this time I conducted

388
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,702
an mtDNA test on Kim Young-ho's DNA

389
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,539
and the DNA found on Yang Jae-seok's body.

390
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:20,418
It turns out Kim shares maternal lineage 
with the source of this blood.

391
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,461
-Maternal lineage? 
-Yeah.

392
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:26,632
Does Kim Young-ho have any other family? 
A sister or anyone on his mother's side?

393
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,426
It'd be good to compare them.

394
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,970
Same maternal lineage, huh?

395
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,848
I'll tell you what's even more striking.

396
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:38,561
I compared this with Yoon Seo-ha's DNA, 
and I didn't get a match.

397
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:40,062
Isn't that a given?

398
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:43,107
Kim Young-ho and Yoon Seo-ha 
share a father.

399
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,776
They don't share a mother, 
so their DNA can't be a match!

400
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,528
No, that's not what I mean.

401
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,781
Yoon Seo-ha and the source of this blood.

402
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,701
They are not a maternal match 
but a paternal match.

403
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,287
They both have Yoon's father's DNA.

404
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,705
PATERNAL LINEAGE MATCH 73.999998%

405
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,707
Hey, what the hell are you talking about?

406
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,708
You dumbass!

407
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:04,128
Kim Young-ho, Yoon Seo-ha, 
and the source of this blood,

408
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,714
their paternal lineage all match up.

409
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,841
KIM'S MOTHER - KIM YOUNG-HO 
YOON MYUNG-HO (FATHER)

410
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:13,053
This person is Kim's maternal relative 
and also Yoon Seo-ha's paternal relative.

411
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,556
I don't know how this is possible.

412
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,308
By the way,

413
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,769
the DNA belongs to a female 
with type A blood.

414
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:25,816
A female relative with blood type A?

415
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:31,071
Check if Kim Young-ho and Yoon Seo-ha 
have any unknown relatives, just in case.

416
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,908
-Okay, I will. 
-Yeah. Hang in there.
