1
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,403
No need to cry your heart out over this.

2
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:31,156
You're okay.

3
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:35,326
Daddy will be coming in soon. 
Go wait inside, okay?

4
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,078
There, there. It's okay.

5
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:52,635
Seo-ha.

6
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,723
How did you get all the way here?

7
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,976
Does your mom know you're here?

8
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,941
Is she doing okay?

9
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,486
Mom's doing fine.

10
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:16,534
I think she might be getting married 
to someone who treats her well.

11
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,080
And you?

12
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,915
Are you okay?

13
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,167
Does he treat you well too?

14
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,715
He's a much better person than you, Dad.

15
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,177
He treats me well too.

16
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,347
Like a real daughter.

17
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,605
Then why did you come here?

18
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,275
To see how you are doing.

19
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,861
To see for myself.

20
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,783
Dad, what are you doing over there?

21
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,121
Nothing special. I'm coming in now.

22
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,794
You'd better go back now.

23
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,004
And…

24
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,216
please don't do this again.

25
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,219
Showing up here unannounced

26
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,638
is awkward for both of us.

27
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,187
Goodness, Professor Yoon!

28
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,940
What brings you here? 
You didn't even call.

29
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,193
You've had a drink too?

30
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,864
Anyway, I'm glad you're here. 
I have something to ask you.

31
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,201
Take a look at these.

32
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,579
These are the drafts 
for my daughter's wedding invitation--

33
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:27,498
Sir, I came here to talk to you.

34
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,335
Yes, of course. We should talk.

35
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:31,920
Yes.

36
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,050
You came to talk 
about what happened to Hong-sik, right?

37
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,637
Yes.

38
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,390
How dare that son of a bitch 
mess with my boy?

39
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,810
I cared so much for Hong-sik!

40
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:52,106
And the killer set him on fire, 
as if shooting him dead wasn't enough?

41
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,734
I heard that

42
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,154
the culprit is your half-brother.

43
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,032
He's lucky that the cops got to him first.

44
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:04,911
If it were me, I would've made sure 
that he never walked again.

45
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,830
Anyway,

46
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:12,168
we should get on with the deal 
for this building, shouldn't we?

47
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:17,173
Yes, about that, as you already know, 
the inheritance hasn't been resolved yet.

48
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,174
Still?

49
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,010
That bastard has been preparing 
a paternity suit

50
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,680
to claim a right to the burial ground.

51
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:29,102
How can he do that if he's convicted? 
That won't be an issue at all.

52
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,604
No, unfortunately not. That bastard

53
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,651
keeps denying that he killed anyone.

54
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:40,405
Well, the police must have some kind 
of evidence if they're holding him.

55
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:41,614
Don't worry, Ms. Yoon.

56
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,452
But the thing is, 
they don't have any evidence yet.

57
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,662
What?

58
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:51,374
Are you telling me 
that he might walk if he doesn't confess?

59
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,876
Then who the fuck killed Hong-sik?

60
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,587
How can they release 
a murder suspect like that?

61
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,257
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

62
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,427
If the police release him, 
I can't do anything about it.

63
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,014
Then I won't be receiving 
the inheritance for a while,

64
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,891
which means I can't buy your building.

65
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,227
Fucking hell! That's no good!

66
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,896
What's wrong with those damned cops?

67
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,440
Goddamn it!

68
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,068
Shit.

69
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,574
DETECTIVE PARK SANG-MIN

70
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,163
-Yes? 
-Ms. Yoon.

71
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,331
Yes.

72
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,666
This is Detective Park 
from Namil Police Station.

73
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,502
Regarding the recent incident 
with the blood,

74
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,130
you should file a complaint against Kim.

75
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,133
I'm sure he's the culprit.

76
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,803
You haven't found any evidence, have you?

77
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,432
Give us a bit more time.

78
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:54,687
As long as we have reason to hold him, 
we will be able to find solid evidence.

79
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,357
Please trust us 
and proceed with your complaint.

80
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,152
-I'm not going to file a complaint. 
-Ms. Yoon--

81
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,949
If that guy walks,

82
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,703
I'll arrange for a lawyer friend of mine

83
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,039
to scare him a little

84
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:16,250
and talk some legal sense into him 
to secure a signed agreement.

85
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,502
Don't you worry.

86
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,047
Hong-sik told me

87
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:25,551
that your father lived 
with that half-brother of yours.

88
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,389
That bastard stole your father's love

89
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,641
and even killed your husband.

90
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,061
Are you going to let him take 
half your inheritance?

91
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,898
If it were me, 
I'd never let that shit happen.

92
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:40,942
So,

93
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,070
shall we proceed or not?

94
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:47,990
Please do.

95
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,285
I'll leave it to you.

96
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,747
You made the right decision.

97
00:06:56,416 --> 00:07:00,837
You should get that inheritance already 
and start a new life, right?

98
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,956
THE BEQUEATHED

99
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:37,915
CHIEF'S OFFICE

100
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,834
You said Kim Young-ho was the one!

101
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:44,338
I kissed Prosecutor Kim's ass 
just to get you that fuckin' warrant,

102
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,215
and you screw up once again?

103
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,800
Shit!

104
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,722
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

105
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,393
Hey, what is this?

106
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,604
I'll take responsibility and resign.

107
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,274
I heard they're reducing personnel 
in our station anyway.

108
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,902
And I'm aware of the rumor about me

109
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,029
getting laid off.

110
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,615
I can't believe this idiot.

111
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,366
Listen, you fool.

112
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,579
Do you think you even deserve 
to hand in a resignation?

113
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:19,999
Damn it.

114
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,800
As for the personnel reduction, 
Choi Sung-jun will be leaving.

115
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:32,887
Sir?

116
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,056
Choi Sung-jun will be quitting.

117
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,352
He came to see me last night. 
The matter has been settled.

118
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,605
What you should do is sweet-talk him

119
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,149
into solving this case before he leaves.

120
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,317
Got it?

121
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,676
LANDLORD CHOI TAE-SEONG

122
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,224
HE JUST MET KIM YOUNG-HO 
DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH

123
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,642
JUST MAKE YOURSELF AN ALIBI

124
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:29,902
OKAY, THANK YOU

125
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:50,089
-Fuck! 
-Grab this asshole!

126
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,591
Stay put, you son of a bitch!

127
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,050
-Fuckin' bastard! 
-Asshole!

128
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,011
You son of a bitch!

129
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,931
-Hey. 
-Fuck you, son of a bitch!

130
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,224
Keep still, asshole!

131
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:01,976
Don't move!

132
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:10,651
NAMIL POLICE STATION

133
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,946
In my opinion, 
Kim Young-ho is not the culprit.

134
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,283
I don't get why 
Detective Park is so obsessed with him.

135
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,037
Hello, sir.

136
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:25,791
What are you all doing right now? 
I heard Kim Young-ho was released.

137
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,378
Did you organize protection?

138
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,382
-No. 
-What? What about Yoon Seo-ha?

139
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:38,220
I mean, Detective Park says 
we don't need to look out for her.

140
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,640
He just wants us to find evidence on Kim.

141
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,934
We're also frustrated 
about who we should listen to!

142
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,354
Someone else is the perpetrator.

143
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:49,106
-They are both in danger right now. 
-What?

144
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,693
Either of them could be the next victim!

145
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,780
Track down their locations 
and stay on them.

146
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,699
-Now! 
-Yes, sir. Let's go, guys!

147
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:12,046
ATTORNEY KIM JUNG-TAE

148
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,848
Hey, asshole. Stay still.

149
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,934
Get a hold of yourself, fucker!

150
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,772
Mom…

151
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,273
-Hey. 
-Mom!

152
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,571
-Hey, bring him here if he's awake. 
-Yes, sir!

153
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,032
Get up, asshole.

154
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,703
Up, you son of a bitch!

155
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,835
Who are you people?

156
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,133
Mr. Kim, you're not hurt, are you?

157
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:00,052
We're not bad guys. I'm a lawyer.

158
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,473
We're not doing this 
because we have anything against you.

159
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,560
We just have business to discuss, 
so don't get the wrong idea.

160
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:10,062
There's nothing difficult about this. 
You see here?

161
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,272
WITHDRAWAL OF LAWSUIT

162
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,898
We just need your thumbprints. Sign it.

163
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:13,899
-No. 
-Hurry up.

164
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,401
No!

165
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,820
Why the hell are you doing this?

166
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,613
Shut up, dumbass! Grab his thumb!

167
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,990
Get his thumbprint!

168
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:25,619
That burial ground belongs to me, 
you motherfucker!

169
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,371
What now? What the fuck?

170
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,956
Hey, wait a minute!

171
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,210
Hey, asshole!

172
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,463
You're asking for it!

173
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:41,177
Hey, get that fucking bastard! 
Get him, you idiots!

174
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,016
Get up, you bastard!

175
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,351
Son of a bitch!

176
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,564
-Someone catch him! 
-Motherfucker!

177
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:03,949
My leg!

178
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:10,289
Fuck!

179
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,958
-Grab that bastard! 
-Motherfuckers.

180
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,465
-Damn it! 
-Sons of bitches!

181
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,178
You fuckin' son of a bitch!

182
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:30,851
Hey!

183
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,269
Please stop!

184
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,312
Hey!

185
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,274
-Run down! 
-What the fuck was that?

186
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,404
What the fuck?

187
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,078
Help me.

188
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,748
Please help me!

189
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,087
Help me, sir.

190
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,714
-Sir, please help. 
-Hey.

191
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,176
Hey, get up.

192
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,179
Fuck. You're with them, aren't you?

193
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,560
Damn! This is gonna be a hassle!

194
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:14,937
Good evening, sir!

195
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,485
You!

196
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,823
Why did you let things get to this?

197
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:30,744
Did you get it signed?

198
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:35,040
Not yet, sir. 
That crazy bastard bit my nose and--

199
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,960
I'm sorry, sir.

200
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,213
Motherfucker!

201
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,093
That fucking bastard!

202
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,722
Hey!

203
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:04,028
LANDLORD CHOI TAE-SEONG

204
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,745
-Hey, Ms. Yoon. 
-Hello.

205
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,956
Did you get the agreement signed?

206
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,586
Well, he didn't exactly 
sign the agreement,

207
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:25,090
but we just have to make sure 
your half-brother disappears, right?

208
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:26,592
Wait, what are you--

209
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,345
Well, my position 
has become quite difficult.

210
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:33,599
But why? Mr. Choi, what happened?

211
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,185
This guy seems to be badly hurt.

212
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:37,686
What?

213
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,940
You just need him to disappear, right?

214
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:41,857
What?

215
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,276
You said he doesn't have 
any relatives around.

216
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,445
It wouldn't be a big deal 
if he goes away, huh?

217
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,031
Wait, what do you mean by that?

218
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,240
Shit!

219
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,617
The thing is,

220
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,953
this kid saw my face.

221
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,997
If he squeals later on,

222
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,459
that would put you in a tough spot too.

223
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:04,046
Anyway, we'll take 
good care of things here.

224
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,341
Just get the contract ready 
and meet me soon, okay?

225
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,343
Take care of things how?

226
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,721
You were just meant to scare him 
and get his thumbprints!

227
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:13,722
Ms. Yoon.

228
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,849
You don't need to worry so much.

229
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:19,520
-We're experts at these things! 
-I'm sorry, but this is just…

230
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,355
My kid's wedding is around the corner.

231
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,732
Do you really think I would mess this up?

232
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,237
I'll make this go away 
like it never happened!

233
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,655
No, but Mr. Choi--

234
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:37,496
What the hell is he thinking? 
That stupid son of a bitch.

235
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,084
Please leave a message after the--

236
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,188
Please leave a message after the--

237
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,106
Shit!

238
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:34,470
Hey.

239
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,433
Where are all the files 
on Yoon Myung-gil's acquaintances?

240
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:43,854
What's going on?

241
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:45,939
Where is everyone?

242
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:49,401
I sent them out to protect 
Kim Young-ho and Yoon Seo-ha.

243
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,572
Did our team have 
two leaders from the start?

244
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,241
No.

245
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,912
You've been the only leader 
from the beginning.

246
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,000
Sorry about that. It was urgent.

247
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,377
Both of them are in danger right now.

248
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:10,631
There seems to be someone manipulating 
Kim Young-ho using religion.

249
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,382
It might even be his mother--

250
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,052
You're really something, man.

251
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,471
I get that you're so talented,

252
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,474
but stop showing off, for fuck's sake!

253
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,226
Hey, what's wrong with you?

254
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,645
Did you tell the chief you're quitting?

255
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,357
Do you think I'm a joke?

256
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,777
Because I'm leading a lame investigation, 
fixated on Kim Young-ho?

257
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:36,198
No, not just the investigation. 
I am literally lame.

258
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,451
Sang-min, we don't have time 
for this crap right now.

259
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,246
Do you pity me 
because I'm about to get fired?

260
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,208
"Oh, he's crippled."

261
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,003
"How would he get by without a job?" 
Is this charity work for you?!

262
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,215
Why are you so freakin' 
full of yourself, man?

263
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:54,758
You bastard.

264
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,010
Cut it out for God's sake!

265
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,059
Sang-min, I'm sorry.

266
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:07,938
Bring it on, asshole.

267
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,439
Sang-min, please stop.

268
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,151
Just shut your mouth 
and come at me, asshole.

269
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,536
You aren't going to fight back? Why?

270
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,414
Because you can't hit a cripple?

271
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,457
Hit me!

272
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,545
You've always looked down on me, 
haven't you?

273
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:35,382
And your damn son made me a cripple!

274
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,217
You bastard!

275
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,020
I'm sorry, Sang-min.

276
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:34,983
I'm sorry.

277
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,237
Don't say that shit.

278
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,989
The more you apologize…

279
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,244
the more I feel like a total fool.

280
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,455
My wife left me like that

281
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,499
because I'm an idiot.

282
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,504
You know very well how pathetic I am.

283
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:01,760
But why are you looking at me 
with pity in your eyes?

284
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,682
Fuck, that makes me feel 
even more pathetic.

285
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,185
No, Sang-min.

286
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:16,108
Everything that's happened to you 
and my son is my fault.

287
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,445
When my wife collapsed…

288
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,826
I had no idea 
because I was too bent on catching perps.

289
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,661
-She died. 
-How could this happen?

290
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,789
She was such a kind person.

291
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,042
-But she did seem a bit weak. 
-What is going on?

292
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,627
Maybe that's why.

293
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,296
I feel so bad for them!

294
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,719
Are you the husband?

295
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,101
She went into hypoglycemic shock.

296
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:55,772
Your son had headphones on in his room, 
so she was found too late.

297
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,483
What were you doing?

298
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,120
What the hell were you doing?

299
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,501
It was an accident.

300
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,546
It wasn't Jun-hyung's fault.

301
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,801
But I found myself 
blurting out those words.

302
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,848
He was already blaming himself for it.

303
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,103
I shouldn't have said such a thing.

304
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:44,029
I thought he would realize over time 
that I didn't mean what I said.

305
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,823
Because we're family.

306
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,286
But I was wrong.

307
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:59,461
Had I corrected it then and there, 
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

308
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:32,953
Yes, Dae-su.

309
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:35,414
Sir, we found Kim Young-ho's car.

310
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:36,748
Yeah?

311
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,919
We tracked him down 
using security camera footage,

312
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:44,005
but its windows are shattered, 
and we can't find him.

313
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:44,923
What?

314
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:49,136
Check the nearby cameras first. 
Call me if you find any suspicious cars.

315
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,471
-Yes, sir. 
-What about Yoon Seo-ha?

316
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,140
We haven't found her yet.

317
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:56,977
She's not at home, but we'll contact you 
as soon as we find her.

318
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:58,478
Okay.

319
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,865
I got a call from the autopsy room.

320
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:13,076
They found DNA on Yang Jae-seok's neck.

321
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,413
Its owner is Kim's maternal relative 
and also Yoon's paternal relative.

322
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,706
A woman with type A blood.

323
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:22,127
DNA matching Kim Young-ho's maternal side 
and Yoon Seo-ha's paternal side?

324
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,462
What does that mean?

325
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:27,424
I'm not sure, but I think 
Kim Young-ho's mother is definitely alive.

326
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,217
We must find her.

327
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,512
Hey, wait a minute.

328
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,145
Yes, sir.

329
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:44,191
Do you have the info on the person 
who was close to Yoon Myung-gil's family?

330
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:48,487
Yes, do you mean the neighbor who knew 
the family well since they were young?

331
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,071
Yeah, that one.

332
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,657
Text me the address of that person now.

333
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,575
Will do, sir.

334
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:03,919
Let's go.

335
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:12,093
PARKING LOT

336
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,622
The person we're meeting now 
seems to have lived

337
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,416
where Yoon Myung-ho's family lived 
when they were young.

338
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,087
We need to find the woman 
Yoon Myung-ho chose over his daughter.

339
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,005
That's Kim Young-ho's mother.

340
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:53,635
This series of incidents happened 
right after Yoon Myung-gil died.

341
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:55,595
The culprit must be

342
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,015
a relative with a connection 
to the burial ground.

343
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,609
Tell me where your boss is.

344
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,903
I told you that we don't know either.

345
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,989
Seriously, why do you keep asking that?

346
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,158
You work here. You must've called him 
if he didn't show up for work.

347
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,412
I told you that he hasn't contacted us.

348
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:21,663
Seriously.

349
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,332
Stop bothering us and leave, okay?

350
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:28,920
You can go outside and contact him 
or look for him for all I care!

351
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,757
Ma'am.

352
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,385
You're dripping water on the floor. Ma'am.

353
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:39,055
At least give me a tip 
before you ask! Ma'am.

354
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,017
What a jerk.

355
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:52,360
YUJIN MEATS

356
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,363
Myung-ho was the oldest brother.

357
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:59,367
After him was Myung-gil, 
and then there was the youngest sister.

358
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,954
Myung-ho wasn't that crazy, you know.

359
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,707
That's a bit different from what I heard.

360
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,876
I heard the eldest was completely insane,

361
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:12,172
which was why the second son, Myung-gil, 
inherited the family burial ground.

362
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,592
I feel uncomfortable

363
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:19,012
talking to a stranger 
about another family's matters.

364
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,263
It's a rumor, after all.

365
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,474
This is a murder case.

366
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,810
Rumor or not, 
you should tell us what you know.

367
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,520
Well,

368
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:33,068
Myung-ho really cared a lot 
for his younger sister.

369
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,071
He treasured her very much.

370
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,907
Myung-hee was often teased by other kids,

371
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,076
and Myung-ho always protected her.

372
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,118
That's right.

373
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:48,458
Kids her age used to tease her a lot 
ever since she was little.

374
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:51,086
She also cried a lot over little things.

375
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,171
Children naturally feel like

376
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:55,757
the world is ending 
even over small things.

377
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,843
Even so, she cried all the time!

378
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:02,889
That's why Myung-ho stayed right by her 
even after she grew up.

379
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,894
They were so close that everyone 
in the neighborhood knew the two of them.

380
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:11,189
But then, they suddenly disappeared.

381
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,942
By that, do you mean

382
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,986
the two of them died at that time?

383
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,490
No, they didn't pass away. 
They probably got kicked out of the house.

384
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,409
Because when they left,

385
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,994
Myung-hee's belly was big.

386
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:26,454
She was pregnant?

387
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,498
Yes, pregnant!

388
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:32,252
There were rumors 
that Myung-ho was the baby's father

389
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,463
and that was why 
Myung-ho's father kicked them out.

390
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:39,092
Goodness, I told you that's not true!

391
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,510
They were siblings.

392
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,097
Of course it's true.

393
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:48,768
Why else would Myung-ho have vanished 
right when Myung-hee disappeared?

394
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:52,522
And someone saw them 
run away in the middle of the night.

395
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:58,361
Did anyone see the two of them 
running away at that time?

396
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:03,116
Yes. The old barber down the road 
said he had seen them.

397
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,200
And that's not all.

398
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,870
About three or four years after that,

399
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,038
word got around

400
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:13,752
that someone saw them 
living together in another neighborhood.

401
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,336
Come on now!

402
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,840
What's wrong with siblings living together 
after they leave their parents?

403
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,175
Nonsense.

404
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,427
Girl, it makes no sense that the jerk

405
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,680
who had abandoned his wife and kid 
was just living with his sister.

406
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:29,934
And someone saw Myung-hee 
carrying a three-year-old child

407
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,270
with Myung-ho by their side.

408
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:35,356
Kim Young-ho, Yoon Seo-ha, 
and the source of this blood,

409
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,776
their paternal lineage all match up.

410
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:42,530
This person is Kim's maternal relative 
and also Yoon Seo-ha's paternal relative.

411
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:46,242
They also heard 
that child calling Myung-ho "Daddy."

412
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:51,581
Are you saying that Ms. Yoon Myung-hee 
had a child with her biological brother?

413
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:55,251
I'm almost certain of it.

414
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,214
They had a child together in incest.

415
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:02,091
WOLGUNGJANG MOTEL

416
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,225
Please leave a mes--

417
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,143
Shit! Are you kidding me?

418
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:30,370
But not too long 
after that rumor went around,

419
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,872
Myung-ho returned home.

420
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:37,335
From then on, so many shamans 
kept going in and out of that house.

421
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,003
You bastard!

422
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:43,341
There is a ghost clinging to your back, 
committing evil deeds with your body.

423
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:47,679
They said Myung-ho became like that 
because of an evil spirit attached to him,

424
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:52,559
so they kept performing the ritual on him 
even though he was totally fine.

425
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:57,480
Meanwhile, Myung-hee took her child 
to stay at a strange temple.

426
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:58,773
Gyeongamsa Temple?

427
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,817
That's right! Gyeongamsa.

428
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,571
It was a temple 
where Buddhist monks practiced shamanism.

429
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,656
Why did she go to that temple?

430
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:09,576
Without Myung-ho, 
it was hard for her to live in peace.

431
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:14,998
I heard she had gone into hiding 
with her child to live away from people.

432
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:18,418
Apparently, her plan 
was to make a living through shamanism,

433
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:23,006
so she lied that her child had 
the divine illness when he didn't.

434
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:26,259
Besides, your son doesn't have 
the divine illness.

435
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:28,219
Son? My son? You mean Kim Young-ho?

436
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:32,599
Dear me. If people had found out 
her child was a product of incest,

437
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,934
they would've judged them so harshly.

438
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:39,689
I bet she wanted to hide 
from people as best as she could.

439
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,338
What was that?

440
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,563
Shit!

441
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,447
Come on!

442
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,869
Even their own family 
turned their backs on them.

443
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:38,623
Myung-hee probably wanted to stay 
out of sight for her child's sake

444
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:42,710
and live like she didn't even exist.

445
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:45,630
Damn it. How did it get stuck in there?

446
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:52,470
Why was Ms. Yoon Myung-hee teased 
by others when she was young?

447
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,266
Cleft palate.

448
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,353
She was born with a cleft palate,

449
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:04,148
but she got the surgery too late, 
so the other kids teased her a lot.

450
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,698
But who are you, ma'am?

451
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,617
I heard that Mr. Yoon lived alone.

452
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,786
I'm a local resident.

453
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,287
Are you close with Mr. Yoon?

454
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,957
Well, he's just a neighborhood friend.

455
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,419
It seems Mr. Yoon has no family.

456
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,503
Well…

457
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,422
How long has he been living on his own?

458
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,507
Oh, he had an older brother.

459
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,593
A crazy guy, but I heard he died.

460
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,291
I have just as much of a right 
to my uncle's burial ground as she does!

461
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,004
Let me go, you bastard!

462
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:37,046
