=Episode 22=

3
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,800
Mr. Wang,

4
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,110
why don't you work with us?

5
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,350
Then you can take revenge on Su Lan.

6
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,430
Compared to Su Lan,

7
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,920
I hate your family more.

8
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,310
(He must be taking her for Sheng Mian.)

9
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,240
Mr. Wang,

10
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,840
you think you can threaten me

11
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,000
by taking this woman?

12
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,430
Didn't Su Lan tell you?

13
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,510
I don't care for her at all.

14
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,400
I brought her here

15
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,070
just to get back my money.

16
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,040
Look at you.

17
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,590
Instead of hurting her,

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,230
why don't you save yourself?

19
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,800
Penny, what's wrong?

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,840
Do you feel unwell?

21
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,560
(So, they still love each other.)

22
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,680
(Sheng Mian's baby)

23
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,400
(can't live.)

24
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,590
Penny,

25
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,150
what you should do now

26
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,280
is to take care of yourself

27
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,240
and our baby.

28
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,520
Trust me and I will

29
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,800
take care of the rest, OK?

30
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,280
You were way too impulsive today.

31
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,240
No wonder Mr. Wang confused you.

32
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,430
Luckily, he's never seen Sheng Mian.

33
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,710
Anyway,

34
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,560
this is not your concern.

35
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,470
I got you involved.

36
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,470
If anything happened to you,

37
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,400
what would I do?

38
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,280
(Today, I indeed reacted badly.)

39
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,840
(Luckily, Yancheng didn't suspect me.)

40
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,750
I just want you
to divorce Sheng Mian soon.

41
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,870
I won't do it again.

42
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,190
I've sent my men

43
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,750
to watch Mr. Wang in the hospital.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,240
I'm glad you aren't hurt.

45
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,840
Go get some rest.

46
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,000
OK, then.

47
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,870
Send me the photo of Su Lan's brother.

48
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,360
I remember he was invited

49
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,310
to the Sheng's party.

50
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,560
He must have been there.

51
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,680
Check if there are any group photos.

52
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,270
(Oh no.)

53
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,680
(Am I in any group photos?)

54
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,640
OK. I get it.

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,960
I want some bread, too.

What?

75
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,310
The shoes were sold?

76
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,940
I asked you to tell me once in stock.

77
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,240
Sorry, Miss Xiao.

78
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,400
The other day,

79
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,870
Mr. Fu ordered the shoes.

80
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,680
A woman's name was carved on them.

81
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,390
Mr. Fu also asked us to deliver them

82
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,310
to his friend

83
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,800
before she goes to the party tomorrow.

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We're terribly sorry.

85
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,960
What's her name?

86
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,920
Let me check.

87
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,830
It's Penny.

88
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,320
Miss Xiao,

89
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,310
how about you come
and select other shoes?

90
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,350
No.

91
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,750
Penny is so terrible.

92
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,750
She stole everything.

93
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,320
Xiao Chuqing?

94
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,350
What a coincidence.

95
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,640
It's you.

96
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,630
Go tell your sister.

97
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,480
Stay away from what I love.

98
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,680
Either my man or my shoes,

99
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,480
I'll get them back.

100
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,560
You never own them.

101
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,750
So, she never steals anything.

102
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,390
You fail to get them

103
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,800
only because you're weak.

104
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,920
Don't get cocky.

105
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,560
In the name of Penny,

106
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,870
your sister toyed with Yancheng.

107
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,310
Let's how she'll end this.

108
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,830
Xiao Chuqing, don't forget.

109
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,310
My sister is pregnant.

110
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,480
She just visited doctor with me.

111
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,600
The doctor said,

112
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,920
it's probably a boy.

113
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,560
With the first child of the Fu's,

114
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,310
no other woman

115
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,800
can replace my sister.

116
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,560
I advise you

117
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,480
to reconcile with her.

118
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,070
It's our annual party tomorrow.

119
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,160
If you come and apologize to her,

120
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,230
I may persuade her

121
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,560
to forgive you.

122
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,200
(Xiao Chuqing,)

123
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,160
(you have to seize)

124
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,950
(this great chance.)

125
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,800
(So, tomorrow, Penny is going)

126
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,950
(to the Sheng's party.)

127
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,920
(Yancheng's first child)

128
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,160
(may not even live.)

129
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,950
The will is indeed fake.

130
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,160
Finally, we've confirmed

131
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,510
Su Lan stole the money

132
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,630
and faked a will.

133
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,040
Mr. Sheng married a dangerous woman.

134
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,430
We're done with this.

135
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,000
Shall we talk about ourselves?

136
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,080
Penny,

137
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,750
I don't care about the Sheng's.

138
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,800
I just know after all this,

139
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,070
I will be free.

140
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,590
Open it and see.

141
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:42,790
It's a gift for you.

142
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,750
Didn't you say

143
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,480
you would have
an important party tomorrow?

144
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,360
You can wear them.

145
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,950
You're pregnant.

146
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,800
Your feet swelled up.

147
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,950
So, I bought one size bigger.

148
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,640
Thank you.

149
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,150
They're beautiful.

150
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,480
But people say

151
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,510
when someone buys shoes for his lover,

152
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,070
they'll soon break up.

153
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,600
I don't care what people say.

154
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:10,820
I give you these shoes

155
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,000
because I want to be with you

156
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,240

I thought you weren't coming.

It's the first annual meeting

185
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,340
since Dad died.

186
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,480
I wouldn't miss it.
