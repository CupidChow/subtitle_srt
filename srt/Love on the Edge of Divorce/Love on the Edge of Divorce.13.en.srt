00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,940
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,880
This is what happened.

4
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,150
We really don't know what to do.

5
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,840
I know you have the best lawyers.

6
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,200
Could you please help us?

7
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,600
Your husband screwed it up.

8
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,400
But he sent you to beg me.

9
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,520
He...

10
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,640
Why isn't he here?

11
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,760
He left for some business.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,950
I can communicate with you.

13
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,200
You really care for him.

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,790
He wanted the best
for the studio and me.

15
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,560
That's why he lost his mind

16
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,070
and fell into Miss Xiao's trap.

17
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:30,990
I can help you.

18
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,720
But I have a condition.

19
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,960
What is it?

20
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,760
I'll do anything for my studio.

21
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:36,710
Date me.

22
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,430
Date you?

23
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,310
Mr. Fu, can you tell me why?

24
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,430
I want you to know

25
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,710
if your love for him

26
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,200
is really worth it.

27
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,950
Mr. Fu, they're in the coffee shop.

28
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,400
Have you made up your mind?

29
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,480
OK.

30
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,400
We'll date.

31
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,560
Let's go, then.

32
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,960
Now?

33
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,120
Sir, this is your reserved table.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,840
Mr. Liang?

35
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,030
What a coincidence.

36
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,630
I asked your wife out for some business.

37
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,400
Are we disturbing your date?

38
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,120
Wife?

39
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,470
Liang Hanqing!

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,680
You married Penny without telling me?

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,840
Yes, yes.

42
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,590
We didn't tell anyone.

43
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,030
Su, I'll explain to you later.

44
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,200
Liang Hanqing,

45
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,390
why didn't you tell Su about it?

46
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,430
You shouldn't have kept it from her.

47
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,270
Liang Hanqing,

48
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,240
I wait to see what you'll explain.

49
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,430
Let's call it a day.

50
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,360
I should go.

51
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,310
Miss Su.

52
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,200
What?

53
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,400
You don't need to wait.

54
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,800
Let him explain now.

55
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,360
Mr. Fu,

56
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,000
don't interfere too much.

57
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,710
I don't care about anyone else.

58
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,680
But I have to defend you.

59
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,680
A man shouldn't

60
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,240
hurt two women.

61
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,630
Now, make your choice.

62
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,870
Who do you want,

63
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,200
your wife or your lover?

64
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,960
(Penny has to beg Mr. Fu
for our studio.)

65
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,200
(Su,)

66
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,280
(tonight, punish me)

67
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,270
(as you wish.)

68
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,470
I want...

69
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,030
My wife.

70
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,520
Su, let me explain.

71
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,280
It's not like that at all.

72
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,150
Mr. Fu,

73
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,470
this is a family matter.

74
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,750
You crossed the line.

75
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,150
I just don't want you

76
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,400
to be deceived anymore.

77
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,240
Thanks for your concern.

78
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,800
But whatever Hanqing does,

79
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,280
I won't divorce him.

80
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,400
Why?

81
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,310
Because I love him.

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,080
You saw that.

83
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,560
He won't discard me, either.

84
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,590
Our relationship isn't that fragile.

85
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,120
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

86
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,630
And today, I dated you.

87
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,040
Hope you'll keep your promise.

88
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,480
Who said I would only date once?

89
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,900
- You...
- Date me one more time.

90
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,030
As compensation.

91
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,150
Come on.

92
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,650
I'm taking you somewhere.

93
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,910
(It's him.)

94
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,560
Dad is so happy today.

95
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,710
Come on.

96
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,430
(Three years ago)
Hope my daughter Mian

97
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,100
will go to her dream university.

98
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,030
Thanks, Dad.

99
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,950
And happy birthday to Weiyuan.

100
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,950
That's right. Today is her birthday.

101
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,510
Here. Let's cut the cake.

102
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,420
Come on.

103
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,430
(Do I have to be inferior)

104
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,480
(just because we don't share a mother?)

105
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,000
Watch out.

106
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,150
Are you OK?

107
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,640
Be very careful.

108
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,430
(I didn't know I could meet him again.)

109
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,360
Mr. Fu, the business division called.

110
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,100
You have a meeting
at the Fu's headquarters.

111
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:45,790
(Mr. Fu?)

112
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,480
(The Fu's headquarters?)

113
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,070
(Is he Fu Yancheng?)

114
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,150
(Sheng Mian?)

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,240
(Why are they together?)

116
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,920
(The man I've been missing)

117
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,510
(turns out to be Sheng Mian's husband)

118
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,750
(and my brother-in-law.)

119
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,790
(Wait.)

120
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,480
(Fu Yancheng hates Sheng Mian.)

121
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,190
(He can't be so close to her.)

122
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,870
(There must be something fishy.)

123
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,560
Mr. Fu, you're back.

124
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,720
How soon will our ball start?

125
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,000
In three months.

126
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,950
We'll hold it next week.

127
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,150
But Mr. Fu,

128
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,360
we're short on time.

129
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,560
Is there a problem?

130
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,800
If you don't want to be my assistant,

131
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,480
I can get another one.

132
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,760
No problem.

133
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,800
Tonight, send a gown to Miss Penny.

134
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,030
Also,

135
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,600
invite all the people
who terminated their contracts

136
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,680
with Miss Penny.

137
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,560
OK.

138
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:57,910
Miss Penny.

139
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,000
At Mr. Fu's order,

140
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,420
this is where I have to leave you.

141
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,040
Please enjoy this ball

142
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,720
that is held for you.

143
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,870
For me?

144
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,870
(Let me see)

145
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,310

Everybody.

169
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,000
Let me introduce someone.

170
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,790
This is the new designer,

171
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,080
Ms. Penny.

172
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,240
She's very talented.

173
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,840
She's working on the design

174
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,240
of Yu Jing Yuan Villa.

175
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,670
So, she designed that villa.

176
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,270
We happen to need a designer.

177
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,080
I wonder if you're interested.

178
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,080
Of course.

179
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,100
I'd love to hear about it.

180
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,030
OK. I'll visit you later.

181
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,370
OK.

182
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,510
(Isn't she the designer)

183
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,960
(I just sacked?)

184
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,960
(Why is she so close to Fu Yancheng?)

185
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:16,870
Mr. Zhou.

186
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,720
I remember you just sacked a designer.

187
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,200
Would you like to cooperate

188
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,040
with Miss Penny?

189
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,080
Mr. Fu,

190
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,950
you remember it wrong.

191
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,910
My subordinates

192
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,870
must have mistaken that thing.

193
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,750
My last designer

194
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,510
is as excellent as Miss Penny.

195
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,390
We'll keep cooperating with her.

196
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,470
Miss Penny,

197
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,790
I guess you have to work
with Mr. Zhou next time.

198
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,230
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

199
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,510
I'll see you around.

200
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,550
Yes, yes.

201
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,200
Thank you, Mr. Fu,

202
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,030
for helping our studio.

203
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,830
I don't care for that.

204
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,630
I do everything for you.

205
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,510
(Why are they here?)

206
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,630
(I can't let his mother see me.)

207
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,750
Ladies and gentlemen,

208
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,790
the charity ball of the Fu's

209
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,030
now begins.

210
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,240
Who's the woman dancing with Yancheng?

211
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,790
This ball is being held

212
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,440
three months earlier for a mere woman.

213
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,270
I'd like to see

214
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,790
who has fascinated my son.

215
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,000
(I can tell from her back)

216
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,550
(that she must be Penny.)

217
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,560
Mrs. Fu,

218
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,870
let's take a look and we'll know.

219
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,600
Where's the woman

220
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,500
who danced with Mr. Fu?

221
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,840
They headed for the bathroom.
