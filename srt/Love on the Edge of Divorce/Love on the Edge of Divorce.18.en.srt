=Episode 18=

3
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,350
Hey, Penny.

4
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,710
Are you not angry?

5
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,710
Can you lend me a million?

6
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,120
Yes. I'll transfer it now.

7
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,430
I'll pay it back.

8
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,960
No worries. I...

9
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,710
(Why does she need so much?)

10
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,840
(Is she in trouble?)

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,840
Qi Chen, let's go.

12
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,880
To Penny's studio.

13
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,640
Isn't it a health tonic
for pregnant women?

14
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,640
Penny is pregnant?

15
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,750
Mr. Fu, you want Penny, huh?

16
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,590
She isn't in.

17
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,280
Tell me. When was your sex last time?

18
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,120
(Penny didn't tell me about that.)

19
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,030
When do you want it to be?

20
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,400
Half a year ago?

21
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,520
Are you sure?

22
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,750
Or maybe one year ago.

23
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,750
Dad!

24
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,630
- Stop.
- Dad!

25
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,960
- You can't get in.
- Let me in.

26
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,710
I beg you. Let me in.

27
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,190
- Dad!
- Please calm down.

28
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,630
Don't hold us up, please.

29
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,590
We'll save him now.

30
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,470
Prepare to do CPR.

31
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,710
Everybody, get ready.

32
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,120
The patient has no pulse

33
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,120
or breath.

34
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,710
Do chest compressions.

35
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,560
100 to 120 times per minute.

36
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,030
Five to six centimeters deep.

37
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,590
Clear his airway.

38
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,470
Prepare to bag him.

39
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,750
Maximize the oxygen flow.

40
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,750
Do the first defibrillation.

41
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,000
Choose biphasic wave and 200 joules.

42
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,470
More compressions.

43
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,800
Observe his reaction.

44
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,310
Clear his veins.

45
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,190
Inject one milligram of epinephrine.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,030
Keep doing CPR.

47
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,120
Stop pressing.

48
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,800
The patient has lost vital signs.

49
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,710
He's clinically dead.

50
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,870
Time of death,

51
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,910
2:46 in the afternoon.

52
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,200
Dad!

53
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,540
Dad!

54
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,470
Dad.

55
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,960
(Dad,)

56
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:05,990
(I'm sorry.)

57
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,560
(You died because of me.)

58
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,430
(From this day on,)

59
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,150
(I want nothing to do with the Fu's.)

60
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,200
Penny,

61
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,870
we have a baby, right?

62
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,400
It's my fault.

63
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,190
You had a hard time.

64
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,120
I'll divorce Sheng Mian tomorrow.

65
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,560
Fu Yancheng,

66
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,270
listen carefully.

67
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,630
The baby isn't yours.

68
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,040
I know you're being angry.

69
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,440
I know everything.

70
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,630
The baby can't be Liang Hanqing's.

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,040
I'll be responsible.

72
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,580
I'll take care of you and the baby.

Your father doesn't care for you.

You have to fight for what you want.

00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,950
Luckily, your father's lawyer helped us.

90
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,950
Or we wouldn't get anything.

91
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,000
Dad,

92
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,430
you did me an injustice.

93
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,240
Since everybody is here,

94
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,070
I'll read Mr. Sheng's will.

95
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,390
"I'll leave all my share

96
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,000
and my property

97
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,600
to my daughter Sheng Weiyuan."

98
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,540
(Sheng Zhong, Sheng Weiyuan)

99
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,800
(Why did Dad leave nothing to me?)

100
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,160
(This is weird.)

101
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,880
Mian,

102
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,070
don't blame Dad.

103
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,190
I believe he thinks

104
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,830
you're talented enough

105
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,480
to succeed without family support.

106
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,510
But I'm not like you.

107
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,390
I've been sick and weak.

108
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,870
I can't do too much.

109
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,190
So, Dad left me

110
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,030
all his property.

111
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,030
He really cares for you, then.

112
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,750
According to the will,

113
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,390
this house belongs to my mother and me.

114
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,550
But you can come back, anyway.

115
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,680
We are

116
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,960
still a family.

117
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,510
Mr. Fu,

118
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,720
I've never seen anyone

119
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,200
sneak back into his own house.

120
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,270
Penny doesn't want to see me.

121
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,790
And she's pregnant.

122
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,270
I don't want to annoy her.

123
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,680
Penny, what's wrong?

124
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,790
Are you OK, Penny?

125
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,710
Are you OK? Wake up.

126
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,570
Wake up.

127
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,440
Out of my way.

128
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,800
Penny, what's wrong?

129
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,510
Qi Chen, get the car.

130
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,510
OK.

131
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,230
Penny,

132
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,390
feeling any better?

133
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,960
Thanks for driving me here.

134
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,040
You may leave.

135
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,990
Penny,

136
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,510
don't reject me.

137
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,840
Let me take care of you.

138
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,550
Do you remember that car crash?

139
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You gave me your promise.

140
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,790
As long as I wake up,
you'll do anything.

141
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,510
I beg you. Let's not torture each other.

142
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,030
No matter whose baby it is,

143
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,440
I'll take it as my own baby.

144
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,590
Mr. Fu,

145
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,230
you may leave.

146
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,790
Everything was wrong when it started.

147
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,910
It's time to end it.

148
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,790
I didn't know

149
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,320
so many things happened.

150
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,000
I apologize on behalf of my family.

151
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,960
Had I known you would be hurt,

152
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,720
I wouldn't have asked you
to marry Yancheng.

153
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,870
Grandpa,

154
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,270
please grant our divorce.

155
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,510
Mian,

156
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:06,120
I know you had a hard time.

157
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,510
Our holiday hotel

158
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,870
will hold a party in a couple of days.

159
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,840
Go relax yourself.

160
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,030
Give yourselves a few days

161
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,090
to think about it.

162
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,840
When you're back,

163
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,390
if you still want a divorce,

164
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,720
I won't stop you anymore.
