3
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,030
Don't make everyone

4
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,070
pay for your idea.

5
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,640
It's not a month yet.

6
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,960
Sheng Mian is still in charge.

7
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,510
In my opinion,

8
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:58,600
it's time for her

9
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,840
to quit her job now.

10
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,110
I dare you.

11
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,760
I've bought Michelle's patent.

12
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,760
I'll unconditionally
give it to the Sheng's.

13
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,350
Sheng Mian,

14
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,590
do what you want to do.

15
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,920
I got your back.

16
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,000
Last night, why didn't you tell me

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,510
you bought the patent?

18
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,310
Because you weren't honest last night.

19
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,550
What do you mean?

20
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,880
Tell me.

21
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,230
Did you miss me when I was away?

22
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:44,910
No.

23
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:46,990
Really?

24
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,040
You just be denying it.

25
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,590
Did you fly all over the world

26
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,950
just to buy this patent?

27
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,230
You really care for me.

28
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,950
You know where I was traveling.

29
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,500
I don't care for you.

30
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,680
Grandpa told me.

31
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,350
I was exhausted, exactly.

32
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,790
After Michelle died,

33
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,560
his second son got the patent.

34
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,800
That man is

35
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,770
a famous coxcomb.

36
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,400
I went from New York to London

37
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,250
to feed pigeons.

38
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,870
I rode the horse, raced the car,

39
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,030
skydived, and did disco dancing.

40
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,630
I was so exhausted after that.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,800
I even hurt my wrist
when riding a horse.

42
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,910
Is it serious?

43
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,280
It depends on what you do.

44
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,400
If you kiss me,

45
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,550
it won't hurt.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,310
If you spend the night with me,

47
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,400
I'll totally recover.

48
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,080
You get hurt all the time.

49
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,130
I think you're too weak

50
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,170
and you need some rest.

51
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,520
How dare you say that?

52
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,360
I'll prove how strong I am.

53
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,150
Brat,

54
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,590
you left home

55
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,680
without telling me.

56
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,960
How disrespectful.

57
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,000
Ms. Sheng, after work,

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,520
can you visit Grandpa with me?

59
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,080
OK.

60
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,750
Grandpa,

61
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,240
we're here to see you.

62
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,030
What's so funny? You look happy.

63
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,080
You're just in time.

64
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,920
Sit down.

65
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,360
Wen Zhao

66
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,430
is telling me stories

67
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,000
about Mian's college life.

68
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,920
He was talking

69
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,870
about their first date
in an escape room.

70
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,590
Unexpectedly,

71
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,870
Mian's foot was stuck in the railing.

72
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,870
Wen Zhao

73
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,680
stepped on the "ghosts"

74
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,240
and saved her.

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,870
I don't even remember, Grandpa.

76
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,640
Anything more?

77
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,710
I want to hear my wife's funny stories.

78
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,750
Yes. A lot more.

79
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,590
After all, young days are really long.

80
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,590
Our sweet memories

81
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,630
won't be replaced.

82
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,920
Right, Sheng Mian?

83
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,570
Oh, Sheng Mian.

84
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,600
Some classmates want a reunion tonight.

85
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,450
Will you go?

86
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,800
She isn't going anywhere tonight.

87
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,480
She isn't' your accessory.

88
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,750
You have no right to restrict her.

89
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,040
I'm here for Grandpa.

90
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,070
I won't go.

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,840
Grandpa.

92
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,480
They're noisy.

93
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,360
Let me take you to the yard.

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
OK. Let's go.

95
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,790
- Go.
- Come on.

96
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,630
Tonight, my wife

97
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,920
isn't going anywhere.

98
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,400
Grandpa,

99
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,270
I always wanted to ask something.

100
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,190
When you went to my family
for the marriage thing,

101
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,860
Ms. Su highly recommended Sheng Weiyuan.

102
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,040
Why did you pick me?

103
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,150
Kid,

104
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,390
there is

105
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,560
always a destiny.

106
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,040
When you risked your life to save me,

107
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,870
our destiny started.

108
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,070
It had to be you.

109
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,490
No one else would do.

110
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,390
That's just a small thing.

111
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,920
I'm good at judging from small things.

112
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,430
Don't you see?

113
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,200
Yancheng

114
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,070
smiles more because of you.

115
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,630
He's more sensitive, too.

116
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,110
Grandpa,

117
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,240
you know Wen Zhao is Sheng Mian's ex.

118
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,160
Why did you invite him?

119
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,800
I'm your real grandson.

120
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,600
Wen Zhao threatens you?

121
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,720
Your love can't be so fragile.

122
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,830
No, actually.

123
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,950
Anyway, Sheng Mian

124
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,000
has eyes only for me.

125
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,880
What will my great-grandson

126
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,870
look like?

127
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,190
I'll try tonight, Grandpa.

128
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,200
Good.

129
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,360
Good for you.

130
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,620
(College Classmate)
Zhao,

131
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,310
we had this reunion for your sake.

132
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,630
We waited and waited.

133
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,870
But the two of you didn't come.

134
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:05,990
We're busy, you know.

135
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,840
Then, we left.

136
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,270
Actually, you should know.

137
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,840
We can't go back.

138
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,950
Who did you expect?

139
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,200
Sheng Mian?

140
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,870
Earlier today, Fu Yancheng
stole the show

141
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,270
and Sheng Mian was touched.

142
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,650
Now,

143
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,510
I believe she's sleeping

144
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,240
in Fu Yancheng's arms.

145
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,920
Did you come back from abroad

146
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,680
just to drink alone here?

147
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,560
None of your business.

148
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,030
Leave.

149
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,590
You know what?

150
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,240
The moment I saw you in the office,

151
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,960
I knew

152
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,390
we were the same.

153
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,310
We can't let go of the past

154
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,480
but struggle in memories.

155
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,510
If I tell you

156
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:18,750
I can do something

157
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,510
to get Sheng Mian back to you,

158
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,190
will you do that?

159
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,270
Work with me.

160
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,190
Is this what you can do
after the practice?

161
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,560
The imperfect latte art

162
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,160
stands for me.

163
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,310
Like Eve was created from Adam's rib,

164
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,510
you're also the part of me

165
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,000
I've been missing.

166
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,390
So, we're meant to be together.

167
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,870
Why are you so honey-lipped now?

168
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,480
Is it really so disgusting?

169
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,360
I learned it from foreigners.

170
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,270
More than disgusting.

171
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,590
But anyway,

172
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,000
I don't want coffee.

173
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,630
I want a cup

174
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,040
of refreshing sparkling water.

175
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,760
In a second.

176
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,960
Sheng Mian,

177
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,240
new fabrics have come.

178
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,320
Go check them with me.

179
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,510
OK.

180
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,960
Aren't you leaving?

181
00:08:58,970 --> 00:08:59,840
You go ahead.

182
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,770
I'll be waiting here.

183
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,840
What do you want?

184
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:20,850
A file.

185
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,240
I feel so hot.

186
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,780
So hot.

187
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,240
Soon, you'll feel better.

188
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,670
When people know
you cheat on Sheng Mian,

189
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,750
the company will be mine.
