Penny?

Fu...

5
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:01,910
Mr. Fu.

6
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,040
Why are you here?

7
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,120
The bidding is about to start.

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,950
I'm here to talk to you.

9
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,260
But you could have

10
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,590
visited me in my office.

11
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:13,600
Do you know where you are?

12
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,400
I just want a deeper understanding

13
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,040
of your decoration style

14
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,950
and I want to study your preferences

15
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,510
to prepare for the bidding.

16
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,400
When you wanted to know
my decoration style

17
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,430
and my preferences,

18
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,710
you could have asked me.

19
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,200
Why did you visit my Grandpa?

20
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,250
Is Yancheng back?

21
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,040
Yancheng,

22
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,250
is that you?

23
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,240
Huh?

24
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,920
Weird.

25
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,710
I thought Yancheng was back.

26
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,750
Mr. Fu,

27
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,080
why are your ears so red?

28
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,680
You're too close to me.

29
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,520
I'm so hot.

30
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,000
Sorry, Mr. Fu.

31
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,310
I was a little bit woozy just now.

32
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,190
I'm so sorry, Mr. Fu.

33
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,030
For a better design,

34
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,270
I came here without telling you.

35
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,680
It's OK.

36
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,960
If you want to know

37
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,910
my preferences,

38
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,430
you can just ask me.

39
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,360
OK.

40
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,030
Mr. Fu, I should go.

41
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,280
See you at tomorrow's bidding.

42
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,710
OK.

43
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,750
Mr. Fu.

44
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,470
What's catching your eye?

45
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,470
Nothing.

46
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,240
Qi Chen,

47
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,080
when a girl came to my home

48
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,630
and did something intimate,

49
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,470
what did she mean?

50
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,750
Obviously, she loves you.

51
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,750
She loves me?

52
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,910
Looks like another woman

53
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,590
is impressed by your charm.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,840
Don't be nagging.

55
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,030
You asked me to talk.

56
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,980
(Villa Design, Bidding Meeting)

57
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,400
Hi, everybody.

58
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm Penny from Fixed Star.

59
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,840
Now, I'll elaborate

60
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,910
my design proposal.

61
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,820
(Design Proposal)

62
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,360
You're a mere plagiarist.

63
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,070
How are you qualified to stand there?

64
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,360
I wondered

65
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,480
why a designer from a small studio

66
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,640
could be allowed

67
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,240
to bid for Mr. Fu's project.

68
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,390
So, she plagiarized the design.

69
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,440
I didn't.

70
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,510
It's just your own word.

71
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,590
Who'd believe you?

72
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,920
Mr. Fu, you don't believe her, do you?

73
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,560
Ms. Penny, please explain

74
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,720
why your design

75
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,850
is exactly the same

76
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,900
(Design Proposal)
as ours?

77
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,390
It's the same, indeed.

78
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,430
Yeah. Something must be wrong.

79
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,590
I agree.

80
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,610
So, she's a plagiarist.

81
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,910
Who knows?

82
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,870
Mr. Xiao, you say this is your design.

83
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,160
Then tell me

84
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,560
what inspired your designer.

85
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,480
One of my designers made this proposal.

86
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,390
I know very well about his inspiration.

87
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,800
As you can see,

88
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,600
this design has a clear feature

89
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,000
of traditional Chinese gardens.

90
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,190
Inspired by Suzhou Gardens,

91
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,480
we make this villa

92
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,630
look simple and natural.

93
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,120
You seem to notice the overall style

94
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,600
but ignore many details.

95
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,750
Look closely.

96
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,950
You can see many patterns of maple leaf

97
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,120
on the walls and stairs

98
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,680
from the courtyard to the interior.

99
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,920
I got to know Mr. Fu loved it

100
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,510
from his band

101
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,510
and his tie.

102
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,040
Shall I wipe it for you?

103
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,880
Stop.

104
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,120
(Does she really...?)

105
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,950
And you can see,

106
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,510
I've used a lot of grass

107
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,240
for the ground of the courtyard.

108
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,390
So, Mr. Xiao,

109
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,510
why do I use this kind of material?

110
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,760
That's obvious.

111
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,040
You want the courtyard
to look more lively.

112
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,510
The artificial warm light
at 35 degrees obliquely

113
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,120
simulates the sunset in the courtyard.

114
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,560
For the walls,

115
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,630
I've picked

116
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,160
the granite with natural crystals.

117
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,240
It'll reflect brighter glows.

118
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,360
But in the design you offer,

119
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,480
there isn't granite

120
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,950
or maple leaves.

121
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,320
Right?

122
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,190
Don't try to get away

123
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,130
with such a petty trick.

124
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,150
Fine.

125
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,120
If you say this is your design,

126
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,800
where is your original draft?

127
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,360
It's on my laptop.

128
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,400
But just now...

129
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,120
It no longer worked.

130
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,670
What is your problem?

131
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,120
(So, Xiao Yang
had someone ruin my laptop.)

132
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,240
It's such a bad excuse.

133
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,120
This is our design draft.

134
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,160
It clearly marks

135
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,630
when my designer designed it.

136
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,180
You're just a plagiarist

137
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,490
who can't show her draft.

138
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,090
What kind of designer are you?

139
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,390
Such a designer

140
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,870
is an insult to this industry!

141
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,430
Because of this,

142
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,040
you can't design anymore.

143
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:52,850
Mr. Fu.

144
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,920
I reviewed Ms. Penny's draft.

145
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,560
This is it.

146
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,950
As for Mr. Xiao's draft,

147
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,510
we'll let some professionals comment.

148
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,960
They'll judge

149
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,520
if it's original.

150
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,800
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

151
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,680
I have a little habit.

152
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,380
I usually put my name

153
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,000
in my design.

154
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,950
Look closely.

155
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,240
You can see my name Penny in the design.

156
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,590
I guess

157
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,160
Mr. Xiao's draft

158
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,510
also has my name on it.

159
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,080
I stole it, so what?

160
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,150
You're a mere designer.

161
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,790
Why can you get Fu Yancheng's project?

162
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,150
I think you just want to seduce him.

163
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,030

you defend this woman so hard.

how dare you call me by my name?

I won't care for a man

173

who plagiarizes
and slanders someone else.

174

From this day on,

175
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,150
my company will no longer
cooperate with yours.

00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,990
I'm here to announce.

If you want a competition, do it fairly.

193
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,020
Don't disgrace our family.

194
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,420
Sister,

195
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,820
I had planned

196
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,420
to kick Penny out of our industry.

197
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,380
But Yancheng defended her

198
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,460
and ruined my plan.

199
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,020
Sister,

200
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,900
you graduated
from a top foreign university

201
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,410
and you learned from a famous designer.

202
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,500
You grew up with Fu Yancheng, too.

203
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,380
Will you just watch

204
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,780
when another woman steals him?

205
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,940
I never fight with girls

206
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,420
for a man.

207
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,580
Men pursue me.

208
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,060
But anyway,

209
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,580
I should go back to China.

210
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,180
This is so like you, Sister.

211
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,980
(Favorite day)

212
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,300
Hey, Penny.

213
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,260
We managed

214
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,540
to land the project

215
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,860
of Fu Yancheng's villa

216
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,260
and you made the most merit.

217
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,860
When we receive the payment,

218
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,620
our financial problem

219
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,620
will be solved.

220
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,460
Brilliant.

221
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,340
And Mr. Fu

222
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,140
asked you to sign the contract.

223
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,460
I approved.

224
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,900
(If Fu Yancheng knows I'm Sheng Mian,)

225
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,860
(he'll definitely think)

226
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,870
(I'm up to something else)

227
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,740
(and he won't give me the project.)

228
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:46,900
What's wrong?

229
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,340
You don't look very happy.

230
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,620
I can't sign the contract.

231
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:53,940
You can sign it.

232
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,740
No way.

233
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,820
You have to sign it.

234
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,740
Or it'll be legally invalid.

235
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,100
- But I...
- Don't worry.

236
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,380
Mr. Fu picked you

237
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,700
to do the design.

238
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,780
This is quite joyful.

239
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,180
I'll go get prepared.

240
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,620
Penny will arrive soon, huh?

241
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,020
Yes. She's supposed
to sign the contract today.

242
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,540
Mr. Fu,

243
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,780
we could have sent the contract by post.

244
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,420
But you asked Penny to come.

245
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,300
I think you just want

246
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,140
to see her.

247
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,300
You have way too much time, Qi Chen.

248
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,260
Mr. Fu, I have work to do.

249
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,180
Mr. Fu,

250
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,350
I'm here for the contract.

251
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,540
I've confirmed

252
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,660
the specific terms.

253
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,100
If you don't mind,

254
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,140
let's sign it now.

255
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,500
(Signature of Party B)

256
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,780
(Signature of Party B: Sheng Mian)

257
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,220
You're Sheng Mian?

258
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,540
I...

259
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,380
