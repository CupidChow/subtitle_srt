Let's go.

18
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,020
Mr. Fu, thanks for helping me out.

19
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,680
I'll clean the suit and return it.

20
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,800
I'll give you a ride.

21
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,990
No need.

22
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,750
Are you angry?

23
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,830
If you don't like this kind of party,

24
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,750
you won't come again.

25
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,630
I'm not angry.

26
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,030
Who am I to be angry?

27
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,120
Designing for your villa

28
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,400
is precisely what I hope for.

29
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,840
I also value a partner like you.

30
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,910
Are we just partners?

31
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,270
Or what?

32
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,630
Since you love someone else,

33
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,590
stop doing anything that confuses me.

34
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,030
I love...

35
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,030
Mr. Fu,

36
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,150
people are waiting in there.

37
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,120
I don't approve.

38
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,240
Penny did nothing wrong.

39
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,080
Why must I terminate
her contract, Grandpa?

40
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,000
I heard you hugged each other

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,840
in front of people.

42
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,680
That is ridiculous.

43
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,520
What a disgrace
to our family reputation!

44
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,550
Mian

45
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,400
majored in interior design.

46
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,360
You should have her

47
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,560
design your wedding house.

48
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,190
Why did you hire another woman?

49
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,960
Do you want her

50
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,150
to pester you?

51
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,520
She never pestered me.

52
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,240
Grandpa, why can't you see?

53
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,960
Sheng Mian just wants money.

54
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,080
I think you've lost your mind.

55
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,430
That's not true.

56
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,270
Tell me.

57
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,280
Who's that female designer?

58
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,910
Oh, Fu Yancheng.

59
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,150
You're pissing me off.

60
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,870
Grandpa, Grandpa.

61
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,240
Grandpa, are you OK?

62
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,210
Don't scare me, Grandpa.

63
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,080
Don't be angry, Grandpa.

64
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,200
Come on.

65
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,000
However hard I hit you,

66
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,000
you won't tell me who she is, huh?

67
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,470
I...

68
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,360
I can't stay mad at you.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,840
But remember.

70
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,330
You betrayed Mian.

71
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,240
You must apologize to her.

72
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,310
Otherwise, you're never allowed

73
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,040
to come in here again!

74
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,950
(Sheng Mian,)

75
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,130
(it's you again.)

76
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,680
Mr. Fu,

77
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,470
this is the file you asked for.

78
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,760
Put it down.

79
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,880
I'll leave you alone.

80
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,560
Qi Chen told me everything.

81
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,750
Because you refused to expose me,

82
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,560
your grandpa hit you.

83
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,880
I'm OK.

84
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,720
If you don't mind,

85
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,430
let me apply the ointment.

86
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,590
Sorry.

87
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,760
I'll be gentle.

88
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,750
Does it still hurt?

89
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,030
I feel better when you're here.

90
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,120
Mr. Fu, let me help you...

91
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,190
I should go.

92
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,560
Mr. Fu,

93
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,000
guess what skill I wanted just now.

94
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,080
Invisibility.

95
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,090
I wanted to be invisible.

96
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,880
Mr. Fu,

97
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,960
are you bothered with something?

98
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,670
What do you think?

99
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,400
I think you are.

100
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,560
And...

101
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,630
It must be about love.

102
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,000
You think you're clever?

103
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,670
Come back.

104
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,830
If a woman suddenly

105
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,950
plays hard to get,

106
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,240
what does she mean?

107
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,800
(A woman?)

108
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,560
(It must be Penny.)

109
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,120
(Really obvious.)

110
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,510
Did this woman change her attitude

111
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,870
when a close female friend

112
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,680
appeared beside you?

113
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,880
Yes, I guess.

114
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,750
That's it. She's probably jealous.

115
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,560
Jealous?

116
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,400
If you aren't sure,

117
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,870
why don't you pretend
to be close to that friend

118
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,160
and see how this woman acts?

119
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,960
Childish.

120
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,160
I'm obviously not
going to do anything like that.

121
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,120
Yancheng, why do you have time

122
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,240
to invite me over?

123
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,000
I want a good designer like you

124
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,310
to check my decoration.

125
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,680
Generally, it's good.

126
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,200
Compared to international trends,

127
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,720
it's a little conservative though.

128
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,030
Chuqing.

129
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,140
Your hair is messy.

130
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:17,990
Let me fix it.

131
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,390
What's your plan later?

132
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,680
Shall we have a cup of coffee?

133
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,360
Why do you avoid me?

134
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,120
I'm just working.

135
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,110
Are you sure?

136
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,960
Are you jealous of my relationship

137
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,800
with Xiao Chuqing?

138
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,630
I'm not.

139
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,630
Who am I to be jealous?

140
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,240
You can.

141
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,860
As long as you want to.

142
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,030
