The doctor said you recovered well.

You'll recover fully soon.

19
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,950
Thanks for making the decoction again.

20
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,270
Mr. Fu,

21
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,200
thank you for your help these days.

22
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,200
Like I said, I should take care of you.

23
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,760
Drink it.

24
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,950
It tastes so bitter.

25
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,200
Is it still bitter?

26
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,200
No.

27
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,000
Not anymore.

28
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,450
Miss Penny,

29
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,710
don't leave in such a hurry.

30
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,560
Mr. Fu started a business trip today.

31
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,840
When he's back,

32
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,910
how can I explain?

33
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,730
In this case,

34
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,400
he'll send me to Africa.

35
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,120
These days,

36
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,430
Mr. Fu has done too much for me.

37
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,960
And I've almost recovered.

38
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,200
Don't worry.

39
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,310
When he's back,

40
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,360
I'll explain to him.

41
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,190
Grandpa.

42
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,040
Mian,

43
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,820
I haven't seen you for a while.

44
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,080
Come and stay over tonight.

45
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,400
Talk with me.

46
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,310
I'm too useless.

47
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,960
No one talks to me now.

48
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,680
Mian,

49
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,960
you won't leave me alone, huh?

50
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,080
Grandpa, don't say that.

51
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,660
I give you my word.

52
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,680
I'll be there tonight.

53
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,100
OK. I'll be waiting.

54
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,640
(Fu Yancheng started
a business trip today.)

55
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,040
(He can't be at home.)

56
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,270
(It'll be fine.)

57
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:27,910
Grandpa,

58
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,910
Grandpa?

59
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,650
Oh, Yancheng.

60
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,120
Come on. Get in here.

61
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,440
- Grandpa.
- (Oh no.)

62
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,480
(It's Fu Yancheng.)

63
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,870
Mian?

64
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,950
You look so weird.

65
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,350
Grandpa,

66
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,870
I have an allergic reaction on my face.

67
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,550
I can't show it now.

68
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,800
I'm going back to my room.

69
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,030
Stop.

70
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,400
Yancheng,

71
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,630
she doesn't feel well.

72
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,430
Let her go get some rest.

73
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,070
Grandpa, is this what you want me for?

74
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,140
Did you

75
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,740
annoy her again?

76
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,140
Oh, man.

77
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,230
What the heck.

78
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,420
Forget it.

79
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,580
Whatever it is,

80
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,060
talk to her tomorrow.

81
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,340
Shall we have a drink?

82
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,380
Sure.

83
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,820
Let's go.

84
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,940
(As long as I stay quiet,)

85
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,220
(I won't run into Fu Yancheng.)

86
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,980
Mian,

87
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,660
Yancheng is drunk.

88
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,180
Take care of him, please.

89
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,660
(Oh no.)

90
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,140
(How did he get in here?)

91
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,820
(I'll be exposed.)

92
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,500
Penny.

93
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,660
Let me explain.

94
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,420
(You're attracted to me when I'm Penny.)

95
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,420
(If you know I'm Sheng Mian,)

96
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,540
(would you think)

97
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,660
(I've been lying to you)

98
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,280
(would you hate me then?)

99
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,660
Sheng Mian?

100
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,260
What are you doing here?

101
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,900
Mrs. Fu, yesterday, I...

102
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,740
Shut up.

103
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,740
You're trying so hard
to approach Yancheng.

104
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,340
You granted a divorce,

105
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,740
but now you're here.

106
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,540
How shameless!

107
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,580
I warn you.

108
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,660
Give up on him.

109
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:54,980
Unless I'm dead,

110
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,860
you won't be able to stay!

111
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,300
Mom, what's going on?

112
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,500
Sheng Mian?

113
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,460
Stop!

114
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:05,980
Yancheng,

115
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,500
don't go after her.

116
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,380
Obviously, she worked with your grandpa

117
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,550
to set you up.

118
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,380
When she failed, she ran away.

119
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,980
She must feel guilty.

120
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,420
(I'd like to see)

121
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,660
