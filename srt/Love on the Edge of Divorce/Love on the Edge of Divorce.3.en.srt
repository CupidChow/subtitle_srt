3
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,120
Penny.

4
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:51,550
Such a rare visitor.

5
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,640
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,420
Mr. Xiao,

7
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,270
don't tease me.

8
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,790
I'm a mere employee.

9
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,960
Today, I'm here for Mr. Fu.

10
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,000
Mr. Xiao, you also know Penny?

11
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,280
Of course.

12
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,870
Penny is famous in this industry.

13
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,410
She's not only professional

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,480
but also gorgeous.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's hard to see her.

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,510
Penny, you came prepared.

17
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,820
Are you going

18
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,120
to play with Mr. Fu?

19
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,560
Mr. Fu, will you

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,400
give me a chance?

21
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:18,790
Not interested.

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,590
Mr. Fu, don't be so rude to a lady.

23
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,500
I'd like to play with you, Penny.

24
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,820
Mr. Fu, give me a chance.

25
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,340
How about this?

26
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,740
Let's have a competition.

27
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,260
If I win,

28
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,700
you give me five minutes.

29
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,980
If you win,

30
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,100
I'll leave right away.

31
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,940
I said, not interested.

32
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,900
Or do you think you can't win

33
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,380
and you're afraid of losing?

34
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,820
You ask for this.

35
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,220
Mr. Xiao, Penny's studio

36
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,180
has been mortgaged.

37
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,340
Within three months,

38
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,260
it will be auctioned.

39
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,380
So, she wants Mr. Fu's project
to save her studio.

40
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,020
You played really well. It's a draw.

41
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,220
I didn't know Penny could

42
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,540
also play so well.

43
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,980
- Mr. Fu, I...
- Penny.

44
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,220
Pay your bet.

45
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,380
You should leave.

46
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,460
But you didn't win, either.

47
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,700
I still stand a chance.

48
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,340
Fine.

49
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,310
If you don't go, I will.

50
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,420
Mr. Fu.

51
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,980
Penny,

52
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,420
hold up.

53
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,220
What do you want, Mr. Xiao?

54
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,180
Did anyone ever tell you

55
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,380
you were beautiful

56
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,740
and proud?

57
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,740
Every time I contact you,

58
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,260
you remain standoffish.

59
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,500
Come on.

60
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,140
Today, you're here.

61
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,790
Are you short of money?

62
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,660
Mr. Xiao, just cut to the chase.

63
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,420
I know your studio

64
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,260
has been mortgaged.

65
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,380
Anyway,

66
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,300
I always appreciate your talent.

67
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,980
I'm willing to help you.

68
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,780
Come to me at seven tonight.

69
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,300
We'll talk.

70
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,580
There you are, Penny.

71
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,580
Come on.

72
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,740
Take your seat.

73
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,660
Today, Mr. Fu is supposed

74
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,900
to sign the contract with me.

75
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,540
But I'm a man

76
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,060
who cares for women.

77
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,090
I know you have a financial problem.

78
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,140
If you drink all the wine here,

79
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,300
I'll give you a hand

80
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,900
and let you have Fu Yancheng's project.

81
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,660
What do you say?

82
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,700
OK.

83
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,900
I'll drink.

84
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,780
Penny.

85
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,300
I'll give you Fu Yancheng's project.

86
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,220
But anyway,

87
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,220
I'll have you first.

88
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,300
What are you doing?

89
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,740
Let go of me!

90
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,580
Let go!

91
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,740
You can't get away.

92
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,140
Help!

93
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,020
I'm Fu Yancheng's wife.

94
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,140
He's my husband.

95
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,940
If he knows you want to rape me,

96
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,680
your family can't
afford the consequences.

97
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,140
Don't try to fool me.

98
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,540
If he was your husband,

99
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,100
you needn't have competed in tennis.

100
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,300
You needn't have begged me

101
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,580
to give you his project.

102
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,100
We quarreled

103
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,740
and we had a bet.

104
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,440
It's a love thing. Don't you understand?

105
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,300
I can call him now.

106
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,750
Ask him and you'll know

107
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,230
if I'm telling the truth.

108
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,100
How dare you fool me?

109
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,780

00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,700
this is the contact

169
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,780
of the designer you wanted.

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,340
(Did I hear it wrong?)

171
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,180
(I heard a woman's voice.)

172
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,780
Who's that?

173
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,140
Hello.

174
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,380
This is Fu Yancheng.

175
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,780
Fu Yancheng?

176
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,100
Why do you do this to me?

177
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,460
Say something.

178
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,300
Why do you do this to me?

179
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,940
Every time I go to see you,

180
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,620
you ignore me.

181
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,900
I've done so many things

182
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,100
just to get a chance.

183
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,300
Fu Yancheng,

184
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,500
tell me.

185
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,020
What have I done wrong

186
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,340
to make you reject me all the time?

187
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,420
Say something.

188
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,660
I really don't know what I did

189
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,300
to make you so rude.

190
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,300
Say something!

191
