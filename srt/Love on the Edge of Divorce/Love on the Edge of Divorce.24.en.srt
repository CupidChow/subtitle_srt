Fu Yancheng,

4
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,350
let's get a divorce.

5
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,680
We'll break up.

6
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,190
We'll never see each other again.

7
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,760
No.

8
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,520
Sheng Mian,

9
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,230
I can't divorce you.

10
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,790
Give me a second chance, OK?

11
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,950
Shall we start all over again?

12
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,680
I beg you.

13
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,640

Mrs. Fu,

44
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,630
when I was shopping,

45
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,870
I bought you this.

46
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,000
See if you like it.

47
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,590
Thank you.

48
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,800
Yancheng and I will

49
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,750
take care of you.

50
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,960
Chuqing,

51
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,120
did you and Yancheng

52
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,400
have a problem?

53
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,920
No.

54
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,080
We're doing good.

55
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,840
Was it something Yancheng said?

56
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,430
I don't know what's wrong with him.

57
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,240
He used to hate Sheng Mian

58
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,840
and always wanted a divorce.

59
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,610
But the other day, he told me

60
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,470
he would never leave Sheng Mian.

61
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,680
When I kept asking,

62
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,150
he became impatient.

63
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:18,960
Sheng Mian

64
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,720
always plays dirty tricks.

65
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,240
Several times, you know.

66
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,910
She must've driven a wedge
between you and Yancheng.

67
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,910
How slimy.

68
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,790
Mrs. Fu,

69
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,280
I have something to tell you.

70
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,200
What is it?

71
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,800
I...

72
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,400
You...

73
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,240
You're pregnant?

74
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,590
(Now,)

75
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,030
(I have to risk it.)

76
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,060
(As long as Mrs. Fu)

77
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,800
(make Fu Yancheng divorce Sheng Mian,)

78
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,190
(I believe I'll carry Yancheng's baby.)

79
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,000
Can you not tell Yancheng now?

80
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,360
I'll figure out the right time

81
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,430
to tell him myself.

82
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,630
OK.

83
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,400
But Sheng Mian
hasn't divorced Yancheng yet.

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,190
I'm afraid

85
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,910
my tummy will swell up.

86
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,080
Don't worry.

87
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,080
Count on me.

88
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,680
I got you here

89
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,560
to tell you something.

90
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,360
Xiao Chuqing is carrying
Yancheng's baby.

91
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,030
If you're wise,

92
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,120
divorce Fu Yancheng immediately.

93
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,160
Are you sure

94
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,950
that's your grandson?

95
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,350
Of course.

96
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,920
At the Fu's ball,

97
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,390
Yancheng was with Chuqing.

98
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,950
By calculation,

99
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,680
she got the baby that day.

100
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,630
If you hadn't pestered my son,

101
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,800
he would have married Chuqing.

102
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,000
Congratulations, then.

103
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,480
You'll have a grandson.

104
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,960
Don't worry.

105
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,310
If your son wants a divorce,

106
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,590
I won't pester him.

107
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,430
Hope you'll keep your word.

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,480
Stop playing dirty tricks.

109
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,300
Penny,

110
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,560
(Liang)
I got the security tape

111
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,920
of your accident.

112
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,060
(CAMERA 01)

113
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,120
(Xiao Chuqing?)

114
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,360
(I'm going to be
the lady of this house.)

115
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,320
Why are you here?

116
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,600
I'm the designer of this villa.

117
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
Why can't I be here?

118
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,360
Now, your baby is gone.

119
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,120
You've lost your biggest chip.

120
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,950
Whoever you are,

121
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,680
you stay away from Yancheng.

122
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,430
So, you know who I am.

123
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,390
I didn't want that man a long time ago.

124
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,000
But you killed his baby.

125
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,600
Guess if he'll let you go.

126
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,360
It's just a baby.

127
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,870
You know what?

128
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,400
I'm also carrying

129
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,480
Yancheng's baby.

130
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,870
A pregnant woman
really has a poor memory.

131
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,630
You even mistake the baby's father.

132
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,000
Don't be ridiculous.

133
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,600
Did you forget what you did

134
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,430
with that waiter at the ball?

135
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,920
Modern medicine is advanced.

136
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,270
A DNA test is available
during pregnancy.

137
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,680
I'm not pregnant. I'm not.

138
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,000
Mrs. Fu, did you hear?

139
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,760
Xiao Chuqing,

140
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,880
who were you with

141
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,510
at the hotel?

142
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,360
Mrs. Fu, let me explain.

143
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,560
I...

144
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,830
How dare you fool me?

145
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,560
You know what?

146
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,520
In your life,

147
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,160
you'll never marry my son!

148
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,200
What a cheap woman.

149
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,950
How dare you trick me?

150
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,510
Xiao Chuqing, stop.

151
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,430
You framed Sheng Mian several times.

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,040
The trap at the ball.

153
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,630
And then the abortion.

154
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,870
How could you be so wicked?

155
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,240
Yancheng, don't you want to divorce her?

156
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,720
I did everything to help you.

157
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,480
Who said I would divorce her?

158
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,190
I'll never leave her all my life.

159
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,230
Yancheng,

160
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,950
she seduced you as Penny

161
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,750
instead of telling you
she was your wife.

162
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,240
Don't be deceived anymore.

163
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,510
When did you know I was Sheng Mian?

164
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,070
At the Fu's release.

165
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,630
Sheng Weiyuan came to me.

166
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,950
She told me you were pregnant

167
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,950
and called me "mistress".

168
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,360
You sent her, didn't you?

169
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,000
(So, it's her.)

170
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,360
(When I had the "abortion",)

171
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,950
(she must've deliberately put Yancheng)

172
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,950
(on the speaker.)

173
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,360
Yancheng, she and her sister are wicked.

174
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,630
Only I love you for real!

175
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,470
Enough!

176
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,200
Xiao Chuqing,

177
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,750
stay out of my sight.

178
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,470
Yancheng.

179
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,790
Yancheng.

180
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,240
Yancheng!

181
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,290
Sheng Mian. Sheng Mian.

182
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,080
Sheng Mian,

183
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,190
I miss you so much.

184
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,950
In order not to disturb you,

185
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,430
I didn't visit you.

186
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,680
But as I close my eyes,

187
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,190
you linger in my mind.

188
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,120
Don't expect me to be thankful

189
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,120
for what you just did.

190
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,270
