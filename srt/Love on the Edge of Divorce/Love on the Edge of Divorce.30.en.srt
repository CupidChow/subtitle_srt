Without a transfusion,

5
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,230
even she may die.

6
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,400
Doctor, she's waking up.

7
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,680
You're in a critical condition.

8
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,310

Doctor,

13
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:22,910
I beg you.

14
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,510
Save my baby.

15
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,480
Don't worry.

16
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,790
We'll do our best.

17
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,240
The baby has lived.

18
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,520
Don't worry.

19
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,950
I'll go tell your family.

20
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,270
Doctor,

21
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,280
keep my secret, please.

28
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,800
Nothing.

29
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,400
I'm going to work.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,190
Mr. Fu, you asked to see me?

31
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,750
Yes. For only one purpose.

32
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,240
Sign this.

Why do I have to?

36
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,150
Because you almost
killed Sheng Mian the other day.

37
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,470
What do you mean?

38
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,640
I don't understand.

39
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,280
Don't play innocent.

40
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,870
The Sheng's exterior walls

41
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,360
are usually repaired at a fixed time.

42
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,750
I heard yesterday,

43
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,960
Miss Sheng Weiyuan
urged the property manager

44
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,470
to send a repairman.

45
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,520
Then, his toolkit happened to drop.

46
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,840
Isn't it

47
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,310
a little too much coincidence?

48
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,590
Now, the repairman is out there.

49
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,000
Unless you do what I tell you to,

50
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,630
he'll come in and expose you.

51
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,120
Mr. Fu.

52
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,590
Yancheng,

53
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,910
give me a second chance.

54
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,680
I lost my mind.

55
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,960
I was jealous of Mian.

56
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,750
I just tried to scare her.

57
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,280
I didn't know you would be hurt.

58
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,960
Mr. Fu, I'll never do that again.

59
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,030
I can't go to jail.

60
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,360
Give me a chance.

61
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,010
I'm her sister.

62
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,040
If you sign this contract,

63
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,880
I give you my word.

64
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,120
This will be over.

65
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,360
But this is all I have now.

66
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,430
Can I do anything else?

67
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,270
Sheng Weiyuan,

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,270
when you had the plan

69
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,240
to hurt Sheng Mian,

70
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,750
you would expect this.

71
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,470
Sign it.

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,360
You'll have a second chance.

73
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,320
Will you go to jail

74
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,480
or give your share to Sheng Mian?

75
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,120
Make your choice.

79

And I have some new ideas

80
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,750
to adjust our business.

81
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,670

You...

83
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,430
Are you pregnant?

84
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
Fu Yancheng doesn't know?

85
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,720
He knew I was pregnant.

86
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,830
But later, something happened.

87
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,070
He thought I lost the baby.

88
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,630
Why didn't you tell him

89
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,040
such an important thing?

90
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,530
Too many things happened between us.

91
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,960
What's worse,

92
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,390
people kept trying to hurt my baby.

93
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,270
I wanted to protect the baby.

94
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,680
So, I didn't tell anyone.

95
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,960
But anyway,

96
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,240
I'm going to tell him tonight.

97
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,440
I guess

98
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,000

00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,630
Actually, I can tell.

106
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,440
I've lost to him.

107

I advise you to have an abortion soon.

The later you have it,

142
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,750
the more you'll hurt

145
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,510
is there no hope at all?

146
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,670
Judging from the results,

147
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,790
the baby can hardly live.

148
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
Unless it has obvious quickening.

149
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,390

00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,960
my baby may not live.

163
