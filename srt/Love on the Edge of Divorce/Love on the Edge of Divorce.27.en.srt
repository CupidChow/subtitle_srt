3
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,580
(Emergency, First Aid)

4
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,200
Thank you for today.

5
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,520
If you hadn't arrived in time,

6
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,390
I don't know what would happen.

7
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,240
Xiao Yang failed today.

8
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,520
He'll try to hurt you again.

9
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,790
Sheng Mian, move in with me.

10
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,430
Wen Zhao, what's wrong?

11
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,310
Do you feel unwell?

12
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,070
Yes, a little bit.

13
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,870
I feel suffocated.

14
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,060
I can't breathe.

15
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,520
What's your problem?

16
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,040
I got hit on the head.

17
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,200
It aches again.

18
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,120
Is it the after-effect?

19
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,000
My chest is so tight.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,310
I can hardly breathe.

21
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,310
I feel really bad.

22
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,710
My chest hurts.

23
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,150
I can't move my arm.

24
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,640
Is it broken?

25
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,310
Why can't I feel my leg?

26
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,400
I...

27
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:45,630
I...

28
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,240
Am I paralyzed?

29
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,920
Will I be paraplegic?

30
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,070
Your CT reports have come out.

31
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,350
You're both OK.

32
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,590
Just some bruises.

33
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,660
You need some ointment.

34
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,680
Oh, Sheng Mian.

35
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,240
It's getting late.

36
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,120
I'll drive you home.

37
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,430
OK.

38
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,640
Let's go.

39
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,590
Stay safe.

40
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,030
Thanks for driving me back.

41
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,220
It's late.

42
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,080
You go home.

43
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,910
OK. I'll watch to make sure you go in.

44
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,640
Bye-bye.

45
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,550
Bye-bye.

46
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,240
Welcome home.

47
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,120
How did you get in?

48
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,400
We're a couple.

49
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,680
I certainly walked in here.

50
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,800
Don't bother about that.

51
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,360
You didn't have dinner. Taste it.

52
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,960
Did you make the dishes?

53
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,960
Come on.

54
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,270
What happened?

55
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,680
Nothing.

56
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,430
I cut my finger when I cooked.

57
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,520
How careless.

58
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,240
If I remember correctly,

59
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,550
it's the bamboo shoot

60
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,560
from Maqiji Restaurant.

61
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,000
This is the stewed chicken
from Wangtian Restaurant.

62
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,160
This is the spicy pork
from Tai Restaurant.

63
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,040
And this.

64
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,120
I also tasted it.

65
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,960
So, which one is your dish?

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,840
Sheng Mian,

67
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,950
I wanted you to have hot dishes
when you came back.

68
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,510
So, I went to your favorite restaurants

69
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,350
for signature dishes.

70
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,430
And your finger?

71
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,680
I indeed cooked for you.

72
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,120
Then, I cut some fruit.

73
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,430
It's still in the fridge.

74
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,150
Where's the cut?

75
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,830
I'm a man.

76
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,000
Such a minor cut

77
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,040
recovered very soon.

78
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,640
Give it to me.

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,840
What?

80
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,190
My spare key.

81
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,760
What if I don't?

82
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,670
Then, I'll move away.

83
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,040
Drop the act.

84
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,190
The doctor said you're OK.

85
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,120
Sometimes, the doctor is wrong.

86
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,720
And I haven't done checkups.

87
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,270
Maybe something's wrong.

88
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,360
My chest hurts.

89
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,480
My heart hurts.

90
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,680
I can hardly breathe.

91
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,360
You may have a heart problem

92
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,600
because you have too many schemes.

93
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,630
You act quite poorly.

94
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,000
Go back and practice more.

95
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,430
The doctor said you're OK.

96
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,540
You just had bruises.

97
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,630
You can't fool me.

98
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,950
Like I said,

99
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,270
I haven't done checkups.

100
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,710
Since ancient times,

101
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,800
no man has confessed his weakness

102
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,120
in front of his romantic rival.

103
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,920
A man will only let down his guard

104
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,000
in front of his sweetheart.

105
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,350
Fine.

106
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,830
I'll call Qi Chen.

107
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,270
He'll take you to the hospital

108
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,430
for a full checkup.

109
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,630
No need.

110
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,160
I'll just lie in your bed for a while.

111
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,520
Fu Yancheng, come back!

112
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,800
Fu Yancheng, why did you get in here?

113
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,080
Sheng Mian,

114
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,000
your bed feels so good.

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,630
I feel all right now.

116
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,760
Get up.

117
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,040
You get up.

118
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,560
Don't pretend to be sick. Get up.

119
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,240
I'm not pretending.

120
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,240
I have lovesickness.

121
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,070
Your scent is my miracle cure.

122
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,920
Then, smell it more.

123
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,630
I contacted Chinese and foreign clients.

124
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,000
They'll buy our products.

125
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,430
We'll accomplish our goal.

126
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:11,910
What's wrong?

127
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,840
What's on your mind?

128
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,270
My father had a wish.

129
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,390
He wanted to invent

130
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,590
a children's fabric

131
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,240
green, breathable, and waterproof.

132
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,830
But before his wish came true,

133
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,220
he passed away.

134
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,470
Wen Zhao,

135
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,800
can we...?

136
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,640
Sheng Mian,

137
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,750
our top priority

138
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,960
is to attain our goal

139
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,190
within a month.

140
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,720
It's not time to put our energy or money

141
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,040
on the research.

142
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,350
I see.

143
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,030
Sheng Mian,

144
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,030
don't worry.

145
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,720
I'll help you accomplish it.

146
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,840
For everything else,

147
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,040
after you hold down your job,

148
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,430
we'll sort it out.

149
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,560
OK?

150
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,840
OK.

151
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:51,790
I'll go back to work.

152
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,220
(Grandpa Fu)

153
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,920
Mian, did you quarrel with Yancheng?

154
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,000
The other day, he came back
and took away his passport.

155
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,560
He didn't tell me where he would go.

156
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,800
I got information from the airlines.

157
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,950
He flew to Europe

158
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,560
and then North America.

159
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:10,830
He's flying all over the world.

160
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,800
Has something happened?

161
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
When we had the video chat,
everything was OK.

162
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,640
Grandpa,

163
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,910
don't worry.

164
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,720
We're doing all right.

165
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,800
He must have gone out for an emergency.

166
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,790
Oh, I see.

167
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
Glad you're all right.

168
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,440
OK.

169
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,870
What has Fu Yancheng been doing lately?

170
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,240
Why would I think of him?

171
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,240
(I always wanted)

172
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,000
(to draw the line with him.)

173
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,960
(Now, I finally get what I want.)

174
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,390

Ms. Sheng has worked
for only half a month.

228
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,440
But our sales

229
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,480
have increased by 25%.

230
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,480
I believe under her guidance,

231
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,120
our company will go through a new peak.

232
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,480
Then, Ms. Sheng, please explain

233
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,600
why we have more orders

234
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,150
but a far lower annual rate.

235
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,480
I spent some money

236
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,960
on Michelle's patented fabric

237
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,360
