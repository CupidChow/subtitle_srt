00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,940
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,820
(Penny, Design Director)

4
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,780
Hello.

5
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,030
Penny, what's up?

6
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,030
Send me the proposal for Lanyang.

7
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,920
OK. I'm on it.

8
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,320
Oh, Penny.

9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,310
Do you know where I am?

10
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,680
Where are you?

11
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,070
At Fu Yancheng's villa.

12
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,710
He invited me over for a drink.

13
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,400
(Oh no.)

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,600
(I haven't told Liang Hanqing
about the husband thing.)

15
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,680
I'll be right there.

16
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,250
I have something to tell you.

17
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,190
OK. I'll be waiting.

18
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,190
I'll hang up.

19
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,230
Mr. Fu, you chose our studio

20
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,200
to design your villa.

21
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,840
This is really my honor.

22
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,430
You're being modest.

23
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,870
You have Penny, such a good designer.

24
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,430
I'm quite jealous

25
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,640
of your career and family.

26
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,480
That's right. Umm...

27
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,880
Fa... Family?

28
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,240
Hanqing.

29
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,480
Here I am.

30
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,120
Penny, what took you so long?

31
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,960
Come have a seat.

32
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,520
Mr. Fu and I

33
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,950
are talking happily.

34
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,680
Mr. Fu, why did you

35
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,430
suddenly invite Hanqing over?

36
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,070
Mr. Liang made efforts at my villa.

37
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,400
So, I invited him over

38
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,630
- for a drink.
- Thank you.

39
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,200
I'm quite curious.

40
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:15,950
When did you meet each other?

41
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,640
Penny and I

42
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,120
met in college.

43
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,560
At that time,

44
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,680
she was a very good student.

45
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:22,630
She studied very well

46
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,910
and did part-time jobs.

47
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,430
So, I knew

48
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,310
she would be a success.

49
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,080
After she graduated,

50
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,190
she rejected the offer
from big companies

51
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,400
and started a business with me.

52
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,680
When you first started a business,

53
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,310
did you think of getting closer?

54
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,150
Getting closer?

55
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,270
Yeah.

56
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,840
We not only got closer

57
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,870
but also got better.

58
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,870
Right, Hanqing?

59
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,000
That's right.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,360
We need to do better.

61
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,430
A toast to you.

62
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,680
Very well.

63
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,280
When I first got to know you,

64
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,520
I didn't know you were a couple.

65
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,430
We didn't want people to gossip.

66
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,080
You know.

67
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,360
If privacy and business mix,

68
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,280
it'll be confusing.

69
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,150
How could you be so careless?

70
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,080
Let me wipe it.

71
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,470
Pretend we're a couple.

72
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,500
Don't give ourselves away.

73
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,520
I'll explain later.

74
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,470
Don't drink too much.

75
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,400
Penny asked me not to drink too much.

76
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,520
That's good.

77
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,280
Are you cold?

78
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,870
No, Mr. Fu.

79
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,080
No need, Mr. Fu.

80
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,920
Don't move.

81
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,310
Mr. Fu,

82
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,520
are you cold?

83
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,000
Put on my coat.

84
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,630
The Spring Hotel owned by the Fu's

85
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,630
will open next week.

86
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,070
It offers many relaxing services.

87
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,320
You have to come.

88
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,320
No, thanks, Mr. Fu.

89
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,950
You're invited, too.

90
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,130
You also have to come.

91
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,360
A real man, indeed.

92
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,400
Penny,

93
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,390
isn't it inappropriate?

94
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,200
Here he comes.

95
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,470
Smile.

96
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,560
I can't smile.

97
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,120
You have to.

98
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,670
I...

99
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,510
Honey, are you OK?

100
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,800
Come and let me see.

101
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,440
Come on.

102
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,670
Are you OK?

103
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,110
Don't move.

104
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,080
Hug me.

105
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,000
Hug me. Come on.

106
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,950
Right now,

107
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,390
come to the lounge.

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,840
Did he leave?

109
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,520
Yes.

110
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,720
Will we give ourselves away?

111
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:27,630
I don't think so.

112
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,480
He was too far to see.

113
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,110
Fine.

114
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,120
I'll go get a drink.

115
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,400
Sorry, sir.

116
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,360
Your pool is in need of repairs.

117
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,630
Please move to another pool.

118
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,560
- Please come.
- It was all right just now.

119
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,840
- Why...?
- Come, please.

120
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,760
Come on.

It's the girl's locker room.

140
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,720
Are you insane?

141
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,600
What do you like about Liang?

142
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,240
I'm better than him in every way.

143
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,630
Penny.

144
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,160
Penny.

145
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,350
Are you OK?

146
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,840
I'm fine.

147
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,150
You go out.

148
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,510
I'll wait out there.

149
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,040
Mr. Fu,

150
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,040
what's bothering you?

151
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,160
Qi Chen,

152
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,790
I have a friend.

153
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,550
The woman he loves ignores him.

154
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,120
She only stays with her husband.

155
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,320
Mr. Fu,

156
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,080
I think you should...

157
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,710
No.

158
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,270
Your friend should

159
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,550
keep her working overtime at midnight.

160
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,990
She'll stay away from her husband.

161
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,680
By then, your friend

162
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,320
can do something.

163
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,390
He'll succeed.

164
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,510
Mr. Fu.

165
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,270
I got you here so late.

166
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,320
I'm sorry.

167
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,300
Did I disturb your sweet hours
with your husband?

168
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,510
It's OK, Mr. Fu.

169
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,680
This is my job.

170
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,870
Be seated.

171
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,840
I got you over urgently

172
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,320
because I want to discuss with you

173
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,390
the decoration style.

174
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,840
Today, I had some inspiration.

175
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,710
You know.

176
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,680
When I have inspiration,

177
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,270
I must talk to you about it.

178
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,480
Only in this way

179
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,870
can we find a spark.

180
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,280
Got it.

181
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,510
Mr. Fu,

182
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,510
go ahead.

183
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,790
For my living room,

184
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,320
I want the style of ancient Egypt.

185
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,510
The furniture

186
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,840
should be made of wood

187
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,990
with simple and low lines

188
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,000
as well as round corners.

189
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,080
The floor should

190
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,960
be made of terra-cotta or bricks.

191
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,270
For the bedrooms,

192
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,840
I want the style of ancient Rome.

193
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,510
It should be simple and majestic.

194
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,320
The most popular cedar wood will be used.

195
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,960
Only in this way can the house

196
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,550
bring out the best in me.

197
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,320
Mr. Fu, the style of the living room

198
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,440
is actually the Mediterranean style.

199
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,390
The style of the bedrooms

200
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,000
is actually from old Egypt.

201
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,110
People

202
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,840
sometimes have the wrong inspiration.

203
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,870
I get it.

204
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,870
Anyway,

205
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,390
you want me to redesign

206
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,200
your villa.

207
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,110
Right?

208
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,280
Right.

209
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,590
No problem.

211
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,040
Mr. Fu,

212
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,360
I've modified the design

213
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,230
and emailed it to you.

214
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,840
My work is done. I should go.

215
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,080
Who said it's done?

216
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,960
You need to read these documents.

217
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,480
We're on a serious time crunch.

218
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,670
These days, you'll have to stay and work.

219
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,550
I'll finish my job.

220
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,960
(You must be taking revenge.)

221
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,270
(How narrow-minded.)
