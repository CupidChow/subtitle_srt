5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,840

7
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,350

15
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,270
You can't get in.

16
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,200
Doctor, what will happen?

17
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,480
She bled too much.

18
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,040
I'm afraid she'll lose her baby.

19
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,070
I need her family
to sign the surgery notice.

20
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,070
Are you her family?

21
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,910
I'm her sister.

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,480
But I don't have the say.

23
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,840
I'll call her husband.

24
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,680
Yancheng,

25
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,590
my sister is in hospital.
She's in danger.

26
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,560
Come quickly.

27
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,070
Sheng Mian is trying so hard

28
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:40,950
to avoid the divorce.

29
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,640
I'm not lying, Yancheng.

30
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,950
She's really in danger.

31
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,000
When she was wheeled in,

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,120
she was calling your name.

33
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
She really loves you.

34
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,680
Don't divorce her, OK?

35
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:49,630
Shut up!

36
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,310
Drop the act.

37
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,790
Sheng Mian and I will only talk

38
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,040
about divorce.

39
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,120
He's too busy to come.

40
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,960
What do we do?

41
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,150
What's more important
than his wife's surgery?

42
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,360
Mian.

43
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,910
You're finally awake.

44
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,190
Do you feel unwell?

45
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,520
My baby.

46
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,430
Is it still alive?

47
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,520
The baby

48
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,430
may not live.

49
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,840
It was urgent just now.

50
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,800
I called your husband.

51
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,150
But he didn't come.

52
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,360
So, we wasted some time.

53
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,640
Mian,

54
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,750
Yancheng must be really busy.

55
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,030
Say no more.

56
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,800
I won't listen.

57
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,240
You go back.

58
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,400
I want to stay alone.

59
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,560
I'll go and pack your things

60
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,430
for hospitalization.

61
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,280
(I'll just make you
misunderstand each other)

62
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,840
(more and more.)

63
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,080
Sheng Mian, come out.

64
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,150
Sheng Mian.

65
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,360
Are you Sheng Mian?

66
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,150
I'm Sheng Weiyuan,

67
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,360
Sheng Mian's sister.

68
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,190
Sheng Mian, come out.

69
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,430
Ignoring this won't help.

70
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,270
Let's get everything straight.

71
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,390
Will you divorce me?

72
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,700
Sheng Mian, come out.

73
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,100

Yancheng,

77
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,270
don't be so mean.

78
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:36,560
My sister was sick.

79
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,120
And you didn't go to the hospital.

80
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,600
She's still there.

81
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,430
Do you have to divorce her now?

82
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,390
I don't care how Sheng Mian is doing.

83
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,680
To avoid the divorce,

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,870
she's trying everything.

85
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,480
Since you hide her from me,

86
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,430
I'll have to be rude.

87

married me three years ago.

112

But we've never met.

113
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,510
It proves we have no emotional ties.

114
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,840
Please approve of our divorce.

115
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,840
That's not true!

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,320
Your Honor,

I'll drop the suit.

118

I won't divorce.

to marry a stranger.

00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,720
I've never done anything wrong.

198
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,440
But I've wronged you.

199
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,120
I owe you so much.

00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,320
