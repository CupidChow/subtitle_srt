3
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,230
Yancheng.

4
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,040
Sheng Mian,

5
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,760
you forgave me, right?

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,840
Yancheng,

7
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,760
shall we get back together?

8
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,310
We'll have a baby.

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,840
Sheng Weiyuan?

10
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,190
Why are you here?

11
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:31,630
Yancheng.

12
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,120
Yancheng.

13
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,560
I've been loving you for years.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm Sheng Mian's sister.

15
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,590
I can do whatever she can do.

16
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,430
What?

17
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not divorced yet.

18
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,560
You can't wait to sleep with my husband?

19
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,680
Sheng Mian.

20
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,710
Let me explain.
I didn't know it was her.

21
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,550
Don't explain.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,840
I know everything.

23
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,520
Sheng Mian,

24
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,510
you trapped me.

25
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,680
Honey,

26
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,240
shall we get back together?

27
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,960
Sure.

28
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,240
He's just a man.

29
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,630
Tomorrow, I'll be
the CEO of the Sheng's.

30
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,120
I can get all kinds of men.

31
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,630
Impressive, Weiyuan.

32
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,150
Soon, I'll call you Miss Sheng.

33
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,680
Wish you good luck

34
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,840
with everything tomorrow.

35
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,360
Sheng Mian.

36
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,800
I know you just lied

37
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,240
about getting back together.

38
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,640
But I don't care.

39
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,680
I'll wait until you forgive me.

40
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,640
You're drunk.

41
00:02:59,150 --> 00:02:59,990
Go to sleep.

42
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,400
I should go.

43
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,640
(Sheng Mian,)

44
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,680
(I will get you back.)

45
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,700
(The Sheng's Group)
Everyone,

46
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,800
Mr. Sheng passed away

47
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,310
and we're sad about that.

48
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,910
But we need a leader, anyway.

49
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,960
You're holding Mr. Sheng's agreement

50
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,590
to transfer all his share

51
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,150
to Sheng Weiyuan.

52
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,280
So, everybody,

53
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,280
if you don't object,

54
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,240
Sheng Weiyuan will be the CEO.

55
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,910
Please trust me.

56
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,470
I'm Sheng Zhong's daughter.

57
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,120
I'll fulfill his dying wish

58
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,560
and make contributions to our company.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,840
Hold on.

60
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,310
My dear sister,

61
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,840
why aren't I invited

62
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,360
to such an important meeting?

63
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,150
Sheng Mian, it's not your seat.

64
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,400
Don't forget.

65
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,840
Your father left no share to you.

66
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,000
You have no position here, either.

67
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,560
You shouldn't have sneaked in.

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,840
Let me correct you.

69
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,590
I didn't sneak in.

70
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,360
I'm not you who always do dirty tricks.

71
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,590
I came in here

72
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,870
through the front door.

73
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,080
Besides,

74
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,270
I have some files

75
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,390
about how Ms. Su and Mr. Wang

76
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,750
faked my father's will.

77
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,880
Take a look, guys.

78
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,680
Sheng Mian, don't talk nonsense

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,630
with a few pieces of paper.

80
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,510
You must have lost your mind.

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Don't believe her.

82
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,560
Ms. Su,

83
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,240
you know what?

84
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,920
A few days ago, I met Mr. Wang.

85
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,480
He wanted me to tell you

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,270
he missed you and couldn't even sleep.

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,800
Sheng Mian, don't be ridiculous!

88
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,240
Mr. Wang and I are innocent!

89
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,070
Don't trust anything on the paper.

90
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,270
Innocent?

91
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,560
Everybody,

92
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,870
this is the camera footage

93
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,630
in my father's ward.

94
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,390
You can see Ms. Su Lan and Mr. Wang.

95
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,560
Are they innocent?

96
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,000
You will judge.

97
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,040
He passed out.

98
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,870
This terrible man.

99
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,000
How could he leave

100
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,950
all his property to Sheng Mian?

101
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,720
We need an early plan.

102
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,440
Don't worry.

103
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,680
You have me.

104
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,040
When Sheng Zhong dies,

105
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,160
we don't need to date sneakily.

106
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,400
Everybody,

107
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,040
this notarized will

108
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,040
(Notarization)
is what my dad actually made.

109
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,070
I'm the biggest shareholder.

110
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,160
I will take over the Sheng's.

111
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,110
Mom,

112
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,720
how could you do that with Mr. Wang?

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,070
Don't you feel guilty?

114
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,270
Weiyuan, it's my fault.

115
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,910
Everybody,

116
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,480
Sheng Weiyuan never knew

117
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,390
what I was doing.

118
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,070
She did really a lot

119
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,480
to take care of this company.

120
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,390
Please don't get her involved

121
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
because of what I did.

122
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,190
You're right, but so what?

123
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,560
You've never worked here.

124
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,070
You aren't familiar with our business.

125
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,480
Will they trust you with this company?

126
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,310
Who said she isn't familiar?

127
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,470
Everybody,

128
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,600
I'm Fu Yancheng, CEO of the Fu's

129
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,430
and investor of the Sheng's.

130
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,870
Sheng Mian has never worked here.

131
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,800
But she personally made the proposals

132
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,430
of your two rounds of funding.

133
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,430
And she has a perfect analysis

134
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,800
of the future development

135
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,390
of your company.

136
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,120
If Su Lan hadn't embezzled your money,

137
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,830
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

138
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,350
I believe

139
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,680
shareholders like you

140
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,000
are smart guys.

141
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,190
If you only listen to others

142
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,920
and don't trust Sheng Mian
with this company,

143
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,430
I advise you to withdraw.

144
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,480
I'll buy the share you sell.

145
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,430
According to company rules,

146
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,920
there's a one-month probation
for the CEO.

147
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,390
If she fails to increase our performance

148
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,830
by 20% during that,

149
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,360
she'll have to quit.

150
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,440
No problem.

151
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,390
You'll lose fair and square.

152
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,480
If I don't make it within a month,

153
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,120
I will quit.

154
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,440
Anyway,

155
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,270
thanks for coming and helping me.

156
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,870
Then can you give me a chance?

157
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,440
Let me buy you dinner.

158
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,870
I have a lot to say.

159
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,750
There's a psychological clinic nearby.

160
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,150
If you want to say something, go there.

161
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,870
I just took over the company

162
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,710
and I'll be busy.

163
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,160
Ms. Sheng,

164
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,870
the resumes of professional managers.

165
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,470
Thank you.

166
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,440
You want a manager?

167
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,960
May I help you?

168
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,440
No, thanks.

169
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,460
(Wen Zhao, First Love)

170
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,320
Ms. Sheng,

171
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,230
I came to interview.

172
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,230
Wen Zhao?

173
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,030
What are you doing here?

174
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,990
Sheng Mian,

175
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,200
long time no see.

176
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,710
Indeed.

177
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,040
It's been years.

178
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,030
You're what you were.

179
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,040
You haven't changed.

180
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:27,990
Who's this?

181
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,080
This is Mr. Fu Yancheng

182
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,920
from the Fu's.

183
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,240
I'm Sheng Mian's husband.

184
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,320
Hello, Mr. Fu.

185
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,750
I'm her classmate in college

186
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,870
and her first love.

187
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,270
I got you back

188
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,480
for something.

189
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,160
Go ahead, Mr. Fu.

190
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,240
Sheng Mian will take over the Sheng's.

191
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,840
She needs an experienced manager.

192
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,750
You've been managing

193
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,600
our business overseas.

194
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,720
I know

195
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,960
what you can do.

196
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,670
So, I want you

197
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,750
to help Sheng Mian.

198
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,750
But Mr. Fu,

199
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,910
you know she was my girlfriend.

200
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,720
And I still have feelings for her.

201
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,760
What if...?

202
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:29,120
She will divorce Fu Yancheng soon.

203
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,510
But I believe I'm right.

204
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,080
The two of them

205
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,240
are destined to be together.

206
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,270
They won't divorce.

207
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,030
Young guys like you will handle

208
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,150
your relationship.

209
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,270
I won't interfere.

210
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,720
I get your point.

211
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,720
Will I attend the meeting
this afternoon?

212
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,870
Over the years,

213
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,720
I've never met Mr. Yancheng.

214
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,800
No need.

215
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,480
When you work for Mian,

216
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,440
you will often see him.

217
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,080
It makes sense.

218
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,710
How do you feel?

219
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,870
How are you settling in?

220
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,230
Good.

221
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,150
Thank you, Wen Zhao.

222
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,080
I know when you were abroad,

223
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,000
you only worked for giant companies.

224
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,200
Now, you assist me with low pay.

225
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,910
I'll keep that in mind.

226
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,030
When my company takes off,

227
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,200
I'll make it up to you.

228
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,390
Sheng Mian,

229
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,360
I don't help you for money.

230
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,870
If I hadn't insisted on going abroad,

231
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,000
we wouldn't have broken up.

232
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,150
Actually, these years,

233
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,030
I often thought of you.

234
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,840
I know.

235
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,320
You'll get a divorce.

236
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,320
Sheng Mian,

237
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,670
I don't want to miss you.

238
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,750
Let go of her!

239
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,380
