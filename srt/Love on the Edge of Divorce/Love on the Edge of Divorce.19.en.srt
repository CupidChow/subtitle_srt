=Love in the Edge of Divorce=

2
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,940
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,110
What kind of guest

4
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,320
do I have to personally greet?

5
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,030
Grandson of your grandpa's friend.

6
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,350
Your grandpa said,

7
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,350
you only need to see him

8
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,840
and show our respect.

9
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,200
Grandpa, I've arrived.

10
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,120
What's this?

11
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,070
Later, you'll meet him

12
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,080
and eat with him.

13
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,710
A candlelight dinner

14
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,400
for two men?

15
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,230
It makes some sense.

16
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,910
Qi Chen,

17
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,430
what on earth is going on?

18
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,040
It's your grandpa.

19
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,510
He lied to get you here

20
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,120
and match-make you and Ms. Sheng.

21
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,350
Ms. Sheng is in her room.

22
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,240
Someone will bring her here later.

23
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,840
Such a scheming woman.

24
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,000
She fooled Grandpa again.

25
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,470
Which room is she in?

26
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,200
She's in...

27
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,750
Room 8802.

28
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,560
Get me two divorce papers.

29
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,150
But your grandpa...

30
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,030
Get going.

31
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,840
OK. I'm on it.

32
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,200
Come back.

33
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,430
Get the table cleaned.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,840
But...

35
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,800
Sheng Mian,

36
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,400
you're trying so hard
to avoid the divorce.

37
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,560
Since you're also here,

38
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,750
let's make a break.

39
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,280
Grandpa, you're so thoughtful.

40
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,470
You even prepared dinner.

41
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,920
Thank you, Grandpa.

42
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,280
You're Sheng Mian?

43
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,590
(So, Grandpa got me here)

44
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,960
(because he wanted to match-make)

45
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,590
(Fu Yancheng and me.)

46
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,080
(Then, I'll divorce you)

47
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,310
(as Penny.)

48
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,030
Sheng Mian got me here.

49
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,800
What did she do to you?

50
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,080
She warned me.

51
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,870
Unless you get a divorce,

52
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,360
I'll always be a mistress.

53
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,160
She played victim with Grandpa

54
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,680
and in turn she humiliated you.

55
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,520
She's quite scheming.

56
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,390
Go. Get in with me.

57
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,630
I don't want to see her again.

58
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,560
As long as I see you,

59
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,630
I don't care what others say.

60
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,230
Penny,

61
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,600
since you exiled me,

62
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,070
I've been missing you so much.

63
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,560
After tonight,

64
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,480
you'll divorce Sheng Mian.

65
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,630
I don't want this anymore.

66
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,000
OK.

67
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,430
I won't let you suffer.

68
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,720
Whatever she says,

69
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,190
you're the only wife I acknowledge.

70
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,830
I'm not good enough to be your wife.

71
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,950
I'm a mere designer.

72
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,270
We aren't fit for each other.

73
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,190
I don't care if you are fit for me.

74
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,800
There's love between us.

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,360
I'm to blame, anyway. I...

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,240
I should have found you earlier.

I tried so hard to get Mian there.

118
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,950
But you want to divorce her.

119
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:26,930
I warn you.

120
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,160
You have to get her back.

121
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,270
Otherwise, tomorrow,

122
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,750
you would attend my funeral.

123
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,960
Grandpa,

124
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,230
I beg you.

125
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,320
Stop interfering with my stuff.

126
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,870
I'm your grandson.

127
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,360
But I have my own life.

128
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,510
I just want the woman I love.

129
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,480
Tomorrow, bring that woman back.

130
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,590
I want to see her.

131
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,670
How mysterious.

132
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,600
What are we doing?

133
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,560
You'll know.

134
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,600
Grandpa.

135
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,550
Penny, I'll introduce you to Grandpa.

136
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Fu Yancheng,

137
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,000
is this your beloved woman?

138
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,390
How could you hug

139
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,600
even in front of me?

140
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,710
This is indecent.

141
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,030
Turn around.

142
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,800
Don't worry.

143
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,750
I won't give you a hard time.

144
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,390
Don't be scared. I'm here.

145
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,000
- You...
- Grandpa.

146
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,200
Nice to meet you.

147
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,080
I'm Penny.

148
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,200
We haven't met.

149
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,150
How rude of me.

150
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,030
Please forgive me.

151
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,470
Grandpa,

152
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,210
she's the girl I've been loving.

153
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,960
Let's sit down.

154
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,430
Grandpa, I'll get you down.

155
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,800
Grandpa,

156
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,030
don't tell him I'm Sheng Mian.

157
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,960
I'll explain later.

158
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,110
Grandpa,

159
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,110
I'm sorry.

160
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,720
I didn't know you were here.

161
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,270
So, I didn't bring any presents.

162
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,150
That's OK.

163
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,270
We're a fa...

164
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,870
We are

165
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,270
straightforward guys.

166
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,750
Today, I'm here to ask you

167
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,600
what plans you have.

168
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,270
Grandpa, I want to marry Penny.

169
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,590
Then Mi...

170
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,910
Shy girl,

171
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,440
what about you?

172
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,790
What do you think?

173
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,280
Grandpa,

174
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,450
I know.

175
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,240
I'm not good enough for him.

176
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,720
- Nonsense.
- Nonsense.

177
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,630
Grandpa, you approved?

178
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,440
You tell me

179
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,390
why you're not good enough.

180
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,180
Mr. Fu, he...

181
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,220
He's from an illustrious family

182
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,360
and he's handsome.

183
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,670
He's young but very successful.

184
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,720
He's such a rare nice man.

185
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,840
I'm but a mere designer.

186
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,240
I can't be good enough.

187
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,440
So, I'm so perfect in your heart.

188
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,720
I don't care about those.

189
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:30,870
Love is all I care about.

190
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,110
Grandpa,

191
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
let us be together.

192
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,170
Umm...

193
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,280
You must be aware

194
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,910
of the marital status

195
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,510
of my grandson.

196
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,150
Ms. Penny, are you single?

197
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,150
Grandpa, I...

198
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,510
I'm married, too.

199
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,360
Then, do you really

200
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,480
love Yancheng?

201
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,000
Yes.

202
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,440
I love him.

203
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,840
Good.

204
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,870
I'm so glad

205
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,960
to hear that.

206
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,630
I should go.

207
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,550
Why are you leaving?

208
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,000
Is that a yes?

209
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,840
Yes.

210
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,200
Did you hear?

211
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,040
Grandpa said yes.

212
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,120
Tell me earlier

213
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,510
before you do this again.

214
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,270
I don't like this kind of surprise.

215
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,230
Are you angry?

216
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,360
I want him to know

217
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,200
you're a good girl.

218
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,750
It's inappropriate for me

219
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,720
to see your grandpa now.

220
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,630
I'll divorce tomorrow.

221
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,470
