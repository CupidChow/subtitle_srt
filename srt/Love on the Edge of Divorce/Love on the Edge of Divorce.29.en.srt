=Episode 29=

3
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,260
(The Sheng's Group)

4
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,430
I had a headache yesterday.

5
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,920
I don't remember what happened.

6
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,390
Sheng Mian, Yancheng and I...

7
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,600
If the word gets out,

8
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,270
by then,

9
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,920
our company will be impacted.

10
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,150
I guess I have to be the CEO

11
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,760
to solve this problem.

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,040
I don't agree.

13
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,120
You send away Sheng Mian

14
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,760
and I'll drug Fu Yancheng.

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,230
When it starts to work,

16
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,510
you'll take some intimate photos of us.

17
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,350
What do you mean, Wen Zhao?

18
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,640
Isn't it obvious?

19
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,680
Oh, I not only photographed

20
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,150
how you got close to him

21
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,790
but also how you drugged him.

22
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,430
- Someone always wants
- I...

23
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,790
to break up our marriage.

24
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,550
Too bad.

25
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,680
She just never succeeds.

26
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,500
(Notarization)

27
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,510
I've transferred all my property

28
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,230
to Sheng Mian unconditionally.

29
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,480
Whether we're married or divorced,

30
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,040
she's able to keep this company.

31
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,000
Once I make up my mind,

32
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,030
I won't give up on her.

33
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,150
Nobody else

34
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,030
can take advantage of me.

35
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,800
Fu Yancheng, are you insane?

36
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,000
I can even die for you.

37
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,030
Let alone the money thing.

38
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,190
Tomorrow, I'll announce it to the media.

39
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,800
You're a coward.

40
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,750
No wonder he always outperforms you.

41
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,430
You'll never get up in there!

42
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,470
Thanks.

43
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,590
From this day on,

44
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,750
we'll suspend Sheng Weiyuan's work.

45
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,960
You'll have to think

46
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,470
what you can do.

47
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,150
Good.

48
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,710
You nearly act as well as me.

49
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,120
I'm better, actually.

50
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,800
Do I act worse than him?

51
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,280
Sheng Weiyuan asked me

52
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,560
to fake the news
of your marital problem.

53
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,200
What's her offer?

54
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,000
She'll get the Sheng's.

55
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,400
I'll get back Mian.

56
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,400
Why are you telling me this?

57
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,280
Don't you always want
to get back Sheng Mian?

58
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,560
I love her, indeed.

59
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,960
But I'll get her back decently.

60
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,200
And of course,

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,560
we can't waste Sheng Weiyuan's plan.

62
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,960
We can work together

63
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,360
and trap her instead.

64
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,560
OK. We'll do it together.

65
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,400
Wen Zhao,

66
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,430
if we weren't both
in love with Sheng Mian,

67
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,470
we would be friends, huh?

68
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,990
Don't overthink.

69
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,750
Wen Zhao,

70
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,120
I have some ideas about our plan

71
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,080
for the next quarter.

72
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,360
After today's meeting,

73
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,360
come to my office.

74
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,080
Here are the clients
we'll introduce to the Sheng's.

75
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,550
We'll talk.

76
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,630
OK. I'll be waiting tonight.

77
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,030
Mian, watch out!

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,920
Fu Yancheng!

79
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,120
- Mr. Fu.
- Yancheng.

80
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,550
- Are you OK?
- Mr. Fu, how you doing?

81
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,910
Go to the hospital.

82
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,310
You guard him.

83
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,150
I'll go get the car.

84
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,750
Fu Yancheng, wake up. Don't scare me.

85
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,790
Fu Yancheng.

86
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,670
Sheng Mian.

87
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,230
What happened?

88
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,150
Sheng Mian.

89
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,310
What's going on there? Sheng Mian?

90
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,350
Fu Yancheng.

91
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,480
Fu Yancheng, hang in there.

92
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,560
- Mr. Fu.
- Hang in there. We'll be arriving.

93
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,430
Fu Yancheng.

94
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,510
We're arriving, Fu Yancheng.

95
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,750
Mr. Fu, hang in there.

96
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,680
Move faster.

97
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,590
Don't worry.

98
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:09,910
You're awake?

99
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,600
How do you feel now?

100
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,150
I'm fine.

101
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,200
Now, I only have dizziness,

102
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,000
weakness, muscle soreness,

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,840
and confusion.

104
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,310
Nothing else is wrong.

105
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,030
I'm fine.

106
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,310
The doctor said I won't die.

107
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,660
Ouch.

108
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,680
My arm is injured, too.

109
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,640
It hurts.

110
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,040
I need someone to take care of me.

111
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,870
I'll call Qi Chen now.

112
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:35,790
No need.

113
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,070
He's on maternity leave.

114
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:38,900
His wife.

115
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,000
I'll call Grandpa.

116
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,190
Grandpa can't help.

117
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
He's aged.

118
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,870
If you tell him, he'll worry.

119
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,390
- Then...
- I'll take care of Mr. Fu.

120
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,600
I happen to have business problems

121
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,440
to ask him.

122
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,590
No way.

123
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,870
I can't handle those problems.

124
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,270
I'm dizzy and weak.

125
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,510
My arm hurts. I can't use it.

126
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,630
How can I handle such a big project?

127
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,240
Then, go home with me.

128
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,240
I know you care for me.

129
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,240
Sorry for the trouble.

130
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,480
You were trying to save me.

131
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,630
I'll take care of you.

132
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,400
Eat something.

133
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,490
What's wrong?

134
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,520
You...

135
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,950
You pressed that.

136
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,310
All the other parts can be injured.

137
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,720
But this part can't.

138
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,480
It's about our future

139
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,480
and Grandpa's wish.

140
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,040
Fu Yancheng.

141
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,190
How could you say you're fine?

142
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,000
I think you only talk tough.

143
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,600
I don't think so.

144
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,830
Just eat something.

145
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,320
Feed me, then.

146
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,230
Fine.

147
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,480
I'll feed you.

148
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,960
I don't want to eat this.

149
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,440
What do you want?

150
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,560
You know.

151
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,550
You're just not that hungry.

152
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,390
Eat nothing, then.

153
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,750
I'll eat.

154
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,870
Come on. Let me feed you.

155
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,790
Is it a blessing in disguise?

156
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,350
Shut up.

157
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,030
Eat and say nothing.

158
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,510
Sheng Mian.

159
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,320
Sheng Mian, come help me. Hurry.

160
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,510
I can't hold it. Hey.

161
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,160
What's wrong?

162
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,000
I'll go to the toilet.

163
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,080
Go ahead, then.

164
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,720
I'm still a little dizzy.

165
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,750
I can scarcely stand.

166
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,750
Then, you just sit.

167
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,630
You fed me too much food.

168
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,080
I feel bloated.

169
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,030
Help me, please.

170
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,840
I'm dizzy and weak.

171
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,840
You've seen it, anyway.

172
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,320
Fu Yancheng, you...

173
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,160
I have to go.

174
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,840
I know what you're thinking.

175
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,080
No peeking.

176
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,840
I won't peek.

177
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,710
Sheng Mian,

178
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,910
sleep in my bedroom.

179
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,550
What if I need you at midnight?

180
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,670
When I go to the bathroom.

181
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,790
You're injured and need a good rest.

182
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,360
You'll sleep in bed.

183
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,440
I'll take the couch.

184
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,150
Call me if you need anything.

185
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,600
I can't sleep soundly without you.

186
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,390
It's better for my recovery.

187
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,320
Don't even try that.

188
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,320
Now,

189
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,360
you need a good rest.

190
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,840
