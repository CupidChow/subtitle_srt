3
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,220
Sorry, sorry.

4
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,070
I got the wrong girl.

5
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:25,790
Mr. Fu,

6
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,560
can I leave now?

7
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,950
Do you hate to see my mother?

8
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,120
If you don't mind,

9
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,480
I can take you to see her decently.

10
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,310
It's not the time.

11
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,070
Fine.

12
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,760
Everything is arranged.

13
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,400
Penny will drink the spirit.

14
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,200
I told that man

15
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,280
to do exciting tricks during sex.

16
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,040
It'll be thrilling, then.

17
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,480
I can't show up.

18
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,190
You'll take people
to catch them in the act.

19
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,590
Remember.

20
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,470
Make sure Ms. Bai will see them.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,840
Count on me.

22
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,680
(Penny,)

23
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,560
(you escaped just now.)

24
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,030
(Later,)

25
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,030
(Ms. Bai will catch you in the act.)

26
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,000
I just saw my boyfriend

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,710
enter this room
with that terrible woman.

28
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,400
We've been together for five years.

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,840
But he's cheating on me.

30
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,030
Please be my witnesses.

31
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,190
- OK.
- No problem. This is outrageous.

32
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,280
How dare you seduce my boyfriend?

33
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,770
Get out, all of you.

34
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,470
Chuqing? Why is it you?

35
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,680
Stop shooting. Get out.

36
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,590
Get out, all of you!

37
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,640
Who?

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,190
Who's making a scene at my son's ball?

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,840
Chuqing?

40
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,640
Mrs. Fu.

41
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,710
You guys go out.

42
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,240
Mrs. Fu,

43
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,360
let me explain.

44
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,640
Chuqing,

45
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,710
how could you do this?

46
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,120
You really let me down.

47
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,280
(Once she thinks)

48
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,840
(I'm a dissolute woman,)

49
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,360
(I'll never be with Fu Yancheng.)

50
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,240
Mrs. Fu,

51
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,520
you get me wrong.

52
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,630
Look at this.

53
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,710
It's...

54
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,240
Yancheng's customized suit.

55
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,710
Why is it there?

56
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,520
- Is it...?
- Yes.

57
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,840
Actually, it's Yancheng

58
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,120
who couldn't help himself

59
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,800
and did it with me.

60
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,590
Why didn't you say it just now?

61
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,190
Yancheng left for some business.

62
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,400
In order not to disgrace his family,

63
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,680
I didn't say anything
in front of people.

64
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,360
Good girl.

65
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,430
I was wrong about you.

66
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,960
My son

67
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,310
has never done this to another girl.

68
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,630
From this day on,

69
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,830
you're my daughter-in-law.

70
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,480
I'll help you

71
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,190
kick Sheng Mian out.

72
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,160
Thank you, Mrs. Fu.

73
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,630
Can you step out for a second?

74
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,310
I want to take a bath

75
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,560
and tidy myself.

76
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,870
Oh, my son.

77
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,870
He did it so hard.

78
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,880
Good girl.

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You take a break here.

80
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,950
Wicked woman.

81
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,360
She changed so fast.

82
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,230
Chuqing,

83
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,430
how are you now?

84
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,240
Did Mrs. Fu give you a hard time?

85
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,750
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,040
I didn't know why the waiter

87
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,040
took you for Penny.

88
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,040
Come on. Save your breath.

89
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,110
Listen.

90
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,510
At whatever cost,

91
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,480
find the waiter.

92
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,720
Give him some bush money,

93
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,120
ask him to leave this hotel

94
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,070
and never come back again.

95
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,240
The man who had sex with me tonight

96
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,830
has to be Fu Yancheng.

97
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,110
OK.

98
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,560
I'll take care of it.

99
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,560
This is a blessing in disguise.

100
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,750
It's not bad

101
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,680
when Fu Yancheng's mother thinks

102
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,760
he had sex with me.

103
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,480
Then, she'll totally be on my side.

104
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,830
Yancheng.

105
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,030
Yancheng.

106
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,160
Hello. Did you get the wrong guy?

107
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,270
I'm not Yancheng.

108
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,270
Don't try to avoid me.

109
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,390
This is the suit you wear today.

110
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,000
(Mr. Fu gave me)

111
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,430
(this stained suit.)

112
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,730
(This woman mistook me for him.)

113
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,920
When that woman is drunk,

114
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,600
take her into the room.

115
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,670
Remember.

116
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,310
Make a big scene.

117
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,680
Are you Penny?

118
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,150
Penny?

119
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,830
Yes, I am.

120
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,000
(As long as you're with me,)

121
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,630
(you can take me for Penny.)

122
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,680
Ms. Penny, let me get you to your room.

123
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,920
Why did you drink so much?

124
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,070
I didn't drink too much.

125
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,190
Just a little bit.

126
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,470
I'll drive you home.

127
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,310
I'm not going home.

128
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,600
I want more wine.

129
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,000
They said,

130
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,160
the more I drink,

131
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,830
the more deals I'll get.

132
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,920

00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,550
if Miss Xiao told the truth.

192
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,440
Madam,

193
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,480
she loves Mr. Yancheng so much.

194
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,200
I don't think she would lie.

195
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,440
She's very likely to lie

196
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,800
just because she loves Yancheng.

197
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,360
After all, every woman wants

198
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,960
to be Yancheng's wife.

199
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,320
I don't want another trouble

200
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,870
after Sheng Mian is gone.

201
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,280
That's all for now.

202
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,420
Mom,

203
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,670
what's the emergency?

204
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,840
Sit down.

205
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,600
Yancheng, last night in the hotel,

206
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,480
did someone take advantage of you?

207
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,960
Mom,

208
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,320
she didn't take advantage.

209
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,480
She isn't like any other woman.

210
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,670
I pursued her.

211
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,080
I love her.

212
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,390
So, I don't want you

213
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,360
to interfere with us.

214
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,630
(So, Xiao Chuqing didn't lie.)

215
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,240
(Last night, Yancheng had sex with her.)

216
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,480
(I didn't know)

217
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,030
(Yancheng cared so much for her.)

218
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,120
Finally, you love someone.

219
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,320
Mom won't interfere.

220
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,030
You love her.

221
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,120
And you had sex with her.

222
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,480
You should divorce Sheng Mian

223
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,150
as soon as you can.

224
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,910
Don't worry. I'll do it soon.

225
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:35,270
(So, Penny stayed
with Fu Yancheng last night.)

226
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,560
(Penny,)

227
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,270
(I'll make you pay the price.)

228
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,670
My head hurts.

229
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,240
How long was I asleep?

230
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,630
Last night...

231
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,480
Mr. He, a toast to you.

232
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,750
Mr. Ji, nice to meet you.

233
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,320
Mr. Wang, we'd appreciate your help.

234
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,000
We won't let you down.

235
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,910
Why do I not remember
what happened later?

236
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,960
Why didn't you get more sleep?
