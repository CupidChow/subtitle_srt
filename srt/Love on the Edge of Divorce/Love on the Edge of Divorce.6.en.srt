3
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,920
I've confirmed

4
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,150
the specific terms.

5
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,520
If you don't mind,

6
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,430
let's sign it now.

00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,140
(Sheng)

8
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,420
(Signature of Party B: Sheng Mian)

9
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,950
You're Sheng Mian?

10
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,120
I...

11
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:19,700
(Sheng Mian)

12
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,590
So, you're Sheng Mian.

13
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,950
For 300 million,

14
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:26,840
you married.

15
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,000
Now, I want a divorce.

16
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,310
In the name of a designer,

17
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,840
you tried hard to approach me.

18
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,680
What are you up to?

19
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,120
When you fool me like this,

20
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,510
can you pay the price?

21
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,070
Mr. Fu,

22
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,350
I have an emergency.

23
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,190
I have to go.

24
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,520
Wait.

25
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,280
Sign it before you leave.

26
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,190
(What do I do?)

27
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,870
Why are your ears so red?

28
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,510
You're too close to me.

29
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,590
(I guess I have to do this.)

30
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,920
Mr. Fu.

31
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,430
Look.

32
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,030
Can I sign it like this?

33
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,920
Mr. Fu?

34
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,430
Mr. Fu,

35
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,520
hope we will

36
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,520
cooperate pleasantly.

37
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,470
I'll take my leave.

38
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,550
Mr. Fu,

39
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,310
your breath is taken away.

40
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,870
What happened?

41
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,150
Is there a thing between you

42
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,310
and Ms. Penny?

43
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,270
Don't be gossipy.

44
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,430
Come on.

45
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,840
I'm caring for you.

46
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,120
I've been making inquiries

47
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,240
about Ms. Penny.

48
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,360
If you aren't interested,

49
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,830
I won't say too much.

50
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:19,910
Come back.

51
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,200
Tell me.

52
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,390
Her birthday is two weeks away.

53
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,160
Won't you prepare a present

54
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,390
to make her happy?

55
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,600
I'm obviously going to buy her a present.

56
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,780
Thanks for picking a present for me.

57
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,850
I can tell

58
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,750
you care a lot for your female friend.

59
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,310
I wonder what she's like.

60
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,000
She's a designer.

61
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,390
She's talented but modest.

62
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,240
She's strong but sometimes fragile.

63
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,120
She's sweet but sometimes distant.

64
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,240
I can't help trying
to know more about her.

65
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,950
Then, what does she

66
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,430
usually like?

67
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,310
She'll like whatever you like.

68
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,680
I've been paying attention

69
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,720
to this Sunlight Necklace.

70
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,470
It's not sold on the market.

71
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,390
But I see it here.

72
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,520
I'll pick it, then.

73
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,240

(Xiao Chuqing, Young Lady of the Xiao's)

Chuqing?

90
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,760
Long time no see.

91
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,680
I came to see you upon arrival.

92
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,520
Are you surprised?

93
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,490
You should tell me.

94
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,770
Qi Chen could have picked you up.

95
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,640
Who's this?

96
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,360
Hello. I'm Penny,
designer of Mr. Fu's villa.

97
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,640
I'm Xiao Chuqing.

98
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,470
Yancheng,

99
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,040
don't you remember I'm also a designer?

100
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,270
Why didn't you tell me?

101
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,120
I didn't want to trouble you.

102
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,360
And I like Penny's design style.

103
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,720
I'll learn from you, Ms. Penny.

104
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,680
You flatter me, Miss Xiao.

105
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,030
Oh, Yancheng.

106
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,240
I want to hold a welcoming dinner today.

107
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,800
Shall I hold it here?

108
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,440
OK.

109
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,120
Ms. Penny, join us.

110
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,190
Thanks for inviting me.

111
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,240
But I won't come.

112
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,360
Many of our friends
need interior decoration.

113
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,200
Come and meet them.

114
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,230
Please come.

115
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,750
I also want you to meet more guys.

116
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,230
OK.

117
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,160
I'll come, then.

118
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,590
Chuqing,

119
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,780
when Fu Yancheng
got married three years ago,

120
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,630
you went away out of anger

121
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,680
and didn't see him anymore.

122
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,790
Now, you're back.

123
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,760
Did you think it through?

124
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,560
Or is it because Fu Yancheng will

125
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,160
divorce that humble woman?

126
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,590
Miss Xiao.

127
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,080
Penny,

128
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,240
I'm glad to have you here.

129
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,840
Penny.

130
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,240
This dress looks good on you.

131
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,230
Thanks, Mr. Fu.

132
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,320
Yancheng, your mother is here.

133
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,350
(Oh no.)

134
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,550
(I can't let her see me.)

135
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,230
Yancheng.

136
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,390
Ms. Bai, long time no see.

137
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,870
Can I have a word?

138
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,960
This way, please.

139
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,560
OK.

140
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,550
Sorry, Mr. Fu.

141
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,790
I was a little bit woozy.

142
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,150
Chuqing, I'm sorry.

143
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:35,990
It's OK.

144
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,150
Sorry, your dress is stained.

145
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,200
It's OK.

146
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,960
Yancheng invited you.

147
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,200
I can't make you unhappy.

148
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,630
Let me take you away to clean it.

149
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,630
Don't bother.

150
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,480
Never mind. Let's go.

151
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,960
My friend just gave me this dress.

152
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,840
I haven't worn it.

153
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,120
We have similar sizes.

154
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,960
Put it on.

155
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,510
No, thanks.

156
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,960
I'll just dry my dress.

157
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,550
You're Yancheng's friend.

158
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,490
So, you're my friend.

159
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,350
Make yourself at home.

160
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,670
Don't worry. I'll guard the door.

161
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,510
Off you go.

162
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,080
Penny,

163
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,960
we haven't known for a long time.

164
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,480
But I like you.

165
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,030
I'd like your opinion

166
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,550
on something.

167
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,030
I wonder if you wouldn't mind.

168
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,960
Thanks for trusting me.

169
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,120
Just go ahead.

170
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,240
Three years ago,

171
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,200
I indeed went abroad
because of Yancheng.

172
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,320
He broke his promise.

173
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,030
He told me he had a reason,

174
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,750
but I didn't forgive him.

175
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,840
A few days ago,

176
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,390
he said he would divorce

177
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,030
and asked me for a second chance.

178
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,230
Penny,

179
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,440
do you think

180
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,270
I should give him a chance?

181
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,750
Miss Xiao, you didn't know what to do.

182
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,390
But I guess when you asked me,

183
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,600
you had the answer inside you.

184
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,630
You don't need my opinion.

185
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,710
Anyway,

186
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,670
Mr. Fu is just my client.

187
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,960
I can't ask too much about his privacy.

188
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,230
Sorry, I can't help.

189
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,720
No wonder Yancheng
is impressed with you.

190
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,960
You're perfectly logical.

191
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,750
Are you done?

192
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,390
Let me do up your zip.

193
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,230
Yes, please.

194
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,800
Thanks.

195
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,440
Sunlight?

196
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,550
(It's the necklace I want.)

197
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,480
(Nobody else can wear it.)

198
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,410
You also know Sunlight?

199
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,910
It's a present from my best friend.

200
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,750
Beautiful, isn't it?

201
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,040
It's so beautiful.

202
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,960
(So, Fu Yancheng loves Xiao Chuqing.)

203
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,550
(It's always her.)

204
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,720
(What am I thinking?)

205
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,200
(Hilarious.)

206
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,120
Chuqing, time to cut the cake.

207
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,120
Penny, please hold my bag for a second.

208
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,440
Yancheng, I'm going to cut the cake.

209
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,960
But I don't know where Xiao Yang is.

210
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,030
Can you cut it with me?

211
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,390
Come on.

212
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,630
Let's have Chuqing

213
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,470
cut the cake.

214
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,440
Thank you, everybody.

215
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,600
Every one of you

216
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,280
is my closest friend.

217
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,930
I'm so happy to enjoy

218
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,360
your love for me.

219
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,200
I want to use a camera

220
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,450
to capture this precious moment.

221
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,940
Penny,

222
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,600
