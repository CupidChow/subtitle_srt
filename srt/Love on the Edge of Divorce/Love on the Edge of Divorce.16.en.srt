00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,270
Mr. Fu,

4
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,880
all the sections are ready.

5
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,320
Qi Chen's recovering.

6
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,640
Thank you for this time.

7
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,800
Yancheng.

8
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,190
Penny,

9
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,560
Yancheng must have been harsh.

10
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,950
He made you design

11
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,000
and serve as his assistant.

12
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,150
You had hard work.

13
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,430
No.

14
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,270
I enjoy working.

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,350
It will start soon.

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,320
Let's go.

(The Fu's New Product Release)

18
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,400
Distinguished guests,

19
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,400
nice to meet you.

20
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,640
Welcome to the Fu's release.

21
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,560
I'm honored to introduce to you

22
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,790
our new products.

23
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,400
In this era of innovation and change,

24
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,400
we're committed to bringing you

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,680
the most up-to-date

26
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,360
and the most influential products.

27
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,820
(The Fu's New Product Release)

28
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,310
We'll always lead this industry.

29
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,520
Hope we will work together

30
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,030
to create a brighter tomorrow.

31
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,430
Penny,

32
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,400
how I wish I could

33
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,870
stand by your side as your husband.

34
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,470
(Is it really so disgusting?)

35
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,840
Penny,

36
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,800
how I wish I could

37
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,310
stand by your side as your husband.

38
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,550
(Baby,)

39
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,150
(it's time to tell Dad the truth.)

40
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,640
Penny,

41
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,430
stop using those dirty tricks

42
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,310
to seduce Yancheng.

43
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,710
You know how a mistress

44
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,150
will end up.

45
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,190
I should say this to you.

46
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,750
After all, Mr. Fu is married.

47
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,270
You can't wait to be his mistress.

48
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,110
You...

49
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,110
Xiao Chuqing.

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,120
Who are you? Are you insane?

51
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,720
I'm Sheng Weiyuan.

52
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,950
My sister is Sheng Mian.

53
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,750
Fu Yancheng is my brother-in-law.

54
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,310
Miss Xiao, you're so shameless.

55
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,000
You want a married man

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,510
and try to break his family.

57
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,680
Go look closely at the release.

58
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,630
Who's seducing him?

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,310
My sister is Penny,

60
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,510
the talented new designer.

61
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,480
They're not only a couple

62
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,870
but also work well together.

63
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,790
Why did you say?

64
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,190
Penny is Sheng Mian?

65
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,520
You know what?

66
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,630
My sister is pregnant.

67
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,920
Don't steal her husband.

68
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,800
What? What did you say?

69
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,760
I said,

70
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,750
my sister is carrying
Fu Yancheng's baby.

71
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,950
You will never get him.

72
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,600
(A wise woman
never needs to do anything)

73
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,000
(to get what she wants.)

74
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,030
(Mian,)

75
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,390
(let me see)

76
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,920
(if you can keep the baby.)

77
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,360
(Everybody knows
Yancheng hates Sheng Mian.)

78
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,680
(I don't think he knows
Penny is Sheng Mian.)

79
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,040
(His family must not know)

80
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,360
(Sheng Mian is carrying his baby.)

81
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,000
- Chuqing.
- Mrs. Fu.

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,680
Why do you visit me again?

83
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,720
We just had some tea yesterday.

84
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,030
Mrs. Fu,

85
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,160
I've heard something

86
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,560
that disgraces your family.

87
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,950
I wonder if I should tell you.

88
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,910
What is it?

89
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,830
Who dares

90
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,720
to spoil our reputation?

91
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,360
Your daughter-in-law,

92
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,760
Sheng Mian.

93
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,160
Oh, that lewd woman.

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,840
What did she do?

95
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,350
She...

96
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,430
She's pregnant.

97
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,560
What?

98
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,240
You know how much Yancheng hates her.

99
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,720
It can't be his baby.

100
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,950
I don't know

101
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,920
whose baby it is.

102
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,440
But I heard

103
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,190
Sheng Mian is very promiscuous.

104
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,630
Maybe she doesn't know

105
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,870
whose baby she's carrying.

106
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,240
This is outrageous.

107
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,160
For her sake,

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,190
we've helped her family so many times.

109
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,390
How dare she cheat on my son?

110
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,190
For the record,

111
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,720
you'd better confirm

112
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,830
if she's really pregnant.

113
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,250
Look into Sheng Mian's clinic visits.

114
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,830
Don't worry too much.

115
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,240
Maybe it's just a rumor.

116
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,510
She didn't betray Yancheng.

117
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,270
OK. I get it.

118
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,160
Sheng Mian really cheated on Yancheng.

119
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,360
She's carrying someone else's baby.

120
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,510
What a cheap woman.

121
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,470
This baby

122
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,120
can't live.

123
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,880
Hello.

124
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,880
Are you free tomorrow?

125
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,750
I need you to confirm

126
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,560
some details in the villa.

127
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,110
You may decide.

128
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,560
I like whatever you like.

129
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,840
I may decide?

130
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,560
What if the hostess of this villa

131
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,680
doesn't like the style?

132
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,720
She'll certainly like what she picks.

133
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,400
So,

134
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,360
I have a lot in common with Ms. Sheng.

135
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,750
Why do you bring her up?

136
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,710
Mr. Fu,

137
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,840
you and Ms. Sheng are a couple.

138
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,750
Is there a misunderstanding between you?

139
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,710
Misunderstanding?

140
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,600
She tricked my grandpa.

141
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:43,870
No misunderstanding.

142
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,750
Actually, I...

143
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,350
You what?

144
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,590
Nothing.

145
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,840
I'll see you tomorrow evening.

146
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,120
To tell you something.

147
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,920
OK.

148
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,790
I'm in hospital.

149
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,390
You're my daughter-in-law.

150
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,670
Shouldn't you come and take care of me?

151
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,910
You have really bad manners.

152
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,840
OK.

153
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,790
I'll be right there.

154
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,120
This is the place.

155
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,510
Why would anyone

156
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,550
live in such a remote hospital?

157
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,630
Anybody?

158
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,960
Help!

159
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,790
Anybody? Help!

160
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,920
Help!

161
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,750
Anybody here?

162
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,520
Help!

163
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:22,910
Mrs. Fu?

164
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,790
What do you want?

165
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,000
What do I want?

166
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,790
I'd like to ask you.

167
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,150
Why did you cheat on my son?

168
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,320
You utterly disgraced my family.

169
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,750
Over the years,

170
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,870
we have

171
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,600
helped your family so much.

172
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,080
How dare you have an affair

173
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,790
and even carry someone else's baby?

174
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,960
Do you think

175
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,960
we won't care?

176
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,080
I didn't do that.

177
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,720
Mrs. Fu, let me explain.

178
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,000
- I didn't.
- Don't deny it.

179
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,110
You know what?

180
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,240
- Whatever you say...
- I didn't.

181
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,440
Today,

182
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,910
you have to do

183
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,240
this abortion.

184
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,510
Do it.

185
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,840
No.

186
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,040
No.

187
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,040
Don't.

188
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,710
Please don't.

189
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,200
It's Fu Yancheng's baby!
