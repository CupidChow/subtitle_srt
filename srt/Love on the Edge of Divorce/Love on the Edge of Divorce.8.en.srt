00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:58,550
Yancheng.

4
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,710
Chuqing, what was that sound?

5
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,780
Nothing.

6
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:02,960
I twisted my ankle.

7
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,480
I suddenly remembered,

8
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,790
I'll meet an important client.

9
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:08,630
Give me a lift.

10
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,590
Come on. Let's go.

11
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,620
(Outpatient)

12
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,260
(Emergency Area)

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,120
What's with my wrist?

14
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,950
Its nervous system is injured.

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,400
Without a surgery from an expert,

16
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,680
it can hardly heal.

17
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:34,630
Doctor,

18
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,760
I'm a designer.

19
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,280
I need my wrist.

20
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,870
But I can't be of help.

21
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,430
The two top experts in our hospital

22
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,480
are both away.

23
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,710
Doctor,

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
if my wrist can't heal,

25
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,710
I ever be able to hold a pen again?

26
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,950
Doctor, the experts are here.

27
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,150
Give the surgery now.

28
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,520
Yancheng, thanks for the ride.

29
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,360
I should go.

30
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,430
Mr. Fu, someone called,

31
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,560
saying Ms. Penny was injured.

32
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,450
Why didn't you tell me?

33
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,310
Get in the car.

34
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,880
Doctor, how was the surgery?

35
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,080
Is her wrist OK?

36
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,030
Are there after-effects?

37
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,870
Mr. Fu,

38
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,560
you asked too many questions.

39
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,980
How can the doctor reply?

40
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,120
Sorry, doctor.

41
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,030
It's OK. Don't worry, Mr. Fu.

42
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,170
The surgery went well.

43
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,870
Her wrist is cured.

44
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,590
No after-effects.

45
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,120
But she needs to stay
for a couple of days.

46
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,400
Thanks, doctor.

47
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,200
You're awake.

48
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,360
Does it still hurt?

49
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,430
Don't get up.

50
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,030
The doctor advised you
to rest.

51
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,360
Don't worry.

52
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,360
I'll take care of everything else.

53
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,080
Aren't you supposed
to be with Miss Xiao?

54
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,190
Don't worry about me.

55
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,030
I...

56
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,360
Why?

57
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,290
You don't think
that I like Xiao Chuqing, do you?

58
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,580
I don't need to know

59
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,500
who you like.

60
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,550
It's none of my business.

61
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,940
But I want you to know.

62
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,180
Xiao Chuqing and I are just friends.

63
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,100
The one I love is...

64
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,940
Penny.

65
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,140
Yancheng, you're also here.

66
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,940
Upon hearing Penny was injured,

67
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,920
I rushed over to see her.

68
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,660
I'll fetch your medicine.

69
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,500
You guys talk.

70
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,700
Penny, do you feel better?

71
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,060
Hereafter, you must be careful.

72
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,260
(So, Xiao Chuqing is behind all this.)

73
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,580
However careful I am,

74
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,060
someone always try to get rid of me.

75
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,260
Don't be kidding, Penny.

76
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,940
Nobody wants you to get hurt.

77
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,480
Why would anyone want to get rid of you?

78
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,180
I'm tired. I need some rest.

79
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,980
OK. You rest well.

80
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,620
The bouquet gives me a headache.

81
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,820
Take it away.

82
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,780
Yancheng,

83
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,940
I came to see Penny
because I'm worried about her.

84
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,260
But she seems to be in a bad mood.

85
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,970
She nearly lost the use of her wrist.

86
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,740
She was really frustrated.

87
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,020
She has a reason to be upset.

88
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,340
I'm so glad that she's fine.

89
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,780
It's my fault.

90
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,180
I asked you to drive me,

91
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,340
so you didn't find her injured in time.

92
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,180
Yancheng,

93
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,540
do you blame me?

94
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,540
No.

95
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,740
You didn't know it would happen.

96
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,840
Taking care of Penny is hard work.

97
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,300
Take care of yourself, too.

98
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,580
(Outpatient)

99
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,140
The doctor said,

100
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,140
after you are discharged,

101
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,660
you should rest for month.

102
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,980
Don't touch your wound

103
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,950
or use your right hand
unless you have to.

104
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,180
I get it.

105
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,530
And...

106
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,900
Go to my place when you're out.

107
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,770
I'll take care of you.

108
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,820
No, thanks, Mr. Fu.

109
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,980
I'll go back home.

110
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,620
Your wrist was so badly injured.

111
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,940
I'm responsible for it.

112
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,820
Technically, it's a work-related injury.

113
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:58,900
So, I have the reason

114
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,100
to take care of you.

115
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,820
- But...
- No buts.

116
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,100
We'll do that.

117
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,660
Mr. Fu,

118
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,340
if you're busy, don't bother
taking care of me.

119
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,460
The nanny will do.

120
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,300
It's OK.

121
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,020
Your wrist was injured during work.

122
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,500
I should take care of you.

123
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,060
The chicken soup is nutritious.

124
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,180
Drink it and you'll get better faster.

125
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:04,980
Did you make it?

126
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,400
