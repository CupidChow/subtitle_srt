=Episode 1=

3
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,280
Fu Yancheng?

4
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,060
(Financial News, Friday
Fu Yancheng became the CEO of the Fu's.)

5
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,520
(Three years ago)
(Fu Yancheng became the CEO of the Fu's.)

6
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,240
(As soon as he took the job)

7
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,100
(at the age of 24,)

8
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,710
(he landed the renovation project
of the western suburbs.)

9
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,960
(He became China's youngest)

10
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,630
(well-known entrepreneur
of the new generation.)

11
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,400
He's good, huh?

12
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,960
He's my grandson.

13
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,860
(Grandpa Fu, Former Chairman)
What do you think, Mian?

14
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,870
He's good enough for you, huh?

15
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,000
Thanks to you,

16
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,360
I managed to live.

17
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,080
I can't

18
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,960
do too much to repay you.

19
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,400
I'll let my grandson

20
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,710
marry you.

21
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,150
- But...
- For your marriage,

22
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,840
my corp will invest 300 million

23
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,030
into your father's corp.

24
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,530
I don't want to marry him.

25
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,800
It's OK if you don't.

26
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,360
I just think if you marry Fu Yancheng,

27
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,300
(Sheng Zhong, Mian's Dad)
you'll live a better life.

28
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,590
It's OK.

29
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,240
I'll think of another way.

30
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,190
I would rather die

31
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,240
than let your mother's hard work

32
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,430
go up in smoke.

33
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,270
Dad.

34
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,310
Never mind.

35
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,400
I want you to be happy.

36
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,470
Dad.

37
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,400
I'll marry him.

38
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,620
(Marriage License)

39
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,460
(Sheng Mian)

40
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,640
Mian,

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,840
Yancheng is too busy to come back.

42
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,840
Sorry for this.

43
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,500
(Marriage License)

44
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,630
(Since we got married,)

45
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,960
(we haven't met for three years.)

46
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,280
(For the first time,)

47
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,590
(we met in bed.)

48
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,150
(But how did we sleep together?)

49
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,340
(One day earlier)
Mian?

50
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,680
- Mr. Fu.
- What are you doing alone?

51
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,770
(Su Lan, Mian's Stepmother)
You and Fu haven't met

52
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:01,680
since you got married.

53
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,030
Now, he's finally back.

54
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,430
Go say hello to him.

55
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,750
- But...
- You're his wife.

56
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,630
And our second round
of funding will start.

57
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,750
Ask Fu Yancheng to help your father.

58
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,630
(Is there something up with the wine?)

59
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,790
(Forget it.)

60
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,430
(For whatever reason,)

61
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,000
(under such circumstances,)

62
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,390
(I can't let him know who I am.)

63
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,680
(I should leave now.)

64
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,110
How much do you want?

65
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,350
None.

66
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,710
None?

67
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,000
Are you going to pester me?

68
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,000
I'll give you what you deserve.

69
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,190
But you'd better give up

70
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,950
on what you don't deserve.

71
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,360
I know you're rich, Mr. Fu.

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,890
But I don't need money.

73
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,610
Last night,

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,750
we just got what we wanted.

75
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,180
(Mom)

76
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,870
Yancheng, since you're back,

77
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,160
divorce your wife.

78
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,800
It's been three years.

79
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Solve the problem.

80
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,270
I know.

81
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,070
Sheng Mian's father sold her.

82
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,040
I will divorce her.

83
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,070
(Sold me?)

84
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,270
(So, this is how)

85
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,560
(he thinks of our marriage.)

86
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,950
(I don't need to tell him who I am.)

87
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,330
(I'll pretend
nothing happened last night.)

88
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,500
Playing hard to get won't work on me.

89
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,800
Take the money and go.

90
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,360
When you get out of here,

91
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,830
forget what happened.

92
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,510
I'm not as rich as you.

93
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,360
But don't reject it.

94
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,150
This penny...

95
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,350
You deserve it.

96
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,230
Stop.

97
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,630
(She's a virgin.)

98
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,500
(Complex, Outpatient)

99
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,310
Last night, you drugged my wine.

100
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,680
Was Fu Yancheng satisfied with you?

101
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,040
Did he say when he would

102
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,310
support our funding?

103
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,390
I may let you down, Ms. Su.

104
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,680
I didn't take Fu Yancheng's money.

105
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,040
I'm not like you

106
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,000
who can't live without a man.

107
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,960
You...

108
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,560
I acquiesced to a divorce.

109
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,880
I warn you.

110
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,190
Stay out of my business.

111
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,680
Divorce?

112
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,000
How could you be so selfish?

113
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,040
If Weiyuan was a bit healthier

114
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,070
instead of being so weak,

115
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,630
you wouldn't have married

116
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,800
such a rich young man.

117
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,600
How dare you divorce him?

118
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,160
(Bed No.33-35)
You should think

119
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,360
about how to make him support our corp.

120
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,640
Mom.

121
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,740
(Sheng Weiyuan, Sheng Mian's Sister)

122
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,040
Don't say anything like that.

123
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,480
Life isn't easy for Mian.

124
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,960
Weiyuan,

125
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,480
why did you come out?

126
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,560
How do you feel?

127
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,590
The doctor said,

128
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,600
if my examination turns out all right,

129
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,240
I can have the operation immediately.

130
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,120
I'll try hard to support our family.

131
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,830
Silly girl.

132
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,160
Dad and Mom only want you

133
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,630
to be healthy.

134
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,230
Go back in.

135
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,200
It's cold out here.

136
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,760
Go inside.

137
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,830
Hi, Mrs. Fu.

138
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,600
Don't call me that.

139
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,040
(Bai Qiu, Fu Yancheng's Mother)

140
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,160
Call me Ms. Bai.

141
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,640
Ms. Bai.

142
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,480
Come to my family now.

143
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,510
Don't think you can have an advantage

144
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,120
when Yancheng is back.

145
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,360
Let me be honest.

146
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,800
He's back just to divorce you.

147
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,830
If you know what's good...

148
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,240
OK. I'll be right there.

149
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,470
What?

150
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,910
Fine.

151
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,480
I called Yancheng, too.

152
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,870
He'll arrive soon.

153
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,230
Mr. Fu,

154
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,240
the villa you wanted

155
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,240
has been bought for you.

156
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,910
We've also chosen

157
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,080
some good design companies.

158
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,320
That villa matters a lot to me.

159
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,790
Have it well designed.

160
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,280
Yes.

161
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,390
Mr. Fu,

162
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,390
will you really divorce Sheng Mian?

163
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,750
You haven't even met her

164
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,080
before you want a divorce.

165
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,910
If you fall in love with her later,

166
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,270
that'll be a bad bargain.

167
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,510
It won't happen.

168
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,360
She's just a snob.

169
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,410
She married me

170
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,750
merely for the investment.

171
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,200
Better safe than sorry.

172
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,200
If you get along with her

173
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,670
and realize she's...

174
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,630
If someone has to be fired, you'll be it.

175
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,210
You should know.

176
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,200
Father was so stubborn

177
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,960
that we allowed Yancheng to marry you.

178
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,560
Now, Yancheng has taken over the Fu's.

179
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,530
So, he's in charge.

180
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
You aren't good enough for him.

181
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,120
He deserves someone better.

182
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,710
You're right.

183
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,030
I know I'm not good enough.

184
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,600
Glad you know that.

185
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,030
You know exactly

186
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,870
the condition of your father's corp.

187
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,840
We helped you once.

188
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,910
But we won't help you again.
