=Love in the Edge of Divorce=

2
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,940
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,030
Why are you leaving?

4
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,470
Is that a yes?

5
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,280
Yes.

6
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,680
Did you hear?

7
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,570
Grandpa said yes.

8
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,600
Tell me earlier

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,000
before you do this again.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,520
I don't like this kind of surprise.

11
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,590
Are you angry?

12
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,680
I want him to know

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,520
you're a good girl.

14
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,200
It's inappropriate for me

15
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,310
to see your grandpa now.

16
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:10,950
I'll divorce tomorrow.

17
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,120
Wait for me.

18
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,520
(Dad,)

19
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,200
(I'll divorce Fu Yancheng tomorrow.)

20
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,230
(Maybe it's the best for us.)

21
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,400
(How I wish)

22
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,960
(you could be by my side)

23
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,680
(at this moment.)

24
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,710
(Dad,)

25
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,480
(I miss you so much.)

26
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,860
(May 30th)

27
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,870
How time flies!

28
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,030
You've grown up.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,870
How I wish

30
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,030
I could accompany you for longer.

31
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,710
He passed out.

32
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,400
This terrible man.

33
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,590
How could he leave

34
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,590
all his property to Sheng Mian?

35
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,470
We need to plan ahead.

36
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,190
Don't worry. I'm here.

37
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,710
When Sheng Zhong dies,

38
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,710
we don't need to date sneakily.

39
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,240
(Oh, I see.)

40
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,080
(No wonder Su Lan easily)

41
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,560
(stole the company's money.)

42
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,430
(They've been having an affair.)

43
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,710
"I'll leave all my share

44
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,120
(Signatures)
and my property

45
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,710
to my daughter Sheng Weiyuan."

46
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,310
(The will must be a fake, too.)

47
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,410
Grandpa,

48
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,710
I don't mean to keep it from Yancheng.

49
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,440
Mian,

50
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,190
you're a good girl.

51
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,910
I know you must have your reason

52
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,680
for all of this.

53
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,030
I'll keep your secret.

54
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,840
When you want him to know,

55
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,190
you can tell him yourself.

56
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,960
Grandpa.

57
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,750
Actually, I'm here

58
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,710
to ask you for a favor.

59
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,750
What is it?

60
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,240
It's my family business.

61
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,040
The Fu's gave us two rounds of funding.

62
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,960
Theoretically, our capital chain

63
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,310
wouldn't have been broken.

64
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,850
But when my father was sick,

65
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,800
there was no money in the account.

66
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
I suspect there's a problem.

67
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,560
Our companies have
frequent transactions.

68
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,120
I wonder if I can investigate

69
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,520
through your company.

70
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,240
And...

71
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,190
I also suspect there's a problem

72
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,030
with my dad's will.

73
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,430
Who do you suspect?

74
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,280
Su Lan.

75
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,470
But it's just a guess.

76
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,630
I can't expose her

77
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,150
without conclusive evidence.

78
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,320
So...

79
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,720
Please help me, Grandpa.

80
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,440
Mian,

81
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,920
I'd love to help you.

82
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,000
But I'm old

83
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,270
and fuzzy-headed.

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,510
I can't even read account books.

85
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,510
I really can't help you.

86
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,920
I'm being thoughtless, Grandpa.

87
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,820
But I think of a man

88
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,240
who can lend you a hand.

89
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,390
Will you let him do it?

90
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,630
I'll certainly accept

91
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,070
whoever you recommend.

92
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,030
OK.

93
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,000
I'll tell Yancheng.

94
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,830
Let him check the accounts.

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,840
Hey, Grandpa.

96
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,110
Come on.

97
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,160
You just said

98
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,800
you would accept my recommendation.

99
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,960
Now,

100
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,360
only Yancheng knows the best

101
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,390
about the two companies

102
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,830
and has the most connections.

103
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,560
If you don't agree,

104
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,130
I can't do anything else.

105
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,030
But...

106
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,430
Mian, for now,

107
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,600
don't divorce Yancheng.

108
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,200
Your marriage with him

109
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,560
will only facilitate you.

110
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,740
When your father's case is over,

111
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,950
you decide whether you'll divorce.

112
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
I give you my word.

113
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,390
I won't interfere with your decision.

114
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,440
OK?

115
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,240
Grandpa, I should go.

116
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,750
Good move.

117
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,670
Grandpa,

118
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,040
did Sheng Mian come again?

119
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,240
Did she change her mind again?

120
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,350
She did.

121
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,480
Sheng Mian was here.

122
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,520
She did it again.

123
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,120
But she said

124
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,560
she wouldn't ravish you
against your will.

125
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,160
She'll divorce you.

126
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,040
But before that,

127
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,600
you have to give her a hand.

128
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,430
Her family is in trouble.

129
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,310
Again.

130
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,760
Tell me, Grandpa.

131
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,190
What happened?

132
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,750
I guess her stepmother

133
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:26,950
colluded with someone

134
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,920
to steal company money.

135
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,480
Investigate for her

136
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,040
and see what exactly happened.

137
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,350
Also,

138
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,040
after you finish this,

139
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,040
I promise you

140
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,230
you'll marry Penny.

141
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,000
Are you serious?

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,950
Of course.

143
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,030
On the condition

144
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,480
that you help Sheng Mian find the truth.

145
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,720
OK. I'm on it.

146
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,960
Oh, wait.

147
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,910
Do it

148
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,160
discreetly.

149
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,430
You do it personally.

150
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,360
Since you and Penny love each other,

151
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,240
let her join you.

152
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:00,800
OK. I get it.

153
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,960
I believe

154
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,480
as they stay together,

155
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,720
Sheng Mian won't want
to divorce Yancheng.

156
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,700
(Welcome to our engagement party.)

157
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,160
When is our appointment?

158
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,470
At three.

159
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,330
We have one hour.

160
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,270
There's still time.

161
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:29,710
Mr. Fu?

162
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,510
Oh no. What a coincidence.

163
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,070
It truly is a small world.

164
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,780
(Welcome to our engagement party.)

165
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,880
Mr. Liang.

166
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,680
Since when are you a janitor?

167
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,760
Mr. Fu,

168
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,720
what a coincidence.

169
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,390
I have a renovation project here.

170
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,560
I'm measuring the hotel.

171
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,070
Do you think I can't recognize it

172
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,190
when your face is stained?

173
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,350
Liang Hanqing,

174
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,510
will you still not tell the truth?

175
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,800
What's your relationship with Penny?

176
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,480
It's too hard for me.

177
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,510
I can't offend Penny.

178
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,360
Nor can I offend you.

179
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,360
I'll be screwed anyway.

180
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,150
Let me be honest, Mr. Fu.

181
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,550
Penny and I aren't a real couple.

182
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,270
We didn't mean to lie, really.

183
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,110
Say it again.

184
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,390
We didn't mean to lie.

185
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,590
Back up there.

186
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,490
Back up?

187
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,270
Penny and I aren't a real couple.

188
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,910
I knew she wouldn't
love someone like you.

189
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,960
That's right.

190
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,040
This is your present.

191
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,320
Password is her birthdate.

192
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,270
Such a rich man.

193
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,720
He knows how to insult.

194
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,910
But I love it.

195
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,960
Don't tell Penny

196
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,840
we met today.

197
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,720
If she knows,

198
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,840
I'll make your studio disappear.

199
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,960
Don't worry, Mr. Fu. My lips are sealed.

200
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,720
He's really weird.

201
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,510
No wonder Penny doesn't like him.

202
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,360
Why was so much money given

203
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,840
to this company?

204
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,910
Dad never told me about it.

205
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,510
Are you keeping something from me?

206
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,160
(Oh no.)

207
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,030
(Grandpa must have)

208
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,120
(told him everything.)

209
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,240
