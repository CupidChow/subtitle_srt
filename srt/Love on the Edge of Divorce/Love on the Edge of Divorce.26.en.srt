=Episode 26=

3
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,440
I know.

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,880
You'll get a divorce.

5
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:58,910
Sheng Mian,

6
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,390
I don't want to miss you.

7
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,350
Let go of her!

8
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,870
Isn't it inappropriate

9
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:36,950
to grab the hand

10
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,430
of a married lady?

11
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:40,910
Why are you here?

12
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,210
Mr. Wen is helping my wife.

13
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,510
As your husband,

14
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,200
I should thank him.

15
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,400
Excuse me.

16
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,240
Three cups of coffee.

17
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,560
She never drinks coffee.

18
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,040
People change.

19
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,500
You guys talk.

20
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,840
I'll use the washroom.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,870
Give up on Sheng Mian.

22
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,800
She's my wife.

23
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,560
She married me.

24
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,920
She's my wife.

25
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,150
And she'll always be.

26
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,190
You had the wrong marriage

27
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,590
for some years.

28
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,710
She shouldn't have married you.

29
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,190
Now, I'm back.

30
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,400
I'll get her back on track.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,840
Stop daydreaming.

32
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,430
Sheng Mian only loves me.

33
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,360
You're just an ex-boyfriend.

34
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,560
If you were really so confident,

35
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,280
you wouldn't be here.

36
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,360
How was your talk?

37
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,870
Mr. Wen and I feel like old friends.

38
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,430
We need a good drink.

39
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,960
Don't bother.

40
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,400
Wen Zhao doesn't drink.

41
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,030
Mr. Wen, you can't drink, huh?

42
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,680
Since you're eager to get a drink,

43
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,710
I'll drink with you.

44
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,940
(Focus Cafe)

45
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,400
OK, Mr. Fu.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,840
Sheng Mian,

47
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,710
go home with me.

48
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,200
In your dreams.

49
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,680
Grandpa doesn't let me into the house.

50
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,840
He's angry because I broke your heart.

51
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,870
He doesn't even eat now.

52
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,590
Even if you ignore me,

53
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,800
you should care for him.

54
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,030
I just want

55
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,750
to give Grandpa a video chat and pretend

56
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,920
we're back together.

57
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,630
You can do it here.

58
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,560
Grandpa is so smart.

59
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,360
He won't believe it unless you're there.

60
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,400
Grandpa ate nothing for a day.

61
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,360
Let's make a deal.

62
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,960
I'll go after that.

63
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,150
No problem.

64
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,640
Mian,

65
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,750
did you forgive Yancheng

66
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,870
just to make me happy?

67
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,510
That's not true, Grandpa.

68
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,680
I did forgive him.

69
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,270
We're really back together.

70
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,560
What's wrong?

71
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,320
Nothing, Grandpa.

72
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,360
We keep a cat.

73
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,560
It's having fun with me.

74
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,400
Go away.

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,870
Good.

76
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm so glad

77
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,160
to see you get back together.

78
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,640
Later,

79
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,630
I'll eat something.

80
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,350
Mian,

81
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,440
when you have time,

82
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,560
come and see me

83
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,310
with Yancheng.

84
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,410
OK, Grandpa.

85
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,590
We'll hang up.

86
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,920
Bye-bye.

87
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,350
I should go.

88
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,640
Hey.

89
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,510
How could you leave

90
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,390
after breaking my leg?

91
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,920
I don't mind breaking it.

92
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,110
OK.

93
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,510
If my leg is broken,

94
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,680
you'll have a hard time.

95
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,160
Knock it off.

96
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,510
We had a deal.

97
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,750
I'll leave when it's done.

98
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,470
We did?

99
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,680
I drank too much. My head hurts.

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,840
I don't remember.

101
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,830
I know you still care for me.

102
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,000
Why is it so sour?

103
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,270
You drank too much.

104
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,000
The vinegar will make you sober.

105
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,920
Now, do you remember what you said?

106
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,310
Sheng Mian, don't leave.

107
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,540
What if Grandpa suddenly

108
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,510
has a video chat?

109
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,630
Don't use him as an excuse.

110
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,920
He isn't that boring.

111
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,750
Sheng Mian, for the sake

112
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,120
I helped with your board meeting,

113
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,920
stay with me for one night.

114
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,040
Just so you know,

115
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:24,710
I want the bedroom.

116
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,960
You sleep here.

117
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,230
After tonight,

118
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,430
we won't owe each other.

119
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,240
I saw the photos

120
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,630
of when you saved Grandpa.

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,920
If only I had met you

122
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,920
at that time.

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,840
Fu Yancheng,

124
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,720
no one would wait for you.

125
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,960
We can't get back.

126
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,240
What about Wen Zhao?

127
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,760
Wen Zhao?

128
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,560
He's an important friend.

129
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,870
I don't care

130
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,350
how you think of him,

131
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,000
I will get you back.

132
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,320
OK.

133
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,190
Mr. Zhao, I'll see you tonight.

134
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,480
I just got an order
from a big overseas firm.

135
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,290
We'll achieve our performance.

136
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,040
I'll meet them at their factory tonight.

137
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,040
It's good news.

138
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,680
But I'll attend the exhibition tonight.

139
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,520
I can't go with you.

140
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,070
It's OK. I'll go alone.

141
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,230
Stay safe, then.

142
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,720
OK. Don't worry.

143
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,640
Hello?

144
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,320
Xiao Yang?

145
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,560
Sheng Mian,

146
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,390
long time no see.

147
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,550
You screwed my sister.

148
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,840
Now,

149
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,870
I'll make you pay for it.

150
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,440
You...

151
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,080
Sorry,

152
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,630
the subscriber you dialed
can not be connected.

153
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,960
Please redial later.

154
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,350
Sorry,

155
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,840
the subscriber you dialed
can not be connected.

156
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,240
Please redial later.

157
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,350
Hello.

158
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,480
Is Sheng Mian with you?

159
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,000
She went to see a client.

160
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,360
What kind of firm?

161
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,240
An overseas firm.

162
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,390
Its contact here is...

163
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,280
Xiao Yang.

164
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,710
Xiao Yang?

165
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,870
Oh no. Text me the address.

166
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,920
Untie me.

167
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,920
Untie me!

168
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,200
We didn't finish the drink.

169
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,080
Now, we'll continue.

170
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,240
If you make me happy,

171
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,320
maybe,

172
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,200
you'll suffer less.

173
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,350
Xiao Yang,

174
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,080
if you hurt me,

175
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,670
Fu Yancheng will torture you.

176
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,510
I have nothing to lose, anyway.

177
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,960
Fu Yancheng showed no mercy

178
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,510
and cut off my family business!

179
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,390
I'd like to see

180
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,080
what he can do with me

181
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,670
when I bully his wife.

182
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,590
Can you fight?

183
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,750
Mind your own business.
