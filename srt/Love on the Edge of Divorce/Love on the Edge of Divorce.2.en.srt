00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,940
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,350
Mr. Yancheng is back.

4
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,200
Oh, Yancheng's back.

5
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,220
(Divorce Paper)

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,840
Madam,

7
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,420
Mr. Fu has an important meeting tonight.

8
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,710
(Not him.)
He won't be back.

9
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,980
Here's the divorce paper.

10
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,260
When Ms. Sheng signs it

11
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,580
and after the cooling-off period,

12
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,540
they'll get a divorce.

13
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,480
I know he's busy.

14
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,190
Ask him to take care of himself.

15
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,200
OK, Madam.

16
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,040
(Is that Mr. Fu's wife?)

17
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,320
Sign it.

18
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,630
In one month,

19
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,180
get the certificate in the courthouse.

20
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,100
(Signature: Sheng Mian)

21
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,680
Penny.

22
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,040
Morning, Penny.

23
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,000
What happened?

24
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,000
Penny, you're finally here.

25
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,350
A few days ago, my friend told me

26
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,790
about a no-lose deal.

27
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,400
(Liang Hanqing, Partner)
So, I mortgaged our studio

28
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,000
and invested some money.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,840
What?

30
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,350
You mortgaged our studio?

31
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,280
I...

32
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,400
I did the wrong thing.

33
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,560
Now, I have to pay the mortgage.

34
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,400
Otherwise,

35
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,270
the bank

36
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,040
will confiscate our studio.

37
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,220
We've been working hard for years

38
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,430
to make our studio this big.

39
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,750
- You...
- Oh, my lady.

40
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,470
I'm sorry. I really am, my lady.

41
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,000
But you know what?

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,520
Now, we can do something

43
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,030
to save our studio.

44
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,960
Take your seat first.

45
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,400
Sit, please.

46
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,000
Do you know Fu Yancheng,

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,870
CEO of the Fu's?

48
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,030
Fu Yancheng?

49
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,630
He bought a lavish villa

50
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,190
in Yu Jing Yuan.

51
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,810
I've heard it's a wedding house

52
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,960
for Xiao Chuqing, his first love.

53
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,030
He's the CEO of the Fu's

54
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,960
and Miss Xiao is
from another rich family.

55
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,310
He'll definitely offer
a sky-high design fee.

56
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,560
This deal alone

57
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,710
will save our studio.

58
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,870
- But...
- Mian,

59
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,360
whether our studio can survive

60
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,560
depends on you.

61
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,120
Fine.

62
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,120
At eight tonight,

63
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,150
go meet him

64
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,470
at Night Bar.

65
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:06,990
Cousin,

66
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,080
come to Night Bar.

67
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,750
I have a big present for you.

68
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,960
Hi, handsome.

69
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,000
Qi Chen, handle them.

70
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,680
Where are you?

71
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,240
In the adjacent box.

72
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,940
I'm here to say hello to a friend.

73
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,560
Are those girls your present for me?

74
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,360
No way.

75
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,840
They're way too common.

76
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,000
My present is coming soon.

77
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,430
Mr. Fu...

78
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,120
It's you.

79
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,310
Sorry, Mr. Fu.

80
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,560
If I tell you I didn't mean it

81
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,530
and it was a coincidence,

82
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,470
will you believe it?

83
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,590
You're so good at making coincidences.

84
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,870
I'm sorry, Mr. Fu.

85
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,240
Shall I wipe it for you?

86
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,470
Stop.

87
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:18,830
Did Lin Jing invite you?

88
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,440
Yes.

89
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,040
Let me introduce myself.

90
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,390
How much does Lin Jing offer?

91
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,190
Seven figures after tax.

92
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,430
More than a million?

93
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,380
But you aren't pretty or sexy enough.

94
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,830
You really ask for a lot.

95
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,470
Mr. Fu,

96
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,830
I'm just being honest.

97
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,270
Your thing is really big
and time-consuming.

98
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,120
I've also heard
you're exceptionally demanding.

99
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,550
You can't be easily satisfied.

100
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,590
But don't worry.

101
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
If you pick me,

102
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,190
my service will be worth
every penny and more.

103
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,200
Shut up.

104
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,960
Mr. Fu,

105
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,070
tell me your favorite style.

106
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,270
I usually do it the way my client wants.

107
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,070
I can also show you

108
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,190
what I'm good at.

109
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,400
Wait a minute.

110
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,960
I need my phone.

111
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,800
What are you doing?

112
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,350
Mr. Fu,

113
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,390
I want us to give each other a chance.

114
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
I know you're busy.

115
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,430
But give me one minute.

116
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,750
You'll be satisfied.

117
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,000
One minute?

118
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,750
Don't underestimate me.

119
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,190
You experienced how long I could last.

120
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,640
I...

121
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,950
I experienced?

122
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,560
What?

123
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,270
Can't wait to do it again?

124
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,910
Mr. Fu,

125
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,600
I'm just trying to persuade you.

126
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,350
Persuade me?

127
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,630
It's cute that you think that.

128
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,710
Mr. Fu,

129
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,240
I know you don't trust me now.

130
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,600
But I have a lot of experience.

131
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,240
I have many regular clients, too.

132
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,800
I won't let you down.

133
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,600
A lot of experience?

134
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,270
Many regular clients?

135
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,820
Wasn't it your first time?

136
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,000
First?

137
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,360
How's that possible?

138
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,860
I've been doing it for three years.

139
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,200
Tell Lin Jing.

140
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,790
I don't need you.

141
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,640
Fine.

142
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,160
Then, I'll wait for Mr. Lin.

143
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,830
Is he also your client?

144
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,600
Kind of.

145
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,000
Disgusting.

146
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,950
Disgusting?

147
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,070
What is wrong with him?

148
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,630
How did I provoke him?

149
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,310
Ridiculous.

150
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,320
Mr. Lin.

151
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,640
Penny,

152
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,120
how was your talk with my cousin?

153
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,870
He doesn't really like me.

154
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,350
He left without seeing my proposal.

155
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,320
Sorry.

156
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,360
My cousin

157
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,800
isn't easy to be with.

158
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,880
But it's OK.

159
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,040
Tomorrow, the Fu's will hold

160
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,190
a party for designers.

161
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,240
You can talk at the party.

162
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,710
That's great.

163
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,600
I'll be there.

164
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,710
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

165
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,380
(Party for Designers)

166
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,390
Penny.

167
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,640
Mr. Zhang?

168
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,590
What a coincidence.

169
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,800
Ms. Designer,

170
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,190
I want a chance

171
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,830
to cooperate with you.

172
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,000
Mr. Zhang.

173
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,950
You're drunk. Let me walk you out.

174
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,040
No, I'm not.

175
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,950
I don't have fun yet.

176
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,150
You know

177
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,480
I can hold my liquor.

178
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,590
This way.

179
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,440
This way, please.

180
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,400
Mr. Fu?

181
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,190
- Mr. Fu.
- Why do you keep talking

182
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,360
about money?

183
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,360
Don't you have feelings?

184
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,870
He's your client?

185
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,110
Mr. Fu,

186
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,310
I still want to know

187
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,120
what style you like.

188
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,310
I can try all kinds of styles.

189
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,270
She can do a lot of styles.

190
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,160
Yes. If you aren't satisfied,

191
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,870
I promised I won't charge.

192
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,390
You have quite a lot of clients.

193
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,040
Are you short of money?

194
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,600
Penny will do whatever you want.

195
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,240
She just charges too much.

196
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,550
(No wonder he's being rude.)

197
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,960
(He doesn't want me
to serve several clients)

198
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,170
(and ignore the quality.)

199
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,040
(That explains.)

200
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,270
Mr. Fu, don't worry.

201
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,750
If I take your project,

202
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,910
I won't serve anyone else.

203
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,320
If you're interested,

204
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,390
give me five minutes.

205
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,440
You sell yourself in public.

206
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,270
Aren't you ashamed?

207
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,160
Mr. Fu.

208
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,670
What is wrong?

209
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,280
How did I mess with him again?

210
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,470
Let's cooperate.

211
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,990
Mrs. Zhang,

212
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,670
Mr. Zhang got in the car.

213
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,510
Don't worry.

214
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,760
We'll have lunch next time.

215
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,440
(This is Fu Yancheng's car.)

216
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:17,750
Mr. Xiao,

217
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,270
at ten the day after tomorrow,

218
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,360
Mr. Fu will meet you
at Sun and Moon Tennis Court.

219
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,390
We haven't finalized

220
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,790
which design company we'll hire.

221
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,900
(Mr. Xiao)
Come on, Mr. Qi.

222
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,750
You know.

223
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,550
My company Yanyang Design

224
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,270
is the biggest among top design companies.

225
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,630
And I've heard

226
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,440
this villa is a wedding house

227
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,290
for my sister Chuqing.

228
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,840
So, as her brother,

229
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,150
I should be in charge, right?

230
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,360
Please say something nice about me

231
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,200
to Mr. Fu.

232
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,960
I get it.

233
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,720
But Mr. Fu will make the final decision.

234
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,590
OK.

235
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,560
I'll hang up.

236
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,150
(Yanyang Design?)

237
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,390
(Xiao Chuqing's brother?)

238
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,150
(If they cooperate tomorrow,)

239
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,670
(I'll lose my studio.)

240
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,890
(I can't let it happen.)

241
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,840
What's this?

242
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,000
Sorry, Mr. Fu. It's my fault.

243
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,720
A design company that wants cooperation

244
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,570
must have put it here.

245
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,630
I'll dump it now.

246
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,590
Wait.

247
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,540
(Fixed Star)

248
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,840
This proposal looks good.

249
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,510
Contact this designer ASAP.

250
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,320
OK, Mr. Fu.

251
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,870
Why didn't you stop her
from divorcing Fu Yancheng?

252
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,910
Some companies that cooperated with us

253
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,910
for the sake of the Fu's

254
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,030
are pulling out.

255
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,150
Our second round of funding
will start very soon.

256
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,480
If she divorces now,

257
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,150
what will we do?

258
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,480
The Fu's and Mian have helped a lot.

259
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,910
I'll figure out a way.

260
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,240
Don't get her involved.

261
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,630
You passed out at today's board meeting.

262
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,720
What can you do?

263
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,200
If the Fu's no longer works with us,

264
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,750
our second round of funding will fail.

265
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,790
If our company collapses,

266
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,320
what can Weiyuan and I do?

267
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,750
She mustn't divorce at this time.

268
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,910
I'll go talk to her now.

269
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,870
Enough.

270
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,480
She lives her own life.

271
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,480
I don't need her to sacrifice for us.

272
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:27,710
Mr. Fu,

273
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,360
the lawyer called me this morning.

274
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,150
But Sheng Mian replied

275
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,240
that she would rethink it.

276
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,000
She agreed to divorce me.

277
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,510
But now, she backtracks.

278
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,000
What on earth does she want?

279
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,670
Her stepmother Ms. Su Lan
made a request.

280
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,030
She wants the Fu's
to keep investing in Sheng's.

281
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,550
So, they want money.

282
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,750
OK.

283
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,960
Let her talk to my lawyer.

284
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,840
I can invest.

285
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,920
But only this once.

286
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,800
After the investment,

287
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,630
Sheng Mian must divorce me.

288
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,500
Yes.

289
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,550
Also, Mr. Xiao invites you
to play tennis tomorrow.

290
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,560
I got it.

291
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,960
Mr. Fu, you are good.

292
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,000
You're indeed a famous tennis amateur.

293
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,750
Even a former tennis player like me

294
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,840
has to admit defeat.

295
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,480
You flatter me, Mr. Xiao.

296
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,840
Just get to the point.

297
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,260
Mr. Fu,

298
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,150
will you live in the villa by yourself

299
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,390
or with your wife?

300
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,990
Mr. Fu,

301
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,910
please think of us

302
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,510
when you want to decorate your villa.

303
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,920
In professionalism,

304
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,360
we're one of the top companies.

305
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,600
We'll have the most professional designer

306
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,440
work for you.

307
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,670
Speaking of relationships,

308
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,320
you and my sister grew up together.

309
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,270
Our families are old friends, too.

310
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,200
In any case,

311
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,400
giving me this project

312
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,870
will be the best choice.

313
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,960
