=Episode 15=

3
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,070
No more sleep?

4
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,560
Do you still feel unwell?

5
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,560
Thanks for asking.

6
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,760
I have things to do. I should go.

7
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,150
Stop calling me Mr. Fu.

8
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,520
Last night...

9
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,430
Last night,

10
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,560
thank you for helping me out.

11
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,430
And introducing me to many clients.

12
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,920
So, are you going to burn bridges?

13
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,200
You didn't behave like this last night.

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,840
Tell me.

15
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,230
When will you get a divorce?

16
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,400
Divorce?

17
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,230
You want to deny it?

18
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,070
Sorry, Mr. Fu.

19
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,560
But I have to go.

20
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,790
I'll do my best to design your villa.

21
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,190
Penny,

22
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,760
last night, were you
or were you not drunk?

23
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,400
(So, Fu Yancheng doesn't know
Penny is Sheng Mian.)

24
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,800
Come on. I'll drive you.

25
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,590
No need, Mr. Fu.

26
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,560
We'll talk.

27
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,800
Mr. Fu,

28
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,080
what will we talk about?

29
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,240
You don't want another date, huh?

30
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,080
What?

31
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,310
Are you scared?

32
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,400
Check this.

33
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,310
I asked Qi Chen to take back

34
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,750
your contract with Xiao Chuqing.

35
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,780
(Agreement, Party A: Xiao Chuqing)

36
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,710
Thank you, Mr. Fu.

37
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,030
Sorry for the trouble.

38
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,120
It's OK.

39
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,560
I should help my wife.

40
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,120
Mr. Fu,

41
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,190
is there a misunderstanding?

42
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,430
No.

43
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,430
You called me honey last night.

44
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,430
Mr. Fu,

45
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,840
I was drunk last night.

46
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,910
It may be the rum talking.

47
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,310
Don't take it personally.

48
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,920
Qi Chen, watch out!

49
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,960
Fu Yancheng.

50
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,560
Fu Yancheng.

51
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,700
(Emergency, First Aid)

52
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,200
Doctor,

53
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,840
where's the man who came with me?

54
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,950
He's seriously injured.

55
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:13,950
He's still being rescued.

56
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,880
Sorry.

57
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,480
We did our best.

58
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,270
Fu Yancheng.

59
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,960
Fu Yancheng.

60
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,590
Fu Yancheng.

61
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,520
Wake up.

62
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,880
You wake up.

63
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,790
Fu Yancheng.

64
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,720
Wake up and I'll do anything for you.

65
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,240
Are you sure?

66
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:26,670
♪I dream of you,
think of you, and love you♪

67
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:30,180
♪Nobody but you♪

68
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,160

♪You're the only one I see♪

♪The only dream I dream is always you♪

73
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,200
The doctor said

74
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,940
you're in recovery.

75
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,010
More milk will help with it.

76
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,120
Can I not drink it?

77
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,120
I stopped drinking milk
when I was three.

78
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,310
I don't like the taste.

79
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,980
Then...

80
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,160
Will you make an exception for me?

81
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,710
Is it funny?

82
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,280
Why?

83
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,160
Penny,

84
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,200
I know it's not that easy

85
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,840
to get a divorce.

86
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,030
My point is, as long as we're together,

87
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,270
I won't wish for anything else.

88
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,360
But I must

89
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,390
explain one thing.

90
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,440
What is it?

91
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,840
Xiao Chuqing and I are just friends.

92
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,710
Don't explain.

93
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,990
I trust you.

94
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,920
Boss,

95
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,360
after you care for Ms. Penny,

96
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,670
will you care about me?

97
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,750
Are you dead?

98
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,670
I won't die.

99
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,120
I just broke my leg.

100
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,350
Mr. Fu,

101
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,240
you need a temporary assistant

102
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,080
to work for you on my behalf.

103
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,630
Morning, Mr. Fu.

104
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,800
Morning.

105
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,480
I'll only work for two weeks.

106
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,200
When Qi Chen is back, I'll leave.

107
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,750
OK.

108
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,750
Thank you for helping me.

109
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,960
What do you need me do?

110
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,750
There will be a new product release.

111
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,670
Qi Chen is in charge every year.

112
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,150
Your main job is to...

113
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,270
Mr. Fu, keep it professional.

114
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:27,990
I can't.

115
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,860
Mr. Fu,

116
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,790
will I email the proposal to Penny?

117
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,870
No need.

118
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,790
I reviewed the proposal.

119
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,960
Have another team do it.

120
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,910
Don't waste my time.

121
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,480
If the new team still fails,

122
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,080
we won't do this business.

123
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,390
Mr. Fu,

124
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,240
you did my job.

125
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,200
Who's the assistant,

126
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,480
you or me?

127
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,550
If you don't mind,

128
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,960
I can be your assistant forever.

129
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,080
It depends on what you can do.

130
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,790
You know very well what I can do.

131
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,150
Don't leave tonight.

132
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,920
Why?

133
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,320
To work overtime?

134
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,960
I'll prove what I can do.

135
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,360
Did I wake you up?

136
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,790
Today, I have a meeting to attend.

137
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,630
So, I left.

138
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,870
If you're tired, get more sleep.

139
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,500
Now, I ache all over.

140
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,350
OK.

141
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,390
I'll be gentle next time.

142
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,390
I'll go back soon.

143
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,230
I see.

144
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,800
Go ahead.

145
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,550
Go to the meeting, OK?

146
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,390
Hey, Penny.

147
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,200
Our studio is out of crisis.

148
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,000
You have to thank Mr. Fu.

149
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,750
These days,

150
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,000
you don't need to come.

151
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,840
Serve as Mr. Fu's assistant attentively.

152
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,320
Take good care of him.

153
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,910
I'll take very good care of him.

154
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,510
Glad to hear that.

155
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,870
That's it. I'll hang up.

156
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,100
(Outpatient)

157
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,030
You're pregnant for seven weeks.

158
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,790
Haven't you felt it?

159
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,020
Tell your husband

160
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,460
(Pregnancy)
to have less sex.

161
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,320
Don't hurt the baby.

162
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,910
Now, you have
minor symptoms of miscarriage.

163
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,080
Do you get it?

164
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,680
Yes, doctor.

165
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,560
(Fu Yancheng,)

166
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,000
(we have a baby.)

167
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,240
(Diagnosis: Pregnancy)
I don't want you at all.

168
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,120
(He hates my family.)

169
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,720
(Will he like a baby with my blood?)

170
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,870
Mom,

171
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,600
the checkup result is good.

172
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,670
Don't worry.

173
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,110
Sheng Mian?

174
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,240
What's she doing here?

175
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,580
(Gynecology)

176
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,150
Gynecology?

177
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,840
Come in.

178
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:18,950
Hi, doctor.

179
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,950
Who are you?

180
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,870
The sister of the lady
who just went out.

181
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,320
Here's the thing.

182
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,000
My sister has severe depression.

183
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,240
I'd like to know

184
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,910
if anything is wrong with her.

185
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,200
Can we do something

186
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,550
to help her?

187
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,710
Depression?

188
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,320
You should care more about her.

189
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,390
She's pregnant.

190
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,480
Don't let her hurt herself.

191
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,390
OK.

192
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,100
