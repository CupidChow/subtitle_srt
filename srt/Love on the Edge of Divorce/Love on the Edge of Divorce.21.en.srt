=Episode 21=

3
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,200
Why was so much money

4
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,710
given to this company?

5
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,840
Dad never told me about it.

6
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,400
Are you keeping something from me?

7
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,240
(Oh no.)

8
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,000
(Grandpa must have)

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,040
(told him everything.)

10
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,040
(What do I do?)

11
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,590
Why did you lie to me?

12
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,480
You know everything?

13
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,400
Why did you do this?

14
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,430
I feared you wouldn't like me.

15
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,510
So, you tested me like that, right?

16
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,120
I don't mean that.

17
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,240
I just...

18
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,660
Do you know

19
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,430
how happy I was when Liang Hanqing

20
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,790
told me you weren't a couple?

21
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,280
(Oh, that.)

22
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,080
So unreliable.

23
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,960
How could he sell me out?

24
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,280
If I hadn't met him today,

25
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,870
when would you tell me the truth?

26
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,710
Not until you get a divorce.

27
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,590
I didn't want to lie to you.

28
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,280
But only by doing this

29
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,630
can I feel less humble.

30
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,800
I know you lied to me

31
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,710
because I was married.

32
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,960
Grandpa promised me.

33
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,590
If I help Sheng Mian

34
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,030
find the truth of his father's will,

35
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,120
I can then divorce her.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,360
How do I know it's true?

37
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,560
What if you're lying?

38
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,710
How about I investigate with you?

39
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,870
I feared you would be unhappy

40
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,750
if I wanted that.

41
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,370
I was wondering how to ask you.

42
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,280
I'm not that narrow-minded.

43
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,370
I wish more than anyone else

44
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,960
we could find the truth soon.

We'll try our luck.

What are you waiting for? Look with me.

63
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,310
Mr. Fu,

64
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,470
stop acting

65
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,800
like a boss, OK?

66
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,520
It's here, I think.

67
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,270
Is there a contract
with the Sheng's on your phone?

68
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,110
Yes.

69
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,200
Give it to me.

70
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,310
Enter Su Lan's birthdate.

71
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,190
He risked his career

72
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,480
for Su Lan.

73
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,630
What a hopeless romantic.

74
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,630
I think this is it.

75
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,640
Lan, what are you doing?

76
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,000
Don't worry.

77
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,070
I told them what to do.

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,840
Lan,

79
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,350
I've almost finished

80
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,600
that thing.

81
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,310
Rest assured. It's done.

82
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,600
The money will

83
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,210
be transferred to your overseas account.

84
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,440
OK.

85
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,560
Really?

86
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,640
You miss me?

87
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,520
How much?

88
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,200
What do you miss?

89
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,830
How do you miss it?

90
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,870
Soon, I'll be back to you.

91
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,350
Mr. Wang,

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,510
a Mr. Qi Chen asked to see you.

93
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,310
OK. Be right there.

94
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,270
I'll hang up.

95
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,270
Did he leave?

96
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,400
Don't move.

97
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,680
Qi Chen is clumsy.

98
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,920
I don't think he'll leave that soon.

99
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,160
This is the information I've sorted out.

100
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,190
I don't know why, but this company

101
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,920
has many transactions with the Sheng's.

102
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,540
(Transaction Records)

103
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,270
The contracts are suspicious.

104
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,560
It's a shell company under the name

105
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,630
of Su Lan's brother.

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,190
Su Lan uses it for transfers.

107
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,190
That's how the Sheng's money was stolen.

108
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,520
I guess Mr. Wang

109
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,000
helped Su Lan with it.

110
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,660
That is to say,

111
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,430
since Su Lan married Mr. Sheng,

112
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,190
she's been lining her pockets.

113
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,630
No wonder the Sheng's
has been in trouble.

114
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,750
So, there has been an internal problem.

115
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,600
Mr. Sheng trusted Su Lan too much.

116
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,670
(I didn't know)

117
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,430
(Su Lan never)

118
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,190
(had any feelings for Dad.)

119
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,600
(She only had schemes.)

120
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,870
Can they get the money back?

121
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,480
The procurators

122
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,570
have tracked down

123
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,510
Mr. Wang's law firm.

124
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,830
There's solid evidence.

125
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,120
They can quickly file

126
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,040
a court application

127
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,430
to freeze the money.

128
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,950
Maybe they can get back some.

129
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,270
What's wrong?

130
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,510
It's not your concern.

131
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,640
Don't worry.

132
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,110
I don't worry.

133
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,630
I just think

134
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,560
Su Lan and Mr. Wang are so hateful.

135
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,720
If it weren't for them,

136
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,830
maybe Sheng Mian needn't
have married you.

137
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,350
It makes sense.

138
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,870
They made no secret.

139
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,120
They even paid hotel bills

140
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,270
with the company's money.

141
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,320
Five times a week.

142
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,600
They're really energetic.

143
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,070
They're not young, after all.

144
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,100
It sounds like

145
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,040
you're quite jealous.

146
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,240
If you want it, I can do it.

147
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,470
If you struggle,

148
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,270
I don't mind letting you know

149
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,360
how jealous I am.

150
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,790
Hello.

151
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,960
OK. I get it.

152
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,120
Mr. Wang ran away.

153
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,560
Lan,

154
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,040
how much longer do I have to hide?

155
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,160
I don't even dare to go home.

156
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,190
Don't worry.

157
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,130
The formalities are being handled.

158
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,310
You just wait.

159
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,240
The Supervision Commission
has tracked me down.

160
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,550
If they catch me,

161
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,320
I'll spend the rest of my life in jail.

162
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,480
I did everything for you, you know.

163
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,510
You promised me.

164
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:40,360
OK. I know you're doing all this for me.

165
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,080
When the money is transferred,

166
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,390
we'll go abroad together.

167
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,480
You can't be lying, huh?

168
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,270
You know me.

169
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,080
I only care for you.

170
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,750
Over all these years,

171
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,670
I've never had another man, right?

172
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,870
Don't be so unconscionable.

173
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,360
They're too different things.

174
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,720
When everything's done,

175
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,080
don't forget to pay me.

176
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,390
Don't worry.

177
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,630
Even I'm yours.

178
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,630
Don't be scared.

179
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,070
Who?

180
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,320
Who's that?

181
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:40,870
Don't come over.

182
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,550
Stay away from me.

183
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,230
If you come over,

184
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,750
I'll kill myself.

185
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,160
If I die,

186
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,440
you won't get the money back.

187
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,440
So, you know your worth.

188
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,510
Su Lan is right.

189
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,750
You're smart, Ms. Sheng Mian.

190
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,630
You even got Mr. Fu here

191
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,030
to deal with a man like me.

192
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
Under such circumstances,

193
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,600
stop thinking of Su Lan.

194
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,510
It's actually her who put you

195
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,630
into this position.

196
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,080
Don't try to turn me against her.

197
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,320
Su Lan told people

198
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,550
that you're here.

199
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,600
From the beginning,

200
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,320
you've just been her fall guy.

201
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,960
This is what Su Lan offered.

202
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,390
Take a good look at it.

203
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,620
(Checklist of Evidence)

204
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,620
(By Su Lan)

205
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,840
Sorry, the subscriber
you dialed is powered off.

206
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,550
- She isn't like that.
- Sorry,

207
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,340
the subscriber
you dialed is powered off.

208
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,200
It's you.

209
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,480
You must be lying

210
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,910
and trapping me, right?

211
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,870
I've worked for the Sheng's for years.

212
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,910
What have I got?

213
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,440
Sheng Zhong stole my lover.

214
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,680
In the end,

215
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,960
Su Lan deceived me, too.

216
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,920
Mr. Wang,

217
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,480
why don't you work with us?

218
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,510
Then you can take revenge on Su Lan.
