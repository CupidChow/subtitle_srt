I'm his mother.

00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,740
This woman

33
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,590
is living at Yancheng's house.

34
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,800
How can I bear it?

35
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,310
Today, I'll teach her a good lesson.

36
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,030
Mr. Fu is just working with her.

37
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,320
I wasn't born yesterday.

38
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,750
If it's about work,

39
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,280
why is she staying so late?

40
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,560
There's just an emergency.

41
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,910
How about you come tomorrow?

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,870
I have to see

43
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,630
who this designer is.

44
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,360

00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,460
Try to run away?

47
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,540
You have feelings for me, too.

48
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,380

Just what?

51
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,920
You just couldn't help it?

52
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,820
I had our accountant check

Why are you so guilty?

67
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,700
Don't do this.

68
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,980
He'll come back anytime.

69
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,700

No need, Mr. Fu.

94
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,740
I didn't know Fu Yancheng
could care so much for Penny.

at playing hard to get.

Working, of course.

103
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,540
I'm not like you.

104
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,340
You're rich enough to travel around.

105

I think of you when there's a good deal.

106
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,940

offers a big deal.

108
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,740
I recommended you.

109
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,220
You can talk to him over lunch.

110
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,260
OK.

111
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,180
Thanks, bro.

112
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,180
OK.

113
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,980
I'll text you the time and place.

114
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,900
OK. Sure.

115
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,140
This is really my lucky day.

116
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,300

117
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,980
so you're the client.

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,940

So do you.

122
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,420
Miss Xiao, I'd like to make a toast.

123
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,780
Thanks for your support.

124
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,620
Come on.

125
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,620
I'll drink it up.

126
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,780
Thanks, Mr. Liang.

127
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,940
I always appreciate your talents.

128
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,620
I believe when you get a good chance,

129
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,060
you'll be very successful.

130
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,460

131
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,820
you're saying

132
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,820

133
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,540
If you give us a chance,

134
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,500
we won't let you down.

135
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,780
Words

136
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,540
are as convincing as a contract.

137
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,940
This is the contract.

138
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,180
(Agreement of Cooperation)

139
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,900
Miss Xiao, you...

140
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,380
Miss Xiao, I drank too much.

141
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,780
I'll text it to Penny.

142
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,620
She'll check it.

143
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,740
Mr. Liang,

144
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,980
a lot of studios want

145
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,980
to cooperate with me.

146
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,900
I've shown

147
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,300
my best sincerity.

148
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,660
If you hesitate,

149
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,220
I no longer want to negotiate.

150
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,300
Miss Xiao, please don't go.

151
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,140
Miss Xiao.

152
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,540
Miss Xiao.

153
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,980
I trust you without doubt.

154
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,140
Well, I'll sign it.

155
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,980
I'll sign it now.

156
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,060
That's what happened.

157
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,180
(Lawsuit)
This contract

158
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,740
gives tempting offers.

159
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,620
It looks like a win-win.

160
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,660
So, I signed it right there.

161
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,820
I didn't expect a big trap in it.

162
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,820
Before we have a project,

163
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,620
we owe them a huge sum of money.

164
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,340
I realized it and reasoned with her.

165
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,180
But her security guy hit me.

166
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,920
What's Chuqing's problem?

167
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,140
I haven't done anything to her.

168
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,740
Why did she set such a trap

169
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,180
on our studio?

170
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,540
Xiao Chuqing came at me.

171
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,940
She knew I was on alert,

172
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,860
so she trapped you.

173
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,540
She came at you?

174
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,260
Why?

175
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,700
For Fu Yancheng.

176
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,380
I'm just involved in this drama.

177
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,660
This all began with me.

178
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,020
I'm obligated to save our studio.

179
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,140
What can you do?

180
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:35,980
Penny.

181
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,140
How about

182
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,140
you ask Mr. Fu for help?

183
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,900
He's close to Xiao Chuqing.

184
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,420
His company also has

185
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,580
the best lawyers.

186
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,380
They can easily

187
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,420
deal with this lawsuit.

188
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,420
I know your relationship with Mr. Fu.

189
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,700
But...

190
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,350
Hello.

191
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,340
What?

192
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,140
What happened?

193
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,740
A client asked to terminate his contract.

194
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,930
He wasn't the first one.

195
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,460
Looks like Xiao Chuqing

196
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,100
has got the word out.

197
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,660
Mr. Fu.

198
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,700
Mr. Fu,

199
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,780
Miss Xiao Chuqing probably

200
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,100
gave Penny's studio a hard time

201
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,100
because of you.

202
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,300
You're so close to her.

203
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,740
If you rush to see Penny,

204
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,100
I wonder if Miss Xiao will...

205
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,380
Don't be nagging.

206
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,420
I won't listen.

207
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,660
Su, listen to me.

208
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,340
It's all your fault.

209
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,300
You signed the contract carelessly.

210
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,780
See?

211
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,260
If you lose the lawsuit, you can never

212
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,620
pay off the debt.

213
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,100
- Su.
- Don't touch me.

214
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,540
Come on, Su.

215
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,820
Trust me.

216
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,780
I'll solve this problem, OK?

217
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,940
Don't be angry.

218
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,100
- I don't want to talk.
- Let's go.

219
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:09,940
Qi Chen.

220
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,980
- Mr. Fu.
- Follow them.

221
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,660
Let me know where they're going.

222
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,940
