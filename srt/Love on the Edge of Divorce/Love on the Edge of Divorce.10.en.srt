00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,120
Mr. Fu, bad news.

8
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,970
The project we gave the Sheng's failed.

9
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,040
We have great losses.

10
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,040
What did you say?

11
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,000
They delivered disqualified bricks.

12
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,400
There was a huge safety problem.

13
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,040
We are sued.

14
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,120
Look at the Shengs.

15
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,070
Sheng Zhong overestimated himself.

16
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,510
He asked for investment several times.

17
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,640
Sheng Mian delays divorcing me.

18
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,120
Her whole family are insatiable.

19
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,280
I was being too soft.

20
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,510
From this day on,

21
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,760
withdraw all the investment in them.

22
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:38,910
Yes, Mr. Fu.

Listen, Sheng Mian.

Stop profiting in the name of my family.

30
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,640
I don't want you at all.

31
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,430
Divorce me now,

32
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,070
or I'll cut off your family business.

33
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,300

OK.

34
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,190
I'll divorce you.

35
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,310
Sheng Mian,

36
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,120
you're the most useless girl
I have ever seen.

37
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,080
Your ex-boyfriend in college, Wen Zhao.

38
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,080
He couldn't support our business.

39
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,560
For God's sake, you finally

40
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,150
married Fu Yancheng.

41
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,030
Instead of appreciating it,

42
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,280
you offended him.

43
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,320
See?

44
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,360
Because of this,

45
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,280
they won't help our company

46
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,280
get through the problem.

47
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,920
No matter who I marry,

48
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,710
you mustn't be so sarcastic.

49
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,080
If you weren't so greedy
and shortsighted,

50
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,310
we wouldn't end up like this.

51
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,590
You made a mistake.

52
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,840
Don't blame it on me.

53
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,590
You know what?

54
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,960
I won't take advantage
of my marriage anymore.

55
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,520
And I want nothing to do with the Fu's.

56
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,590
I will

57
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,280
divorce Fu Yancheng.

58
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,800
Sooner or later, you'll ruin us!

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,840
Mian,

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,750
I know you have a hard time.

61
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,030
But if you want a divorce,

62
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,590
I totally disapprove.

63
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,710
Grandpa,

64
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,030
he really hates me.

65
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,280
Our marriage is pointless.

66
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,430
Now, Yancheng has got

67
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,280
a bit of a temper.

68
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,750
He talked harshly

69
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,310
and broke your heart.

70
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,590
Don't worry.

71
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,520
I'll teach him a good lesson.

72
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,030
Mian,

73
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,310
you want a divorce so hastily.

74
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,430
Do you still miss Wen Zhao,

75
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,280
your ex-boyfriend in college?

76
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,560
No way, Grandpa.

77
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,120
He and I have lost contact.

78
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,430
Glad to hear that.

79
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,550
Mian,

80
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,630
listen to me.

81
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,520
Never bring up the divorce thing again.

82
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,300
(Fu Yancheng)

83
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,150
Penny,

84
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,240
let's have dinner tomorrow.

85
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,840
I have a reservation
at Fancy Restaurant.

86
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,270
Mr. Fu, Penny doesn't call or text back.

87
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,160
Maybe she's busy.

88
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,360
Or maybe her phone died.

89
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,560
Why must you come to her studio

90
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,160
instead of waiting for her reply?

91
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,310
I have to see her.

92
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,600
Mr. Fu, there you are.

93
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,000
Where's Penny?

94
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,030
She isn't in.

95
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,080
I'll come tomorrow.

96
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,870
She won't be here, either.

97
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,270
Mr. Fu, hey.

98
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,630
She really isn't here.

99
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,510
Why are you avoiding me?

100
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,590
I'm not.

101
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,030
Are you sure?

102
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,890
Then why are you afraid
to look at my eyes?

103
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,470
It's late.

104
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,040
You should go back.

105
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,800
Not until you explain everything.

106
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:37,980
Penny,

107
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,310
you know how I feel for you.

108
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,560
Why would I know

109
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,720
how you feel?

110
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,070
You're being angry.

111
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,870
You're my client.

112
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,630
I won't be angry with you.

113
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,750
Do you only want me to be your client?

114
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,910
It's midnight.

115
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,880
Happy birthday.

116
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,390
This is your favorite necklace.

117
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,560
I had planned to give it to you

118
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,400
over dinner tomorrow.

119
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,270
This is too precious.

120
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,030
I can't accept it.

121
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,720
Fine. Then, I'll dump it.

122
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,910

I want to know.

174
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,320
Hello.

175
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,960
Hanqing.

176
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,360
How's your business trip?

177
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,750
Go to bed early.

178

Don't worry.

179
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,510
I'll get some rest, too.

180
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,340
Your husband is Liang Hanqing?

181
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,110
Yes.

182
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,600
Why didn't you tell me?

183
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,670
- You also...
- Mr. Fu.

184
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,750
If I made you misunderstand,

185
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,750
I apologize now.

186
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,320
From now on,

187
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,360
I won't confuse you anymore.

188
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,030
I will pretend

189
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,550
nothing happened

190
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,590
just now.

191
