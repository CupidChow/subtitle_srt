When you're in charge of the Fu's,

98
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,580
you no longer respect me, huh?

99
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,500
That's not true, Grandpa.

100
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,740
That's not true?

101
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,420

00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,380

Mr. Fu,

113
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,860
what's wrong?

114
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:37,940
Are you in a bad mood?

115
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:43,900
I'm fine.

116
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,460
Just something annoying.

117
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,780
(Fu Yancheng hates his wife.)

118
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,180
(I can't let him know I'm Penny.)

119
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,420
(Or our cooperation will fail.)

120
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,620

121
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,620

131

Grandpa,

132
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,500
after the meditation on the mountain,

133
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,820
you look much better now.

134
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,580
Boy,

135
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,700

136
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,500
Why isn't Sheng Mian here?

137
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,540
What holds her up?

138
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,900
Who knows?

139
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,900
Maybe she got acute appendicitis

140
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,180
and almost died on her way here.

141
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,620

142
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,640
You. I...

143
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,780

Don't be ridiculous.

146

You look very well after the meditation.

147
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,860
Don't bring her up.

148
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,820
So unlucky.

149
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,310
Mian,

150
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,740
I'm so glad

151
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,820
you've come today.

152
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,340
You've even brought me a present.

153
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,580
It's so sweet of you.

154
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,780
I love it.

155
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,060
Glad you love it.

156
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,700
That day, I was supposed to pick you up

157
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,820
with Yancheng.

158
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,740
But some family stuff held me up.

159
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,020
I'm terribly sorry.

160
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,700
Silly girl.

161
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,420
Don't talk like a stranger.

162
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,140
I'm not that narrow-minded.

163
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,130
So sad.

164
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,700
Yancheng isn't here today.

165
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,020
You came at a bad time.

166
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,340
Did you quarrel?

167
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,180
No, Grandpa.

168
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,300
Grandpa,

169
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,580
I don't think Mr...

170
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,140
I don't think Yancheng

171
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,140
smiles a lot.

172
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,860
Well, life isn't easy

173
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,180
for him.

174
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,380
When he was little,

175
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,350
his parents were too busy

176
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,860
to take care of him.

177
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,900
So, he always stayed alone.

178
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:45,980
Therefore,

179
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,420
he's been aloof.

180
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,540
He appears to be indifferent

181
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,900
and he isn't good
at expressing sentiments.

182
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,100
But actually, he's warmhearted.

183
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,060
He's very sentimental.

184
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,220
So, I want you

185
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,420
to give him more time

186
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,950
and get to know about him.

187
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,780
I will, Grandpa.

188
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,820
Now, I'm aged.

189
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,940
I'm not as healthy as before.

190
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,260
I don't know if I can live

191
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,620
until you have a baby.

192
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,140
Grandpa, you're still strong.

193
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,860
You'll see that day coming.

194
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,460
Good.

195
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,900
I'm so relieved

196
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,660
to hear that.

197
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,540
Yancheng is so naughty

198
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,140
that he keeps me worried.

199
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,140
I should warn him more often.

200
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,580
Hey, boy.

201
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,860
Sheng Mian is here to see me.

202
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,340
She's such a good girl.

203
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,700
And she's willing to have your baby.

204
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,980
You must take good care of her.

205
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,980
(Oh no.)

206
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,500
(Fu Yancheng will be angry.)

207
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,100
Qi Chen, drive me to Grandpa's.

208
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,180
But you have an appointment
with Mr. Zhang.

209
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,020
I'll go later.

210
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,180
OK.

211
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,420
When Yancheng knew you were here,

212
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,980
he was coming over.

213
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,580
Looks like

214
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,060
he cares about you.

215
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,100
Grandpa,

216
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,140
take a good rest.

217
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,300
I have things to do.

218
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,220
I should go.

219
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,580
Don't leave in such a hurry.

220
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,340
Have lunch here.

221
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,780
Grandpa,

222
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,060
I have an urgent job.

223
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,540
I'll visit you another day.

224
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,340
Fine, then.

225
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,140
Goodbye, Grandpa.

226
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,740
Penny?

227
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,340
Fu...

228
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,660
