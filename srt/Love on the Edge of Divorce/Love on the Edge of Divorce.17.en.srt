Please don't.

4
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,000
It's Fu Yancheng's baby!

5
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,640
You're just being desperate.

6
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,670
My son

7
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,590
utterly hates you.

8
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,480
How dare you

9
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,070
frame him?

10
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,150
Mrs. Fu,

11
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,350
let me explain.

12
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,070
It's really Fu Yancheng's baby.

13
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,950
If you don't believe me, call him.

14
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:31,990
Mom.

15
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,120
Yancheng,

16
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,430
I'm in the hospital.

17
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,640
Your wife Sheng Mian is pregnant.

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,590
She said it's your baby.

19
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,270
Mom,

20
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,400
I've never had sex with her.

21
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,230
Fu Yancheng, I'm...

22
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,510
Did you hear?

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,840
Yancheng said

24
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,350
the baby you carry

25
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,790
has nothing to do with us.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,070
He doesn't want a baby

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,560
with your blood.

28
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,190
Do it.

29
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,880
Don't come over.

30
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,280
Don't!

31
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,990
No!

32
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,960
Stay away!

33
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,630
Stay away from me!

34
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,270
Don't!

35
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,680
Stay away!

36
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,310
Let her go!

37
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,290
I called the police.

38
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,430
Penny.

39
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,310
Penny.

40
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,240
Penny, you're OK.

41
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,240

Fu Yancheng's mother

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,430
called me to a hospital.

45
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,710
I think it's a trap.

46
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,560
I'll send you the address.

47
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,190
If I'm out of contact after I get there,

48
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,870
come and pick me up.

49
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,590
You're finally back.

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,430
I called you but didn't get through.

51
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,360
I had to wait.

52
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,200
I was so worried.

53
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,550

Why can you still care about me?

58
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,200
She talked to you?

59
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,680

00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,120

After the long recovery,
you should work now.

94
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,720
Here are our projects with the Sheng's.

95
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,000
Stop all of them.

96
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,110
Moreover,

97
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,880
do something

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,630

101
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,600

00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,480

103
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,120
She has to be punished.

00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,000

00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,470
What?

108
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,160

118
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,630

00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,750

Su Lan, what happened?

133
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,360
Why did you take away

134
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,200
all our firm's money?

135
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's your fault.

136
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,480
You offended the Fu's.

137
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,750
They'll almost bankrupt us.

138
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,870
I used the money to pay the debts.

139
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,390
I don't want the creditors to press me.

140
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,830
Don't use such a lame excuse.

141

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,270
If you have an ounce of decency,

144
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,790
give back the money.

145
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,910
Instead of wasting time on me,

146
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,790
why don't you think

147
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,150

152
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,150
How could he leave his property

153
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,000
to Sheng Mian alone?

154
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,030

00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,840
How much do you need?

162
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,360
Two million for the operation.

163

169
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,390
we'll have to sell it.

170
