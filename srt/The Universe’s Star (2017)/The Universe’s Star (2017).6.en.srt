1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,300
For the past three days,

2
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,830
10,000 articles about you came out.

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,630
People are wondering if we received any money.

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,730
Whenever there's an economic crisis or a political issue,

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,560
you cover them up.

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,730
Woo Joo.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,460
You were not like this for 10 years. Why are you doing this this year?

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,430
- What are you talking about? - Love?

9
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,630
That's not love. You just want to do whatever you want.

10
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,730
Why can't I do whatever I want?

11
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,830
All right.

12
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,460
What would you know? You've only been loved.

13
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,030
Do you ever think about the end? What about people watching?

14
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,230
Half of your concert tickets have been refunded.

15
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,330
How are you going to make up for it?

16
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,400
Don't you know they'll turn their backs on you if you make a mistake?

17
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:01,230
Once they turn their backs on you, you'll be nothing.

18
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,560
I already explained to her.

19
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,130
Luckily, she seemed to understand.

20
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,900
Darn it.

21
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,230
- Let's move on. - Enjoy.

22
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,730
Everyone knows you're a huge fan of Woo Joo's.

23
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,200
- That's right. - His fans must have been...

24
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,030
- shocked by his recent scandal. - That's right.

25
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,530
He'd been very careful not to get involved in any scandals.

26
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,230
His fans are in shock after his first scandal since his debut.

27
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,200
Excuse me, another portion of pork rind, please.

28
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,360
Okay. Give me a second.

29
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,530
Are you leaving?

30
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,460
Yes. You seem busy.

31
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,360
All right.

32
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,000
Are you okay?

33
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,330
I'm okay.

34
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,130
All right.

35
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,660
I'll get going.

36
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,900
Good luck with your concert.

37
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,130
Thank you.

38
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,300
I'll try to close the shop and come.

39
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,930
Then again, all seats will probably be taken by your fans.

40
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,460
I'm leaving.

41
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,230
Okay.

42
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,230
Son.

43
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,630
Cheer up.

44
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,030
By the way, can she eat pork rinds?

45
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,460
I'm sure she'll want to eat even the sign of the store.

46
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,630
Bring her here once.

47
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,830
Later.

48
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,560
What are you talking about? There's no later.

49
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,130
I thought I couldn't possibly like him more.

50
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,560
But now I really like him.

51
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,130
So...

52
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,260
I want to be with him even if I have to be away from him.

53
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,830
I...

54
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,260
want to...

55
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,030
live now.

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,830
What's the point of living if you have to hide from him?

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,730
You said you miss him even when you're with him.

58
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,630
How will I go up leaving a fool like you behind?

59
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,200
Are you going up?

60
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,200
Yes. I have no regrets.

61
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,430
I've been loved enough.

62
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,630
But the biggest love I received...

63
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,260
was from you.

64
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,330
Not from my busy boyfriend, but you.

65
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,430
The time when you waited for me...

66
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,760
and the time we spent together.

67
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,130
It was so fun following Woo Joo around with you.

68
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,930
I had a gloomy life.

69
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,300
I sometimes became depressed because I died so early.

70
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,630
But with you, I could laugh.

71
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,830
You gave me the energy to go on.

72
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,760
No matter how exhausted I was, I became okay.

73
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,530
Whatever I was going through,

74
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,930
I could go on thanks to you.

75
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,100
To be honest, Woo Joo is too skinny for my taste.

76
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,200
So keep your chin up.

77
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,530
You gave someone...

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,260
a reason to live and hope.

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,330
You're not a speck of dust, but a star.

80
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,930
I'm sure Woo Joo thinks the same.

81
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,260
My goodness.

82
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:06,130
When you're exhausted, it's okay to stop shining for a while, my baby.

83
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,530
Woo Joo's Wife.

84
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,400
Pull yourself together.

85
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,830
You should go to his concert on behalf of me.

86
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,100
Seat A37. See Woo Joo in real life.

87
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,400
Ready?

88
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,030
Leave before I turn back.

89
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:52,430
Red light, green light, one, two, three.

90
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,260
Go.

91
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,330
Let's do it again.

92
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,130
Red light, green light, one, two, three.

93
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,500
- What happened to today's concert? - It's been canceled.

94
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,330
Oh no.

95
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,730
- How could they do this? - You can't cancel on the day of it.

96
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,930
This place will be empty.

97
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,330
If the reporters come, Woo Joo will be hurt.

98
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,060
Hey.

99
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,560
Woo Joo.

100
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,230
Go inside.

101
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,000
(I love you, Woo Joo.)

102
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,030
(Handsome Woo Joo)

103
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,960
(Hang in there, Woo Joo)

104
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,830
(You have us, Woo Joo.)

105
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,230
(We will always be on your side.)

106
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,560
(Always on your side. Woo Joo is my life.)

107
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,430
(Thank you for becoming a singer.)

108
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,200
(You're my one and only, Woo Joo!)

109
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:11,560
(Eternity Junk)

110
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,670
- We'll protect and love you... - We'll protect and love you...

111
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,030
- forever! - forever!

112
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,060
- This very moment - This very moment

113
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,900
- When I am with you - When I am with you

114
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,600
- I wish - I wish

115
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,330
- Time would stop - Time would stop

116
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,430
- I wish I could be - I wish I could be

117
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,960
- A star that protects you - A star that protects you

118
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,430
- Even if it is from a place - Even if it is from a place

119
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:18,530
- Where you cannot see me - Where you cannot see me

120
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,930
- A star that shines during the day - A star that shines during the day

121
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,900
- A star that protects you - A star that protects you

122
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,530
- Even if you can't see me - Even if you can't see me

123
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:34,330
- Even if you can't see me - Even if you can't see me

124
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:38,030
- A star that shines during the day - A star that shines during the day

125
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,860
- A star that protects you - A star that protects you

126
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,130
- Even if you can't see me - Even if you can't see me

127
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,230
- Even if you can't see me - Even if you can't see me

128
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,230
We must each

129
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:56,460
Follow our own time

130
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,060
A star you cannot see

131
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,130
Traveling in its orbit

132
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,200
Even if one day

133
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,530
We cannot see each other

134
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,060
If our hearts

135
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,200
Can see each other

136
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,630
A star that shines during the day

137
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,230
A star that protects you

138
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,670
Even if you can't see me

139
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,130
Even if you can't see me

140
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,960
A star that shines during the day

141
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,300
A star that protects you

142
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,200
Even if you can't see me

143
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:54,000
Even if you can't see me

144
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:08,130
So you don't lose your way when you are tired

145
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,730
A star that shines during the day

146
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,730
A star that protects you

147
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,400
Even if you can't see me

148
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,230
Even if you can't see me

149
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,000
A star that shines during the day

150
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,630
A star that protects you

151
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:34,460
Even if you can't see me

152
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,230
Even if you can't see me

153
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,600
- I am - Byul Yi.

154
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,330
Don't you get it yet?

155
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,630
We're dispatched for a reason.

156
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,900
Woo Joo gets to go up thanks to you.

157
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,830
What does your will matter? You were dispatched to get Woo Joo to go up.

158
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,960
What's going on?

159
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,030
- Oh my gosh! - He stabbed him!

160
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,030
- Someone help him. - Get him.

161
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,400
Someone stop him.

162
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,130
- Get him! - Hey!

163
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,030
Someone stop him.

164
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,800
Hurry.

165
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,960
(Restricted Area)

166
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,200
You must have really decided to die.

167
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:18,500
You can't cross over yet, so you can't even go up with him.

168
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,600
Please ask to save him somehow.

169
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,900
Why must I do that?

170
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:29,930
I'll go in his place,

171
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,330
so please save him.

172
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,630
Be reasonable.

173
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,060
How could you go up in Woo Joo's place?

174
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,160
Your daughter...

175
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,830
that I didn't send up on time.

176
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:52,100
She isn't famous, so the afterlife isn't interested,

177
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,100
but for you,

178
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,300
she's the sole reason why you are still here.

179
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,660
I know him.

180
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,300
Really?

181
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,530
Of course. He's the best worker at our company...

182
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,000
and the most popular.

183
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,830
Can you tell Daddy that I'll come a little later?

184
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,330
I think if I leave too, Mommy will cry a lot.

185
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,330
What the...

186
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,230
She still has seven years left before she's scheduled to go up.

187
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,230
She'll just be starting her life. Don't you feel sorry for her?

188
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,730
Her first love.

189
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,900
First kiss.

190
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,000
First date.

191
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,900
There will be so much...

192
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,460
she couldn't do yet.

193
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,000
I'll go in her place.

194
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,200
You know.

195
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,000
You make mistakes all the time.

196
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,700
You'll go up in my daughter's name.

197
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,430
So...

198
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,600
please...

199
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:49,000
ask to let us stay together just a little while longer.

200
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Manager Gu won't want to, since this came from higher up.

201
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,100
He'll do it.

202
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,830
Because...

203
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,660
I remember everything.

204
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,330
Tell him...

205
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,800
that I forgive him.

206
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:14,830
I didn't...

207
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,660
want to forgive him, ever,

208
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,160
but you don't forgive because you want to.

209
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,260
You just do it.

210
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,400
After I left first,

211
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,330
my son was busy working just to survive.

212
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,830
I couldn't just watch him...

213
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,830
come so soon after me.

214
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,400
I shouldn't...

215
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,130
have brought that child instead of my son.

216
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,960
That foolish girl.

217
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,460
I sent her back,

218
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:17,030
so she should've ignored it and lived the rest of her life.

219
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:21,160
How could a grim reaper take a human's life?

220
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,800
If word gets out,

221
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,460
you'll likely lose your job.

222
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,700
- Did she say to threaten me? - No.

223
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,860
No, no. Definitely not. She said you'd understand.

224
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,830
She asked that you end it not as an ill-fated relationship,

225
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,660
but a positive one.

226
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,900
Even grim reapers...

227
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,430
are people too, after all.

228
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:10,600
I understand how desperately he wanted to protect him.

229
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,260
Even grim reapers...

230
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,600
are people too, after all.

231
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,630
The laceration is worse that predicted.

232
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,930
Suction.

233
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,630
His BP is dropping.

234
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,100
How much blood did he get?

235
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,900
He got 10 bags of RBC and 2 bags of platelets.

236
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,660
Get more.

237
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,330
Please connect me to the VIP room.

238
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:54,600
But there will be more and more mistakes to fix.

239
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,700
Sending up one famous singer...

240
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,800
won't cover up all those mistakes.

241
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,730
(Gu Sun Gwan)

242
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:07,260
I'm not threatening you. I just wish you'd understand our predicament.

243
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,500
Grim reapers are people, too.

244
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,160
We are all people here.

245
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,460
We can't send someone up because they want them upstairs.

246
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,660
Arrest!

247
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,300
Charge.

248
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,960
If you need someone to take responsibility,

249
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:22,900
I'll step down.

250
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,800
But Woo Joo...

251
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,400
won't be going up for a while.

252
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,630
During that short and long time...

253
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,000
that we were granted,

254
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,960
all I could do...

255
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,260
Wow. This is something even the country can't do for us.

256
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,430
Who donated all of this?

257
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,900
I know, right? Look at that.

258
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,400
(From the late Um Chun Gil)

259
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,800
That old man Um Chun Gil is an incredible man.

260
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,860
He donated all the money he saved...

261
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,660
from making noodles.

262
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,530
Looks like you'll get even busier.

263
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,900
Being busy is fine. I need to live, too.

264
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,730
I quit smoking and the sleeping pills.

265
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,560
I'm really a good person now.

266
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:24,560
And I'm easy, in contrast to my appearance.

267
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,860
You're smiling.

268
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,500
I've never seen you smile before.

269
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,030
I'll carry that.

270
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:44,060
Forgiving. And...

271
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:48,230
loving as if death will never find me.

273
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,230
"Hello,"

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,860
"Woo Joo, I attend Seohwa Girls High School next door."

Where did you get that?

278
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,800
Hold on.

279
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:28,460
- "Your songs are great..." - Wait.

280
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,030
"and comfort me through my difficult time at school."

281
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,860
"You may think it's strange, but I have..."

282
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,500
I have a strong feeling that when I grow up,

283
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,300
I will be your bride.

284
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:44,730
If I come visit you one day, you'll meet me,

285
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,800
won't you?

286
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,660
It's embarrassing, but...

287
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,530
will you marry me?

288
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,530
(Woo Joo and Ha Na)

289
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:59,560
Woo Joo, would you marry me?

290
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,200
What are you doing?

291
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,130
- Nothing. - What is that?

292
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,800
Let me see. Hey! I'm older.

293
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,300
- Give it to me, you punk. - It's nothing.

294
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,960
Stay still. "Hello, Woo Joo."

295
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,860
Wow! You got a fan letter. Woo Joo got a fan letter!

What are you doing?

298
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,960
We've all received them. Are you embarrassed?

299
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,530
- Stay still. Let me take a look. - No.

300
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,430
You got a gift, too. I'm jealous.

301
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,600
That must be nice.

302
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,230
Yes, it's nice.

marry me?

Get up!

00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,100
Sit. Good boy.

that make my heart erupt with joy pass...

318
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:58,000

become light for us both,
