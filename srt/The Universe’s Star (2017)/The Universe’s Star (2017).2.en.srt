1
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,870
Have you ever considered...

2
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,040
life without Woo Joo?

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,740
Are you insane? Now, concentrate.

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,840
Three, two, start.

5
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,070
"Reservation number 137". I get to see Woo Joo live!

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,690
I was awesome just now.

7
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,360
- I was awesome. - I failed.

8
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,360
- I couldn't concentrate. - Loser.

9
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,930
Why were you distracted when buying such sacred tickets?

10
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,560
This is the first time he failed.

11
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,460
Woo Joo is human, too. Sure. He could've lost in for a moment.

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,130
He could think about wanting to die.

13
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,230
As long as he doesn't do anything weird.

14
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,190
Will he really die?

15
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,660
Tell me the truth, you grim reaper.

16
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,730
You're good at reading these things.

17
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,730
Does he die before or after the concert?

18
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,630
If I knew,

19
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,490
how could I watch my baby ascend?

20
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,860
What a cruddy job post death.

21
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,360
Let's just do it. Woo Joo can't see us anyway.

22
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,360
Don't you know Woo Joo?

23
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,660
He hates people who follow him around more than his haters.

24
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,560
What if he does something drastic?

25
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,230
You said he's your destiny.

26
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,160
Will you just let him go easily down that path?

27
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:36,930
Let's follow him around.

28
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,830
You can afford to since you're a freelancer.

29
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:42,530
Just call in sick for a few days.

30
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,390
How could a dead girl call in sick? That's...

31
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,190
(We'll protect and love you forever.)

32
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,730
Hello? Hello, Sir.

33
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,160
You see, I fell off my bike...

34
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,030
and threw out my back.

35
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,960
It hurts too much to move.

36
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,560
I'm sorry for waking you.

37
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,760
Okay. Goodnight.

38
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,890
(Alarm)

39
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,790
Every morning, he gets up at 6:30am on the dot.

40
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,630
He runs on the designated, empty route for the designated time.

41
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,890
He never skipped this routine since he made his debut.

42
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,260
He eats organic foods sent by his fans.

43
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,560
But he doesn't care about flavour.

44
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:06,930
He consumes exactly 2,500 calories, the average for a Korean man.

45
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,630
He never eats sweets.

46
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,660
Instants? Why bother?

47
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,690
The smell. Are you insane?

48
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,390
Right. Sorry.

49
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,290
Kids posted those comments. Should we still press charges?

50
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,460
Yes, press charges against all of them.

51
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,030
Why did you even bother asking? Are you stupid?

52
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,930
It's nicer than I expected.

53
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,360
- Gak Shi! - What?

54
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,890
It'll be dangerous if he steps on a bar of soap!

55
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,730
Let's keep our boundaries.

56
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,030
You know, based on what we've seen, he is totally clean.

57
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,460
There's nothing bad about him.

58
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,530
He doesn't drink, smoke, gamble, or date around.

59
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,290
He lives alone, but he doesn't even watch porn.

60
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,760
I can't see a cause of death.

61
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,190
Does he...

62
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,560
- use drugs? - No way.

63
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,760
You never know.

64
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,290
Michael Jackson, Prince.

65
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,560
That's how all of the foreign stars died.

66
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,830
No wonder.

67
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,360
I thought he wrote this song way too quickly.

68
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,990
What if he has needle marks?

69
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,560
Jade, amethyst, germanium, titanium...

70
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,690
Hey.

71
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,430
(Well-being jade seat)

72
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,490
- "Well-being jade seat"? - "Well-being jade seat"?

73
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,760
Jade is supposed to be great for men.

74
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,430
I don't think he'll die from a disease, at least.

75
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,490
Start over.

76
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,130
Let's start over.

77
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,690
Start over.

78
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,690
Start over.

79
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,490
Start over.

80
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,060
Why am I standing here absent-mindedly?

81
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:47,690
It's because I feel empty

82
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:54,160
Without you

83
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,190
I can't

84
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,160
Do anything

85
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,460
Let's stop.

86
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,530
- Let's call it a day. - Why don't we continue?

87
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,560
Also, look at me every once in a while.

88
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,430
We're singing a duet.

89
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,830
If you want to chill, go home. Thank you for today.

90
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,400
Give me some water.

91
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,560
Do you have any idea how I brought Jo Yi Na, that handful, here?

92
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,560
- What did you just say? - I mean you're so popular.

93
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,860
- Woo Joo. - Wasn't that too much?

94
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,230
She made it too cheesy.

95
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,790
I thought it was very pleasant to the ear.

96
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,760
- Hey. - Should I get the car ready?

97
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,060
What have we been doing all day?

98
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,790
You didn't even thank the staff for their hard work.

99
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,130
Anyway, use the last version unless you want to call off everything.

100
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,330
Making a love song is a piece of cake.

101
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,190
- Hey. - Gosh.

102
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,260
I'll write one.

103
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,130
You could buy this building only because of Woo Joo.

104
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,900
What do you know about music?

105
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,190
President Uhm.

106
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,260
I'll scoop your eyes out.

107
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,730
How dare you hit on him?

108
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,090
He is a bit of a jerk when he's at work, though.

109
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,400
Don't be so harsh. He's my baby.

110
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,060
I've been worried after prescribing you those pills.

111
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,560
You might become dependent on them like I did.

112
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:01,090
- Why don't you just skip them? - You're scary.

113
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,290
Hey, it's a girl.

114
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,530
With your failed album, you probably will have trouble falling asleep.

115
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,090
The best cure is someone sleeping soundly next to you.

116
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,490
- Get a pet or something. - That's absurd.

117
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,160
Hey, I'll never keep you as a pet, at least.

118
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,860
You're crazy. I have a crush on someone.

119
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:25,360
At least, I make an effort. Don't you think you're abnormal?

120
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:29,230
You live all alone in such a huge apartment.

121
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,860
I'm sure there are ghosts.

122
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,930
Hang up.

123
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:34,530
Ghosts, my foot.

124
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,230
(Zolpidem)

125
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,790
My goodness. Did you see?

126
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,560
Did you see his Adam's apple?

127
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,260
Gak Shi, that's not what's important.

128
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,090
"Zolpidem".

129
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,290
"Zolpidem".

130
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,630
He's so sexy and cute.

131
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,430
He's extremely healthy. Will he really die?

132
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,560
I wonder, too.

133
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,200
My baby hasn't...

134
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,190
smiled once yet.

135
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,260
Why does he keep all the lights on?

136
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,360
He hates darkness.

137
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,490
(Alarm)

138
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,660
He's not here yet.

139
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,190
Take your time. Don't wash just your bangs.

140
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,070
I'll go and look.

141
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:41,470
(Manager Ko)

142
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,470
Hello.

143
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,030
You never sleep in. You didn't run this morning.

144
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,700
Hi.

145
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,000
Please get that for me.

146
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,840
One iced Americano, please.

147
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,430
A caramel frappuccino with a huge heap of whipped cream, please.

148
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,700
That was nice.

149
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,570
This is it.

150
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,900
Right. About those online haters...

151
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,900
Yes?

152
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,340
Withdraw the suit.

153
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,730
I'll do some volunteer work with them instead.

154
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,400
What?

155
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,170
All right. I'll take care of it.

156
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,230
Hey.

157
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,700
Thank you always.

158
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Are you crying?

159
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,430
No. Are you going crazy?

160
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,870
You've never said that for seven years. What's with you?

161
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,900
It's like you're going to die soon or something.

162
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,670
(Manager Gu: Come here.)

163
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,930
Get off him.

164
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:33,930
(The Famous Singer Is Soon to Die)

165
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:37,070
Once he ascends, I won't be able to see him again.

166
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,500
Can't I just watch him?

167
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,370
Why would you follow around an alive person?

168
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,840
There are tons of better people to follow around.

169
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,670
He's been acting strangely.

170
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,130
- I want to die. - He says he wants to die.

171
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,800
- Thank you always. - He's different from usual.

172
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,200
If he...

173
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,200
dies,

174
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,470
I'll guide him.

175
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:05,370
I know Woo Joo better than anyone else does.

176
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,130
You even failed to guide a kid.

177
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,100
Woo Joo is a different story.

178
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,300
If we don't send him up this year, he will live for a long time.

179
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,070
He's needed up there.

180
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,670
You can't take a person just because...

181
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,770
he's needed. Don't you feel sorry for him?

182
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,730
Who feels sorry for who now?

183
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,730
I feel sorry for you more than anyone else.

184
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,030
You could have sent me up when I died.

185
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,870
Why are you making me work here?

186
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,730
You could have ended up as a ghost running from people.

187
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,670
I gave you a means of living.

188
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:35,830
Why does it have to be Woo Joo?

189
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,830
You should know better than that.

190
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,230
What else can I do?

191
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,330
He's the only person I remember.

192
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,300
You're missing a very important thing here.

193
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,230
You're already dead.

194
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,130
When a dead person approaches an alive one,

195
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,000
regrets follow.

196
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,970
Get off of him.

197
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,370
(7 things I want to do if I can live again)

198
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,830
(First love)

199
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,500
(Dream World Admission Ticket)

200
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,330
- Hello? - Woo Joo.

201
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,170
President Uhm wants to have a drink with you.

202
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,400
I'm working out.

203
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,500
- This late? - Give me the phone.

204
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,500
Hello. Woo Joo, what are you going to do about the song?

205
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:07,870
Hello?

206
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,100
Gosh.

207
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:17,100
- Why is he outside this late? - Leave him alone.

208
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,030
He's not a fish in a fish tank.

209
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,500
You're turning him into a weird person.

210
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,500
Rumors can destroy male celebrities in a second.

211
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:27,770
How did he get there in the first place? Gosh, what should I do?

212
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,600
We should just get some rice.

213
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,500
- Sir. - Yes.

214
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,330
- Please add two bowls of rice. - Okay.

215
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,770
Is Woo Joo coming?

216
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,030
He's busy with work.

217
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,500
He is? I see.

218
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,500
- Sir. - Call a driver.

219
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,100
I just had two shots of soju. Sir.

220
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,570
- Bye. - Drive safely.

221
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,670
- Okay. - You should call a driver.

222
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,900
It's okay.

223
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,300
I think he's going to die soon. What should I do?

224
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,870
(Woo Joo)

225
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,900
Here I go. Let's see.

226
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:20,270
Woo Joo.

227
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm a huge fan of yours. I can't believe this.

228
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,200
It's an honor to guide you.

229
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,670
I died about three years ago.

230
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,200
I almost thinking it was a good thing that I died.

231
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,300
I'm so proud of myself right now.

232
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,830
This is such a rewarding moment.

233
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,430
I shouldn't laugh in front of a dead person.

234
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,500
Sorry? Do you need anything?

235
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,400
Wait, Woo Joo.

236
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,000
Throw up in my hand. No, not my hand.

237
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,930
What are you doing? Goodness.

238
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,500
Use this.

239
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,500
My goodness.

240
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,570
I'll clean up.

241
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,730
Throw up as much as you want.

242
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,570
Goodness. It was wrong?

243
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,500
The VIP must have been waiting.

244
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,870
He must be so disappointed.

245
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,030
Really?

246
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,300
When?

247
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,030
Let me see.

248
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,500
He's supposed to die this year. It can't take long.

249
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,630
I'd say he'll ascend before the first snow.

250
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,430
I understand you need him.

251
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:43,130
We're working at full capacity.

252
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,000
Okay. It'll never happen again.

253
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,600
Bye.

254
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,870
Are you from North Korea?

255
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,300
If you're from here, how could you mistake someone else for Woo Joo?

256
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,400
You didn't check his name or face because of your greed.

257
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,800
It'll never happen again.

258
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:10,130
- I don't believe it. - Get out!

259
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:14,070
I'll get him by all means.

260
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,930
Are you hoping our company will close down?

261
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:19,470
- That's not true! - My goodness.

262
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,330
Let me hit you with "Diamond Sutra".

263
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,200
- Get out! - I will!

264
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,170
Let's take a walk.

265
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,170
A ghost mimicked a human being?

266
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,230
Did you learn from the movie "Ghost"?

267
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,770
- Yes. - It was released when I was little.

268
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,930
You could have just played a few tricks like female ghosts do.

269
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:57,070
How dare you meddle with a person's life?

270
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,770
People's lives should...

271
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,500
never be affected by grim reapers.

272
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,430
It's up to human beings.

273
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,030
They make each other get sick,

274
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,830
cause accidents while pursuing money,

275
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,000
and cause car accidents by making cars.

276
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,070
Even suicides are caused by other people.

277
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:18,070
Some people die early because of an unlucky relationship...

278
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,430
while others...

279
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,570
live longer because of a good relationship.

280
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,730
How many times do I have to tell you? Isn't it absurd...

281
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,270
that a grim reaper gave a person a life?

282
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,070
That was the only thing...

283
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,430
I could do for him.

284
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,500
No matter what,

285
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,500
I felt alive...

286
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,930
when I saw Woo Joo.

287
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:04,700
You're...

288
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:07,770
fired.

289
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:12,900
This is the only thing I can do for you.

290
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,030
Neither saving nor killing someone...

291
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,200
is a grim reaper's job.

292
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:23,070
It's a human being's.

293
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,800
Sorry?

294
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:06,170
Why? Now that you need to go back, are you afraid?

295
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,770
Is that really possible?

296
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:09,870
Of course.

297
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,870
It happened a long time ago to a foreigner.

298
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:18,370
Just three days after he died, he went back in his same form...

299
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,270
and stayed for about 40 days.

300
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,470
That was Jesus.

301
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,800
His father is on a different level.

302
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,500
If you focus, you can do it too.

303
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,570
Practice and give it a shot.

304
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:38,570
It's up to those around him to save him, anyway.

305
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:44,070
With this, let's say I repaid my debt...

306
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,770
for taking you.

307
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,400
You'll be reborn...

308
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:19,670
as someone closest to your precious Woo Joo.

309
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:25,570
If he can survive past the first snowfall,

310
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,970
he should be safe.

311
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,630
However,

312
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,400
make sure...

313
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:07,000
you don't fulfill all seven reasons you haven't crossed over yet.

314
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,170
(First love)

315
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:11,100
If you have nothing holding you here,

316
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,400
you'll end up going up first.

317
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,070
Are you okay?

318
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,630
Do you remember what happened?

319
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,770
Don't fall asleep and listen to me.

320
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,780
Can you hear me? Open your eyes.

321
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:21,930
Can you hear me?

322
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,670
The test results are clear. She has no broken bones.

323
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:28,830
It's amazing how uninjured she is, but thank goodness.

324
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,830
She needs to process her discharge,

325
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:34,430
but she must be afraid of her parents and won't talk.

326
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,670
But Mr. Goo.

327
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,130
Do you know her?

328
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:49,170
What?

329
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,400
(Woo Joo)

330
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:13,270
In the endless darkness

331
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:23,730
In the tunnel with you, my light

332
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,000
I cannot breathe

333
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:37,070
I cannot breathe

334
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,430
It's like

335
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,500
(Woo Joo)

336
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:44,470
I'm walking through the dark tunnel alone

337
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:54,900
It's like I'm walking in the darkness without you, my light

338
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:00,630
That is how I live

339
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,930
Hey. Who is that?

340
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:06,770
Zoom in.

341
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,900
It is people who save people, but it is also people...

342
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,830
who kill people.

343
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,830
I'm sure he'll go up on his own...

344
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,500
before the first snowfall.

345
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,100
(Star of the Universe)

346
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:45,700
What's it to you whether or not I die?

347
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,170
I'll do anything for you,

348
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:52,370
so let me follow you around until the first snowfall.

349
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,900
Why don't you just date someone?

350
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,800
She's going to follow me around anyway.

351
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,830
- Tomorrow. - With me?

352
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,970
You should see her jumping around.

353
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:07,230
She's acting like she's his guardian angel or something.

354
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,170
Now that I saw you, I feel like I can breathe again.

355
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,930
Since we don't know in advance...

356
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:14,300
when our final moment will be.
