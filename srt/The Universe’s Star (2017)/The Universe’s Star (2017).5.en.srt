00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,360
(Mission three: First kiss)

2
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,280
Mr. Goo.

3
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,580
If I don't tell you today,

4
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,350
I don't think I'll ever be able to pluck up the courage again.

5
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:06,710
Sorry?

6
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,450
I'm a beautiful doctor,

7
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,750
and I earn twice as much as you do.

8
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,410
That being said, I take a shower only when I have a date.

9
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,080
I'm a heavy smoker, and I can't sleep without sleeping pills.

10
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,580
I have no friends because I work too much.

11
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,380
I know nothing about cooking and stuff.

12
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,950
As your...

13
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,180
looks and personality...

14
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,310
perfectly suit my taste,

15
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,780
it's probably pretty fair, I guess.

16
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,380
But...

17
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,680
Still...

18
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,380
What's the point of all that?

19
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,910
Your occupation is...

20
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,280
dangerous.

21
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,750
Right?

22
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,910
Like the person today,

23
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,280
you might...

24
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,250
really die, too.

25
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,180
It's just a little scary.

26
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,080
If I don't say this now,

27
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,050
I might not be able to do it tomorrow.

28
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,880
I like you.

29
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,080
It doesn't matter whether you like me back or not.

30
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,280
Just...

31
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,280
Just don't show up...

32
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,780
injured.

33
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,250
- Isn't that Woo Joo? - Woo Joo?

34
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,610
- Is that Woo Joo? - It is him.

35
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,710
- It's Woo Joo. - It's him.

36
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,280
- Really? - Take pictures.

37
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,950
- What's going on? - He's so handsome.

38
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,910
You should think about your image. My goodness.

39
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,010
They're taking pictures of us.

40
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,780
Your fans will get furious.

41
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,680
They'll try to scoop my eyes out.

42
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,810
Don't take pictures.

43
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,680
What should I do?

44
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,110
Where are we going, anyway?

45
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,580
You should go to the places you want and eat things you want.

46
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,880
- That's what you told me. - Sorry?

47
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,150
Let's go to the sea.

48
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,050
(Mission four: A trip to the sea)

49
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,550
I'm not good enough.

50
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,450
I...

51
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,910
don't deserve...

52
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,680
your feelings.

53
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,310
Is it, by any chance, because I'm a doctor?

54
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,080
I'm nothing to be scared of.

55
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,450
Me being the Grim Reaper of the emergency room?

56
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,450
That's just a joke.

57
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,610
Also,

58
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,010
I'll cut down on smoking.

59
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:07,580
I know you're a nice person.

60
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,910
I've known you for a long time,

61
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,780
- and you're 100 times nicer. - No.

62
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,050
I'm not a nice person.

63
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,450
I'm sorry, Dr. Yun.

64
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,580
Don't be.

65
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,750
It's just my feelings.

66
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,510
Sleeping pills and cigarettes.

67
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,010
Try to stay away from them.

68
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,210
You're probably hurting your health by working too much.

69
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,110
See? You're a nice person.

70
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,450
Aren't you hungry? Do you want something to eat?

71
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,110
What do you want to eat?

72
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,550
What do you want?

73
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,480
What's your favorite color?

74
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,180
White.

75
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,980
Since my mom passed away,

76
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,550
my dad and I haven't been here a lot.

77
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,480
When I was little,

78
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,080
our house was always dark.

79
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:03,350
My dad was always busy. And now, I've become busy.

80
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,810
The stars in the sky are...

81
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,550
as pretty as the glow sticks at the stadium.

82
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:19,450
It looks just like that right before you show up.

83
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,710
I sometimes imagine...

84
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,850
those stars fading one by one.

85
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,280
I'd be left alone in the dark again.

86
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,350
If you think about it, it's only natural.

87
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,550
To be honest, you never know when they'll change their mind.

88
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,480
Woo Joo, we're not watching you...

89
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:52,550
to see how well you do.

90
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,310
We just watch you.

91
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:03,080
Just like looking up at the stars while going through a hard time.

92
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,210
When you shine,

93
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:12,920
it feels like my gloomy days brighten up, too,

94
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,280
even for a short moment.

95
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:19,920
No matter how exhausted I've been, I become okay.

96
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,850
Whatever I'm going through,

97
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,650
I can go on thanks to you.

98
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:33,380
Being a light for someone else...

99
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,380
is not something everyone can do.

100
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:41,250
You only live once, and I think you're doing a pretty good job.

101
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,580
My baby.

102
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,980
So...

103
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,880
when you're exhausted, it's okay to stop shining for a while.

104
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:56,110
You don't have to try to shine all the time.

105
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:13,610
Did you text my dad with my phone?

106
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,950
Yes. I wrote, "I love you."

107
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,210
I've never said that to my dad.

108
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,950
People don't know how you feel unless you tell them.

109
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,980
And you never know when is the last moment.

110
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,510
I don't want you to regret like I did.

111
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,510
(I love you, too, my son. From Dad)

112
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,210
My goodness.

113
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,650
(I love you, Dad.)

114
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,550
(I love you, Dad.)

115
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,480
A soft drink, please.

116
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,510
Okay, it's on the house.

117
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,150
It is so nice here.

118
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:17,080
We only talk on the phone all the time. I'm sorry.

119
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,850
It's okay. We're together all the time in any case.

120
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,650
I don't want to just talk on the phone anymore.

121
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,150
I want to meet you.

122
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,710
- So do I, you punk. - I like you even if you swear.

123
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,650
- I love you! - I like you even if you swear.

124
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,010
I love you, you punk.

125
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,580
I still like you.

126
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:19,210
As the day breaks, the stars seem to fade.

127
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,580
But they're all still there.

128
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,580
They're not gone even if you can't see them.

129
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,550
(Zolpidem)

130
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,750
Sleeping pills and cigarettes. Try to stay away from them.

131
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,780
Just don't show up injured.

132
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,180
Your flowers are ready.

133
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,050
I'd like one more of the same thing.

134
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,050
Okay.

135
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,610
Thank you.

136
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,380
Hello.

137
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,680
Doctor. He's become worse, so he's been transferred to the ICU.

138
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,880
Is Mr. Goo aware of it?

139
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,650
Yes. He was the first one I called.

140
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,750
Wait. Hold on.

141
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:40,210
- Hello. - Woo Joo, it's me.

142
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,410
How can this be possible?

143
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,380
I remember who she is now.

144
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,650
What is she, really?

145
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,180
Shortly after her daughter's death,

146
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,450
she had a stroke and was hospitalized.

147
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:13,050
In a sense, it's a miracle she's held out until now.

148
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,750
Mom.

149
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,480
Mom.

150
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,950
To be honest, I was scared...

151
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,850
you might be...

152
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,150
living happily without me.

153
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,410
I thought I'd get hurt.

154
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,050
That's why I didn't look for you.

155
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,210
You should have been eating well...

156
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,650
and visiting nice places.

157
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,650
You should have been living well.

158
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,250
Why...

159
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:40,180
Why are you waiting for me like this?

160
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,910
Mom.

161
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,450
The thing is,

162
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:58,750
I didn't know that'd be our last moment.

163
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,710
That's why I couldn't say this.

164
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,550
I love you.

165
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,510
I love you, Mom.

166
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,910
I love you.

167
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,620
Don't be scared, Mom.

168
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,710
Let me tell you.

169
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,710
This is not the end.

170
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,910
It's okay.

171
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,850
I love you.

172
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,910
I love you, Mom.

173
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,750
I love you.

174
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:13,280
(Mission five: Saying goodbye)

175
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:18,880
(Mission six: Forgiving courageously)

176
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:32,950
As she has no family, Mr. Goo has been looking after her...

177
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,250
for the past seven years.

178
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,850
At first, I thought I was going crazy.

179
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,280
But maybe someone above is helping me this once.

180
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,380
If I...

181
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,150
end up being condemned,

182
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,550
I might not be able to say this ever.

183
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,980
I'm sorry.

184
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:42,880
Stop it.

185
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,350
I'm really sorry.

186
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,510
Stop it.

187
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,450
I'm never...

188
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:01,680
going to forgive you.

189
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,010
I'll talk to her.

190
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,650
Seven years ago, when I was a trainee,

191
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:45,180
I was scared of blood and couldn't stand anything cruel.

192
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,850
And I had to face deaths at work.

193
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,180
It was painful.

194
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,210
Ha Na.

195
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,280
She was just around my age.

196
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,350
A girl arrived at the hospital.

197
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,880
Where's the doctor? Move.

198
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,610
- It was the first death... - Check her BP.

199
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,810
I had ever experienced.

200
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,780
At the same time,

201
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,610
it was a death I should have stopped.

202
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,950
How would the face look...

203
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,980
behind those hands?

204
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:28,250
I couldn't even imagine.

205
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:29,950
That...

206
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,480
woke me up.

207
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,580
Blood is...

208
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,650
not what I should be scared of.

209
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,950
It's not the moment of death that's scary.

210
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,580
I'm just scared of...

211
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,350
me...

212
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,550
in that white gown...

213
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,510
just standing there.

214
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,510
I can make...

215
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,880
people live...

216
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,850
or die.

217
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:13,350
Since then, I haven't been able to sleep without taking pills.

218
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,050
I've been smoking a lot, too.

219
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:23,910
If I had helped,

220
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,610
you might have lived.

221
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,710
I might be...

222
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:35,110
- I'll look after you. - the reason why you died.

223
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,010
I'm sorry.

224
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,580
I'm sorry.

225
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,980
It's hard to believe,

226
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,780
but I want to believe.

227
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,410
Because I'm so thankful...

228
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:57,080
that you're alive again.

229
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,010
Did you want to see me, Manager Gu?

230
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,750
Yes.

231
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,280
You should go and get her.

232
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,880
Okay.

233
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:57,080
By the way, is she aware?

234
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,680
Does she know that he'll die because of her?
