00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,130
not even my own name, but that I loved the singer, Woo Joo.

00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,060

You're trying to move it with your finger.

14

You can't push it with your finger. You're dead.

It's all in your mind.

16
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,300
The problem with you is, you still think you're real.

- How? - You have to focus.

21
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,430
- Do you hear what I'm saying? - How do you focus?

22
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,230
Just focus.

121
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,060
He has everything here. Why would he go?

122
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,330
His soul isn't weak enough for us to break through.

123
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,260
He needs to want to die once in a while.

124
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,330
That's right. And do some things he normally wouldn't.

125
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,160
- Yes. - Come on, now.

126
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,630

Not Jaws. Jobs.

134
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,260
I hid it so well. How did you see it?

135
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,130
It's compatible in both this life and the afterlife.

136
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,000
It provides a countdown,

137
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,160
as well as GPS. It's as shocking as seeing a ghost.

139

it's the geniuses that change the world.

140
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,000
What use is it...

141
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,400
to take up thousands of nobodies?

142
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,060
In our field, we need to bring up...

to climb the ladder. Don't you agree?

145
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,160
- That's right. - Am I wrong?

146
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,130
- That's right. - Am I wrong?

147
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:04,500
- Wow. - The women in this world will cry.

148
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,100
- Hey! - Hey!

149
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,800
Seriously.

150
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,060
Why you... If you were going to be like this, why did you die?

151
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,260
I'm sorry.

152
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,130
There are some souls left to bring up downstairs at the funeral home.

153
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,460

She's so clueless.

155
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,760
Please stop and let's go.

156
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,630
Had I known, I wouldn't have sold noodles and saved like crazy.

157
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,500
I would've spent freely.

158
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,360
I would've done good deeds. I didn't get much of a pension.

159
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,130
I can't go like this.

160
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,960
If you don't let go, you'll get stuck like me.

161
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,560
Why do you keep talking back to me?

162
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,360
Why is the grim reaper so young?

163
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,460
Hey, do you want me to help?

164
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:10,000
He's the grim reaper. He's the real one.

165
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,760
I'm real, too.

166
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,330
Come on.

167
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,230
Why should our performance matter so much?

168
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,630
Sir, you better hurry.

169
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,230
- Your funeral will be over soon. - Yes, Sir.

170
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,400
Oh, my.

171
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,830
Welcome.

172
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,530
- Hello, Sir. - Hello. All right.

173
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,830
See you later!

174
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,560
(We root for you, Woo Joo!)

175
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,700
Is he really going to die? What should I do?

176
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,460
Supporting Woo Joo is my only joy.

177
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:14,000
Hey, this is not the first time such rumor goes around.

178
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:17,360
Even if he's being called, why would he die?

179
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,830
From the expert's point of view,

180
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,100
he should think he wants to die, which will make him...

181
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,260
do unusual things. There should be those signs first.

182
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,360
His seventh album is not doing so well. Will he, by any chance,

183
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,760
kill himself?

184
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,600
Don't say that. Let's face it.

185
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,930
His latest single is not for everybody.

186
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,700
But you never know until his regular album comes out.

187
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,030
To be honest, the music video was terrible, too.

188
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,700
There have been so many mean comments.

189
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,560
They're all over the internet.

190
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,660
He deserves more.

191
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,700
What are all his lazy fans doing?

192
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,730
Hey, do you even listen to his music on the internet?

193
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,630
- Woo Joo! - What is this brat?

194
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,000
My baby is probably too nice to sue them.

195
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,700
His agency must be against him.

196
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,430
Why does President Uhm keep sending him abroad?

197
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,670
- Also, his comeback stage outfit... - It was awful.

198
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,860
- Was it felt or something? - Should I send his stylists first?

199
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,130
Here comes Woo Joo.

200
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:29,000
- We'll protect and love you forever - We'll protect and love you forever

201
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,830
- We'll protect and love you forever - We'll protect and love you forever

202
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,560
- We'll protect and love you forever - We'll protect and love you forever

203
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,170
- We'll protect and love you forever - We'll protect and love you forever

204
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,530
- We'll protect and love you forever - What?

205
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,700
- He can't see me anyway. - Are we stalkers?

206
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,730
No, we aren't.

207
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,230
- We'll protect and love you forever - Woo Joo, don't die.

208
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:56,000
My life will be meaningless without you.

209
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,400
- We'll protect and love you forever - We'll protect and love you forever

210
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,830
- We'll protect and... - We'll protect and...

211
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,130
Look at this.

212
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,960
His song has disappeared from all charts right away.

213
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,830
I get it. I'll call you back later.

214
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,930
- I'm sorry. Okay. - What did I tell you?

215
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,800
Kids these days don't listen to complicated songs.

216
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,700
Woo Joo, for the next song, bite the bullet...

217
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,960
and write a romantic one.

218
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,930
With easy-to-understand lyrics and...

219
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,670
- an acoustic sound. - I'm not so sure, President Uhm.

220
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,860
Who expects romantic songs from Woo Joo?

221
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,430
It was your idea that he's supposed to be from outer space.

222
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,460
He's been on the Earth for a while now.

223
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,730
Start going on variety shows, too.

224
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,630
Why not a boyfriend-like character like Eric Nam? Woo Joo.

225
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,530
Try searching your name on the web.

226
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,930
Is he sleeping?

227
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,560
Woo Joo, are you sleeping? Oh, he is. He must be tired.

228
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,600
President Uhm, let me speak from a singer-songwriter's perspective.

229
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,330
You need experience to make something.

230
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:03,430
Woo Joo has been living a hermit's life since 19.

231
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,670
How could he write love songs? All he can write are scriptures.

232
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,700
It's not like he doesn't want to write love songs. He just can't.

233
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,400
To write songs, you need emotional exchanges.

234
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,000
On that note, why don't you let him meet some girls?

235
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,230
I knew it. Then at least get him a pet or something.

236
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,330
I can't go on like this. I'm not his pet.

237
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,930
If he can't write love songs, he can always sing others'.

238
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,330
I'll call Jung Ji Chang and ask for a love song.

239
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,130
Talk to Jo Yi Na and schedule a recording.

240
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,330
- Jo Yi Na? - Yes. Hey.

241
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,030
- What is it? - "We Got Married".

242
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:44,600
I'll call them and ask them to cast Yi Na and him.

243
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,960
Kids will love it.

244
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,430
- Where's he going? - Hey.

245
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,130
Woo Joo!

246
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:53,460
- Woo Joo! - Be careful!

247
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,830
(Woo Joo)

248
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:13,530
(Woo Joo Releases Seventh Album "Chaos" with Song "Tunnel")

249
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,400
It's a torture to listen to Woo Joo's new song.

250
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,130
He's just a has-been who's desperately seeking attention.

251
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,030
He should just die.

252
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,030
Gosh, you're so handsome.

253
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,330
I'll delete it.

254
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,330
It's okay.

255
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,500
(Share)

256
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,700
I can just sue you.

257
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,560
Don't you have a transportation card or cash?

258
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:23,630
One, two, three.

259
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,430
One, two, three.

260
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,600
One, two, three.

261
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,430
(Manager Gu)

262
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:39,900
Hello.

263
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,100
How can you send up zero person when 800 people die in a day?

264
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,630
- Won't you work hard? - I work hard, but...

265
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,800
they're saved every time.

266
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,900
Don't give me an excuse.

267
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,360
Don't you want to get a permanent employment within this year?

268
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,800
I do.

269
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,800
Give me more support.

270
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:03,330
- Give me one of those watches. - That's just an excuse.

271
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:06,630
I need you to send someone up before I give you anything.

272
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:10,560
Aren't there any female ghosts hovering around near you?

273
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,660
There is one.

274
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:19,000
Okay. Bye.

275
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,830
Do you...

276
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,000
want to go up?

277
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,930
You're crazy. I'm your best friend.

278
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,030
One, two, three.

279
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,560
I seduced only one guy.

280
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,460
I wouldn't even hope for Woo Joo.

281
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:49,130
I'll go up with no regrets once I'm loved.

282
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,730
I get it.

283
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,800
- Gak Shi. - What?

284
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,960
Will you book concert tickets with me later?

285
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,430
Okay!

286
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,130
Gosh, you scared me.

287
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,860
President Uhm's been nagging me. I'll schedule a recording.

288
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,030
Can you find your way home alone?

289
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,360
What does he take me for?

290
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:58,530
Gosh.

291
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,230
Nothing is going right.

292
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,860
Hello.

293
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,860
It's me. Why is my place so far away from the station?

294
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:14,330
I pay huge rent. Isn't it supposed to be closer?

295
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,830
Gosh, what a lousy neighborhood.

296
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,830
I'm almost there.

297
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,330
Where am I?

298
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,530
I have no idea where I am.

299
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,360
I wish I could die.

300
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,620
Have you ever considered...

301
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,790
life without Woo Joo?

302
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:16,490
Are you insane? Now, concentrate.

303
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,590
Three, two, start.

304
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,820
"Reservation number 137". I get to see Woo Joo live!

305
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,440
I was awesome just now.

306
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,110
- I was awesome. - I failed.

307
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,110
- I couldn't concentrate. - Loser.

308
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,680
Why were you distracted when buying such sacred tickets?

309
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,310
This is the first time he failed.

310
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:48,210
Woo Joo is human, too. Sure. He could've lost in for a moment.

311
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,880
He could think about wanting to die.

312
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,980
As long as he doesn't do anything weird.

313
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,940
Will he really die?

314
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,410
Tell me the truth, you grim reaper.

315
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,480
You're good at reading these things.

316
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,480
Does he die before or after the concert?

317
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,380
If I knew,

318
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,240
how could I watch my baby ascend?

319
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,610
What a cruddy job post death.

320
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:20,110
Let's just do it. Woo Joo can't see us anyway.

321
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,110
Don't you know Woo Joo?

322
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:26,410
He hates people who follow him around more than his haters.

323
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,310
What if he does something drastic?

324
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,980
You said he's your destiny.

325
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:34,910
Will you just let him go easily down that path?

326
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,680
Let's follow him around.

327
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,580
You can afford to since you're a freelancer.

328
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,280
Just call in sick for a few days.

329
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,140
How could a dead girl call in sick? That's...

330
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,940
(We'll protect and love you forever.)

331
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,480
Hello? Hello, Sir.

332
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:00,910
You see, I fell off my bike...

333
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,780
and threw out my back.

334
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:06,710
It hurts too much to move.

335
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:10,310
I'm sorry for waking you.

336
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,510
Okay. Goodnight.

337
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,640
(Alarm)

338
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,540
Every morning, he gets up at 6:30am on the dot.

339
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,380
He runs on the designated, empty route for the designated time.

340
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:44,640
He never skipped this routine since he made his debut.

341
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:00,010
He eats organic foods sent by his fans.

342
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,310
But he doesn't care about flavour.

343
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:06,680
He consumes exactly 2,500 calories, the average for a Korean man.

344
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,380
He never eats sweets.

345
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:25,410
Instants? Why bother?

346
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,440
The smell. Are you insane?

347
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,140
Right. Sorry.

348
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:35,040
Kids posted those comments. Should we still press charges?

349
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:41,210
Yes, press charges against all of them.

350
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,780
Why did you even bother asking? Are you stupid?

351
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,680
It's nicer than I expected.

352
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,110
- Gak Shi! - What?

353
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,640
It'll be dangerous if he steps on a bar of soap!

354
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,480
Let's keep our boundaries.

355
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,780
You know, based on what we've seen, he is totally clean.

356
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,210
There's nothing bad about him.

357
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,280
He doesn't drink, smoke, gamble, or date around.

358
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:15,040
He lives alone, but he doesn't even watch porn.

359
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,510
I can't see a cause of death.

360
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,940
Does he...

361
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,310
- use drugs? - No way.

362
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,510
You never know.

363
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,040
Michael Jackson, Prince.

364
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,310
That's how all of the foreign stars died.

365
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,580
No wonder.

366
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:37,110
I thought he wrote this song way too quickly.

367
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:41,740
What if he has needle marks?

368
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:50,310
Jade, amethyst, germanium, titanium...

369
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:52,440
Hey.

370
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,180
(Well-being jade seat)

371
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,240
- "Well-being jade seat"? - "Well-being jade seat"?

372
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,510
Jade is supposed to be great for men.

373
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,180
I don't think he'll die from a disease, at least.

374
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,240
Start over.

375
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,880
Let's start over.

376
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,440
Start over.

377
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:25,440
Start over.

378
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,240
Start over.

379
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:39,810
Why am I standing here absent-mindedly?

380
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:47,440
It's because I feel empty

381
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:53,910
Without you

382
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:56,940
I can't

383
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:00,910
Do anything

384
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,210
Let's stop.

385
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,280
- Let's call it a day. - Why don't we continue?

386
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:10,310
Also, look at me every once in a while.

387
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,180
We're singing a duet.

388
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:18,580
If you want to chill, go home. Thank you for today.

389
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,150
Give me some water.

390
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,310
Do you have any idea how I brought Jo Yi Na, that handful, here?

391
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:30,310
- What did you just say? - I mean you're so popular.

392
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,610
- Woo Joo. - Wasn't that too much?

393
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,980
She made it too cheesy.

394
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,540
I thought it was very pleasant to the ear.

395
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,510
- Hey. - Should I get the car ready?

396
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,810
What have we been doing all day?

397
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:43,540
You didn't even thank the staff for their hard work.

398
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:47,880
Anyway, use the last version unless you want to call off everything.

399
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,080
Making a love song is a piece of cake.

400
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,940
- Hey. - Gosh.

401
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,010
I'll write one.

402
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:09,880
You could buy this building only because of Woo Joo.

403
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,650
What do you know about music?

404
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:12,940
President Uhm.

405
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:16,010
I'll scoop your eyes out.

406
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:18,480
How dare you hit on him?

407
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,840
He is a bit of a jerk when he's at work, though.

408
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,150
Don't be so harsh. He's my baby.

409
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,810
I've been worried after prescribing you those pills.

410
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:57,310
You might become dependent on them like I did.

411
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,840
- Why don't you just skip them? - You're scary.

412
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,040
Hey, it's a girl.

413
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:08,280
With your failed album, you probably will have trouble falling asleep.

414
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,840
The best cure is someone sleeping soundly next to you.

415
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,240
- Get a pet or something. - That's absurd.

416
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,910
Hey, I'll never keep you as a pet, at least.

417
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:20,610
You're crazy. I have a crush on someone.

418
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,110
At least, I make an effort. Don't you think you're abnormal?

419
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:28,980
You live all alone in such a huge apartment.

420
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,610
I'm sure there are ghosts.

421
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:31,680
Hang up.

422
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,280
Ghosts, my foot.

423
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,980
(Zolpidem)

424
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,540
My goodness. Did you see?

425
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,310
Did you see his Adam's apple?

426
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:13,010
Gak Shi, that's not what's important.

427
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:15,840
"Zolpidem".

428
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,040
"Zolpidem".

429
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,380
He's so sexy and cute.

430
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:42,180
He's extremely healthy. Will he really die?

431
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,310
I wonder, too.

432
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,950
My baby hasn't...

433
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,940
smiled once yet.

434
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:32,010
Why does he keep all the lights on?

435
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,110
He hates darkness.

436
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:12,240
(Alarm)

437
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,410
He's not here yet.

438
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:26,940
Take your time. Don't wash just your bangs.

439
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:29,820
I'll go and look.

440
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:41,220
(Manager Ko)

441
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,220
Hello.

442
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:48,780
You never sleep in. You didn't run this morning.

443
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,450
Hi.

444
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,750
Please get that for me.

445
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,590
One iced Americano, please.

446
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:03,180
A caramel frappuccino with a huge heap of whipped cream, please.

447
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,450
That was nice.

448
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,320
This is it.

449
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,650
Right. About those online haters...

450
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:44,650
Yes?

451
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,090
Withdraw the suit.

452
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,480
I'll do some volunteer work with them instead.

453
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,150
What?

454
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:56,920
All right. I'll take care of it.

455
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,980
Hey.

456
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,450
Thank you always.

457
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:13,350
Are you crying?

458
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:17,180
No. Are you going crazy?

459
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,620
You've never said that for seven years. What's with you?

460
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,650
It's like you're going to die soon or something.

461
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,420
(Manager Gu: Come here.)

462
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:32,680
Get off him.

463
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,680
(The Famous Singer Is Soon to Die)

464
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,820
Once he ascends, I won't be able to see him again.

465
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,250
Can't I just watch him?

466
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:43,120
Why would you follow around an alive person?

467
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:45,590
There are tons of better people to follow around.

468
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,420
He's been acting strangely.

469
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:50,880
- I want to die. - He says he wants to die.

470
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,550
- Thank you always. - He's different from usual.

471
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,950
If he...

472
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,950
dies,

473
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:01,220
I'll guide him.

474
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:05,120
I know Woo Joo better than anyone else does.

475
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,880
You even failed to guide a kid.

476
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,850
Woo Joo is a different story.

477
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:12,050
If we don't send him up this year, he will live for a long time.

478
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:13,820
He's needed up there.

479
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:15,420
You can't take a person just because...

480
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:17,520
he's needed. Don't you feel sorry for him?

481
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,480
Who feels sorry for who now?

482
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,480
I feel sorry for you more than anyone else.

483
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,780
You could have sent me up when I died.

484
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,620
Why are you making me work here?

485
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:29,480
You could have ended up as a ghost running from people.

486
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,420
I gave you a means of living.

487
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,580
Why does it have to be Woo Joo?

488
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:39,580
You should know better than that.

489
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,980
What else can I do?

490
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:44,080
He's the only person I remember.

491
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:48,050
You're missing a very important thing here.

00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:51,980

regrets follow.

495
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:06,720
Get off of him.

Gosh.

- Why is he outside this late? - Leave him alone.

He's not a fish in a fish tank.

You're turning him into a weird person.

- Bye. - Drive safely.

- Okay. - You should call a driver.

521
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:52,650
It's okay.

This is such a rewarding moment.

532
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:45,180
I shouldn't laugh in front of a dead person.

533
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,250
Sorry? Do you need anything?

534
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,150

00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:03,320
I'll clean up.

540
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:07,480
Throw up as much as you want.

541
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,320
Goodness. It was wrong?

542
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,250
The VIP must have been waiting.

543
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:21,620
He must be so disappointed.

544
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:24,780
Really?

545
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:27,050
When?

546
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,780
Let me see.

547
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:33,250
He's supposed to die this year. It can't take long.

548
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:37,380
I'd say he'll ascend before the first snow.

549
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,180
I understand you need him.

550
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:42,880
We're working at full capacity.

551
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:47,750
Okay. It'll never happen again.

552
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:49,350
Bye.

553
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,620
Are you from North Korea?

554
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:58,050
If you're from here, how could you mistake someone else for Woo Joo?

555
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:02,150
You didn't check his name or face because of your greed.

556
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:05,550
It'll never happen again.

557
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,880
- I don't believe it. - Get out!

558
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,820
I'll get him by all means.

559
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,680
Are you hoping our company will close down?

560
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,220
- That's not true! - My goodness.

561
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:22,080
Let me hit you with "Diamond Sutra".

562
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:25,950
- Get out! - I will!

563
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:35,920
Let's take a walk.

564
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,920
A ghost mimicked a human being?

565
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:45,980
Did you learn from the movie "Ghost"?

566
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:50,520
- Yes. - It was released when I was little.

567
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:53,680
You could have just played a few tricks like female ghosts do.

568
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:56,820
How dare you meddle with a person's life?

569
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,520
People's lives should...

570
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:02,250
never be affected by grim reapers.

571
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,180
It's up to human beings.

572
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:06,780
They make each other get sick,

573
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:08,580
cause accidents while pursuing money,

574
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:10,750
and cause car accidents by making cars.

575
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:13,820
Even suicides are caused by other people.

576
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:17,820
Some people die early because of an unlucky relationship...

577
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,180
while others...

578
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:22,320
live longer because of a good relationship.

579
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:28,480
How many times do I have to tell you? Isn't it absurd...

580
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,020
that a grim reaper gave a person a life?

581
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:35,820
That was the only thing...

582
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:38,180
I could do for him.

583
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:41,250
No matter what,

584
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:48,250
I felt alive...

585
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,680
when I saw Woo Joo.

586
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,450
You're...

587
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,520
fired.

588
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:12,650
This is the only thing I can do for you.

589
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:17,780
Neither saving nor killing someone...

590
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,950
is a grim reaper's job.

591
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,820
It's a human being's.

592
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:26,550
Sorry?

593
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:05,920
Why? Now that you need to go back, are you afraid?

594
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:08,520
Is that really possible?

595
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,620
Of course.

596
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:12,620
It happened a long time ago to a foreigner.

597
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:18,120
Just three days after he died, he went back in his same form...

598
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,020
and stayed for about 40 days.

599
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:27,220
That was Jesus.

600
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:29,550
His father is on a different level.

601
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:31,250
If you focus, you can do it too.

602
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,320
Practice and give it a shot.

603
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:38,320
It's up to those around him to save him, anyway.

604
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:43,820
With this, let's say I repaid my debt...

605
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:46,520
for taking you.

606
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:14,150
You'll be reborn...

607
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:19,420
as someone closest to your precious Woo Joo.

608
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:25,320
If he can survive past the first snowfall,

609
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:27,720
he should be safe.

610
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:58,380
However,

611
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,150
make sure...

612
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:06,750
you don't fulfill all seven reasons you haven't crossed over yet.

613
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:07,920
(First love)

614
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,850
If you have nothing holding you here,

615
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,150
you'll end up going up first.

616
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:10,820
Are you okay?

617
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:13,380
Do you remember what happened?

618
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:15,520
Don't fall asleep and listen to me.

619
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:20,530
Can you hear me? Open your eyes.

620
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,680
Can you hear me?

621
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:25,420
The test results are clear. She has no broken bones.

622
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:28,580
It's amazing how uninjured she is, but thank goodness.

623
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:30,580
She needs to process her discharge,

624
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:34,180
but she must be afraid of her parents and won't talk.

625
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:37,420
But Mr. Goo.

626
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:40,880
Do you know her?

627
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:48,920
What?

628
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:54,150
(Woo Joo)

629
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:13,020
In the endless darkness

630
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:23,480
In the tunnel with you, my light

631
01:00:28,350 --> 01:00:31,750
I cannot breathe

632
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,820
I cannot breathe

633
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,180
It's like

634
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:39,250
(Woo Joo)

635
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:44,220
I'm walking through the dark tunnel alone

636
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:54,650
It's like I'm walking in the darkness without you, my light

637
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:00,380
That is how I live

638
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:04,680
Hey. Who is that?

639
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,520
Zoom in.

640
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:28,650
It is people who save people, but it is also people...

641
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:30,580
who kill people.

642
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:34,580
I'm sure he'll go up on his own...

643
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:37,250
before the first snowfall.

644
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:42,850
(Star of the Universe)

645
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:45,450
What's it to you whether or not I die?

646
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:47,920
I'll do anything for you,

647
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:52,120
so let me follow you around until the first snowfall.

648
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:55,650
Why don't you just date someone?

649
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:57,550
She's going to follow me around anyway.

650
01:02:58,450 --> 01:03:00,580
- Tomorrow. - With me?

651
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:03,720
You should see her jumping around.

652
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:06,980
She's acting like she's his guardian angel or something.

653
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:08,920
Now that I saw you, I feel like I can breathe again.

654
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,680
Since we don't know in advance...

655
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,050
when our final moment will be.
