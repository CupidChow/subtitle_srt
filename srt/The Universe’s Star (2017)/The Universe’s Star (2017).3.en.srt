1
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,630
You'll be reborn...

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,130
as someone closest...

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,060
to your precious Woo Joo.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,730
However, make sure...

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,430
you don't fulfill all seven reasons you haven't crossed over yet.

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,530
If you have nothing holding you here,

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,560
you'll end up going up first.

8
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,090
(Seven things I want to do if I can live again)

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,960
(First love)

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,430
- Please make way. - He's going to die.

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,790
Why don't you trust me?

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,330
Woo Joo.

13
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,230
Woo Joo.

14
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:44,790
Woo Joo.

15
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,330
- Did you find out? - Yes.

16
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,860
She doesn't even go to that school.

17
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,190
She's just a stalker.

18
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,660
You know those girls who risk their lives to attract your attention.

19
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,730
Sue her, okay?

20
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,630
- She needs a lesson. - Woo Joo.

21
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,430
It's not like she's a hater. Let's just have her released.

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,630
Look at her. She does look sick.

23
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,220
- Woo Joo. - Thanks to her,

24
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,620
you're the most searched person on the web after years.

25
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,960
Woo Joo.

26
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,360
Woo Joo.

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,390
(Woo Joo Has an Accident During a Show)

28
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,790
Gosh.

29
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,890
I told you not to eat anything in the car.

30
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:33,790
Woo Joo.

31
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,790
Let me speak from a singer-songwriter's perspective.

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,290
If you find it hard to write songs,

33
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,760
why don't you try meeting some girls?

34
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,190
Try meeting nice and obedient girls...

35
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,490
so that nothing leaks out.

36
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,260
I'll keep it a secret.

37
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:55,060
You're on edge right now. No wonder you can't write love songs.

38
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,020
Love songs don't come from here.

39
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,890
If you make your heart beat, the song will play itself.

40
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,060
Songs will start to come to you.

41
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,760
Hang on, Woo Joo.

42
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,790
Hi, Honey.

43
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,460
Like I said, we can meet when I get off work.

44
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,320
Why are you depressed, too?

45
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,820
- Woo Joo. - Gosh.

46
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,990
Okay. No, he didn't say that to you.

47
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,260
Your name.

48
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,260
(Statement)

49
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,890
Your resident registration number.

50
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,690
You're so obstinate.

51
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,490
You shouldn't give a person you like such a hard time.

52
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,530
Okay.

53
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,490
Woo Joo suggested that we release her...

54
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,690
and she does some volunteer work instead.

55
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,290
- He did? - Yes.

56
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,790
We have no choice. Get her personal information...

57
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,160
- and contact her family. - Okay.

58
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,820
Hello. Thank you for your hard work.

59
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,690
Mother.

60
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,090
She must be a runaway. I couldn't let her sleep outside.

61
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,860
All right.

62
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,390
Change into something more comfortable.

63
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,820
Thank you for your help.

64
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,060
What?

65
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,590
You look familiar.

66
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,120
Me?

67
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,860
Never mind.

68
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,360
That's impossible. Never mind.

69
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:19,060
You're right. We can't have met before.

70
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,990
I'm not a runaway. Don't worry too much.

71
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,620
Okay.

72
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,290
You can stay as long as you want.

73
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,390
Good night.

74
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,790
(When I hold your hand)

75
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,020
(When I hold your hand)

76
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,260
Give me your hand.

77
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,520
You're so pretty.

78
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,420
You should earn your keep.

79
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,390
(Woo Joo and His Online Haters Donate Briquettes)

80
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,460
Smile.

81
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,490
Okay.

82
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,690
- Let's share our love. - Let's share our love.

83
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,790
(Woo Joo and His Online Haters Donate Briquettes)

84
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,920
- Let's do a little interview. - How do you feel now?

85
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,560
Wait.

86
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,660
Wait. He's in danger.

87
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,090
- What should I do? - What's your plan now?

88
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,190
- Please say something. - Look here.

89
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,120
(Woo Joo)

90
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,190
What should I do?

91
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,960
An iced Americano, please.

92
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,420
(Woo Joo)

93
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,590
What are you doing? Are you crazy? What's with you?

94
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,960
Are you crazy? Aren't you going to pull yourself together?

95
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,320
Why did you hit me? If you have complaints, just tell me.

96
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,160
Aren't you going to start?

97
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,120
I am.

98
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,160
What are you talking about? We left you behind?

99
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,760
The thing is... Please hear me out, Woo Joo.

100
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,290
Death will come to you within this year.

101
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,020
You brat.

102
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,960
He doesn't want you to care if he dies or not.

103
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,360
If you stalk him again, you'll end up in prison.

104
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,490
He's such a jerk.

105
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,620
You just want to protect him. Why doesn't he believe you?

106
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,220
No one wants to think about his or her own death.

107
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,520
(Zolpidem)

108
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,690
It was better when I was invisible to him.

109
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,990
Now that I've come face-to-face with him,

110
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,860
he's so cold to me.

111
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,290
It's no wonder, though.

112
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,930
I must be less than dust to him.

113
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,790
Let's get out before he comes.

114
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,520
Hey. This is why he mistakes me for a stalker.

115
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,960
(I'll protect and love you forever.)

116
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,790
What is this?

117
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,960
(I'll protect and love you forever.)

118
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,590
She stole your dog?

119
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,590
Whose dog? Do you have a dog?

120
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,220
No.

121
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,820
Anyway, where does she live?

122
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,590
- Cinderella lost her parents - Cinderella lost her parents

123
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:52,490
- Her step-mom was mean to her - Her step-mom was mean to her

124
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,660
Wait.

125
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,490
You're out of hospital.

126
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,620
Are you okay now?

127
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,360
Are you here to take me again?

128
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,290
It's so cute.

129
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,160
It's so cute, isn't it?

130
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,790
Don't touch it.

131
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,590
- Isn't he Woo Joo? - No, I'm not.

132
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,060
I think he is.

133
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,220
(Se Joo Piano)

134
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:51,420
I recognize you the moment I see you

135
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,660
It feels like

136
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:02,690
We've been together for a long time

137
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:09,790
Let's stay together like this

138
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:14,620
It's the most beautiful moment

139
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,860
I'm attracted to you

140
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:26,760
The moment I see you for the first time

141
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,160
That song is in my first album.

142
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,390
You can even play that song? You're such a hardcore fan.

143
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,790
It's Woo Joo.

144
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,320
Am I your friend?

145
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,290
I'm a huge fan of yours. Can I have your autograph?

146
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,060
Are you happy now? Get out.

147
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,460
Hey.

148
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,590
How did you find out the password to my place?

149
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:32,690
In addition to stalking me, you stole my dog. What are you thinking?

150
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:36,020
For the record, you're...

151
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,820
the one who stole that dog.

152
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:42,690
Gosh.

153
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,160
You stalked me real hard, didn't you?

154
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,320
Who are you?

155
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,660
How can you know everything about me?

156
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,560
I know I look like a stalker.

157
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,090
But this is your unlucky year.

158
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,920
You should be careful.

159
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,320
- Are you a fortune teller? - Gosh.

160
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,690
I have no job.

161
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:09,120
Anyway, why do you care if I die?

162
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,920
You saved my life.

163
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:16,220
I'll do anything for you.

164
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,890
Please let me follow you around until the first snow comes.

165
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,490
I'll behave.

166
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,920
Why don't you try meeting some girls?

167
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:37,090
Try meeting nice and obedient girls...

168
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,320
so that nothing leaks out.

169
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,220
Then...

170
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,460
what are your plans for tomorrow?

171
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,420
Why?

172
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,560
If you're going to follow me around anyway,

173
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,960
- why don't we meet tomorrow? - Sorry?

174
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,860
What?

175
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,060
Why?

176
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,320
Me?

177
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,920
- Why? - You don't like it?

178
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,790
I do.

179
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,560
Of course, I like it.

180
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,060
This is unbelievable.

181
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,460
I'll come pick you up.

182
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,920
Hi. Don't report her yet.

183
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:44,020
Please cancel all my plans for the next two weeks.

184
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,120
I think I'll try dating.

185
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:52,060
Woo Joo's death is definitely near.

186
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,020
What's with him? Did he use drugs?

187
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,820
I definitely threw everything away.

188
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:59,520
How dare question Woo Joo's decision?

189
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,020
Have fun protecting him.

190
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,520
Are you going to meet him like that?

191
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,690
You're hopeless.

192
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,490
Don't you have any money of this world?

193
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,990
Okay.

194
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,690
(Um Chun Gil)

195
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,520
(237,628 dollars)

196
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,420
This will suit you.

197
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,020
Take everything. You have a lot of money.

198
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,160
How much is this one?

199
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,690
It's so pretty.

200
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,490
Should we go in?

201
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,090
Your glasses don't even have lenses. Just take them off.

202
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,090
You look so pretty.

203
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,990
I can't believe this.

204
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,560
Do you want some?

205
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,460
What's that?

206
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,260
Ginseng.

207
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,220
Or some propolis capsules?

208
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,060
You hate darkness.

209
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,590
With this, you can turn off the lights.

210
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,820
Forget it.

211
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,490
I have a lot of money. You didn't have to.

212
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,630
Thank you.

213
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,220
What's your name, by the way?

214
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,390
(Um Chun Gil)

215
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,220
Chun Gil. Um Chun Gil.

216
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,960
What do you usually do on a date, Chun Gil?

217
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,260
On a date?

218
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,420
I'm not sure. I've never been on a date before.

219
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,490
You're not saying we're on a date, are you?

220
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,320
- Yes, I am. - Woo Joo.

221
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,090
You should never be owned by just one person.

222
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,790
- Do you want to get off, then? - No.

223
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:12,630
We can go anywhere you want to go.

224
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,190
Don't couples usually go to an amusement park?

225
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:18,990
I don't want that.

226
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,890
Are you scared of rides?

227
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,690
No.

228
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:40,260
Oh, my gosh!

229
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,020
There was something Woo Joo is bad at.

230
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,260
My baby is so cute.

231
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,320
Hey, who's your baby?

232
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,490
- Delete that. - Okay.

233
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,360
I think you need some rest.

234
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,390
My baby, I mean, Woo Joo, you look very pale and sick.

235
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,090
You can't die like this.

236
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,820
That's absurd.

237
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,320
Look. I'm having so much fun.

238
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,630
Let's go for another ride.

239
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,560
Then let's try something safe.

240
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,760
Something like that. Let's try that, shall we?

241
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,660
Come on in.

242
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,560
This one is for kids.

243
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:38,760
It looks fun. It's safe, too.

244
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,920
Why is it so dark in here?

245
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,160
Hi.

246
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,960
Gosh.

247
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:10,590
(Mission two: A fantastic, dream-like date)

248
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,090
What are you doing? Let's go.

249
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,760
Okay.

250
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:53,660
(When I hold your hand, it feels like time is standing still)

251
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:03,090
(Chun Gil)

252
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,960
What should we do tomorrow?

253
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,290
What should I write?

254
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,220
(My baby)

255
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,760
Is there something you want to eat?

256
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,290
(Is there something you want to eat?)

257
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,960
Why aren't you eating?

258
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,690
Do you want me to pour the sauce over?

259
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,890
You decide.

260
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,190
Delete it.

261
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,060
Okay.

262
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,690
Can you give me a napkin?

263
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,390
Left side.

264
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,160
No, the other side.

265
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,420
Where?

266
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,160
I can't throw it away.

267
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:53,860
Woo Joo, is there something you want to have?

268
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,520
What's that?

269
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:01,320
That one is so hard to get your hands on.

270
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,860
It's unbelievably popular.

271
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,220
Move.

272
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,990
(3 tries for 50 cents)

273
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,560
I'm okay. Let's go now.

274
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,390
Hold on. We've invested so much money.

275
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,620
Look at you, Chun Gil.

276
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:25,120
Let's go now.

277
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:39,990
She's making his worn-out heart beat again.

278
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:44,290
It's like she used to be a guardian angel or something.

279
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,690
Why did you send her back?

280
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:53,020
Just wait and see. The relationship between people is a funny thing.

281
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,120
You never know until the end.

282
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,990
We'll find out before the first snow...

283
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,590
if they're meant to be together or not.

284
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,220
I'll protect you forever.

285
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,960
I love you.

286
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,120
I'll protect you forever.

287
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:32,860
I love you.

288
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,520
Hold on.

289
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,120
Try it again.

290
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,660
I'll get going now.

291
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,360
Good luck.
