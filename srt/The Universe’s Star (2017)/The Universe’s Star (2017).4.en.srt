1
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,320
Ta-da.

2
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,420
It's not that I'm scared. I just don't like the dark.

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,250
It needs to be dark to see the stars.

4
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,320
There are so many things you don't like.

5
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,420
You don't look like it in here.

6
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,390
Can't you do things you want,

7
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,950
eat foods that you like, and smile once in a while?

8
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,420
I'm sure your mom is watching from above.

9
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,790
I mean it.

10
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,820
It isn't over just because you can't see them.

11
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,790
The stars are there during the day even if you can't see them.

12
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,650
That's enough.

13
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,720
You know everything.

14
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:29,590
Stay still.

15
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,390
This very moment

16
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,290
When I am with you

17
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,490
I wish

18
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,850
Time would stop

19
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,790
I wish I could be

20
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,750
A star that protects you

21
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,720
Even if it is from a place

22
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,920
Where you cannot see me

23
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,990
A star that shines during the day

24
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,820
A star that protects you

25
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,550
Even if you can't see me

26
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,620
Even if you can't see me

27
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,620
A star that shines during the day

28
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,050
A star that protects you

29
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,120
Even if you can't see me

30
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,120
Even if you can't see me

31
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,750
Hi.

32
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,090
No, it's almost done.

33
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,590
Set it up for me.

34
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,890
Do you want to play Red Light, Green Light with me?

35
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,460
Red light, green light, one, two, three.

36
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,890
Red light, green light, one, two, three.

37
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,320
Just one minute.

38
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:40,320
So you don't lose your way

39
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,790
When you are tired

40
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,920
A star that shines during the day

41
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,650
A star that protects you

42
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,490
Even if you can't see me

43
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,190
Even if you can't see me

44
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,890
A star that shines during the day

45
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,350
A star that protects you

46
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,120
Even if you can't see me

47
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,920
Even if you can't see me

48
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,320
I am

49
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,520
A star that protects you

50
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,790
Even if you can't see me

51
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,220
I will not forget you

52
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,150
Is she buying the drinks or making them?

53
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,620
She'll be right back.

54
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,960
Whatever!

55
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:43,720
That's it. Woo Joo, that was awesome.

56
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,220
Where did that sentiment come from?

57
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,090
You can't write a quality song with fake emotions.

58
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,190
What? Fake?

59
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,050
He was able to do this thanks to his fangirl.

60
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,090
Hey.

61
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,220
Hey. Are you dating that girl?

62
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,190
Come on, now.

63
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,090
How could a person date an ATM? Right, Woo Joo?

64
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:06,120
Right? I don't think she's right in the head.

65
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,890
Seriously. You acted so cold and aloof,

66
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,220
but your standards are lower than I expected.

67
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,620
If she's a fangirl, she must've been easy.

68
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,620
She'd come and go as you say,

69
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,720
and she's too stupid to play hard to get and probably gave everything.

70
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,690
Hey, where are you going?

71
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,990
Let go of me.

72
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,820
- Hey! - Darn it.

73
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,090
Forget today's recording ever happened.

74
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,920
Hey. Hey!

75
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,090
I won't make excuses.

76
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,320
I did use you.

77
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,620
But think about it.

78
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,190
You probably...

79
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,820
don't really like me.

80
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,150
You like the idea of liking me.

81
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,420
I'm a big jerk and a coward.

82
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,720
I may not...

83
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,690
be as awesome as you think.

84
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:46,420
Still, I know you better than anything else in the world.

85
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,820
How would you know...

86
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,590
when even I don't know?

87
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,350
(First Kiss)

88
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,350
I'm going crazy.

89
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,420
Did I go too far?

90
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,790
How humiliating.

91
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,460
How humiliating.

92
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,420
What's her problem?

93
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,990
She said she liked me.

94
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,190
Hey, you said you like me.

95
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,350
What's your problem?

96
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,190
Were you manipulating me?

97
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,920
I will protect you forever.

98
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,820
I love you.

99
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,590
I will protect you forever.

100
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,220
I love you.

101
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,220
(Chun Gil)

102
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,820
Mr. Uhm is saying he'll sue you.

103
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,620
He even scheduled a tour in Southeast Asia.

104
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,190
It's so obvious. He's afraid you'll start dating.

105
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,350
Did you, by any chance,

106
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,820
sell a necklace with my face on it?

107
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,020
Not just a necklace.

108
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,520
You were a hit the year you made your debut,

109
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,220
so there were figurines, pillows, pastries,

110
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:30,320
and Mr. Uhm got a huge caricature of you made and put it...

111
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,420
in his sign for his noodle place and did well.

112
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,520
Noodles?

113
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,460
Can I get it now?

114
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,520
Woo Joo Noodles?

115
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,620
No. The necklace.

116
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,620
The necklace was a limited edition.

117
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,190
It was probably made in China to save cost. How can we get one?

118
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,460
Then do you remember my first fan letter?

119
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,190
Remember? It was a girl who gave it to me with a rabbit stuffed animal.

120
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,460
Wow. You remember things like that?

121
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,520
No.

122
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,890
Anyway, tell him if he sues, I'll counter sue.

123
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,790
I mean, noodles?

124
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:20,920
Fine.

125
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,990
But Woo Joo, what will you do with the title song?

126
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,520
(Chun Gil)

127
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,120
This is ridiculous. Do you think this is a joke?

128
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,420
She's a total newbie.

129
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,120
Don't be nervous.

130
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,920
Do you have an instrumental version of this?

131
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,020
Yes.

132
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,820
Isn't that your first album?

133
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:26,450
Is my heart racing because of you or am I just in a good mood?

134
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:33,720
My feelings keep getting ahead of myself and making me lose control

135
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:40,590
I wish I wouldn't hold back

136
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:47,320
I would take a step closer to you and quietly shine on you

137
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:53,520
From the first moment I saw you, I knew

138
00:12:55,050 --> 00:13:00,950
It was like we had spent many years together

139
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:06,190
These are my shiniest moments

140
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,220
Because I am with you

141
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,450
I am drawn to you

142
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,620
From the first moment I saw you

143
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,990
Are you okay?

144
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,890
Can you hear me?

145
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,090
Good job.

146
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,120
That was good.

147
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,120
We'll start the recording now.

148
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,120
(Dream World Admission Ticket)

149
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,050
So, you mistook someone else for Woo Joo because of his song?

150
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,890
Yes.

151
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,220
I don't even know myself.

152
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,820
Who am I to protect someone else?

153
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,320
I was mistaken...

154
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,820
and liked him...

155
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,120
although we weren't destined to be together.

156
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,120
Do you even want to know?

157
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,050
You found out everything about Woo Joo,

158
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,050
but you never cared to find out...

159
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,690
who you were before you died.

160
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,420
It's not that I didn't want to know,

161
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,320
but I was afraid to find out.

162
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:37,320
What if I was a nobody that no one would even remember?

163
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,050
Then you can ask someone who does remember.

164
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,590
Your true destiny.

165
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,520

(Kim Ha Na)

(Car accident, Died at hospital)

169
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,150
They should've wilted a while ago, but they're still healthy.

170
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,750
The water is clean, too.

171
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,090
I'm sorry for not visiting often,

172
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,990
but I have...

173
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,850
something to tell you today.

174
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,490
She lost a lot of weight since she's in a coma.

175
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,720
She's barely just hanging on.

176
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,950
The ER must be very busy.

177
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,920
Aren't you being too attentive just because she's Mr. Goo's patient?

178
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,590
You even permitted flowers in the room.

179
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,590
What do you mean? I'm just checking on her...

180
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,950
while I'm here anyway.

181
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,720
I saw you replace the water in the vase, too.

182
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,850
Whatever. I go on blind dates every weekend. I need to get married.

183
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,250
Right.

184
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,250
Mr. Goo.

185
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,490
You can't have flowers in the patient's room.

186
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,220
Some patients may be allergic.

187
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:10,320
Dr. Yun, when do you get off today?

188
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,790
Soon. In a few minutes.

189
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,450
Why?

190
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,620
Thank you for looking after her all the time. Okay, then.

191
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,150
Your shoelace... is untied.

192
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:47,350
Dr. Yun. You are too obvious.

193
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,890
- I am? About what? - Don't you know?

194
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:53,590
You smile so much whenever you see him.

195
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,620
If you don't want it to show,

196
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,290
you should smile like that for us, too.

197
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,620
When... When did I do that?

198
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:21,150
(What are you doing?)

199
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,620
What are you doing?

200
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,620
I'm doing something.

201
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,790
(I doing something.)

202
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,250
I have something to ask...

203
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,620
(I have)

204
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,420
If you don't answer right away,

205
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,450
I'll confiscate your phone.

206
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,120
I'll come pick it up, so let's meet.

207
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,620
(I'll come pick it up, so let's meet.)

208
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,920
(Tomorrow)

209
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,490
What's this?

210
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,090
Tomorrow, I'll drop it off with your manager.

211
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,950
What does this mean?

212
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,520
Is she playing hard to get? With me?

213
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,020
This will not do.

214
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,790
Why...

215
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,750
did you act like you didn't recognize me?

216
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,990
The car accident from seven years ago.

217
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,720
You did everything you could...

218
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,220
to save me back then, too.

219
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,420
Right?

220
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,420
Right?

221
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,220
I couldn't...

222
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,550
thank you back then.

223
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,150
What was I like?

224
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,290
What was my name?

225
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,220
Do you know...

226
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,050
my family?

227
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,290
(Scene of the Accident)

228
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:35,890
(Dream World Admission Ticket)

229
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,250
I'll tell you everything.

230
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:58,520
Okay. I'll wait there.

231
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,050
Fire. Fire.

232
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,050
Fire in building 41.

233
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,520
Everyone, head out.

234
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,090
Quickly.

235
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,290
(On air)

236
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,820
Today, we are with Woo Joo,

237
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:25,390
the best singer-songwriter who made a comeback with his seventh album.

238
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,250
First, this is from 052.

239
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,920
"Do you have a favorite food?"

240
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,020
Well, I'm not into food.

241
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,320
Maybe black bean noodles?

242
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,120
I see. Okay, 0408.

243
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:47,990
"If you got a girlfriend, where would you want to go?"

244
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,320
I don't know.

245
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,390
Maybe an amusement park.

246
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,620
I like this question.

247
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,020
The ID is "Forever Woo Joo's fan".

248
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,820
It says he's a guy fan.

249
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:12,250
"You haven't had a single scandal for seven years since your debut."

250
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,190
"But this song is so sweet, it makes me nervous."

251
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,420
"You didn't start liking someone, did you?" Is what he asks.

252
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,550
I am very curious as well.

253
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:31,420
Naturally, it's for the fans.

254
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:36,890
I can hear your countless fans cheering, even from here.

255
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,390
You tend to be very curious about someone you like.

256
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,450
We are accepting questions...

257
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:44,490
for Woo Joo on our bulletin board.

258
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,750
Text them to us now before you miss your chance.

259
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,550
We will be back shortly.

260
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,120
- Hey. Did you see? - No.

261
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,890
- Who? - Chun Gil.

262
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,420
I told her to stay and eat with us, but she said she has plans.

263
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,290
Whatever. Who cares?

264
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,750
Wow.

265
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,820
She's a total player. She left the time and place.

266
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,090
"Dream World at 5pm."

267
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,190
Are you insane?

268
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,450
How could you accept this just because she gave it to you?

269
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,290
I heard you told her to return it.

270
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,590
Aren't you happy?

271
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,020
You're topping the charts right now.

272
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,990
Every chart. You're killing them all.

273
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,690
You can't go back in. You've done enough.

274
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:08,290
What do you mean, enough? My men are still in there.

275
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,820
Stop it.

276
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,920
Give me to me.

277
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,390
You should try to resist. These are bad for you.

278
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:57,120
Give them to me. I can't handle my schedule if I leave without them.

279
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,890
I heard your song.

280
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,890
You're dating her, aren't you?

281
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,920
That nonsense again?

282
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,820
Later.

283
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,120
She's so brave. Maybe it's because she's young.

284
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:12,520
I'm envy her courage to be able to say she likes you.

285
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,950
That's right. It's just her.

286
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,520
She follows me around and has no table manners.

287
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,090
Last time, she fed me a lettuce wrap.

288
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,050
Anyway, everything she does is strange.

289
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:30,150
She's a fangirl that runs to me whenever she sees me, that's all.

290
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,390
I was right. You can't fool your childhood friend.

291
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,720
Should I diagnose you?

292
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,620
Look at your face right now.

293
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,290
You're smiling while talking about her.

294
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:50,220
Code blue. ER. Code blue. ER.

295
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,290
Later.

296
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,320
Ha Na.

297
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,450
Ha Na?

298
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,850
Where are you going now?

299
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:30,820
Why do you care? Mind your own business.

300
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,750
There you go again. Don't do that to your sneakers.

301
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:37,350
Fine, so give it a rest. I'm leaving.

302
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,120
Goodness.

303
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,020
I should've looked back just once.

304
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,490
I should've said bye with a smile.

305
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,290
I didn't know...

306
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,520
that would be our last moment.

307
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,850
- Clear the way! - Move!

308
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,550
Here.

309
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,990
(VIP Wing)

310
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,550
(Gallery)

311
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:26,290
Hey. All the fans are back. The concert...

312
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:27,820
is completely sold out.

313
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,490
Yes. You're back. Welcome back. Fantastic!

314
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,750
Hi. Don't yell and listen. I need to go abroad for work again.

315
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,820
Hello?

316
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,450
What should we do for dinner?

317
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,450
Just eat in the airport lounge.

318
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:43,320
Let's get something good.

319
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,620
- But... - Hey.

320
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,690
- Woo Joo! - Hey.

321
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,790
- Where are you going? - Woo Joo, where are you going?

322
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,450
Seriously. Get out.

323
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,220
Be careful. Are you okay?

324
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,290
- Be careful. - I almost died.

325
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:55,750
Get it.

326
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,520
That one.

327
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,620
- Lower it. - That's it.

328
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:02,220
That's it. Over there.

329
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,490
That one.

330
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,450
- Get it. - Get it.

331
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:07,990
- Win. - Get it.

332
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,620
Get it.

333
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,450
(Woo Joo)

334
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,090
Isn't that Woo Joo?

335
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,850
There. Now, you got what you wanted.

336
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:40,390
Are you hungry? Is there anything you want to eat?

337
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,520
Should we go somewhere? Is there anywhere you want to go?

338
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:48,590
There's so much I want to know about you.

339
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,120
Now that I see you,

340
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,290
I feel like I can breathe again.

341
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,220
It's Woo Joo.

342
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,590
Is it really him?

343
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,490
Oh, my gosh.

344
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,620
Since we don't know in...

345
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,450
when our final moment will be.

346
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,620
(Star of the Universe II)

347
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,150
That isn't love. You're just doing as you wish.

348
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:40,220
What's wrong with doing what I want?

349
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,490
Did she go knowing he'll die because of her?

350
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,790
The stars may look like they are disappearing.

351
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:48,750
However, they aren't disappearing even if you don't see them,
