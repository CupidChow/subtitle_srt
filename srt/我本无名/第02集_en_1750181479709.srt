1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The whole universe shines because of me

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,560
What if it's dangerous again?

4
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,040
I can't let him go.

5
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,640
I'm leaving.

6
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,000
Don't go.

7
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,240
Close the door first.

8
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,520
I have something to tell you.

9
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,960
Can you stay tonight?

10
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,880
Can't we buy your time?

11
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,440
No.

12
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,160
No?

13
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,080
Bye.

14
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,200
Look at me.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,280
I'm Song Yi Ran,

16
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,680
a female star.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,640
So?

18
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,760
So,

19
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,600
I mean,

20
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,520
I don't have much chance

21
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,480
to win the competition.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,560
Are you sure you want to refuse?

23
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,960
I...

24
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,760
The price is not

25
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,200
that important to me.

26
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,560
Actually, I have

27
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,160
many industries that are open.

28
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,080
It's mainly because I'm a person

29
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,480
who is good at planning.

30
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,480
So, I think

31
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,160
my time is a little bit expensive.

32
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,200
Dad.

33
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,320
Did Song Yi Ran cancel the contract?

34
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:34,920
It's okay.

35
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,640
Anyway, I've been chasing after them for a long time.

36
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,920
I don't believe they'll run away.

37
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,560
Hello?

38
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,640
My plane is about to take off.

39
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,720
My eyes are clear,

40
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,720
so you have to wear this

41
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,920
in my house,

42
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,760
in pink.

43
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,920
Even if you force me with a knife,

44
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,800
I can't wear this.

45
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,280
Yes.

46
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,040
It suits you.

47
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,520
A drone?

48
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,120
It must be Mr. Li.

49
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,040
He asked someone to take a picture of me.

50
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,480
It seems that someone has been taking pictures of you for a long time.

51
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,760
There.

52
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,440
There.

53
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,120
There.

54
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,120
I thought it was our community's property.

55
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,240
I was surprised.

56
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,480
So the doctor was taking pictures of me.

57
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,920
You've been taken pictures by paparazzi.

58
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,040
Do you want to take a picture of a paparazzi?

59
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,800
So many paparazzi and drone.

60
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,200
Your family can start live broadcasts.

61
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,640
No wonder Mr. Li is so hardworking.

62
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,960
I'm going to the hospital.

63
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,800
I'll go to the hospital.

64
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,920
I'll be back in a few minutes.

65
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,320
My wife, Li Tianhao,

66
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,640
no one can do it.

67
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,080
No one can do it!

68
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,680
I want to provide you with a job.

69
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,520
I have a job.

70
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,520
With your ability,

71
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,920
you shouldn't just pay a price.

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,200
My job is to be my bodyguard.

73
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:21,880
I'm not interested.

74
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,720
500,000 per month.

75
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,400
It's great to have money.

76
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,160
I make a lot of money a month.

77
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,120
Why do I feel that she's familiar?

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
After watching her video,

79
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,600
I feel stronger.

80
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,600
Even my maid knows her.

81
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,520
Is my amnesia related to her?

82
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,120
Okay.

83
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,480
I promise you.

84
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,680
When will you start working?

85
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,800
No need.

86
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,000
Just stay at my house.

87
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,840
You're my bodyguard.

88
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,080
Bodyguard?

89
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,040
Wait.

90
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,480
I'm not used to

91
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,080
sleeping with others.

92
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,560
You live with them.

93
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,760
Not sleep with them.

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,640
Dad.

95
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,320
You can really do it.

96
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,360
That bastard is living with Song Yiran.

97
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,440
I've heard it.

98
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,360
Son.

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,920
Calm down.

100
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,960
Do a back-up.

101
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,800
Find out the weakness of Ye Wuming.

102
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,680
Yiran,

103
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,440
he's not you yet.

104
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,120
Go play a game

105
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,600
and play with them.

106
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,320
Get up.

107
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,440
It hurts.

108
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,840
I'm sorry.

109
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,240
I didn't mean it.

110
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,560
To be honest,

111
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,480
I can't control my right hand.

112
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,800
Before I wake up every morning,

113
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,160
it starts to shake.

114
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,480
Don't feel bad.

115
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,320
We're watching you.

116
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,640
Lilav again.

117
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,440
Got something to do at the modal office.

118
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,160
Dad.

119
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,800
Yi Ran,

120
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,240
what do you mean?

121
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,680
I want to ask Mr. Li

122
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,360
what you mean.

123
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,000
You want to force me to renew the contract

124
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,400
and play the yin and the yang without agreeing.

125
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,640
You're wronged.

126
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,360
You're wronged.

127
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,920
You're wronged.

128
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,080
You're wronged.

129
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,920
You're wronged.

130
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,840
Am I that kind of person?

131
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,600
We didn't do this.

132
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,840
Did you offend someone else?

133
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,960
Jin Zhu?

134
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,120
Big Brother?

135
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,320
I don't have Jin Zhu.

136
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,720
I don't have a big brother.

137
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,720
I only have a

138
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,720
little bodyguard.

139
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,800
Now you're a star.

140
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,160
You need to learn to be proud.

141
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,440
What will Tianhao think

142
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,880
about this?

143
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,120
I can't be Mr. Li's girlfriend.

144
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,840
Besides, I have a boyfriend.

145
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,160
Boyfriend?

146
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,520
Who?

147
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,600
Him.

148
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,720
Yes, I'm his boyfriend.

149
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,160
You're his boyfriend?

150
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,480
You're lying.

151
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,760
You're just a guy.

152
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,560
I heard it all at home yesterday.

153
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,920
I heard it all.

154
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,280
I'll be back soon.

155
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,720
Wait for the hot search on Weibo.

156
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,880
Song Yi Ran!

157
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,720
Song Yi Ran!

158
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,480
Damn you!

159
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,480
Third Brother.

160
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,920
Brother.

161
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,560
Brother, I'm sorry.

162
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
Let go of my hand.

163
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,360
What?

164
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,280
I told you to let go of my hand!

165
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,840
You want to save your brother, right?

166
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,080
I'll beat you up.

167
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,560
You won't fight back, right?

168
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,360
Li Tianhao.

169
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,520
Don't meddle in men's affairs.

170
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,600
Stay out of it.

171
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,800
You want me to stay out of it?

172
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,640
Go though it.

173
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,920
You're noile, too.

174
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,560
Come on this way.

175
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,240
Aren't you a managed man?

176
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,920
Make your hand stand out, make your hand stand out!

177
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,860
Then don¡¯t fuck with me again

178
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,360
Ok

179
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,640
Tell me

180
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,680
Where is my förchon injury?

181
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,300
Ok

182
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,620
So I am the one who know where the forger is

183
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,620
If you want to tie me up,

184
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,620
you have to tie your hands and feet.

185
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,620
But it's of no use.

186
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,620
From now on,

187
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,620
you are not allowed to provoke Song Yi Ran.

188
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,620
Don't provoke me and my brother.

189
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,620
Otherwise, I'll let you

190
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,620
take this flower ring.

191
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,620
Let's go.

192
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,620
Hurry up.

193
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,620
Hurry up.

194
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,620
Press my feet.

195
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,620
I ran into a mirror.

196
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,620
When did I suffer this grievance?

197
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,620
What should I do?

198
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,620
Ask Old Seven.

199
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,620
Old Seven likes to ask what to do.

200
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,620
Old Seven is so stubborn.

201
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,620
He's so stubborn.

202
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,620
He's so stubborn.

203
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,620
He's so stubborn.

204
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,620
He's so stubborn.

205
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,620
He's so stubborn.

206
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,620
Brother.

207
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,620
Brother.

208
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,620
Look at him.

209
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,620
He's so stubborn.

210
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,620
Did you lose the order yesterday?

211
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,620
A lot.

212
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,620
I don't know why.

213
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,620
He said Song Yi Ran was going to be his girlfriend.

214
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,620
I'm telling the truth.

215
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,620
You don't believe it.

216
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,620
Brother.

217
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,620
You have a mirror.

218
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,620
If you don't have one,

219
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,620
you can use the bathroom.

220
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,620
The bathroom.

221
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,620
You're so stubborn.

222
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,740
Five today.

223
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,740
Five today.

224
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,740
Five today.

225
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,740
Five today.

226
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,740
Five today.

227
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,740
Five today.

228
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,740
Five today.

229
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,740
Five today.

230
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,740
After counting down on you,

231
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:25,060
I think it's

232
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,500
It's really like Song Yi Ran.

233
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,300
Brother,

234
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,220
this is a hot search.

235
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,700
Brother He, please take care.

236
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,460
Wait a minute.

237
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,100
Wait for me.

238
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,540
Song Yi Ran's official necklace

239
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,620
is hard to hide from the sword.

240
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,660
I'm telling you it's too fake.

241
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,340
How can anyone believe you?

242
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,180
Anyway, from tomorrow on,

243
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,220
we'll act as a couple.

244
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,860
I'll make up for you

245
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,980
with a fake couple contract later.

246
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,300
No.

247
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,100
I have no obligation to pretend to be your boyfriend.

248
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,140
Besides,

249
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,820
I'm a man of principle.

250
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,420
Ye Wu Ming,

251
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,980
think about it.

252
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,180
I asked you to act as my boyfriend

253
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,820
because I'm trying to make you feel better.

254
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,940
What can you do to me?

255
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,140
Brother,

256
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,860
I'm telling you,

257
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,780
you're so famous now.

258
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,260
The people in the old man's group are so jealous.

259
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,100
Not only them,

260
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,260
all the men in the world now believe you.

261
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,580
Is it so famous to act as Song Yi Ran's boyfriend?

262
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,300
No.

263
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,860
I can't let him see it.

264
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,220
Are you selling your weapon?

265
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,220
Yes.

266
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,700
Kiss him,

267
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,380
and you'll sell yourself to me.

268
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,340
Kiss me.

269
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,180
What can you do without me?

270
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,540
Don't do it to me.

271
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,700
I'm sorry, brother.

272
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,100
I didn't see it.

273
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:08,180
OK.

274
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,300
Seven,

275
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,700
do you know what you did wrong?

276
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,460
I'll go.

277
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,460
Tomorrow,

278
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,740
I'm going to meet Song Yiran here.

279
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,180
Can you do that?

280
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:40,900
Yes.

281
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:41,980
And...

282
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,180
If you can't find the bank card,

283
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,900
just let it disappear.

284
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,380
Can you do that?

285
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,420
Yes.

286
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,540
I'll go.

287
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,860
It's so remote.

288
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,140
Why is it here?

289
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,700
I don't know.

290
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,780
They told me to change it.

291
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,020
But no one is here.

292
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,700
Britney.

293
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:58,420
This is the passing and 해요 of ITC

294
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:17,060
I will be mature and be persistent
