1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The whole universe shines because of me

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,600
Only you?

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,800
One more.

5
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,600
I'll break his finger.

6
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,000
Senior, Mr. Ma,

7
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,000
wait here.

8
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,000
I'll go in alone.

9
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,960
The

11
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,200
Yi Ran.

12
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,200
Ye Wu Miao,

13
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,800
I know you're good at fighting.

14
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
If you dare to fight,

15
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,800
he'll go down.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Listen to his order.

17
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
Let Yi Ran go.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,400
If you have any conditions, just say it.

19
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,800
It's a good thing to talk to a smart person.

20
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,400
It seems that this little star

21
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,600
is very important to you.

22
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,600
I'm talking about the point.

23
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,600
Sign this contract.

24
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,400
Give me the 20 billion.

25
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,400
Sign it.

26
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,600
Take her away.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
If you don't sign it,

28
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,800
I'll take you down.

29
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,600
I'll sign it.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,200
You only know that I'm competing with you for 20 billion.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,200
But you don't know

32
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,200
that 20 billion is for her.

33
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
20 billion?

34
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
Isn't 20 billion better than a woman?

35
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,200
20 billion?

36
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,800
You have everything with 20 billion.

37
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,400
Yi Ran.

38
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Yi Ran.

39
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,800
Yi Ran.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yi Ran.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yi Ran.

42
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,200
Wu Er Ping.

43
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,200
Don't be afraid.

44
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
I'm here.

45
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,800
They're a team.

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Miss Song,

47
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,600
I'm really sorry.

48
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,200
I didn't tell you the truth.

49
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,600
I asked you to cooperate in this play.

50
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,600
Play?

51
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,400
For the sake of friendship,

52
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,200
I gave up interest without hesitation.

53
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,800
Congratulations to Ye Wu Ming.

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,400
You passed the last test.

55
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,200
Junior,

56
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,400
this is the most important part of the test.

57
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,200
The most important thing about the successor of the Eight Immortal Sect is the character.

58
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,600
You took over the contract of 20 billion.

59
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,200
If you hesitate,

60
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,000
the contract will be invalid.

61
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Mr. Feng, Mr. Zhu,

62
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,800
what do you think?

63
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,400
Ye Wu Ming did pass the test.

64
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Mr. Ye,

65
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,200
we admit that you passed the test.

66
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,000
Greetings, Senior Brother.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,400
You call me Senior Brother?

68
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
You look much older than me.

69
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
I'm a disciple of the Eight Immortal Sect who is abroad.

70
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,600
Now your identity has been confirmed.

71
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,200
Of course you're the Senior Brother.

72
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,800
Please allow me

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
to follow everything.

74
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,800
No, no, no.

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,600
You can follow me if you want.

76
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
But don't call me Senior Brother anymore.

77
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,200
Mr. Ma,

78
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,800
when can I use the 100 million?

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Anytime.

80
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
The penalty of 100 million has been passed.

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,400
The previous thing was a deal.

82
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,800
From today on,

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I have nothing to do with you.

84
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,800
You took the money?

85
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,000
For a playboy,

86
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,400
you took 100 million to protect her.

87
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,400
Is it worth it?

88
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,000
First, she is not a playboy.

89
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,800
Secondly,

90
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,800
is it worth my words?

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,200
Don't be touched.

92
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,200
I haven't said I'll take the money.

93
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,800
You took 200 million.

94
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,800
You took 100 million.

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,200
Are you planning to

96
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,400
send a drug dealer?

97
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Mr. Li,

98
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,600
people are not good enough to swallow their own image.

99
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,400
You have a big appetite.

100
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,800
I'm afraid I'll choke you to death.

101
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,200
I'm not a snake.

102
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,000
You may not be a star.

103
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,200
Besides,

104
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,400
you dare not make things big.

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Mr. Li,

106
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,800
as the biggest shareholder of the company,

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,200
I have a word to you.

108
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,600
Sometimes,

109
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,200
you have to learn to let go.

110
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,000
You can take it when you see it.

111
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,600
Mr. Su,

112
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm doing this for the benefit of the company.

113
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,000
Although you are the biggest shareholder of the company,

114
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,400
you don't have the right to make decisions.

115
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,200
The risk is greater than the profit.

116
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,200
Although I don't have the right to make decisions,

117
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,600
if I withdraw shares from your company,

118
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
do you know what it means?

119
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,000
You have the right to make decisions for your own.

120
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,520
All my colleagues

121
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,000
have their own standards.

122
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
Mr. Su,

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,600
tell me,

124
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,560
is there something that Mr. Li

125
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,800
wants me to do instead?

126
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,280
If I become a?"

127
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,680
Mingtian, Governors this post,

128
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,920
send an issued note to Fish Village for matchmaking box with cards of 50,000 aoa arm.

129
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,760
Before opening the box,

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,360
have Yuanyuan say herself,

131
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Correct on both leading and revoked justice.

132
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:01,880
Yuanyuan!

133
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,800
Mr. Ye.

134
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,560
Such a big office.

135
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,800
Is it comfortable?

136
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,040
You did it as my car.

137
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,040
Fine.

138
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,640
Done.

139
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,540
Congratulations, A Song Yi Ran.

140
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,800
From today onwards,

141
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,000
you're a real nobody

142
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,680
and an

143
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,240
I'm still your bodyguard.

144
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,800
Is that how you like to be a bodyguard?

145
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,920
I like you.

146
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,960
People

147
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,640
must be a little secretive.

148
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,520
But since I've officially broken off the contract with Mr. Li,

149
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,120
I don't think I need to be a bodyguard anymore.

150
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,640
No.

151
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,960
Although Li is stupid,

152
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,280
his father is hard to deal with.

153
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,640
I think he was too polite to you before.

154
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,200
He will definitely change in the future.

155
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,200
Come on.

156
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,200
Think about it.

157
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,120
You were his artist before.

158
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,000
You still have a bad credit card in your hand.

159
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,720
Maybe

160
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,640
you can kill him.

161
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,240
Really?

162
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,200
I'm so scared.

163
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:31,880
Don't worry.

164
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,640
I'm a professional bodyguard.

165
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,040
I think you're right.

166
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,960
Then please continue to protect me.

167
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,440
Then I have to think about it.

168
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,840
Let's have dinner together tonight.

169
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,000
Mr. Man says

170
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,480
this is our family's last meal.

171
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,160
Ms. Ye will be our guest tonight.

172
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,520
I'm home.

173
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,320
Come here.

174
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,600
It's not Mr. Ye's place.

175
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,760
It's not Mr. Ye's level.

176
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,440
It can be my stomach.

177
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,240
You're so massageful.

178
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,040
Move it.

179
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,920
This place smells good.

180
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,840
I usually come here.

181
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,760
Ladies.

182
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,720
Donation.

183
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,520
Guests.

184
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,640
Coupleै

185
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:14,840

187
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,620
You two are

188
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,360
lovers?

189
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,600
Boss, you have a good eye.

190
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,600
We're a couple.

191
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,560
This is it.

192
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,360
Okay.

193
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,760
A couple set meal.

194
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,640
Are you too overbearing?

195
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,320
I'm overbearing.

196
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,680
Girls like me.

197
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,360
You're so ugly.

198
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,240
I don't want others to think I'm a loser.

199
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,680
No matter what others think of you,

200
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,000
just be happy.

201
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,440
You're right.

202
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,280
Anyway, I want to

203
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,240
take more acting lessons.

204
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,560
I want to make up for the past one

205
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,520
and shut others' mouths.

206
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,040
Listen, I'm not in a hurry to pay you back.

207
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,560
But you have to pay me back, right?

208
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,400
Here comes the couple set meal.

209
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,200
Thank you.

210
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,080
It looks delicious.

211
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,000
Hurry up.

212
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,720
I'm not hungry.

213
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,480
You eat first.

214
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,600
Are you afraid of being photographed?

215
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,920
Of course.

216
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,920
If my fans know I'm a meat-eating animal,

217
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,640
I'll be ruined.

218
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,080
Why didn't you think of it?

219
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,040
What if your fans like the real you?

220
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,800
Hurry up.

221
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,320
Hurry up.

222
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,320
Or else all the Geraldine is warning you.

223
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,800
I don't want results.

224
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,200
lack of experience

225
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,120
In the company

226
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,240
You keep saying you eat but have a bad appetite?

227
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,160
Come on, quick, quick

228
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,920
I need to have Opera Ten

229
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,280
I'm not eating.

230
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:42,880
No.

231
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,920
I won't eat if you don't eat.

232
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,120
Why isn't the beer here yet?

233
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,960
I'll pour it myself.

234
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,600
A healthy life and a beautiful morning.

235
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,000
It's a bit hypocritical.

236
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,720
Those on Weibo are just people.

237
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,840
People, you know?

238
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,400
They're all fake. You believe that?

239
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,520
I think

240
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,320
one should be reasonable.

241
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,280
You can't be like the usual.

242
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,080
You're just creating characters.

243
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,600
Then why can't I create

244
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,880
a sincere character?

245
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,280
I'm not that tired.

246
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,560
If those fans

247
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,240
don't like you because you eat meat,

248
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,040
then they only like your personality.

249
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,440
It has nothing to do with you.

250
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,520
Just one bite.

251
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Wang Ming, thank you.

252
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,760
Birthday, Keyiks.

253
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,760
I'm the last one to deliver it.

254
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,920
Do you want to leave now?

255
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,440
You're already on my diet.

256
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,380
How can a Milwaukee Fried Chicken

257
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,040
taste as good as this in showbiz?

258
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,160
Showbiz does no Parent's Day.

259
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,360
Do you have time to prepare for it?

260
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,520
Birthday, Keyiks,

261
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,920
you're raising a baby.

262
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,680
Then…

263
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,480
words never lines don't contradict each other

264
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,780
you have gone out so long

265
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,400
I

266
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,680
raise your hand

267
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,640
how about William

268
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,120
I

269
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,400
take it

270
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,240
you

271
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:12,120
take it

272
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,200
good

273
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:24,200
Life won't ever be the same without you

274
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,200
Please pay the round

275
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,200
Once I save the world

276
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,200
I will find my heart

277
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:53,200
I hate being alone

278
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,200
I hit you when you slept

279
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,200
I liked to sleep when you in dominated

280
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,200
but now you hateU

281
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
If you know

282
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Say we're sorrows

283
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,840
Change another one.

284
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,320
Be ambiguous with me.

285
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,000
Get out of my way.

286
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,240
I'm ambiguous with you.

287
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,800
I'm joking with you.

288
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,920
Don't be angry.

289
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,280
I'm sorry.

290
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,880
You just want to say sorry?

291
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,840
You're not sincere at all.

292
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,600
You can't make up for my hurt heart.

293
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,360
Then tell me.

294
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,840
How can I make up for it?

295
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,920
I'm sorry.

296
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,600
How about this?

297
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,840
I've been thinking about

298
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,440
the rival drama between me and the leading actor for a long time.

299
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,320
I can't control my emotions.

300
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,840
It's action drama.

301
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,560
Take this opportunity

302
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,560
to practice for me.

303
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,000
Action drama?

304
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,880
Okay.

305
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,200
How can I cooperate with you?

306
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,000
I'll think about it.

307
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,840
Close your eyes first.

308
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,680
Stand still.

309
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,640
Feel the environment.

310
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,560
Are you ready?
