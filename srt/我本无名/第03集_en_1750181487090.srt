1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The whole universe is shining because of me

2
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,040
Episode 17

3
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,680
The girl

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,200
Its myuzwen

5
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,480
Raspeople

6
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,040
There is someone

7
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,160
Cute

8
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,640
Director Lei

9
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,160
Is it Director Lei?

10
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,400
You hurt my mind

11
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,800
I want to make you happy

12
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,440
That's how you wanted me?

13
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,400
Director Lei

14
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,400
You're just trying to keep me safe?

15
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,400
Mr. Lei,

16
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,400
you're saying this now?

17
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,400
Don't you think it's ridiculous?

18
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,400
You still don't understand my humor.

19
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Yan Yan,

20
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,400
the contract is right behind you.

21
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Sign it.

22
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
We'll be the same as before, okay?

23
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,400
My attitude has already been very clear.

24
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
I can't make a false accusation against him.

25
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,400
Don't say it so dead.

26
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,400
Anything is valuable.

27
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,400
You can't buy it because you didn't pay the money in time.

28
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,400
Do you want to hear my sincerity?

29
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,400
No, I don't want to hear it.

30
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
No, you want to.

31
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Song Yi Ran,

32
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,400
don't forget how famous you are.

33
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,400
You were the one who coaxed me.

34
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
But after so many years,

35
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,400
I've also earned a lot of money for you.

36
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,400
I've already paid off my debt.

37
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,400
I still hope that

38
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,400
I can be more careful.

39
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,400
That's all.

40
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,400
Some things are spreading out.

41
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
It's not good for us.

42
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,400
What do you think?

43
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,400
It seems that I guessed it right.

44
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,400
You still keep that bank card.

45
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,400
I've already destroyed that bank card.

46
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,400
I've said it many times.

47
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,400
You signed the contract.

48
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
I believe it.

49
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,400
If you don't sign it,

50
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,400
every five minutes,

51
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,400
the place you stay will drop by one degree.

52
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,400
Now it's ten degrees below zero.

53
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
I'll see how long you can hold on.

54
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
I'll eat hot pot

55
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,400
and accompany you.

56
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,400
Yi Ran, don't be afraid.

57
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
Calm down.

58
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
There must be a way.

59
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,400
Yi Ran, you can't sleep.

60
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Yi Ran, you can't sleep.

61
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,400
I'm full.

62
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
How are you two enjoying yourselves?

63
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,400
It's twenty-three degrees below zero now.

64
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,400
Great.

65
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
I'm sleepy.

66
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
I'll let Qi keep an eye on me.

67
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,400
I'll go to sleep for a while.

68
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,400
You guys keep going.

69
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,400
It's twenty degrees below zero now.

70
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,400
I'll see how long they can hold on.

71
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,400
Stop moving.

72
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,400
You're not dead, are you?

73
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,400
Are you reminding me of something?

74
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,400
I felt a strong feeling,

75
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,400
so I went back.

76
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,240
I felt a strong

77
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,240
This kid is not hitting the car door, right?

78
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,400
Really can

79
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,000
If he can open this

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I eat noodles on the spot

81
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,760
This power is called

82
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,760
Goshan Big Bull

83
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,420
Go applying

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,860
Yiran

85
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,860
Yiran, you-re awake?

86
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,860
I was scared to death

87
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,700
Where is this?

88
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,460
Hospital

89
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,460
Did you forget that yesterday

90
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:10,540
your cold

91
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,740
car

92
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,300
Albert Fernstein

93
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,300
Until you fell as a kid

94
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,260
Hospital

95
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,260
I want to make up for it.

96
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,420
You're almost dead.

97
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,700
And you're still trying to make up for it?

98
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,540
Here, have some water.

99
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,100
Is it only you who can see me like this?

100
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,580
The big star.

101
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,620
What are you doing?

102
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,620
Get the script.

103
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,620
There's a very important play this afternoon.

104
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,940
I have to prepare it in advance.

105
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,900
I'll go and get it.

106
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,700
I'll go and get it.

107
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,740
I'll go and get it.

108
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,700
I'll go and get it.

109
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,700
I'll go and get it.

110
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,700
I'll go and get it.

111
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,700
I'll go and get it.

112
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,700
I'll go and get it.

113
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,700
I'll go and get it.

114
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,700
I'll go and get it.

115
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,340
If you don't say it, you're a regular.

116
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,180
Have you had breakfast?

117
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:58,700
Yes.

118
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,700
Where's Linda?

119
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,900
Mr. Yi Ran, our lounge is over here.

120
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,380
Over here.

121
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,060
Sister Yi Ran.

122
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,580
It's okay.

123
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,460
This is my agent, Lu Bingqing.

124
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,540
Sister.

125
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,420
Mr. Ling Long is here.

126
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,780
This woman is here to do something again.

127
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,780
Sister Ling Long.

128
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,700
Sister Yi Ran.

129
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,940
You can act as a sister.

130
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,460
You don't know how happy I am.

131
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,820
I've been looking forward to working with Sister Ling Long.

132
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,460
Sister, you're really a good sister.

133
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,940
Young, beautiful, and in good shape.

134
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,140
You really depend on your strength to make everyone like you.

135
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,700
Sister is the star.

136
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,380
Look at this full of collagen.

137
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,580
I'm envious.

138
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,100
Sister, let's go to the makeup.

139
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,580
How about it?

140
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,700
Yes, let's go to the makeup.

141
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,380
Over there.

142
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,660
Sister.

143
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,700
Sister.

144
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,300
You're a TV show star.

145
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,900
You've never done a big movie.

146
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,700
You're the number one in the world.

147
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,100
You can handle it, right?

148
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,260
You said you were here to get a promotion.

149
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,620
You changed to number two as soon as you joined the team.

150
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,420
Aren't you afraid that people will say you're a self-help star?

151
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,940
It sounds like you're not a self-help star.

152
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,660
But now everyone knows

153
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,460
that sister and the owner are having a fight.

154
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,660
If you don't tell them, they'll be sealed.

155
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,420
The contract you signed

156
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,980
is no different from selling yourself, right?

157
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,980
You...

158
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,900
Excuse me.

159
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,220
Sister has such a good skin.

160
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,540
I have to take a closer look.

161
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,740
You're better.

162
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,940
Thank you, sister.

163
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,940
Sit down.

164
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,980
They don't seem to be in the right condition today.

165
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,660
Aren't they fine?

166
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,300
Okay.

167
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:03,740
Ten minutes.

168
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,620
Let's make up for ten minutes.

169
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,620
Director.

170
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,740
Over there.

171
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,900
Sister Yiran's new bodyguard.

172
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,660
How about she go and check?

173
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,020
I'll go and check.

174
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,940
I heard that Li Tianhao, the president,

175
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,700
is crazy about sister.

176
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,180
He wants to marry her.

177
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,660
I'm sorry.

178
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,020
Please don't talk nonsense.

179
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,220
It's not the turn of outsiders

180
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,220
to interrupt our conversation.

181
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,580
What's your name?

182
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,380
What are you doing?

183
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,580
Where do you live?

184
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,940
You're going to steal my house.

185
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,620
When did you come to this city?

186
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,140
It's none of your business.

187
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,060
Are you Ye?

188
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,420
Brother.

189
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,620
I've been looking for you for three years.

190
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,180
I finally found you.

191
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,060
Is she

192
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,740
giving me lines or...

193
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,540
What lines, brother?

194
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,380
I'm your favorite junior.

195
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,820
We're engaged.

196
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,540
You won't forget, right?

197
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,340
I don't know you.

198
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:06,740
What are you talking about?

199
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,860
Brother.

200
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,460
You're my brother.

201
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,700
Sister Linglong.

202
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,380
You haven't been able to get through the internet, right?

203
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,020
Wu Ming is my boyfriend now.

204
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,420
Come on.

205
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,860
Help me put on makeup.

206
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,580
He's your secret boyfriend on the Internet.

207
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,340
Yes.

208
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,340
I've finished my makeup.

209
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,260
Let's start the play.

210
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,100
It's getting cold outside.

211
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,620
Okay.

212
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,100
Help me take the script.

213
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,100
Okay.

214
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,220
I need to do my makeup too.

215
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,860
How's the play?

216
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,100
Director.

217
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,620
It's only five minutes.

218
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,780
It's normal for our two actresses

219
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,540
to make up for more than 40 minutes.

220
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,940
It's all for your good-looking.

221
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,900
That's right.

222
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,940
We've never

223
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,420
come out within half an hour

224
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,420
since we started shooting.

225
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,100
Everyone, be careful.

226
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,300
Hurry up and get in position.

227
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,020
Okay, director.

228
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,820
Miss Linglong.

229
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,940
Miss Yanran.

230
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,100
Have you read the script?

231
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,100
How about we

232
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,500
just follow the script?

233
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,380
No problem, director.

234
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,420
I have a question.

235
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,700
I think the script is written.

236
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,620
How will the relationship develop?

237
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,740
The script can't be changed.

238
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,580
You can't change it.

239
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,820
I can't act either.

240
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,460
Didn't you tell me later

241
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,340
that the character can't be destroyed?

242
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,420
I think we should just follow the script.

243
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,500
Really?

244
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,460
Then, director.

245
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,260
Let's just follow the script.

246
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,620
Let's go, sister.

247
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,820
Let's go to the concert.

248
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,020
What's going on?

249
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,540
I should just follow the script.

250
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,940
Senior, I'll send you the address.

251
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,220
Come to me anytime.

252
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,380
I'll tell you everything

253
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,740
before you lose your memory.

254
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,580
You're going to find Yue Linglong?

255
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,420
The biggest wish of the past three years

256
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,020
is to know who I am.

257
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,020
Who am I?

258
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,580
She said she can help me find my memory.

259
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,660
I understand.

260
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,540
You go.

261
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,540
I'm going.

262
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,340
This woman

263
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,940
is trying to get me.

264
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,540
No, I have to go and check.

265
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,100
Senior.

266
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,180
I'm sorry.

267
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:34,980
I didn't mean to

268
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,900
embarrass you.

269
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,500
I really can't remember you.

270
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,260
Master said

271
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,420
you're a martial artist

272
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,660
with a deep connection.

273
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,060
I called you here

274
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,740
to confirm something.

275
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,620
He is really my Senior Wu Ming.

276
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,060
Didn't you say you'll take me to find my memory?

277
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,820
How?

278
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,020
I'll tell you when you change.

279
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,140
What are you doing?

280
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,900
Hurry up.

281
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,740
Didn't you say you'll take me to find my memory?

282
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,060
Why did you change your clothes and come here?

283
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,740
Senior.

284
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,180
You've been here before.

285
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,180
You can't go back.

286
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,380
I'm going to find my memory.

287
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,380
I'll go with you.

288
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,380
You used to listen to my heartbeat.

289
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,540
You said my heartbeat

290
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,820
is more intense than the drum.

291
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,660
Do you want to listen to it?

292
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,180
No, no, no.

293
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,180
No, no, no.

294
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:43,980
You...

295
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,100
Are you listening to your heartbeat

296
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,100
or seducing him?

297
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,580
I know you haven't been sleeping well recently.

298
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,580
I don't know

299
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,980
how many nights you've been working.

300
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,060
There are still many things you don't know.

301
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,460
Senior, let's continue.

302
00:13:59,460 --> 00:13:59,980
Wait a minute.

303
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,980
Wait a minute.

304
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,300
Listen to your heartbeat.

305
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,300
What can't I listen to?

306
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,980
Listen to your heartbeat?

307
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,700
Yes.

308
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,860
The sound of the three-dimensional circle

309
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,260
is more intense than the drum.

310
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,300
Hurry up and listen to it.

311
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,300
After listening to it, I have to return the advantage to others.

312
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:14,660
Come on.

313
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,660
No need, senior.

314
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,300
Since sister is jealous,

315
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,100
let's take our time.

316
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,060
Senior.

317
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,820
Your memory is only temporary.

318
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,540
I will help you remember it.

319
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,380
What do you mean?

320
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,900
So I am a real memory.

321
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,420
I'm not another person in my body.

322
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,420
Of course.

323
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,580
And our engagement is also real.

324
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,060
We have happened everything.

325
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,060
What?

326
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,460
You mean

327
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,020
we two are that?

328
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,020
Of course.

329
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,700
Senior.

330
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,580
We used to be very close.

331
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,740
If it weren't for the teacher,

332
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,220
we wouldn't have separated.

333
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,740
Aren't you an actor?

334
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,620
Why did you make a teacher?

335
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,740
An actor is just my superficial identity.

336
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,540
In fact,

337
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,860
I am your favorite junior.

338
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,020
Senior, don't worry.

339
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,620
From now on,

340
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,700
you can sleep in my bed

341
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,540
and rent my house.

342
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,020
Everything is yours,

343
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,700
including me.

344
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,580
No.

345
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,060
Let me think about it.

346
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,580
Can I listen to this?

347
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,820
Of course not.

348
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,700
Why not?

349
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,260
Because he is my boyfriend.

350
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,420
You...

351
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,740
Yes.

352
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,260
And I am his bodyguard.

353
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,340
Yiran.

354
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,380
I can pay you the penalty.

355
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,740
I just want to talk to my favorite senior.

356
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,140
You won't fight with me, right?

357
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,260
Then you can ask Wu Ming.

358
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,020
I am a man of my heart.

359
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,180
Let's go.

360
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,060
Senior.

361
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,060
Senior.

362
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,820
Song Yiran.

363
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,780
I will let you

364
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,260
taste my secret technique.

365
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,900
Sister.

366
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,420
Why do you look so pale?

367
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,060
You are blushing.

368
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,060
But sister.

369
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,980
I have a incense here.

370
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,980
You can smell it.

371
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:02,740
Okay.

372
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,340
Boss.

373
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:38,740
I am the one who knows the past will come back

374
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:43,740
I will be persistent, persistent

375
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,740
I will be persistent, persistent

376
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,740
I will be persistent, persistent

377
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:55,740
I will be persistent, persistent

378
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,740
I will be persistent, persistent

379
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,740
That's fiction

380
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:19,020
The entire universe
