1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The whole universe shines because of me

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Mom!

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What's wrong with you?

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yi Ran, my heart is broken.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I can't live for a few days.

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I just hope that before I die,

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I can see you have a happy family.

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Mom, this is my boyfriend.

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I've been busy with work.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So I haven't had the time to tell you.

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Enough.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We both know it online.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You said that

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
even if you don't want to marry Li,

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
you can't just make up a story.

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You're defaming yourself.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What story?

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Say that.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Shut up!

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's none of your business.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yi Ran, get us the money.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Honey,

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
don't be so mean to the child.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yi Ran knows what he's doing.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What do you mean?

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Look at you.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What's wrong with you?

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Can he get the money?

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Auntie is seriously ill.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Why didn't you go to the ICU?

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Mom,

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
are you trying to force me to get married

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and act with me?

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What?

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Act?

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Why are you acting all the time?

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Go. Go.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Go and act your play.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Why are you so miserable?

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's useless to drag your daughter

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
into this trouble.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Dad, let's talk in the ward.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No.

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Let's talk here.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Let's make it clear.

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Tell me the truth.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Your mom is seriously ill.

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Will you give us the money?

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The big star is so ridiculous.

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yes.

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
His mom is seriously ill.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What should we do?

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's so worrying.

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Do you have no money?

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
If you don't have money,

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
you should find a rich man to marry me.

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'll get money to treat your mom.

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I think Mr. Li is a good man.

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Auntie is seriously ill.

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Why are you still arguing?

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
None of your business.

64
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
She was found out.

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
She's just a dry-dryer.

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Can she support you?

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I can support her.

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You support her?

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Where did you get the money?

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
If you have money,

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
you should cure your mom's illness first.

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Boy,

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'll give you a hand.

74
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Boy,

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I can understand you want to eat soft food.

76
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But as a father,

77
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I advise you to give up this idea.

78
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Dad, what are you talking about?

79
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yiran,

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
it's so good to marry Li Tianhao.

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You're a rich woman.

82
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Anyway, you don't have a chance to act.

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm asking you,

84
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
can I hurt you?

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Your conscience may not hurt him.

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But your ignorance may hurt him.

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What right do you have to talk to me like that?

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I just watched your film.

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I just know you're so sick.

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Look.

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Heart, liver, stomach,

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
all have nutrition.

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What does it mean?

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What does it mean?

95
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You're not here to talk about nutrition.

96
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And you're not listening to me.

97
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What does it mean?

98
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It means you often get angry and have a weak pulse.

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Aunt, let me guess.

100
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
When you wake up at night,

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
is your mouth dry and your chest dull?

102
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Or you have a bad heart rate?

103
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
How do you know?

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I saw it from the film.

105
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You have a weak pulse and a weak heart.

106
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
This kind of disease is most likely to cause anger.

107
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
If you get angry when you don't know,

108
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
you'll lose your mother.

109
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's not a good thing.

110
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's so serious.

111
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Is your mother really sick?

112
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
She's going to faint when she sleeps.

113
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What are you talking about?

114
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Aunt, I can't lie to you at this time.

115
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Look.

116
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Did you have a headache when you were in a hurry?

117
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
My head.

118
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Are you dizzy?

119
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You're telling the truth.

120
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Aunt, don't worry.

121
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Aunt, don't worry.

122
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You're blind.

123
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Shut up.

124
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
How can I cure you?

125
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Aunt, don't worry.

126
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'll give you a few herbs.

127
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Just take a few treatments.

128
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But remember,

129
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
don't be too much.

130
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Especially don't be too much.

131
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Thank you.

132
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Cheers.

133
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Pulse, open pulse.

134
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
How can you know these?

135
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Maybe because I was a

136
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
old Chinese doctor who was a mysterious doctor.

137
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Old Chinese doctor?

138
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You saw it today.

139
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This is my life.

140
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Is it very bad?

141
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
My parents

142
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
never really cared about me.

143
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
They just treated me

144
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
as a loan shark.

145
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
They always wanted to control my life.

146
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I remember

147
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
there was a shooting.

148
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It was raining heavily.

149
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I had a high fever.

150
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The crew asked me to rest for two more days.

151
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But my mom

152
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
was afraid that I would delay the shooting.

153
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So she forced me to go to the set.

154
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I fainted at the door of my house.

155
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
My dad thought I was pretending to be sick and stealing.

156
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Why do I tell you this?

157
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's all in the past.

158
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Although the female number one was stolen by others,

159
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I can start over.

160
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I have to try to get a new role.

161
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I can't say anymore.

162
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm going to cry.

163
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Let's drink.

164
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Let's drink.

165
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Don't go.

166
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Mom.

167
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Don't go, mom.

168
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Don't leave me alone.

169
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I will make money for you.

170
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,640
I'm scared.

171
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,400
I'm scared.

172
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,400
I'm scared.

173
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm scared.

174
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,200
Why do I feel

175
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,000
a strange image appearing?

176
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,800
Boss Xia,

177
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,200
this is our chance.

178
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,800
Above us,

179
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:31,240
there are three

180
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,480
loose pairs.

181
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,800
There are Jenny Mang.

182
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,200
There are thought is

183
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,280
I want to fight for it.

184
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,200
Because today,

185
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,560
an important person will come.

186
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,760
Okay.

187
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,880
I'll go change my clothes.

188
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,640
Get ready.

189
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,680
Why is she here?

190
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,280
Yeah.

191
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
She has the right to come.

192
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,960
Thank you.

193
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,760
She's so pretty.

194
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,800
Look here.

195
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,320
She's the one who doesn't like this.

196
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,680
It's been a long time.

197
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,400
Long time no see.

198
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,240
Long time no see.

199
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,680
Her new boyfriend is here.

200
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,320
He's won the lottery.

201
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,400
Really?

202
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Song Yi Ran.

203
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,120
Why are you here?

204
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,360
You've been replaced.

205
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,080
Why are you still not giving up?

206
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,240
I know.

207
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,720
You really want to come to this movie.

208
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,320
I understand your feelings.

209
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,160
But you can't do it without me.

210
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,400
I'm sorry.

211
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,280
I'm sorry.

212
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,360
I'm sorry.

213
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,240
I'm sorry.

214
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,120
Don't worry, Yi Ran.

215
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,600
With your popularity and strength,

216
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,080
investors can make their own judgments.

217
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,280
Let me tell you now.

218
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,880
Entertainment circle is a clear thing.

219
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,160
There are so many talented people.

220
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,400
Not everyone can be a celebrity.

221
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,920
Yeah.

222
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,280
Entertainment circle is so big.

223
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,120
Your family wants to get the best of it.

224
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,200
I'm sorry.

225
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,080
Our family really has this ability.

226
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,480
I don't know Mr. Su.

227
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,840
He's the first investor.

228
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,120
I think he'll listen to me

229
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,720
or you.

230
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,480
If you

231
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,400
agree to marry me,

232
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,400
I'll talk to Mr. Su.

233
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,840
You'll be the first one.

234
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,720
Thank you.

235
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,920
I don't need it.

236
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,200
Mr. Su, this way, please.

237
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,560
Mr. Su.

238
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,240
Mr. Su.

239
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,160
Have you read the latest project?

240
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,880
The Moon Dragon suits you the best.

241
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,640
Don't ask me about this.

242
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,840
You'll be in charge of the details.

243
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,120
I'm only in charge of the investment.

244
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,880
Thank you for your time.

245
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
This way, please.

246
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,080
Hello, Mr. Su.

247
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,280
I think as a movie producer,

248
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,800
I should be the first one to ask you.

249
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,600
I think as an investor,

250
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,680
I should consider the quality and market of the movie,

251
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,000
not just the relationship.

252
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,840
Wait a minute.

253
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,800
What are you?

254
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,000
Are you a classmate of Mr. Su?

255
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Go on.

256
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,680
First,

257
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,520
we did a lot of publicity in the early days of the movie.

258
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,440
The character of Lin Zhen Huan is not good.

259
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,120
The movie you made before is very popular.

260
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,800
The character is the most important.

261
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,440
In terms of the appearance,

262
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,080
Song Yi Ran is more suitable.

263
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,040
So you mean...

264
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,120
I mean

265
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,760
to keep Song Yi Ran as a female lead

266
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,040
and maintain the male lead of the theater.

267
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,720
What do you think?

268
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,040
What are you?

269
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,040
Why does Mr. Su listen to you?

270
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,320
Who do you think you are?

271
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,320
I heard it.

272
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,480
You can have Song Yi Ran later.

273
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,360
Take it.

274
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,840
I think Song Yi Ran is not suitable.

275
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,640
Why?

276
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:03,960
Look.

277
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,440
I'm from the project.

278
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,240
She is now all over the internal news.

279
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,320
Plus the contract.

280
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,360
All the risks are not lost.

281
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,960
I will bear the consequences.

282
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,360
You are going to save Song Yi Ran.

283
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,760
Look at her.

284
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,840
She is a bad driver.

285
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,200
She is eating with him.

286
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,640
How can she be useful?

287
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,880
Why should I listen to her?

288
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,880
I think she is good.

289
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,320
And

290
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,680
I hope I can hear

291
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,320
what you said last time.

292
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,440
Wait for me.

293
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,320
Thank you, Mr. Su.

294
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,560
How do you thank me?

295
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,120
I'm always grateful.

296
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,440
I will thank you as you say.

297
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,160
Which house is on the third floor?

298
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,760
You come alone.

299
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,600
Forget about that.

300
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,400
You can go on.

301
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,000
Lei Geneva?

302
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,160
See you later.

303
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,440
I miss him so much.

304
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:09,440
Thanks for watching!
