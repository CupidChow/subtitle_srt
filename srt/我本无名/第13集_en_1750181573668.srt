1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The whole universe shines because of me

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,320
My mom has entered the account.

4
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,160
That's great.

5
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,040
But I think

6
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,600
I always want a personal account.

7
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,400
This account is too tight.

8
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,480
But if I use it alone,

9
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,920
I'll be a little scared.

10
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,240
Don't be scared.

11
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,400
I've been with you.

12
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,040
I envy you for having your own account.

13
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,440
I don't have one.

14
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,600
It's simple.

15
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,000
I'll take your account.

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,960
I'll take your account.

17
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:58,920
No.

18
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,320
I don't even know who I am.

19
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,080
What if I had divorced before?

20
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,880
Or I haven't finished it yet.

21
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,840
Then I'll wait for you.

22
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,600
Yiran.

23
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,560
I don't know who I am.

24
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,560
I don't know what kind of experience I have.

25
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,400
What if I was in danger before?

26
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,200
What if I find my memory back?

27
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,480
I don't think I like you anymore.

28
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,600
I'm not afraid.

29
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,280
I'm afraid.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,200
I can't get you involved.

31
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,880
I'm afraid.

32
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,680
I'm afraid.

33
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,240
I'm afraid.

34
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,720
I'm afraid.

35
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,480
But I don't think

36
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
these are reasons.

37
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,840
Have a good rest.

38
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,840
There's a play tomorrow.

39
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,840
Wu Ming.

40
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,440
I'll find your memory back.

41
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,240
Okay.

42
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,840
Sister is in a bad state today.

43
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,840
You must help Wu Ming find her memory back.

44
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,160
Of course I will help her find her memory back.

45
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,000
But it's not Ye Wu Ming

46
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,680
who can find her memory back.

47
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,800
Finding her memory back

48
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,880
may not be like now.

49
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,200
It's completely mine.

50
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,120
But I know

51
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,800
she always wanted to find her old self.

52
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
She always cared about

53
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,560
this matter.

54
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,120
Are you begging me now?

55
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,200
I heard you never beg anyone.

56
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,400
Yes.

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,040
I'm begging you.

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,960
For Wu Ming,

59
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,760
I'm willing to beg you.

60
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,120
And you've always wanted to do this.

61
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,600
We have the same goal.

62
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,640
We can work together.

63
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,920
Song Yi Ran, the famous person,

64
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,520
is begging me now?

65
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,960
My senior is really charming.

66
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,120
What should I do?

67
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,360
I don't want to give my senior to you now.

68
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,560
I promise you.

69
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,600
Although I'm not sure,

70
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,440
I can still try some methods.

71
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,520
You know,

72
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,600
I'm good at making

73
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,240
incense and incense.

74
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,960
Since I met my senior,

75
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,840
I've been making some medicine for him.

76
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,560
Now it's up to you.

77
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,400
Do you dare to give him medicine?

78
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,960
Why is it black?

79
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,280
Shouldn't it be colorless?

80
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,280
This is what happened

81
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,400
when I filmed the costume drama.

82
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,120
Something's wrong with it.

83
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,560
Who would drink it?

84
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,640
You're back from the run?

85
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,800
I brought you a cup of water.

86
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,680
Water?

87
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,520
I added some brown sugar.

88
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,040
Anyway,

89
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,640
I made it specially for you.

90
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,320
Have some.

91
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,300
7r intervenes There are worth it

92
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,800
Go to specs

93
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,380
It's a calming technique.

94
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,280
It can calm people down.

95
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,520
But why are there some stimulating drugs?

96
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,120
Wu Ming, what's wrong?

97
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,320
Are you okay? Tell me! Don't scare me!

98
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,820
Where did you get this?

99
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,620
Yue Linglong gave it to me. He said that it can restore memory after drinking it.

100
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,020
I didn't know that it would be so painful.

101
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,420
No, Wu Minghao, no.

102
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,820
It's a key.

103
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,020
This drug is painful, but it's really useful.

104
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,420
It can help me restore my memory. Give me another cup. Hurry.

105
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,220
Hello?

106
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,820
Mr. Ye, do you miss me?

107
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,620
Who?

108
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,420
You can't even remember my voice?

109
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,620
I miss you. Let's meet.

110
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,820
You're calling me again. Bye.

111
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,020
Yiran is also by your side, right?

112
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,620
Don't hang up yet.

113
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,020
I think I found the truth about your master's death.

114
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,420
Maybe this is also the reason why you lost your memory.

115
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,420
I'm not here.

116
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,220
Don't call me again.

117
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,820
If you don't come, I can only serve you.

118
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,820
You definitely don't want to involve your Yiran, right?

119
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,820
Your master's death seems to have something to do with her.

120
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,420
Will this affect your relationship?

121
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,820
Who is it?

122
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,420
Oh, sorry, I have to make a call.

123
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,820
I just finished drinking the drug. I have a headache.

124
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,820
I need to go out for a breath.

125
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,820
This drug...

126
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,620
Didn't you say that you wanted to drink another cup?

127
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,020
Why are you going out to take a breath?

128
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,220
Did you drink this drug and have a headache?

129
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,420
I'm here.

130
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,020
Are you done playing? If you have any news, let me know.

131
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,220
Is anyone there?

132
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,820
Taking money to help people get rid of the disaster is my job.

133
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,820
My goal is to live a day, but I can't stop for a day.

134
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,220
This is called professional ethics.

135
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,620
So you said that you had news about my master and you were lying to me.

136
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,220
You're an illegal worker. Why are you being so stubborn?

137
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,620
The news is true. It depends on whether you believe it or not.

138
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,220
Speak.

139
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,820
The movie that Song Yi Ran filmed three years ago

140
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,820
is a scam from start to finish.

141
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,020
He used filming as a means to go to your master's house.

142
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,020
His purpose is to kill your master.

143
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,820
Show me the photo of PS.

144
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,220
My master is so good. Yi Ran doesn't know kung fu. How could it be true?

145
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,220
Looks like you don't believe it.

146
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,620
Of course I don't believe it.

147
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,020
Then guess where he is now.

148
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,820
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

149
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,420
Really?

150
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,220
Really?

151
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,420
I've been waiting for so long.

152
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,420
It should be almost time.

153
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,420
It should be too late to save Yi Ran.

154
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,420
Sorry.

155
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,620
It's too late.

156
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,220
Where is he?

157
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,420
I became his manager for three years.

158
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,020
I chose the most kind death method for him.

159
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:39,420
I heard that he was poisoned with opium.

160
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,620
Run faster.

161
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,220
I'm sorry.

162
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,220
I'm sorry.

163
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,420
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,420
I'm sorry.

165
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,420
I'm sorry.

166
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,420
I'm sorry.

167
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,420
I'm sorry.

168
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,420
I'm sorry.

169
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,420
I'm sorry.

170
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,420
I'm sorry.

171
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,420
I'm sorry.

172
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,420
I'm sorry.

173
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,420
I'm sorry.

174
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,420
I'm sorry.

175
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,420
I'm sorry.

176
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,420
I'm sorry.

177
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,420
I'm sorry.

178
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,420
I'm sorry.

179
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,420
I'm sorry.

180
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,420
I'm sorry.

181
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,420
I'm sorry.

182
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,420
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,420
I'm sorry.

184
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,420
I'm sorry.

185
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,420
I'm sorry.

186
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,420
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,420
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,420
I'm sorry.
