1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The whole universe shines because of me

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,600
Did the 8-star door disappear?

4
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,800
Where is he?

5
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,000
Director, let's shoot the scene of the first-to-third first.

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,800
We can, but we can't find the right weapon now.

7
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,400
I'll do it.

8
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,600
Be careful. They are all very powerful.

9
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,400
They are after me.

10
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,000
Don't worry. Your boyfriend is also very powerful.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,800
The door was opened.

12
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,800
Ready to start the live broadcast.

13
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,400
Boss Ye is going on the stage in person.

14
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,400
You three should cherish the opportunity.

15
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,200
Director, you are right.

16
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,800
We can't delay the filming.

17
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,200
You three can do it together.

18
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,600
The amazing competition, I want to start a live broadcast.

19
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,600
We three lost to your teacher.

20
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,200
Now I'm going to let everyone in the world know.

21
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,960
I want to defeat Ba Xian Quan

22
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,680
Please

23
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,320
I thought you were here for a movie

24
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,520
But you came for me

25
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,880
You are not a little bit kind

26
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,760
But you can make such a good movie

27
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,680
Watch

28
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,720
It seems they want to defeat Ba Xian Quan in public

29
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,760
Even if Ye Wu Ming doesn't recover his memory

30
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,160
It's not something a cat can bully

31
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,360
These masters are useless

32
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,400
They are not useful

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Don't worry

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,400
It's just a warm-up

35
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,440
I have prepared a strong medicine for them

36
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,560
It can increase their combat power ten times

37
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,280
These people won't follow the rules

38
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,480
Come on

39
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,160
Liu Yang

40
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,160
They are fighting like robots

41
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,720
Did they take the medicine?

42
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,560
Are they cheating?

43
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,800
They are shooting

44
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,840
Where are you going?

45
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,680
Ye Wu Ming, you have to be careful

46
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,800
The first one in Ba Yuan

47
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,480
He is completely forgotten

48
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,480
He is ready to defend the eight directions

49
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,480
He is not afraid of water

50
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,480
He is completely forgotten

51
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,480
He is the highest level of Ba Xian Quan

52
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
Shi Fang

53
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,080
Why is Pi Yan beating me?

54
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,080
I don't know

55
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,080
I don't know

56
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,080
I don't know

57
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,080
I don't know

58
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,080
I don't know

59
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,080
I don't know

60
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,080
I don't know

61
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
I don't know

62
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,080
I don't know

63
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,080
I don't know

64
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,080
I don't know

65
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,600
Ye Wu Ming is crying

66
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,840
Ye Wu Ming is acting

67
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,840
He is a bastard

68
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,240
Why don't you say that he is beating three people?

69
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,640
That's the script

70
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
Where is Director Pi?

71
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,640
Turn off your emotions

72
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,440
Ye Wu Ming will stand up

73
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,680
He will die

74
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,400
You misunderstood

75
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,400
I also hope that Ye Wu Ming can stand up

76
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,400
Right?

77
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,640
Let's meet everyone

78
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,440
Let's call Ye Wu Ming up

79
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,840
Ye Wu Ming, stand up

80
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,840
Ye Wu Ming, stand up

81
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Ye Wu Ming, stand up

82
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
He is injured

83
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,600
He can't fight anymore

84
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Stand up

85
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Ye Wu Ming, stand up

86
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Ye Wu Ming, stand up

87
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Ye Wu Ming, stand up

88
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Wu Ming

89
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Wu Ming, you are awake

90
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
You damage Ye Wu Ming

91
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Are you okay?

92
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,080
I'm fine, thank you

93
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,640
You go first

94
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,560
You'll hurt me

95
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,760
Mr. Song

96
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,960
We'll shoot it now

97
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,480
Just take a break

98
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:21,140
Get the

99
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,020
Someone to íŒ¬

100
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,280
Step on her

101
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,340
Cheers

102
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,340
High five

103
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,340
Let's go

104
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,640
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,920
His memory is back.

106
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,840
No. I have to check it.

107
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,320
He...

108
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,040
You have to report it immediately.

109
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,440
Ye Wu Ming killed Piao Lanzhi.

110
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,640
That's great.

111
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,600
I've never seen such a wonderful play.

112
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,640
He's killed.

113
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,840
Ye Wu Ming is killed.

114
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,520
I'll go in.

115
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,520
Wait.

116
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,560
He's fine.

117
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,760
He just fainted.

118
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,800
This way.

119
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,440
Senior.

120
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,440
Junior.

121
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,120
Senior, you remember us.

122
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,320
I remember you.

123
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,520
I remember you.

124
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,600
I remember you.

125
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,960
Senior, you remember us.

126
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,200
That's great.

127
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,840
We can finish the engagement.

128
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,640
We lost this game.

129
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,360
Not only did we not destroy Ye Wu Ming,

130
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,920
but also let him recover his memory.

131
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,400
This game is not his last step.

132
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,560
I want to win easily.

133
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,960
I just got the news that Piao Lanzhi

134
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,080
is dead.

135
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,760
Dead?

136
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,080
How?

137
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,800
No matter how he died,

138
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,880
as long as we put the news out,

139
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,720
it's Ye Wu Ming who killed him.

140
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,480
He's a perfect crime.

141
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,480
You can't explain it.

142
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,240
You're just a mouthful of lies.

143
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,200
You're a useless man.

144
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,320
Mr. Feng, you're wise.

145
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,480
As long as he's guilty of killing,

146
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,040
it's a matter of character.

147
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,840
He's not qualified to

148
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,520
borrow our 200 billion.

149
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,720
Wu Ming.

150
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,640
Who are you?

151
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,080
I don't know you.

152
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,480
Are you kidding me?

153
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,440
I'm Yi Ran.

154
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,560
Yi Ran?

155
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,160
Senior, you're awake.

156
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,800
Do you remember who I am?

157
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,000
Junior.

158
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,480
Senior.

159
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,720
Slowly.

160
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,320
Where am I?

161
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,720
I only remember

162
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,120
that Master asked me to go down the mountain to practice.

163
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,600
This is the nursing home.

164
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,600
Your uncle went down the mountain to practice.

165
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,320
It was three years ago.

166
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,480
Senior.

167
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,840
I'm sorry.

168
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm sorry.

169
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,160
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,480
I'm sorry.

172
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,760
It's all over.

173
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,040
Master.

174
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,960
I shouldn't have taken v mode.

175
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,040
What about now?

176
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,640
I never knew that

177
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,160
one neck and four arms

178
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,800
are important for a life.

179
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,760
No.

180
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,000
I found the memory of three years ago

181
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,120
for the first two times.

182
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,000
But I lost the memory of these three years again.

183
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,960
It's okay.

184
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,960
You just dreamt about it.

185
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,040
You're still you after you woke up.

186
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,320
It's okay, Senior.

187
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,640
Those three years are not important.

188
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,840
Yi Ran.

189
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,480
Senior.

190
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,040
Who is Yi Ran?

191
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,320
Why does his name

192
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,560
sound so familiar?

193
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,000
Yi Ran is an actor.

194
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,640
You must have heard his name

195
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,360
often before.

196
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,080
That's why you remember it.

197
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,600
Senior.

198
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,120
You finally recovered your memory.

199
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,480
Don't forget me again.

200
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,640
We have a engagement.

201
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,000
Junior.

202
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,600
Those are all Master's jokes.

203
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,120
And I don't want to talk about it now.

204
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,320
Junior.

205
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,920
Wu Ming just recovered his memory.

206
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,960
Let him calm down.

207
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,800
Junior.

208
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,040
Have a good rest.

209
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,960
We'll be with you

210
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,160
these days.

211
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,480
Okay.

212
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,760
Let's go.

213
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,880
A moment of silence

214
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,880
is like a drop of water in loneliness.

215
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,360
I miss you.

216
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,960
The next second, the sky will be grey.

217
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,200
Why can't I remember him?

218
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,840
It seems that I've forgotten

219
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,040
an important person.

220
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,880
The love flower was still there yesterday.

221
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,960
I'm looking forward to meeting you again.

222
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,800
Wu Ming.

223
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,320
Who are you?

224
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,800
I don't know you.

225
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,200
The stars are not in your range.

226
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,080
I want to meet you again.

227
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,560
I have a feeling.

228
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,640
I want to go in now.

229
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,120
Wu Ming can't forget me.

230
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,440
Before the body recovers its memory,

231
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,840
I hope you won't bother him.

232
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,040
I'm just a word.

233
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,600
I just want to know.

234
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,400
You'll only stimulate him.

235
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,600
It'll be more painful.

236
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,280
I won't let you go in.

237
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,640
I'll come back tomorrow.

238
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,440
I'm afraid you can't come back tomorrow.

239
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,520
The day after tomorrow.

240
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,040
The day after tomorrow.

241
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,920
I'll come every day.

242
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,000
Until he can see me.

243
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,680
You go back first.

244
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,320
If he remembers you,

245
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,760
I'll let you know.

246
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,920
Senior.

247
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,480
Why?

248
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,640
Don't worry.

249
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,080
He'll leave you.

250
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,800
The stars in the sky are not in your range.

251
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,040
Yiran.

252
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,440
I want to meet you again.

253
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,160
What's my relationship with him?

254
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,440
You'll only stimulate him.

255
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,520
I can see you.

256
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,440
Why didn't I stop him?

257
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,280
Why did I let him take the risk?

258
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,240
You'll only stimulate him.

259
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,680
Why didn't I think of protecting him?

260
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,320
He's the one protecting me.

261
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,800
I...

262
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,040
I don't understand me?

263
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,200
What are you talking about?

264
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,080
You told me.

265
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,800
to protect him no matter what.

266
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,520
I don't dare.

267
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,480
You can't kill me.

268
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,760
I'm the one protecting him.

269
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm the one protecting him.

270
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,360
I don't dare to do any harm to him.

271
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,000
Even if you want to kill me,

272
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,640
you have to protect me.

273
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,480
You just came to adjust me.

274
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,040
You've gone far.

275
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,040
I'm sorry. I'm only his price now.

276
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,040
You only know that I'm competing with you for two hundred billion.

277
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,040
But you don't know that these two hundred billion is for him.

278
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,040
Yi Ran, you're free.

279
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,040
I'm free.

280
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,040
I'm free.

281
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
I'm free.

282
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,040
Yi Ran, you're free.

283
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,040
I'm free.

284
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,040
I'm free.

285
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,040
I'm free.

286
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,040
I'm free.

287
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,040
I'm free.

288
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,040
I'm free.

289
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,040
I'm free.

290
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,040
I'm free.

291
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,040
I'm free.

292
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
I'm free.

293
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,040
I'm free.

294
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,040
I'm free.

295
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,040
I'm free.

296
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,040
I'm free.

297
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,040
I'm free.

298
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,040
I'm free.

299
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,040
I'm free.

300
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,040
I'm free.

301
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,040
I'm free.
