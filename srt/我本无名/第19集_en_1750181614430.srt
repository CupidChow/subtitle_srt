1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The whole universe shines because of me

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,240
Mr. Su,

4
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,400
Mr. Lian Long,

5
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,000
it's all Wu Ming Ke's doing.

6
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,560
The Foundry Gate is a place

7
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,480
where traditional culture and fruit trees are passed down.

8
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,880
My master adopted me.

9
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,800
I never went down the mountain before I had a car accident.

10
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,200
We used to practice here.

11
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,640
We used to make wine here.

12
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,920
I didn't expect my master

13
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,040
to be so famous.

14
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,800
This place is so nice.

15
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,600
Now that I think about it,

16
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,280
my master has done so much for me.

17
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,920
I haven't even seen him for the last time.

18
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,200
You miss your master so much.

19
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,200
He must be very nice to you.

20
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,760
Of course.

21
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,400
Just like how you treat me,

22
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,120
you want to kill me every day.

23
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,160
You must be really mean

24
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,240
to any angle.

25
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,120
Master,

26
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,280
you are so cruel to me.

27
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,480
That's why you learned a skill

28
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,780
from Master's incredible training.

29
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,000
Your right hand is able to

30
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,460
érécter all the Hurts.

31
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,420
I see.

32
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,620
You must have beenopot403rr한다 to master.

33
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:39,920
That's right.

34
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:41,940
So when I learned to do something,

35
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,120
I reported her to Master.

36
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,640
How did you report her?

37
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,520
Master.

38
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,300
Do you feel refreshed?

39
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:55,920
What?

40
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,320
Bullshit!

41
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,040
Hurry up!

42
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,960
Pull it out!

43
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:00,800
Hurry up!

44
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,960
You bastard!

45
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,280
I'll break your legs!

46
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,480
It's not revenge.

47
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,480
It's revenge.

48
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,480
But now,

49
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,680
even if I want to take revenge on him,

50
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,480
I can't find him.

51
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,360
On the day of the mountain,

52
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,200
Master asked me to cut my hair.

53
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,440
And start over.

54
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,840
This is the last thing I heard.

55
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,280
When Master left,

56
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,320
we were separated.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,080
We had nothing.

58
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,120
Who said that?

59
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,400
You and me?

60
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,600
Yes.

61
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,480
I still have you.

62
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,440
And I only have you.

63
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,240
Since you've remembered it,

64
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,440
can you tell me

65
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,880
what's the secret

66
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,120
hidden under this coin?

67
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,720
I can't tell you.

68
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,440
It's a secret of the sect.

69
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,920
You still don't have me in your heart.

70
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,280
You don't even tell me the secret.

71
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:44,080
But why do you always

72
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,880
hate me so much?

73
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,360
Relax.

74
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,240
You'll remember it.

75
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,680
Please have a look.

76
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,600
That's right. It's a video of my mother blackening Song Yi Ran.

77
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,520
I was prepared on the day she was going to terminate the contract.

78
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,440
I deliberately made Tianhao go and make trouble to collect the materials.

79
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,080
Now, it's finally done.

80
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,880
Then why did you come to me?

81
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,560
Ye Wu Ming should have been with you when he got his memories back.

82
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,360
Song Yi Ran took it away.

83
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,840
You must hate him.

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,080
I don't hate him.

85
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,200
I just want to find my senior.

86
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,120
That's good.

87
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,280
You find your senior. I'll find my Song Yi Ran.

88
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,000
We'll do what we need.

89
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,480
I was waiting for you to tell me where received it.

90
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,320
I've been waiting for you to tell me.

91
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,240
Earlier...

92
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,080
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,080
Thank you.

94
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,000
That thank you just now

95
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,400
was so gentle.

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,320
It was like you were flirting with me.

97
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,960
You're so sweet and sweet now.

98
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,040
You're more like a flirt and a couple.

99
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,120
I can't help it.

100
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,480
I just like you.

101
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,640
I want to get closer to you.

102
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,920
What should I do?

103
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,720
Don't hesitate.

104
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,400
The best hot-dress, Song Yi Ran?

105
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,960
Be quiet.

106
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,160
Come here.

107
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:45,960
Let me see.

108
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,160
Brother, sister-in-law is going to the bathroom.

109
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,080
It's so dark.

110
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:54,960
What's going on?

111
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,680
Brother, look.

112
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,960
Song Yi Ran, the famous actress,

113
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,680
is like this.

114
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,320
She's unfilial and unfilial.

115
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,120
She's so dark.

116
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,680
She just came out and went to the bathroom for half an hour.

117
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,560
She must have a premonition.

118
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,200
Take it down.

119
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,640
Hurry.

120
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,560
It's too late, brother.

121
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,440
This is already on the top ten million.

122
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,760
Mr. Ye.

123
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,600
Look at this.

124
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,160
It's spreading too fast.

125
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,200
The three parties saw Yi Ran's negative news.

126
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,200
And you're suspected of murder.

127
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,880
They decided to stop shooting.

128
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,480
After the crisis is solved,

129
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,560
they can continue shooting.

130
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
What if it can't be solved?

131
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,200
Then the movie will be ruined.

132
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,280
Or change to the first one.

133
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,720
Then half of the material in the previous one

134
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,600
will be wasted.

135
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,760
It's too much loss.

136
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,400
I'm sorry.

137
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,240
Mr. Li is really hard-working.

138
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,120
It seems that he has started to make arrangements

139
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,320
since I refused him for the first time.

140
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,840
It's okay.

141
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,080
I'll ask Linglong to help clarify.

142
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,000
No need to look for it.

143
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,760
Thanks to him,

144
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,200
I was able to get rid of the blackout successfully.

145
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,080
It seems that he knew

146
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,320
this was a trap from the beginning.

147
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,080
He may even be the one who made the arrangement.

148
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,480
After all, the person he hates most now is me.

149
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,600
That day we were in the movie theater.

150
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,400
So he suddenly took over me.

151
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,520
I didn't expect anything to happen.

152
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,960
He has been

153
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,280
oppressing me like this all the time.

154
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,040
Is it possible that he is famous

155
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,600
and can do this?

156
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,800
Is he a famous artist

157
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,400
who can't be trusted

158
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,040
by the public?

159
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,760
And so,

160
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,120
I was even fired by the marriage.

161
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,280
What should we do, director?

162
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,520
We can only stop shooting.

163
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,520
Let him take over.

164
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,240
Stop shooting.

165
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:34,800
Come on.

166
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,640
Stop shooting.

167
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,560
Pack up your things.

168
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,080
Hurry up.

169
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,400
Wait.

170
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:41,960
Director,

171
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,480
calm down the crew first.

172
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,000
I'll solve the financial problem.

173
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,440
Senior.

174
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,640
Mr. Ma.

175
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,480
Mr. Ma.

176
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,720
I want to apply for three hundred million with the group.

177
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,200
Little brother.

178
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,080
I reported to the board of directors.

179
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,560
But the board of directors

180
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,200
has given up this movie.

181
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,720
Even if the company doesn't withdraw the funds,

182
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,920
the negative news will continue to spread.

183
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,280
Even if it's finished,

184
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,720
it won't be released.

185
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,560
Do you think Yiran is such a person?

186
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,840
Of course I don't believe it.

187
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,680
But

188
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,280
we can't change the public opinion.

189
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,520
There must be a trick by Mr. Feng behind this.

190
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,040
It's to make you

191
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,360
and the people around you less and less famous.

192
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,160
Then, if you question your character,

193
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,720
you can refuse to accept the two hundred million.

194
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,920
Junior.

195
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,240
Go back and talk to me.

196
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,200
No.

197
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,960
I've investigated it.

198
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,880
Mr. Li has already

199
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,600
worked with Mr. Feng.

200
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,600
Senior.

201
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,760
I understand what you mean.

202
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,360
Mingzhu Group can be disbanded.

203
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,280
I'll take the money.

204
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,960
It's not that I don't help you.

205
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,760
It's a trap.

206
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,400
Do you have to jump into it?

207
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,280
Just do it in time.

208
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,800
There will be more.

209
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,840
No.

210
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,920
This movie is too important

211
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,080
to Yiran.

212
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,800
I can't just watch it

213
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,920
and be destroyed.

214
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,760
The movie is not about love.

215
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,760
I can't convince the board.

216
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,280
And I've already asked

217
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,360
several investment companies.

218
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,080
Their requirements are very clear.

219
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,760
Either

220
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,240
Song Yiran will prove himself innocent.

221
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:26,920
Or

222
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,920
change Song Yiran.

223
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,680
Okay.

224
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,000
I'll prove his innocence.

225
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,680
Mr. Li.

226
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,240
Ye Wuming is too powerful.

227
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,440
I want more money.

228
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,960
Do you have the money?

229
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,800
I've given you many chances.

230
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,120
You can't kill him.

231
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,120
So I've changed my strategy.

232
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,000
I've pretended to be obedient to him

233
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,360
and set up a trap for him.

234
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,200
He's dead this time.

235
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,040
What are you doing?

236
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,640
I'll give you another chance.

237
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,080
If you can kill Ye Wuming,

238
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,440
I'll give you the previous salary.

239
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,960
And I'll give you more money.

240
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,800
Lan Zang.

241
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,800
Why?

242
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,280
Why do you leave

243
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,960
before I finish my words?

244
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,600
Mr. Li, is there anything else you want to say?

245
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,440
Don't move.

246
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,560
Don't move.

247
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,760
Don't move.

248
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,760
Don't move.

249
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,840
Mr. Han.

250
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,960
Let's talk about it after the break.

251
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,080
But the movie must be finished now.

252
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:55,960
How about this?

253
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,720
I can raise your investment.

254
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,920
But I don't want to

255
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,520
lose money, right?

256
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Ye.

257
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,200
Wuming.

258
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,120
Wuming.

259
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,320
The company is here.

260
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,280
They want to kill me.

261
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,120
You're fooled, Wuming.

262
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,240
Here, give them the money.

263
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,400
I don't want to lose money.

264
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,360
Do you think

265
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,840
you're breathing free?

266
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,880
I've done enough.

267
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,480
I've made up my mind.

268
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,600
But I'm saying this

269
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,880
to learn how to live.

270
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,680
There are so many things

271
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,080
you have to learn.

272
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,320
Aren't you angry?

273
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,960
Wuming.

274
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,240
Wuming,

275
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:27,840
The universe shines because of me
