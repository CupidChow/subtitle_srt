1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The whole universe shines because of me

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,340
Episode 3

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,840
How's it going?

4
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
Is he dead?

5
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,800
Of course he's fine.

6
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,480
I've cut him off.

7
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,000
Look here.

8
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,480
Look here.

9
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,400
Ma San?

10
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,520
How could it be you?

11
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,320
I'm going to say that Wu Ming

12
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,760
is very loyal to you.

13
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,760
Maybe he's right in front of you.

14
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,440
Impossible.

15
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,760
He's still in the square.

16
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,880
He can't find this place.

17
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,400
That's not for sure.

18
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,480
How did you find this place?

19
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,120
You were still in the square just now.

20
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,200
Do you want to know?

21
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,800
We've checked the terrain in advance.

22
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,680
We found a wire on the ground.

23
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,280
We guessed that you wanted to create

24
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,960
a scene of an accident.

25
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,880
Since you've arranged such a big show,

26
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,640
we can only teach you how to save the chicken.

27
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,520
You thought I was the one who was watching.

28
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,960
But I actually left long ago.

29
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,200
Go save him, Senior.

30
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,120
Go.

31
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,240
When you were on the phone with San,

32
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,600
I was on the phone.

33
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,600
So I wanted to lock you in a very simple place.

34
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,680
So you were tricked.

35
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,480
If you really want to save them,

36
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,160
I'll vote for you.

37
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,320
Go, go.

38
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,960
Ye Hongming.

39
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,320
Uncle, auntie.

40
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,320
Let's go.

41
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,440
I'll arrange for you to go to the mountains

42
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,480
to rest for a while.

43
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,280
Let's go.

44
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:37,960
Okay.

45
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,160
Hongming.

46
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,360
Thank you.

47
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,520
I can only let them leave here first.

48
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,600
They are your weak points.

49
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,440
If it's really dangerous,

50
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,320
I can only care about you,

51
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,400
but not them.

52
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,480
Be a bodyguard.

53
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,080
I'm a professional.

54
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,520
Let's go.

55
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,840
This is the stone that Ye Wu Ming broke.

56
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,120
The authentic Ba Xian Quan.

57
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,040
I didn't expect

58
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,240
this kid is the successor of Ba Xian Men.

59
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,120
Tianhao.

60
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,520
You've done a great job this time.

61
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,840
If he's the descendant of that thing,

62
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,960
wouldn't we be in more trouble?

63
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,200
Do you remember

64
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,640
Mr. Ma?

65
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,240
That thing that the turtle can't play

66
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,120
is related to Mr. Ma?

67
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,080
Mr. Ma once rewarded

68
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,880
the descendant of Ba Xian Men.

69
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,880
No matter what,

70
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,080
Mr. Ma's brother, Ma Nan,

71
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,840
has always been in his position.

72
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,840
Let's play another game.

73
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,200
Let Ye Wu Ming be the scapegoat.

74
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,160
Go.

75
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,040
Send the video and photos to Ma Nan.

76
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,840
I'll go right now.

77
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,120
Go.

78
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,640
I've been taking this medicine for two months.

79
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,440
Why is my brother still in a good state?

80
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,880
Can you do it?

81
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,960
It's been two days.

82
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,080
The effect of the medicine can't be controlled.

83
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,360
You have to find the scapegoat quickly.

84
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,840
Otherwise,

85
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,000
it might be a relapse in these two days.

86
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,080
Brother.

87
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,080
Brother.

88
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,600
Are you okay?

89
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,360
You're getting old.

90
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,000
Your body is getting worse.

91
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,040
Why didn't you come here

92
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,440
when you were in the group?

93
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,440
Here's the thing.

94
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,320
I received an email from you.

95
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,560
There's a video inside.

96
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,360
It's about the reward of our group.

97
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,160
Take a look.

98
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,280
Reward?

99
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,400
It's the authentic Ba Xian Quan.

100
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,160
The broken stones are broken from the pulse.

101
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,000
Other punches can't do it.

102
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,760
Ye Wu Ming is the one who eats soft food.

103
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,640
He broke the leg of a female star, Song Yi Ran.

104
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,720
Go arrange a meeting

105
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,280
and invite Song Yi Ran here.

106
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,720
Don't mention Ye Wu Ming.

107
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,160
Don't alert him.

108
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,400
Okay, brother. I got it.

109
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,360
I found the scapegoat.

110
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,040
It's the real one.

111
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,120
Don't worry, Mr. Nan.

112
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,680
Wu Ming, look.

113
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,720
Mr. Ma is a senior in the industry.

114
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,240
He has hundreds of billions of assets.

115
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,920
The Wu Wei Film Company

116
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,720
is the fifth film company in the world.

117
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,320
But why did he suddenly invite me?

118
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,960
Does he want to sign a contract with me?

119
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,960
If you can sign his contract,

120
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,600
will Mr. Li

121
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,200
be too embarrassed to listen to the nonsense?

122
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,560
I'll go change.

123
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,840
Hello, Mr. Li.

124
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,080
Ye Wu Ming is here.

125
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,960
Dad, what should we do next?

126
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,480
Do you know if Ye Wu Ming can use the needle?

127
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,840
Mr. Ma's poison is

128
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,040
specifically for the needle.

129
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,480
Please wait.

130
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,960
As long as Mr. Ma

131
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,280
dies at this time,

132
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,160
and Ye Wu Ming uses the needle to save people,

133
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,600
he is the murderer.

134
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,400
Welcome to the Han Club.

135
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,560
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

136
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,560
Little brother, please come in.

137
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,960
Brother.

138
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:56,960
Brother.

139
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,960
What's wrong, brother?

140
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,360
Mr. Ma.

141
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:58,960
Mr. Ma.

142
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,960
Mr. Ma.

143
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,960
Mr. Ma.

144
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,960
Mr. Ma.

145
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,960
Doctor.

146
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,960
Call an ambulance.

147
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,960
It's already called.

148
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,960
Half an hour to go.

149
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,960
The ambulance is so late.

150
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,960
My brother is dead.

151
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,960
Mr. Ma is very unwell now.

152
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,960
And he can't move around.

153
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,960
How can we let him do it?

154
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,960
Because he's hot-hearted.

155
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,960
Next, we'll see about Anan.

156
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,960
There's no other way.

157
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,960
We can only wait for the ambulance.

158
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,960
Aren't you my brother's doctor?

159
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,960
If something happens to my brother,

160
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,960
don't try to leave.

161
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,960
Hurry up. Let's try again.

162
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,960
I can save him.

163
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Mr. Ma, the star is awake.

164
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
Brother.

165
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
Brother.

166
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,960
Brother.

167
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
Mr. Ma.

168
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
Mr. Ma.

169
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,960
Mr. Ma.

170
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,960
Mr. Ma, he's out of heart.

171
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,960
Ye Wuming, you murderer.

172
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,960
Ye Wuming, you killed my brother.

173
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
With the real wine.

174
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
Nonsense.

175
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,960
You said you couldn't do it.

176
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,960
No one can leave today.

177
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,960
Mr. Li, it's done.

178
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,960
According to the medicine,

179
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,960
we can announce the death in five minutes.

180
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,960
You're really hopeless.

181
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,960
Ye Wuming has become a murderer.

182
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,960
Finally, the one who loves to play is out.

183
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,960
I don't think Ye Wuming will dare to leave

184
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,960
without Ye Wuming.

185
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,960
Brother.

186
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,960
Chen Ai hasn't settled down yet.

187
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,960
Be happy.

188
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,960
We'll celebrate in five minutes.

189
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,960
You're out of heart.

190
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,960
What's the use of doing this?

191
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,960
Ye Wuming, I've called the police.

192
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,960
When the police come,

193
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,960
I'll send you to the police station.

194
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,960
Ye Wuming, I've called the police.

195
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
When the police come,

196
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,960
I'll send you to the police station.

197
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,960
When the police come,

198
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,960
I'll send you to the police station.

199
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,960
Come on.

200
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,960
Help me up.

201
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,960
Slowly.

202
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,960
I'm really having a heart attack.

203
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,560
Uncle, you're not having a heart attack.

204
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,360
You're just being poisoned.

205
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,560
And it's been at least two months.

206
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,160
I just helped you reduce your toxicity.

207
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,560
I'll give you another dose of the medicine.

208
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,560
It'll be enough to take a month.

209
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,160
But you have to be careful of the people around you.

210
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,960
Looks like someone doesn't want you to live long.

211
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,560
What do you think you're doing?

212
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,560
Stop lying to me!

213
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,560
I didn't say it was you.

214
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,560
You're the best.

215
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,960
You're the best.

216
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,760
Uncle, find someone you can trust.

217
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,760
And welcome the medicine you've been taking.

218
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,160
You know everything.

219
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,960
Mr. Ma, don't worry.

220
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,160
I'll take care of this.

221
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,760
Brother, how could I harm you?

222
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,960
You keep saying that the Eight Sages Sect is our enemy.

223
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,160
This guy is from the Eight Sages Sect.

224
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,160
He's definitely trying to set us up.

225
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,960
Shut up!

226
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,760
I'll settle this.

227
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,360
Little brother, help me up.

228
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,760
Okay.

229
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,760
What's wrong?

230
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,560
Mr. Ma has been saved.

231
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,560
Saved?

232
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,360
Didn't you say he was forced to die?

233
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,560
Who saved him?

234
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,160
Who else?

235
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,960
Ye Wu Ming.

236
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,560
It's him again.

237
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,560
It's him again!

238
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,160
It's him again!

239
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,560
It's him again!

240
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,360
It's him again!

241
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,360
Wait for me.

242
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,160
Mr. Ma, the results are out.

243
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,560
Look.

244
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,160
An Nan!

245
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,960
You dared to instigate the doctor to harm me

246
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,560
just to take the Ma family's wealth?

247
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,160
The Ma family was involved in the accident. It was you who betrayed us.

248
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,360
I didn't expect that you still don't know how to repent.

249
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,960
Take him to the police station.

250
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,960
Brother.

251
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,960
Little brother, I called you here

252
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,960
to confirm if you are the successor of the Eight Sages Sect.

253
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,360
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

254
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,560
But I really am not the successor you mentioned.

255
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,960
The Eight Sages Sect saved my life.

256
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,360
If it wasn't for the Eight Sages Sect,

257
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,160
the Four Great Sects wouldn't have lost money so easily.

258
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,360
Little brother, you saved my life again today.

259
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,560
Half of the wealth of the Qianli Group

260
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,160
can be yours.

261
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,160
Thank you, Mr. Ma. I can't take this money.

262
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,360
You must repay me. It's the rule of the Ma family.

263
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,160
Mr. Ma, thank you for your kindness.

264
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,960
But I don't want anything.

265
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,560
Here. This is the prescription for your illness.

266
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,760
Take good care of yourself.

267
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,360
I'm going.

268
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,560
Thank you.

269
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,360
Take care.

270
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,560
I was thinking of bringing you to see the world.

271
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,560
I didn't expect that I'm the one who's ugly.

272
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,560
You're the master they really want to marry.

273
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,960
You Ming, I didn't expect that other than girls like you,

274
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,960
you're quite popular among the old men.

275
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,160
You can't say that.

276
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,760
Mr. Ma is being polite to me.

277
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,560
It's all because of the beauty Song.

278
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,960
Enough. Third just called me.

279
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,560
All the dogs at home have left. Let's go home.

280
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,160
Let's go home.

281
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,760
You're finally back, my big house.

282
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,960
I miss you so much.

283
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,160
Look at my Italian designer hand-made limitless sofa.

284
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
They're back.

285
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,360
Wow, the sunlight is so different here.

286
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,160
This tablecloth...

287
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,160
It's a little dirty. Let's wash our hands.

288
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,360
Let's go.
