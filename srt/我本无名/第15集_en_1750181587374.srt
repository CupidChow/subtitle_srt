1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The whole universe shines because of me

2
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,180
pastor

3
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,180
it is up to you

4
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,700
you are here to see me ?

5
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,900
do what ?

6
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,200
if tomorrow almost 800 will be on the show

7
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,600
all the movie stocks will be mine

8
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,180
and yours will be in wuguage

9
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,920
bro

10
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:26,460
now you can desert about 100 movies

11
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,560
they are all yours

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,400
I'll give you all the shares of Xiuli Cangzhen

13
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,240
if you win.

14
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,080
But if you lose,

15
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,600
her new movie will be released

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,320
in the micro-industry.

17
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,200
You have to give me all the shares.

18
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,720
Deal.

19
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,960
Kai.

20
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,720
Kai.

21
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,400
Kai.

22
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,000
Kai.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,680
Kai.

24
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,320
You guys go over there.

25
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,280
We'll go over here.

26
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:51,920
Okay.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,920
Boss Ye.

28
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,560
Have some tea.

29
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,120
How's it going, Manager Li?

30
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,760
No problem.

31
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,280
Boss Ye is now in his prime.

32
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,200
He thinks that money can buy a machine.

33
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,400
But reality is often very cruel.

34
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,800
Money is not everything.

35
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,800
It's not something that can be bought.

36
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,440
It can buy every manager of the county.

37
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,480
I don't need any money.

38
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,800
Get out of here with your money.

39
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,280
Don't try to force me.

40
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,680
I won't agree.

41
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,280
How many more are there?

42
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,400
Two more.

43
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
Find some.

44
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,720
Bro.

45
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,160
I'm afraid this isn't your wife.

46
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,520
I'm the one.

47
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,600
What should we do?

48
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,720
They've already sold 164.

49
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,720
Go and arrange it.

50
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,200
Find 20 good managers of the county that are related to us.

51
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,800
Tell them to definitely not let him go.

52
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Okay.

53
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,080
Boss Ye.

54
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,400
Have some tea.

55
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,680
The night is shining.

56
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,640
Call me back.

57
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,840
As soon as the meeting starts.

58
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,520
Still calling?

59
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,520
Go back to work right now.

60
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,440
The meeting is mother- begining now.

61
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,240
I have prototype scale work to go.

62
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,240
There are 204 music halls in the whole city.

63
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,240
But we have only 20.

64
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,240
You're doomed.

65
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,240
Young man, do you know where you stand?

66
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,240
I'm a man of my word.

67
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,240
You're too arrogant.

68
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,240
You only see the surface.

69
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,240
We have 200 music halls.

70
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,240
As long as I have the least of them,

71
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,240
you can achieve your goal.

72
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,240
You have to know that

73
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,240
to make a move, you have to do it.

74
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,240
It's a matter of honor.

75
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,240
You're indeed Mr. Li.

76
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,240
You can say such a despicable thing.

77
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,240
I lost, I lost.

78
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,240
Why are you talking nonsense?

79
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,240
Qin, get the contract.

80
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,240
You're so independent.

81
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,240
Aren't you afraid that I'll turn the tables?

82
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,240
You think you can see me talking?

83
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,240
You're so stubborn.

84
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,240
How do you know that we have 204 music halls?

85
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,240
What are you doing?

86
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,240
Manager Zhang.

87
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,240
Yes.

88
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,240
We're here to help you.

89
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,240
You're really a free-range.

90
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,240
Our 30 music halls are supposed to be closed.

91
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,240
With this money,

92
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,240
we can open it right away.

93
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,240
I'll arrange the movie later.

94
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,240
I'll go now.

95
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,240
Look.

96
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,240
It's not good.

97
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,240
I don't think it's good.

98
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,240
I think it's not good.

99
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,240
Not good.

100
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,240
Today, I'm the official film of 214 movie theaters.

101
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,240
The movie starring the famous actress Song Yi Ran.

102
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,240
The show is Li Cang Zhen.

103
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,240
The audience is very enthusiastic.

104
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,240
The movie tickets are sold out.

105
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,240
It caused a huge reaction.

106
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,240
This move is actually very deep.

107
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
It's quite wonderful.

108
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,240
Mr. Li is so good at commercial drugs.

109
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,240
I believe.

110
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,240
He will definitely be a star.

111
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,240
Tea.

112
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,240
What is he?

113
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,240
You should ask me what to do.

114
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,240
What to do?

115
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,240
How do I know what to do?

116
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,240
Brother Kai is so hidden.

117
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,240
It's all Mr. Ye's arrangement.

118
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,240
I'm just taking my brothers to commercial drugs.

119
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,240
Mr. Ye.

120
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,240
You've worked hard, Brother Kai.

121
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,240
I've already paid the money.

122
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,240
Take your brothers to the second floor of Wen Jun Hotel tonight.

123
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,240
I'll arrange it.

124
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,240
No need.

125
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,240
I don't want to owe you.

126
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,240
You're talking to me about this?

127
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,240
I just think

128
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,240
Brother Kai is so capable.

129
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,240
It's a pity to do the price.

130
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,240
I like the price.

131
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,240
I'm free.

132
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,240
Our Wuwei影業

133
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,240
is missing a market director.

134
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
We need to add a million to the annual salary.

135
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,240
Brother Kai, think about it.

136
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,240
I can't change this fake.

137
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,240
There's still one million left.

138
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,240
Brother Kai.

139
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,240
How much do we have to pay for this one million?

140
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,240
This money can not only support yourself,

141
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,240
but also our brothers.

142
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,240
You're talking nonsense.

143
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,240
Brother Kai, don't be angry.

144
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
Do you remember

145
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,240
the life principles I taught you back then?

146
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,240
You taught us back then

147
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,240
to be able to be beautiful and rich.

148
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,240
To make me happy.

149
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,240
We're always missing

150
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,240
the position of market director.

151
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,240
We can't do much.

152
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,240
Do you think we should hire someone?

153
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,240
No hurry.

154
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,240
They should be here soon.

155
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,240
Just in time.

156
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,240
Director Geng,

157
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,240
go and take me to the auction.

158
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
Go.

159
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,240
Brother Kai.

160
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,240
I'm Mr. Ye.

161
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,240
Mr. Ye.

162
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,240
Mr. Ye,

163
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,240
it was my fault before.

164
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,240
I'll marry you from now on.

165
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,240
It was before.

166
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,240
Now we're all good brothers.

167
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,240
Let's make money together.

168
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,240
Come on.

169
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,240
Brother Kai, we used to be in the same line.

170
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,240
From now on, we're colleagues.

171
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,240
Mr. Ye is great.

172
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,240
I admire you.

173
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
You're a great man.

174
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,240
Brother Kai,

175
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,240
you can't say that.

176
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,240
This is Mr. Ma's company.

177
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,240
Mr. Ma's surname is Ma.

178
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,240
I'm also named Ma.

179
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,240
Don't you have any pity?

180
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
Tell you the truth, Brother Kai.

181
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
I'm Mr. Ma's...

182
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,240
Son.

183
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,240
...son.

184
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,240
What are you thinking about, Brother Kai?

185
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,240
I'm a driver.

186
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,240
Of course.

187
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,240
Mr. Feng, you're here.

188
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,240
Ye Wu Ming's film company

189
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,240
is now in full swing.

190
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,240
His movie

191
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,240
will be released soon.

192
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,240
It'll be harder to deal with him in the future.

193
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,240
Don't worry.

194
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
Someone will take the initiative

195
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,240
to solve this problem.

196
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,240
He's in the middle of the day.

197
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
Who would be willing to take action now?

198
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,240
The enemy is bloody.

199
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,240
It's not a good idea to blame him.

200
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,240
The famous master of the

201
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,240
Yijiang Engineering's warehouse

202
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,240
is Zhang Tianci, the late leader of the Baxian Spring.

203
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,240
When Zhang Tianci was traveling around,

204
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,240
he defeated many masters abroad.

205
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
Some masters

206
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,240
are not worthy of humiliation and kill themselves.

207
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,240
Do you think this is not fair?

208
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,240
Yes.

209
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,240
Those disciples are waiting to take revenge.

210
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,240
I didn't expect Zhang Tianci to die three years ago.

211
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,240
Ye Wu Ming is Zhang Tianci's authentic successor.

212
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,240
The revenge of not taking revenge

213
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,240
will naturally be in his hands.

214
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,240
That's great.

215
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,240
They know

216
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,240
that they will definitely take revenge on Ye Wu Ming.

217
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,240
I have to do many things

218
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,240
with my own strength.

219
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,240
I have to learn to kill people with a sword.

220
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
Kill people with a sword?

221
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,240
Here he comes.

222
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,240
These are the three masters that Mr. Feng mentioned?

223
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,240
Why are you dressed so strange?

224
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,240
The Baxian Spring is mine.

225
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,240
I want to take it back.

226
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
I must have the blood of the Baxian Spring

227
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,240
to wash Zhang Tianci's humiliation.

228
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,240
I came here for one purpose.

229
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,240
I will kill Ye Wu Ming

230
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,240
or be killed by Ye Wu Ming.

231
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,240
Yu Ran!

232
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,240
Yu Ran!

233
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,240
Yu Ran!

234
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,240
Stop acting.

235
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,240
You are acting too fake.

236
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,240
Get up.

237
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,240
I have been preparing for a long time.

238
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,240
Why don't you give me artificial respiration?

239
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,240
The props are not right.

240
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,240
You should use a rope.

241
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,240
With a knife, the artificial respiration will die faster.

242
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,240
Really?

243
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,240
Yes.

244
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,240
This is how it died in the script.

245
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,240
How can they lie to me?

246
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,240
Yu Ran,

247
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,240
don't make such a joke with me.

248
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,240
Wu Ming,

249
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,240
don't be angry.

250
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,240
I just want you to use artificial respiration.

251
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,240
What about you?

252
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,240
Billing J則是不值level?

253
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,240
It Poland is based on a little original script.

254
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,240
This thing is now registered.

255
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,240
Hurry.

256
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,440
Where can I get you around in America?

257
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,240
Ok.

258
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,540
This Newickers has won three games in infrastructure officials.

259
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,240
I said it was the first game in your life.

260
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,240
Raise your hands and get back to work.

261
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,240
All right.

262
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,240
Come on.

263
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,240
Every match in the test.

264
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,680
Are there three masters coming today?

265
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,760
These three

266
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,080
are the top masters in the martial arts world.

267
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,360
As a joint producer,

268
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,800
it's not easy for me to find them.

269
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,160
That's good.

270
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:10,800
OK.

271
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,480
Let's start shooting.

272
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,520
Come on.

273
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,320
Well,

274
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
get ready.

275
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,920
Three, two, one.

276
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:30,800
Go.

277
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,120
Bro, are you OK?

278
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,840
Director, director.

279
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,840
No, director.

280
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,840
Send the hospital.

281
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,440
Change a dance.

282
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,240
OK, got it.

283
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,680
It's a waste of time.

284
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,960
Is there anyone who can fight?

285
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,000
There's no suitable dance?

286
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,400
Can you shoot?

287
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,160
If not, just call it a day.

288
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,320
No one.

289
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,160
Say something.

290
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,520
Can you get someone out?

291
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,360
I'll do it.

292
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,280
Be careful, bro.

293
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,520
You hit me so hard.

294
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,640
I know it's a waste of time.

295
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,160
It's like a piece of paper.

296
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,000
Time is money, Mr. Ye.

297
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,640
Am I right?

298
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,800
I thought

299
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,080
the Baxian Boxing was so powerful.

300
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,480
It's all

301
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,480
the useless Baxian Boxing.

302
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,280
Did the Baxian Gate

303
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,480
go bankrupt?

304
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,640
Where is he?

305
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,320
Let me do it.
