1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The whole universe shines because of me

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Why is he here?

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Why are you here?

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Sister Yi Ran sent me a message

6
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
asking me to talk about the contract.

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This is the contract.

8
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
He took a shower.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Go in.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Why is he here?

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Sister Ling Long is here too?

12
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yue Ling Long is really important here.

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Lu Bing Qing is really not the right time.

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It seems that only Yong Ma is the closest.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I have to find a way to get rid of Brother and solve it.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Fortunately, I prepared in advance.

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You Ming, what's going on?

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What's going on?

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Maybe he jumped off.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'll go and have a look.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's so dark.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Light a candle.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This is the incense I made specially.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Drink some water.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Do you want to smell it?

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Let me see.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
My incense is starting to work.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's so hot.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
If you want to blame, blame yourself.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll kick you out now.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Oh no.

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Why did he come back so soon?

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You can't hug him.

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What are you doing?

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Let go.

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You can't hug him.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Help me with the evidence.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I didn't do anything.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Let go.

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What's that sound?

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You two go out quickly.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Quickly.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm talking to you.

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You Ming.

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You Ming.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You Ming.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Don't come in.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
If he prepared any surprise for me,

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
wouldn't I be upset when I open the door?

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It smells good.

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's quite romantic.

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It smells good.

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Senior, are you hot?

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
He's smoking.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He's smoking.

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He's smoking.

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
He's smoking.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
How did you do that?

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Senior, you're mine now.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Senior.

61
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Senior.

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Senior.

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The candle.

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The candle is poisonous.

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
He Ming.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Senior.

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
There are three beautiful women in this room.

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Can you bear it?

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Senior.

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm wet.

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Help me wipe it.

72
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Senior, can you help me wipe this?

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm wet.

74
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm wet.

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm wet.

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Senior.

77
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Do you want me to do it yourself?

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Senior.

79
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You're all sweaty.

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Water...

81
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
There's something wrong with the water.

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,340
Tiongè¿‘ deng

83
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,600
Yiran

84
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,300
Wait

85
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,400
Let me twist you

86
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,400
Dad help me

87
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
Dad

88
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,380
help me

89
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,200
let me finish

90
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,200
You're poisoned now.

91
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,000
No.

92
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,680
Stay.

93
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,240
If you leave, I'll be left alone.

94
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,240
I can control the medicine too.

95
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,720
Doctor.

96
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,560
Doctor.

97
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,840
Here, take this.

98
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,800
A bad omen?

99
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,480
I'll teach you a lesson today.

100
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,240
Next time, I'll kill you.

101
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,760
Wu Ming, what happened to me?

102
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,840
You were poisoned with the incense.

103
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,040
You're fine now.

104
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,200
Your wound...

105
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,080
Your skin.

106
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,040
Let me see.

107
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,720
Does it hurt?

108
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,320
From now on, don't ever make a scene with Song Yi Ran again.

109
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,880
Or else, I'll let you

110
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,880
take this flower ring.

111
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,920
Since I was young,

112
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,520
no one has ever protected me like this.

113
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,240
Tian Wu Ming,

114
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,080
you're the first one.

115
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,760
No.

116
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,880
It's getting colder.

117
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,680
Get lost.

118
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,560
It hurts.

119
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,600
Yi Ran, explain it to me.

120
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,040
He pushed me away.

121
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,600
Ye Wu Ming.

122
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,920
He doesn't even forget the pain.

123
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,440
Senior.

124
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,160
Yi Ran left.

125
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,320
How about we continue?

126
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,760
No.

127
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,960
Senior.

128
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,720
Song Yi Ran.

129
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,160
You dare to take my senior away.

130
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,320
Then I'll take everything from you.

131
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,760
Why are you looking for me?

132
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,240
You want Song Yi Ran.

133
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,760
I want Ye Wu Ming.

134
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,280
Let's split them up

135
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,240
and get what we want.

136
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,680
You want to hurt Song Yi Ran.

137
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,680
I won't agree.

138
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,320
I won't work with you.

139
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,800
Think about it.

140
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,720
How can the senior Song Yi Ran care about you?

141
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,720
He'll only look at you when he's in the dark.

142
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,400
If you don't do it,

143
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,360
your father will do it too.

144
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,160
By then, he'll only live a miserable life.

145
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,560
I believe that Mr. Li

146
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,560
will make him happy.

147
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,880
Tell me.

148
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,680
Tomorrow, when we shoot the ad,

149
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,680
I'll arrange a small accident.

150
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,280
You just need to arrange someone

151
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,280
to shoot the ad.

152
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,360
I can use the video.

153
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,280
You'd better be more reliable.

154
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,360
The script arranged

155
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,160
the fight between me and Yue Ling Long.

156
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,560
Why didn't anyone tell me in advance?

157
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
Let me see.

158
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,600
There must be a demon in the world.

159
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,800
If they really have a conspiracy,

160
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,120
I'm worried that you'll be in danger.

161
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,120
Really?

162
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,040
But there's a rule at the shooting site.

163
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,040
You can only wait for me outside.

164
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
Go up first.

165
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,920
I have a way to get in.

166
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,720
Okay.

167
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,720
Look at you.

168
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,840
Look at you.

169
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,600
I want to be handsome.

170
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Old Yuan.

171
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,480
Can I do it?

172
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:07,960
Okay.

173
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,480
Just you.

174
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:08,840
Go.

175
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,400
Okay.

176
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
Change clothes.

177
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,360
Sister.

178
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,320
I think our action

179
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,520
is not very smooth.

180
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,520
How about we practice again?

181
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,240
Okay.

182
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,240
Come on.

183
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,840
Sister.

184
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,400
You haven't eaten yet.

185
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
You're too fake.

186
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,440
Again.

187
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,400
How can you hit me?

188
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,080
Is there anyone?

189
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,080
I'm not shooting.

190
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,680
Brother.

191
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,080
It's too hot.

192
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,600
What?

193
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,240
Clear.

194
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,240
Very clear.

195
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,520
How to cut it?

196
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,320
Don't worry. I'm familiar with it.

197
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,320
It's sharp.

198
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
It's sharp.

199
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,320
It's sharp.

200
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,320
It's sharp.

201
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,320
It's sharp.

202
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,320
It's sharp.

203
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,320
It's sharp.

204
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,320
It's sharp.

205
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
It's sharp.

206
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,400
It's sharp.

207
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,400
Look at this.

208
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,400
Song Yi Ran played the big card.

209
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,400
The scene was great.

210
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
It's not good.

211
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
Or it's called

212
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,400
the female star who played the big card.

213
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,400
The first one is her.

214
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,400
You're good.

215
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,400
Playing the big card, scolding the director, fighting with the opponent.

216
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
But I'm a good girl.

217
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
This is good.

218
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
This is good.

219
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,400
Sharp, sharp, sharp, sharp.

220
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,480
You two are talented.

221
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,480
Card.

222
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,480
I can't beat her.

223
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,480
The card was stolen.

224
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,480
Why did Ye Wu Ming come in?

225
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,480
How do I know?

226
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,480
Didn't you tell me that everything is lost?

227
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,480
I said that everything is lost

228
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,480
according to my plan.

229
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,480
Now the plan has changed.

230
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,480
Do you know this is my last chance?

231
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,480
You tell me now that the plan has changed.

232
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,480
Are you a kid?

233
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,480
You only know to push the responsibility when you encounter something.

234
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,480
If you didn't get Ye Wu Ming in,

235
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,480
how could we get him?

236
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,560
Boss, are you blaming me now?

237
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,560
No.

238
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,560
Think about it.

239
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,560
Okay.

240
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,560
I have a way.

241
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,560
I'm waiting for you.

242
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,560
Go to the toilet.

243
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,560
Toilet?

244
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,560
You know to go to the toilet all day.

245
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,560
Let me tell you.

246
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,560
You can break this in one punch.

247
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,560
It's okay.

248
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,560
It's a little bit foamy.

249
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,560
Is it okay?

250
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,560
Okay.

251
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,560
Any problem?

252
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,560
No problem.

253
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,560
Okay, come here.

254
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,560
Go.

255
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,640
Go.

256
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,640
Go.

257
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,640
It seems that this is a real one.

258
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,640
But it's still your fist.

259
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,640
You even fight with bulls.

260
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,640
I'll blow your hand.

261
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
Okay.

262
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,640
Come on.

263
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,640
Come on.

264
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,640
Three, two, one, go.

265
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,640
Are you okay?

266
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,640
Are you okay?

267
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,640
I'm okay.

268
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,640
Come on, wipe your sweat.

269
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,640
Repair it.

270
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,640
Sister, you haven't eaten.

271
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
It's too fake.

272
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
Come again.

273
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,640
I'm sorry.

274
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,640
I'm sorry.

275
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,640
I'm sorry.

276
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,640
I'm sorry.

277
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,640
I'm sorry.

278
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
I'm sorry.

279
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,640
I'm sorry.

280
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,640
I'm sorry.

281
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,640
I'm sorry.

282
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,640
I'm sorry.

283
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,640
I'm sorry.

284
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,640
I'm sorry.

285
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,720
Again.

286
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,720
I know his plan.

287
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,720
I've thought about it.

288
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
Come on.

289
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,720
We have to contact.

290
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,720
Listen to me.

291
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,720
We have to contact.

292
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,720
Get on the car.

293
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,720
Let me tell you.

294
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,720
We have to hurry up today.

295
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,720
What is this?

296
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,720
All the videos that slander you are all here.

297
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,720
Only one.

298
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,720
The rest is deleted.

299
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,720
Can't find it.

300
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,720
How did you get it?

301
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,720
I took it when I was in the inn.

302
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,720
So awesome.

303
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,720
Go.

304
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,720
Go.

305
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,720
Brother.

306
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,720
Who are you?

307
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,720
Who is your brother?

308
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,720
I'm San'er.

309
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,720
Sit down.

310
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,720
Sit down.

311
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,720
Brother.

312
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,720
I almost got taken away by those electricians.

313
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
I can't go back.

314
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,720
Brother, I'll pour you a glass of water.

315
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,720
Come on.

316
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,720
Drink water.

317
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,720
Give me my own.

318
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
Don't move.

319
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
I ask you.

320
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
Why is my key in the Moon Dragon?

321
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,800
I don't know Yuling.

322
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,800
You don't know her?

323
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
You don't know her?

324
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,800
You don't know her?

325
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
She doesn't blame me.

326
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,800
She took the initiative to find me.

327
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
She is your sister and a big star.

328
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
So I...

329
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
Go.

330
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
I'll send you back.

331
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,800
Go.

332
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,800
I...

333
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
She gave me too much.

334
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
I don't want to work hard.

335
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,800
I'll be cheated if I go out.

336
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,800
Brother.

337
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,800
I swear.

338
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,800
I'll ignore her.

339
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,800
San'er.

340
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
I know you want to make up for it.

341
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,880
So I want you to be the spy for the Moon Dragon.

342
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,880
At the same time, you have to be the spy for Song Yi Ran.

343
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,880
Double spy.

344
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,880
Brother.

345
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
Brother.

346
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,880
Double plus double.

347
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,880
Brother.

348
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,880
When do we start?

349
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,880
Hello.

350
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,880
Ye Wu Ming.

351
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,960
I want to know the truth about your master's death.

352
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,960
Bai Bu Ye City, 982nd floor.

353
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,960
I'm the one who knows the truth.

354
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,960
