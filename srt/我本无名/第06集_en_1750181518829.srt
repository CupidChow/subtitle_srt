00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 16

2
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,440
Xia Ruosan is at my house.

3
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,520
How do you know

4
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,880
you want to find him and marry him?

5
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,560
Is there something between you two?

6
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,240
Let me make it clear first.

7
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,200
I really don't know him.

8
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,000
It's the first time I've seen him.

9
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,280
We're really fine today.

10
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,280
It's really the first time we've seen each other.

11
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,000
fascination

12
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,680
What exactly is Mr. Su looking for me for?

13
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,960
Could it be

14
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,080
a record of the legend?

15
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,080
Mr. Su.

16
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,760
Interesting smile!

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But does he really want to owe me money?

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Why hasn't he come out yet?

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What are they talking about?

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Hello?

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm not buying a house. Thank you.

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Junior, we finally meet again.

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Director Su, you must have mistaken me for someone else.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I don't know you.

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This is the seal that Master gave you.

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It can improve your strength.

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Do you feel that sometimes you can't control yourself?

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yes. Yes.

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Director Su, what else do you know?

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Three years ago, you went down the mountain to train.

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Since then, you have not been able to do anything.

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I didn't expect you to lose your job.

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Chen Jian, you fell down.

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You're a traitor.

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Han Xiong.

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I have the impression of Master.

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The day you left,

38
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Master died.

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Then why did Master die suddenly?

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
This matter is full of doubts. Very strange.

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I must find out Master's death.

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Junior, don't be a bodyguard.

43
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Come to Mingzhu Group to be the vice president.

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
We'll investigate together.

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I promised Song Yi Ran to be his bodyguard.

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I have to keep my trust.

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Is he very important to you?

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I don't know.

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay, I respect your choice.

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But the position of vice president will be kept for you.

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You can come at any time.

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Thank you for your kindness.

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But if you are my senior,

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
why didn't you come to me before?

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Master's death must have a conspiracy.

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
In order to ensure the safety of you and Junior,

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I think it is not public.

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You know, Mr. Su said ...

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I miss you.

60
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Do you want to know what happened upstairs?

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm not very curious.

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
OK.

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I won't say it. Let's go.

64
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
If you are angry,

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll be angry too.

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
If you insist,

67
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
just say it.

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Mr. Su said

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
she is my senior.

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Senior?

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Mr. Su is your senior?

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yue Ling Long is your junior.

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Your junior is going to be a team.

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I don't know.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Go home.

76
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Go to the self-media.

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
They said Song Yi Ran was hiding in the golden house.

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
There are more than one man.

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Sister, we can buy a hot search.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
OK.

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You are smart to buy a hot search.

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Song Yi Ran.

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Last time I didn't take your girl number.

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Don't blame me for being rude this time.

85
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Senior.

86
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I will definitely get you back.

87
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Don't talk.

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Come with me.

89
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I can't walk fast.

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Sorry.

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
They are just two reporters.

92
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You can't have a bad heart.

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Understand?

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Go.

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Come.

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
They are coming out.

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Hurry up.

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Song Yi Ran.

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Song Yi Ran.

100
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Song Yi Ran.

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I called you to the golden house.

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I got several men.

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Is it true?

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You are public.

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You are public.

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Your boyfriend has a name.

107
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Is he a cover?

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Answer.

109
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Answer.

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Song Yi Ran.

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Song Yi Ran.

112
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Song Yi Ran.

113
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Why are you hitting people?

114
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Not only the hot search.

115
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Even my family's home address was exposed.

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Not Mr. Li.

117
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's your sister.

118
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You want me to be safe.

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It seems that your family is not good.

120
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Let's go to a hotel.

121
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
No.

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Go to your home.

123
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
My home?

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
No.

125
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I rent with my sister.

126
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And it's old and broken.

127
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You must be not used to it.

128
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Can you not teach me so well?

129
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I can wear high heels.

130
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I can walk with my feet.

131
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And it's better if I can't.

132
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Do you have a back door?

133
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You are a man of your word.

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You are a man of your word.

135
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You are a man of your word.

136
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You are a man of your word.

137
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You are a man of your word.

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Brother Wu Ming.

139
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Why are you back?

140
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You are not used to living in a big mansion.

141
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Right?

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You should put on your clothes first.

143
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What's wrong?

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I think you are a big mansion.

145
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Hi.

146
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Are you Ma San?

147
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm an idol.

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Why are you here?

149
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Sit here.

150
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Sit here.

151
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
San, sit here.

152
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Brother, what's wrong?

153
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You should have brought a girl here.

154
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm not here to play.

155
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm here to live.

156
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Live?

157
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
We are roommates now.

158
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You are a female celebrity.

159
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's not us.

160
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's us.

161
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's us.

162
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's okay.

163
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
We can get together.

164
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Sorry to bother you.

165
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Wu Ming told me that you really want to travel.

166
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Right?

167
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I don't want to.

168
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
No.

169
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You want to.

170
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I happen to have an invitation

171
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
from a foreign travel group.

172
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You can go as long as you want.

173
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
No.

174
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
No.

175
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's not like that.

176
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I will pay you double.

177
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's not about money.

178
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I just want to travel.

179
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Right?

180
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Brother.

181
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Right?

182
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I know you like to travel.

183
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm telling you.

184
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's a little hot in Southeast Asia.

185
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The fruit is delicious.

186
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's raining.

187
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Do you like to rain?

188
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I haven't washed it for a long time.

189
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
San,

190
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
it's a secret that Song Yi Ran came to my house.

191
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You can't tell anyone.

192
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Don't worry.

193
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm the most strict person.

194
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Okay.

195
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I wish you a pleasant trip.

196
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Call me when you arrive.

197
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Okay.

198
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Let's go, San.

199
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Let's go, brother.

200
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Sister Ling Long.

201
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Guess who is back?

202
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Brother Wu Ming is back.

203
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
He brought Song Yi Ran.

204
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
This is complicated.

205
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You even know Su Ming Zhu.

206
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
He is a man of great talent.

207
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I think we should show our cards.

208
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Boss,

209
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
who are we waiting for?

210
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Mr. Li,

211
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I've disguised myself as Song Yi Ran's agent for so many years.

212
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Are you sure you want to use my card now?

213
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Lu Ming Qing,

214
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
you shouldn't have

215
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
taken out your card so early.

216
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Now Song Yi Ran is going to terminate the contract.

217
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's meaningless for you to hide it anymore.

218
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Ye Wu Ming is not simple.

219
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I still haven't figured out his background.

220
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Don't worry.

221
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Don't worry.

222
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Leave it to me.

223
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You've been an agent for so long.

224
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You're always so excited.

225
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You must be very skilled.

226
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Boss,

227
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
this...

228
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Mr. Li,

229
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
if the knife I was holding

230
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
is dead,

231
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'll change it.

232
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Okay.

233
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Okay.

234
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Defeat Ye Wu Ming.

235
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Get me Song Yi Ran's bank card.

236
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
The money will be transferred to your account.

237
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And...

238
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Remember not to break the law.

239
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I don't want to get the police involved.

240
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Boss,

241
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
let's go.

242
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Nice.

243
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Come in.

244
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
How is it?

245
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Good.

246
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You're fast at this.

247
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Isn't it great?

248
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Of course.

249
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Don't take me as an unregulated female heroine.

250
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Four years ago,

251
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I was just a little actress who worked hard for a living.

252
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I had to do all these things myself.

253
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's so dirty.

254
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So I said

255
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm a very easy-going person.

256
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
If you think I'm not easy-going,

257
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I think you should find your own problems.

258
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
What do you think?

259
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
What... What's my problem?

260
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Think about it yourself.

261
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm going to take a shower.

262
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Let's go.

263
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
A little bee.

264
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
How did you get in?

265
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Guess.

266
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You're so annoying.

267
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
What do you want?

268
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Senior,

269
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I came to help you get your memory back.

270
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's too late. I'll tell you tomorrow.

271
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's not too late, Senior.

272
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
What Senior? Senior.

273
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You're going to lock me up?

274
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Who's going to lock you up?

275
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I just want to make up with you.

276
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
How can I explain this to Yiran?

277
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I have to get rid of her quickly.

278
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I don't want to talk to you about the past now.

279
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Then we don't want the past.

280
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
We want the present.

281
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Do you like me?

282
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You guess.

283
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Like?

284
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You guess again.

285
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm a little thirsty.

286
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Why don't you pour me a glass of water?

287
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
After the candle is lit,

288
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
as long as the fragrance is absorbed,

289
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
it can stimulate desire.

290
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Drink this glass of water and go.

291
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Senior,

292
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
why do you have to be a construction worker

293
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
and paint the night sky?

294
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Come on.

295
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
We are nameless,

296
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
we are innocent,

297
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
we don't fear the world's coldness.

298
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I am

299
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
me.

300
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I know that there will be a flowering season.

301
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I will be a stubborn bird,

302
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
persistent,

303
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
and stubborn.

304
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I will be a person who

305
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
will not give up.

306
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

307
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

308
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

309
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

310
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

311
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

312
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

313
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

314
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

315
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

316
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

317
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

318
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

319
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

320
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

321
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

322
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

323
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

324
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

325
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

326
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

327
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

328
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

329
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

330
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

331
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

332
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

333
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

334
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

335
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I will be a person who will not give up.

336
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I will be a person who will not give up.
