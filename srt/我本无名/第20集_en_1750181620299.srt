1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The whole universe shines because of me

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,000
Mr. Li.

4
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,600
The task is done.

5
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,440
Ye Wu Ming is dead?

6
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,960
I pushed him downstairs

7
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,880
and disguised him as the King of the Fallen.

8
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,120
Good.

9
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,280
Once the storm is over,

10
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,520
I'll confirm the corpse

11
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,200
and give you a big reward.

12
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,200
Mr. Li,

13
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,960
you're amazing.

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,960
You can use public opinion

15
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,960
to make Ye Wu Ming suspect the murderer.

16
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,160
When Qiao Nan Chi had a car accident

17
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,360
on his way to the fish house,

18
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,160
he couldn't die in vain.

19
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,720
No one would care about his life.

20
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,320
Everyone only knows

21
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,720
Ye Wu Ming beat him.

22
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,680
How did you do

23
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,960
to blacken Song Yi Ran's video?

24
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,040
After all, I've been a film director for decades.

25
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,000
I used the technique of Meng Tai Qi

26
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,400
to pin the video

27
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,920
into the video.

28
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,400
No one could tell.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,880
That's great.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's really great.

31
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,120
Mr. Li.

32
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,800
How was it?

33
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,040
Were you surprised to see me?

34
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,840
No, that's not it.

35
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,740
Do you really think

36
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,020
you can play so well in acting?

37
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,880
The woman isn't favourite in this team.

38
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,040
One only has Socrates.

39
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,720
the most on my team.

40
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,920
You still know me well?

41
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,360
She's practically my complete incident.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,400
What?

43
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,040
And what about me?

44
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,680
One of my secret love

45
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,360
is the film director Ye Wu Ming.

46
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,440
That was a quick senile tale.

47
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,180
It's the seed of

48
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,180
Are you okay?

49
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,860
Wu Min.

50
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,020
It's a pity that you don't act.

51
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,060
Brother Wu Min.

52
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,420
You're so good.

53
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,740
I want to be a star.

54
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,140
I'm not good enough

55
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,380
to take a selfie with Mr. Li.

56
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,940
I hope he can be fooled.

57
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,300
But how do you know

58
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,900
Mr. Li will come to us?

59
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,180
He's suspicious.

60
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,740
He won't believe

61
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,060
that you two have changed.

62
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,340
So let's take it as it is.

63
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,980
Call him.

64
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,420
Okay.

65
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,420
Hello, Mr. Li.

66
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,780
Let's meet up.

67
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,980
It's a surprise.

68
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,500
Let's go.

69
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,580
Hurry.

70
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,860
I've recorded what you said.

71
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,700
With these testimony,

72
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,100
it can prove Yi Ran's innocence.

73
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,180
I recorded it too.

74
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,260
Two points.

75
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,340
Song Yi Ran.

76
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,380
Song Yi Ran.

77
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,420
You're ungrateful.

78
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,500
Mr. Li.

79
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,900
You've said it so many times.

80
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,180
You don't have any new words.

81
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,340
You know how fast my knife is.

82
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,940
Wu Min doesn't let me go.

83
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,140
No one is going to leave today.

84
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,620
Isn't he your target?

85
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,780
Why are you following him?

86
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,180
The best ability of us sisters

87
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,500
is to change our ways.

88
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,420
But in front of Wu Min,

89
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,820
it's like a white snake.

90
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,300
He's the one we really admire.

91
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,060
He's the most worthy of our company.

92
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,140
Okay.

93
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,860
I admit defeat.

94
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,580
I admit defeat.

95
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,260
As long as you let me go,

96
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,820
I'll make it clear that you didn't kill him.

97
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,420
And I'll admit that

98
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,900
I made the video of the frame.

99
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,980
It's too late.

100
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,180
If I knew it, why did I do it?

101
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,860
I can do what you just said now.

102
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,940
What do you want?

103
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,540
I just want you to admit your crime and obey the law.

104
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,860
Mr. Ye.

105
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,220
You've done enough.

106
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,140
Leave the rest to the police.

107
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,740
Watch him.

108
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,340
The End

109
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,700
Brother.

110
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,860
Mr. Li has become a witness.

111
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,060
The doctor said

112
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,340
he had no sense of self-confidence.

113
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,580
Brother Kai.

114
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,460
Did you find the person who hit him?

115
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,340
Yes.

116
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,140
It's just a regular working group.

117
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,380
It has nothing to do with the four big companies.

118
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,940
From the scene,

119
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,900
it's just a regular transportation accident.

120
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:51,900
How is that possible?

121
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,180
It's not a coincidence.

122
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,500
There must be a conspiracy.

123
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,700
All coincidences are illusory.

124
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,540
Mr. Li must have been hit.

125
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,460
I went to his home and company.

126
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,260
He put all his sins

127
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,700
on his head.

128
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,460
He beat Li Tianhao, his son,

129
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,500
to death.

130
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,380
Li Tianhao is a coward.

131
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,020
He couldn't even care about his father.

132
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,780
But don't worry, brother.

133
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,260
We'll keep looking for him.

134
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,340
We'll find him sooner or later.

135
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:17,980
By the way,

136
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,780
I found a USB in his safe.

137
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,860
I put it on my fist.

138
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:26,900
Ye Wu Min.

139
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,020
Hello, Mr. Ye.

140
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,380
When you saw this video,

141
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,820
I think I was dead.

142
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,220
This is the evidence

143
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,180
that I slandered you

144
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,980
and Song Yi Ran.

145
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,260
Of course,

146
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,220
there are also videos of me apologizing to you.

147
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,100
At this point,

148
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,180
I'm not qualified to negotiate with you.

149
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,540
But

150
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,620
I still want to beg you

151
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,020
to let Tianhao go.

152
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,780
Because he doesn't

153
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,140
threaten you anymore.

154
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,940
This is a last request

155
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,620
from a father.

156
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,140
Thank you.

157
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,300
Although this man is good at bad things,

158
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,380
he is a qualified father in the future.

159
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,020
Forget it.

160
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,180
You don't have to find Li Tianhao.

161
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,700
Just play with this video.

162
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,820
Go ahead.

163
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:43,460
Let's calm down.

164
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,300
I'm sorry.

165
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,100
Ouming,

166
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,660
thank you.

167
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,580
Do we have to say this?

168
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,500
The online storm has passed.

169
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,340
I think we should announce

170
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,700
our relationship publicly.

171
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,300
Yiran,

172
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,380
although Mr. Li has been solved,

173
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,780
he's just a pawn.

174
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,500
The pawns are still there.

175
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,700
So we should

176
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,860
be more low-key.

177
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,420
Okay, I'll listen to you.

178
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,980
Senior,

179
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,700
I'm here to apologize.

180
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,860
Come in.

181
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,180
Senior,

182
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,780
Yiran,

183
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,340
I'm here to apologize to you.

184
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,980
I shouldn't have listened to Mr. Li

185
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,340
and did those things

186
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,660
to make you two feel uncomfortable.

187
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,700
I'm really sorry.

188
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,460
It's okay, Linglong.

189
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,220
I should thank you.

190
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,620
After all these,

191
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,300
I've confirmed

192
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,500
my relationship with Ouming.

193
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,340
Let bygones be bygones.

194
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,740
We should all look at you,

195
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,620
right?

196
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,500
Yiran,

197
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,900
you're so generous.

198
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,540
I feel more valuable than before.

199
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,340
Junior,

200
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,660
you and Mr. Li

201
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,220
should be free to go.

202
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,300
If you don't mind,

203
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,540
come to my place.

204
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,980
It's okay, Senior.

205
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:14,980
I've promised

206
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,180
to go to Senior.

207
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,780
It's okay.

208
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,540
We'll

209
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,220
cooperate in the future.

210
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,540
We're family.

211
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,220
Senior will help you.

212
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,500
Then

213
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,660
I'll go first.

214
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,220
I'll go first.

215
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,940
I wish you two happiness.

216
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,540
Do you think it's a pity?

217
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,220
Such a good junior

218
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,420
truly cares about you.

219
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,740
What do you think?

220
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,100
I find you

221
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:09,980
handsome.

222
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,940
It goes without saying

223
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:21,340
except to express my love for you.

224
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,140
Dad,

225
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,620
I will definitely avenge you.

226
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,020
Yiran,

227
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,780
the last scene

228
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,900
was when you drove.

229
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,100
The lion and tiger

230
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,100
You can shoot it.

231
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,500
Shoot it to death.

232
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,620
But don't worry.

233
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,900
No one is there.

234
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,780
No one is there.

235
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,340
It's safe.

236
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,380
It's fake.

237
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,380
Okay.

238
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,380
I got it.

239
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,780
You can shoot it to death.

240
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,700
Only if Song Yi Ran dies

241
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,460
can I get my revenge.

242
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:54,940
Okay?

243
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,460
Okay.

244
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:55,860
Okay.

245
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,900
You can think about it.

246
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,460
Okay?

247
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,460
Get ready.

248
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,260
Start shooting.

249
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,300
No problem.

250
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,380
Two, four, seven, twelve.

251
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,100
One, two, one, four.

252
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,420
Three, two, one.

253
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,100
Start.

254
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,100
One, two, one, two.

255
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,420
One shot.

256
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,580
Great, Yi Ran.

257
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,020
Yi Ran.

258
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,340
Yi Ran.

259
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,060
Yi Ran.

260
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,500
Yi Ran.

261
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,580
Yi Ran.

262
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:55,700
Yi Ran.

263
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:56,780
Yi Ran.

264
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,820
I'll get my revenge.

265
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:12,080
ö

266
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,740
We live in the sea

267
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:31,040
and are e area

268
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,660
I'm La Goshossa

269
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:38,560
There will be a sparkle in the winter

270
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,160
I will be stubborn

271
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,360
Only to be a legend

272
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,360
The whole universe

273
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,360
Shines because of me
