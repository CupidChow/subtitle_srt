1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The whole universe shines because of me

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,920
You...

4
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,720
How did you get out?

5
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,480
Stay here.

6
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,400
Be careful, Wu Min.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,880
9 years ago

8
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,100
Za SUU familiar

9
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,400
You have soft power just next to me.

10
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,260
Today is your end.

11
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,340
Ah this heir.

12
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,340
How could it be?

13
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,780
We've been practicing for years in the dark night.

14
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,260
How could you find us so accurately?

15
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,660
You two are indeed very similar.

16
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,100
Your movements, your posture, your speech, your tone,

17
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,340
they're all the same.

18
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,820
But no matter how similar you are,

19
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,540
there's a slight difference in your voice and your words.

20
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,380
And I have a good hearing.

21
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,300
I can tell you're two people by the way.

22
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,260
Hearing?

23
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,780
You can hear and smell?

24
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,220
I won't practice this if I'm ten years old.

25
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,500
No.

26
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,140
You're definitely not the real Ye Wu Ming.

27
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,420
The original Ye Wu Ming wasn't that strong.

28
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,940
It seems you do know me.

29
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,740
I couldn't do what I used to do.

30
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,300
Because I lost my memory of learning martial arts.

31
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,620
I was also affected by the three years of my life.

32
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,020
But now,

33
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,740
I've found everything.

34
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,700
In front of such a power,

35
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,540
we really have no chance of winning.

36
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,060
Why did you kill him?

37
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,980
We had no choice.

38
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,020
Someone paid us.

39
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,140
We received the order.

40
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,220
Our company is very strict.

41
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,700
We must complete the order.

42
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,700
Song Yi Ran is still alive.

43
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,620
We're the ones who are dead.

44
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:07,820
Let's go.

45
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,500
I'm here.

46
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,820
You can't kill him.

47
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,060
Yes.

48
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,820
We're convinced.

49
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,420
Goodbye.

50
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,060
Wu Ming.

51
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:21,900
Sorry.

52
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,740
I know we used to be very familiar.

53
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,500
But now,

54
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,500
I can't remember.

55
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,060
It's okay.

56
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,780
Let's get to know each other again.

57
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,820
Kai Ke, remember?

58
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,500
I want to recreate the scene of our first meeting.

59
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,740
I want to be exactly the same.

60
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,300
Mr. Ye doesn't recognize us now.

61
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,460
We're friends.

62
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,700
We're friends.

63
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,900
We're friends.

64
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,060
We're friends.

65
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,140
You don't know each other?

66
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,380
He's really...

67
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,700
I'll pay you extra.

68
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,620
If you get hurt, I'll treat you.

69
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:56,980
I'll treat you.

70
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,780
Okay.

71
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,620
Okay.

72
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,700
Okay. Here.

73
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,900
I'm so dizzy.

74
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,940
Hello.

75
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,740
The key is in the bag.

76
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,820
Get in the car.

77
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,180
What do you mean?

78
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,220
You're the driver.

79
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,620
You have to send me home.

80
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,980
I don't know how to drive.

81
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,660
I'm so dizzy.

82
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:35,820
Remember.

83
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,900
Come to the police station later.

84
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,660
Follow me.

85
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,660
Go, go, go.

86
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,180
This is my friend.

87
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,340
We'll send him away.

88
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,340
You?

89
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,340
What about us?

90
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,340
We...

91
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,300
I...

92
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,380
I...

93
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,380
I...

94
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:54,980
It's...

95
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,740
It's not like the script.

96
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,620
No.

97
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,860
I have to think of another way.

98
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,220
I'm so dizzy.

99
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,420
I can't hold it.

100
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,740
Why am I suddenly so dizzy?

101
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,340
Cover me.

102
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,700
My skirt is quite short.

103
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,460
I'm drunk.

104
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,900
I'm so dizzy.

105
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,580
I want to vomit.

106
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,420
I'm so dizzy.

107
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,780
You're sitting there.

108
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:42,980
You...

109
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,140
You have to be here.

110
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,540
You have to stand next to me.

111
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,500
I'm so dizzy.

112
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,780
Don't go.

113
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,780
Help.

114
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,100
Help me.

115
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,780
What are you doing?

116
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,500
I'm just drunk.

117
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,500
I'm so dizzy.

118
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,980
I'm thirsty.

119
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,220
I want some water.

120
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,100
I'm thirsty.

121
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,100
Here it comes.

122
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,300
The vomit is here.

123
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,380
It's a little disgusting,

124
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,460
but to get my memory back...

125
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:46,780
Take it.

126
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,680
no standard ripped,

127
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,140
can never be doomed.

128
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,980
This fated Mr. Feng

129
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,500
was so cruel to that woman.

130
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,960
Mr. Feng never wanted to be eaten alive,

131
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:08,540
ha

132
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,020
The problem is

133
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,600
He did that on purpose.

134
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,620
cars were ran across entire field.

135
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,460
They're sh黨i

136
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,460
and the public.

137
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,740
Under the circumstances,

138
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,540
it's too risky to give him

139
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,060
the 200 billion.

140
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,740
Since he's following the rules,

141
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,060
let's do as the rules say.

142
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,620
There's still time

143
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,060
until he's cleared of his own name.

144
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,540
Master, you were wrong.

145
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,300
Mr. Ma,

146
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,660
don't say that.

147
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,620
I'm doing everything

148
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,260
as the master's rules.

149
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,180
Okay, let's do as the rules.

150
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,740
Never mind.

151
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:50,580
Mr. Ma.

152
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,780
Never mind.

153
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,460
Sign it.

154
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,820
Okay.

155
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,820
Mr. Li.

156
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,700
Take out some materials

157
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,060
to remove what was stolen.

158
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:09,940
Don't 동안 it.

159
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,060
Just leave it useless.

160
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,220
You can sale the photos?

161
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,620
It's you again.

162
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,220
A couple's set.

163
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,500
I haven't ordered yet.

164
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,180
Then you order.

165
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,180
A couple's set.

166
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,140
Isn't it the same?

167
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,140
Come on.

168
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:28,780
Okay.

169
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,380
Do you remember anything?

170
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,540
No.

171
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,460
Boss, we want a photo.

172
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,460
Come and stand behind me.

173
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,460
Just like that photo,

174
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,340
stand behind me.

175
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,900
Hurry up.

176
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,260
Look.

177
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,460
You were comparing a...

178
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,180
A...

179
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,500
Come on.

180
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,220
Yes.

181
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,220
One, two, three.

182
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,180
Serve the dishes.

183
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:00,780
Okay.

184
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,260
Do you remember anything?

185
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,460
Look.

186
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,380
It's exactly the same.

187
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,540
No.

188
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,580
It's okay.

189
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,460
Let's go to the next place.

190
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,540
Sit down.

191
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,380
It's convenient.

192
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,740
My coat.

193
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,580
Yes, your coat.

194
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,020
You were also wearing this coat.

195
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,540
Come with me.

196
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:35,620
Here.

197
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,580
You play the role here.

198
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,460
Do you remember?

199
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,660
Play the role?

200
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,180
Here.

201
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,500
I was thinking...

202
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,380
How about this?

203
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,140
The leading actor and I have a play.

204
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,180
An action play.

205
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,660
I can't find the right emotion to express.

206
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,820
Can you help me?

207
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,500
Practice.

208
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,560
I don't know what to do with you anymore.

209
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:28,860
I would like to see you again for a while.

210
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:37,680
I will try hard to still remember the past.

211
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:45,360
Can't you crowded times make me feeling pitiful?

212
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,940
Everyone has left

213
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,300
What he did to me today

214
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,060
Why is it so familiar

215
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,780
You said I called the driver

216
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,060
Now send me home

217
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,180
Excuse me

218
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,180
Which is the last 3390

219
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,740
You have to stand here

220
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,180
You have to stand next to me

221
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,700
You were a chair

222
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:29,780
also

223
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,540
Brother, is there anything more detailed

224
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,260
Then I want to eat

225
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,820
You have to cook for me today

226
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,620
I still like you

227
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,180
At first, I didn't do it

228
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,020
I remember

229
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,340
Yiran

230
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,540
Iогuang

231
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,660
I'm so scared

232
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,540
I'm Ch Totally 저희가

233
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,020
I'm afraid you will ever be unable to remember

234
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:43,900
Don't worry

235
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,780
At least, I remember everything.

236
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,980
I won't forget anything.

237
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,660
I won't separate from you again.

238
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,300
I want the whole world to know

239
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,500
that I'm with you.

240
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,500
I promise you.

241
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,980
But I'm a murderer now.

242
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,780
I can't get you into trouble.

243
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,660
But I don't care.

244
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,940
These are all rumors.

245
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,340
Rumors kill people without blood.

246
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,140
So I have to clarify to the outside world

247
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,940
that we're not boyfriends.

248
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,300
But I don't care.

249
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,380
I forgot that you're an investor.

250
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,180
You have to avoid blood

251
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,420
for the sake of the movie.

252
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,540
As for whether they believe it or not,

253
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,700
it depends on your acting skills.

254
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,700
Aren't you helping me

255
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,700
with my acting skills?
