1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The whole universe shines because of me

2
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:00,700
Episode 2

3
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,620
That dance was

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,440
I came here to see you dance.

5
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,960
Let's switch places.

6
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,040
You've been pretending to be an agent for so many years.

7
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,480
It seems like you're also a good actor.

8
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,960
Being an agent is just one of my hobbies.

9
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,120
What?

10
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,960
Are you curious about me?

11
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,320
I don't want to talk nonsense with you.

12
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,960
What do you know about my master's death?

13
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,080
You want to know?

14
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,040
Drink this.

15
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,000
Drink this.

16
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,400
Tell me.

17
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,640
What do you know?

18
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,520
Don't worry.

19
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,560
Drink with me and be happy.

20
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,480
I'll tell you.

21
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,880
Drink.

22
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,640
I heard that

23
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,560
people who lose their memories can't drink.

24
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,240
They'll be confused if they drink too much.

25
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,120
Find a reason to get drunk

26
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,560
and let them spit out the truth after drinking.

27
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,880
I'll go.

28
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,480
Where did Ye Wu Ming go?

29
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,080
Ma San,

30
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,600
are you going to tell me or not?

31
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,760
Fine. I'll go find him myself.

32
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,200
Sister.

33
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,760
Sister.

34
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,040
Wu Ming told me

35
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,560
that it's dangerous outside.

36
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,560
Don't go anywhere.

37
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,400
It's dangerous?

38
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,640
The payment is up to 10,000 yuan.

39
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,280
What?

40
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,360
Am I that kind of greedy person?

41
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,480
I can't sell my brother for 10,000 yuan.

42
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,440
Do you know that?

43
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,320
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,320
The payment is up to 50,000 yuan.

45
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,480
Don't be a second-class drinker.

46
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,040
The woman you're dating is your agent.

47
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,960
Lu Bingqing.

48
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,000
Let's go.

49
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,120
Sister.

50
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,840
Sister, I'll guide you.

51
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,360
This wine

52
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,280
tastes good.

53
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,720
But the alcohol content is too low.

54
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,440
75% alcohol content.

55
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,280
I dare not drink it.

56
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,480
Don't drink too much.

57
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,160
You haven't told me

58
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,760
what happened to my master.

59
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,920
You can't drink too much.

60
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,800
How can he drink so much?

61
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,440
Luckily, I'm prepared.

62
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,600
What?

63
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,320
Come back quickly.

64
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,840
You haven't told me what happened.

65
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,480
Let's go.

66
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,600
Where were we just now?

67
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,240
Come on, let's continue drinking.

68
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,320
Why does he look like a different person?

69
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,240
Take it.

70
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,080
Cheers.

71
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,800
Cheers.

72
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,680
You finallyRAISED AWWARD

73
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:10,600
Hey

74
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:34,200
REAL CO yer

75
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,640
Isn't Um, the 10-day house

76
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,360
Then let me introduce to you

77
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,360
Answer me.

78
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,560
You haven't told me what's going on.

79
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,320
Hurry up.

80
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,040
Why did I see you there?

81
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,520
You must be drunk.

82
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,880
You look like you're drunk.

83
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,680
Come on.

84
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,680
Drink some water.

85
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,960
Since I can't drink more than you,

86
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,560
I'll have to do it.

87
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,520
0

88
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,160
I said I was on trial.

89
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,760
cocky

90
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,320
Bingqin

91
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:58,880
can't tell

92
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,040
you're such a drinker.

93
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,960
Noina

94
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,360
there's a lot

95
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,240
you don't know.

96
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm not.

97
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,880
You used to pretend to be nice to me.

98
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,480
Now you're not.

99
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,320
Calm down, sister.

100
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,840
The entertainment industry is all about plastic sisters.

101
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,600
Whoever plays it for real

102
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,320
will lose.

103
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,200
Sister, there must be a misunderstanding.

104
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,720
Get lost.

105
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,800
Okay.

106
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,520
Sister.

107
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,320
Sister, you're not married.

108
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,040
We're just trying to be fair.

109
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,560
I didn't know my boyfriend

110
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,000
was so popular in the company.

111
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,040
He's quite good.

112
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,320
Have you had enough?

113
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,440
Go home if you've had enough.

114
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,080
Go home.

115
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,280
Ye Wuming.

116
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,240
You're getting more and more interested in me.

117
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,120
I went to him

118
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,000
because I have something important to ask him.

119
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,280
He's been my agent for so many years.

120
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,920
I don't know what he knows.

121
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,640
Only he knows about this.

122
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,360
Then tell me.

123
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,400
What is it that only he knows?

124
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,760
He can dance.

125
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,160
Dance?

126
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,760
How is it? Is it good?

127
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,120
I think Lu Bingqing...

128
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,920
He's not as good as you.

129
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,640
He's so slow.

130
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,920
Are you going to

131
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,400
dance this to someone else?

132
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,400
Of course.

133
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,840
Isn't it good?

134
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,600
The role of the game.

135
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,080
The love of the man in the house.

136
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,960
I'm not the man in the house.

137
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,760
I'm the man in the house.

138
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,600
I'm the man in the house.

139
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,880
The man in the house is my favorite.

140
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,280
Who told you that the man in the house likes you?

141
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,120
And this is too exposed.

142
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,160
No.

143
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,360
I think it's okay.

144
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,120
You...

145
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,920
How is it okay?

146
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,720
Your waist and legs are exposed.

147
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,560
Coming.

148
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
It's not good-looking.

149
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,000
Cover it.

150
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:27,920
Coming.

151
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,240
Boss.

152
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,520
I suspect that Lu Bingqing is suspicious.

153
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,200
I'll talk to you.

154
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,920
No.

155
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,080
I know. Let's go.

156
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,440
We can't even enter the door.

157
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,880
I have something to do.

158
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,480
San.

159
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,240
San.

160
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,840
Is it good-looking?

161
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,440
Yes.

162
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,760
I told you it's not good-looking.

163
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,440
Brother.

164
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,360
I like it.

165
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,280
You like everything.

166
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:53,800
Let's go.

167
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,400
Brother.

168
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,800
I said it's good-looking.

169
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,680
Can we discuss about this dress?

170
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,000
Are you jealous?

171
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,760
I...

172
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,360
You're my girlfriend in the contract.

173
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,560
I should be jealous.

174
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,960
You're still here.

175
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,640
It's my fault to underestimate his alcohol tolerance.

176
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,440
I underestimated his alcohol tolerance.

177
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,240
Song Yiran is not a simple woman.

178
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,920
She must have kept that bank card.

179
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,400
Are you finally going to be ruthless?

180
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,880
Although she has broken the contract,

181
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,280
her business will expire in ten days.

182
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,120
We must teach her a lesson.

183
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,280
As long as she makes an accident

184
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,680
in ten days,

185
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,480
the company can get a huge compensation.

186
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,560
I want 5 million.

187
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,720
I'll give you 10 million.

188
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,720
And catch Ye Wu Ming.

189
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,560
Ye Wu Ming is too powerful.

190
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,960
Add 5 million.

191
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,520
No problem.

192
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,400
I've already found Song Yiran's parents.

193
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,200
I'll give you another 2 million after the accident.

194
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,960
Wait.

195
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,960
Let me finish my words.

196
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,160
I'll cooperate with you.

197
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,520
Always asked for the last last.

198
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,880
Just kill me.

199
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,280
Very good.

200
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,600
Song Yiran,

201
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,480
your parents blame me.

202
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,240
I'm here.

203
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,640
You want to save his parents?

204
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,680
Just wait here.

205
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,000
You want to take me to Mount Wulin?

206
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,160
That's right.

207
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,400
But if you dare to leave,

208
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,720
his parents will be dead.

209
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,120
Keep an eye on him.

210
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,280
Don't let him leave.

211
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,120
Go.

212
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,760
Keep going.

213
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,160
Did you see that door?

214
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,080
Your parents are inside.

215
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,960
Go.

216
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,960
Pull up the steel wire.

217
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,720
What if the village heads get hurt?

218
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,320
What if they get sick?

219
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,640
And they can't get out.

220
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,240
Hurry up.

221
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,120
I didn't know the language used.

222
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,120
You go.

223
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,920
Are you moving?

224
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,080
I'm waiting for you.

225
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,880
Hi, I'm Fuwords.

226
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,680
Who are you?

227
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,680
I will be stubborn and persistent

228
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,680
I will only listen to the legend

229
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:09,680
The whole universe is shining because of me
