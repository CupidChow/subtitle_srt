1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The whole universe shines because of me

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
A healthy life and a beautiful morning.

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
A star is really self-disciplined.

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This is yours. I'll eat this.

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
No, no.

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You're a bit hypocritical.

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm a human being.

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
No, no.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You forgot.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You said there was a three-day show tomorrow.

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You have to experience hunger.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That show is very important to me.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The show is bigger than the sky.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll go hungry first.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Good evening.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Good evening.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Are you okay?

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I haven't eaten anything all day.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I have to act well in this show.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Come on, boss.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We can have a big meal after we've stayed up tonight.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Sit down first.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'll get you some water.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Sister, why do you look so bad?

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
My face is so thin.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You're not that thin.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Don't talk about me.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I haven't eaten anything all day.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But I have a incense here.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Smell it.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Wake up.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Don't break the show.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
How is it?

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You two, get ready for the next show.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Okay.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Don't stay up too late.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Boss.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yiren.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yiren.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What's going on?

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Where's the doctor?

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Find the doctor.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's a long-term cancer.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's caused by a chronic body disorder.

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It also has hypoglycemia.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
If you take some glucose,

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
you'll wake up soon.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Smell my sweet incense.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I promise you.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'll take it.

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Smell my sweet incense.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I promise you.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You'll wake up tomorrow.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What's going on?

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You're delaying the progress again.

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
This scene can only be used today.

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
People are signing it.

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This is the most important scene.

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Two sisters.

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
They're fighting for life together.

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
One of them is not enough.

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Director.

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I have an idea.

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
How about we change the scene?

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Let's change it to

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
sister is unconscious.

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Sister is trying to save her.

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll do it.

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'll do it.

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
There's no other way.

73
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We can only try it.

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
She's working so hard for this scene.

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
If we change it,

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
she'll be very sad.

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Director.

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Give me ten minutes.

79
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I can wake her up.

80
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I've been saving her for so long.

81
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
She's still unconscious.

82
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Ten minutes?

83
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
How could it be possible?

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Send her to the hospital.

85
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
If you say nonsense,

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
it's none of my business.

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'll give you five minutes.

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Get ready.

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Use a new plan.

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Sister Yiran is so good at this.

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's no use for the medicine.

92
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Brother.

93
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's been a long time.

94
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Be quiet.

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Don't waste time.

96
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Send her to the hospital.

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Give all the words to Linglong.

98
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
She's awake.

99
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
She's really awake.

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's impossible.

101
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I smelled my incense.

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
She woke up so quickly.

103
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
She's really awake.

104
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
She's awake.

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's so cool.

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Director.

107
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Director.

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'll make up for it.

110
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I can shoot.

111
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No need.

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Your complexion

113
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
is perfect

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
for the play of Qiu Sheng.

115
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Just shoot like this.

116
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Director.

117
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That one.

118
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Get ready.

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Get ready.

120
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Take a picture.

121
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Come on.

122
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Come on.

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Hurry up.

124
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Okay.

125
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Come on.

126
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
One, two, three.

127
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Three, two, one.

128
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Come on.

129
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Sister.

130
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Sister.

131
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
She killed us.

132
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
She said we were stronger.

133
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So no matter when,

134
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
we can't give up hope.

135
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Sister.

136
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Cut.

137
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Done.

138
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Good.

139
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Good.

140
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Good job.

141
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Good job.

142
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You did a great job.

143
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Great.

144
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Let's go.

145
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You go straight.

146
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Go.

147
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Thank you, teacher.

148
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Thank you.

149
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Director.

150
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
How was my acting?

151
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You were so good at acting.

152
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You did a great job.

153
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What are these?

154
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Healthy foods.

155
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You often post them on Weibo.

156
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
They're all yours.

157
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Those are all human poop.

158
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You know them.

159
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
They're fake.

160
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You believe that?

161
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I don't know.

162
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm doing this for your own good.

163
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You're not sick,

164
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
so you should eat these.

165
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You have to take them into consideration.

166
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I don't take them into consideration.

167
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You have so many green foods.

168
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You think you're a rabbit?

169
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,440
Goubao chicken, braised pork,

170
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,560
and crayfish.

171
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,040
I suggest you think it over.

172
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,720
Someone is filming you.

173
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,840
How did you know

174
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,720
I love these green food?

175
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,400
It's delicious and healthy.

176
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,320
We should change our seats

177
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,280
without any noise.

178
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,920
What are you doing?

179
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,000
My left face is more

180
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
My right face is the same.

181
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,400
What do you know?

182
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,160
Different angles, light,

183
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,200
and my hair.

184
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,240
The effect of the film

185
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,320
is different.

186
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,080
Stand next to me.

187
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,760
You need to keep a watch when eating.

188
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
Closer.

189
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,080
Closer.

190
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,360
Push your head.

191
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,480
Then turn it.

192
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,660
Okay.

193
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,380
We should set a тотally

194
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:22,800
llo amity to them.

195
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,360
We need to make ourenter

196
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,000
10 meters.

197
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,640
Your stars are so fake.

198
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,040
I'm sorry.

199
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,480
Sit back.

200
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,480
Sit back.

201
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,480
Did you do it on purpose?

202
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,480
I didn't do it on purpose. I just...

203
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,480
You don't believe me?

204
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,480
Then do it again.

205
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,480
Sit back.

206
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,480
Sit down.

207
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,480
Open your mouth.

208
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
Open your mouth.

209
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,480
Open your mouth.

210
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,480
Open your mouth.

211
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,480
Look.

212
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,480
You're still helping her to talk.

213
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,480
Is this my artist?

214
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,480
Did you do this?

215
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,480
Mr. Li, don't be angry.

216
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,480
There must be some misunderstanding.

217
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,480
I'll talk to her again.

218
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,480
Don't worry.

219
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,480
Look.

220
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,480
She even played with me.

221
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,480
They've been playing with me.

222
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,480
And they even played this with me.

223
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,480
Lin Qing, I know you're doing this for my own good.

224
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,480
But dating is my private matter.

225
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,480
And I didn't affect my work.

226
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,480
Okay, okay.

227
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,480
Let's not talk about this.

228
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,480
Here we are.

229
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,480
We can finally eat.

230
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,480
I think we should be polite.

231
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,480
We can't be like this.

232
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,480
Those are all very official.

233
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,480
And I'm an actress.

234
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,480
You can just think I'm making a character.

235
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,480
Then why can't you make a sincere character?

236
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,480
It's not that tiring to live.

237
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
I'll eat later.

238
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
Tell me first.

239
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,480
How did you find out that person was secretly taking pictures?

240
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,480
I heard her press the shutter.

241
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,480
You can hear it after so long?

242
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,480
When I was in my bedroom...

243
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
You slept last night.

244
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,480
Ye Wu Ming.

245
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,480
I'm not talking to you.

246
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,480
Go to sleep.

247
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,480
Ye Wu Ming.

248
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
Boss.

249
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,480
The props you took in the movie are still here.

250
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,480
Qi.

251
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,480
Here.

252
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,480
Boss.

253
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,480
Here.

254
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
Qi.

255
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,480
I'm telling you.

256
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,480
I'll give you another chance.

257
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,480
I saw Song Yi Ran was not dead.

258
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,480
Take him to the movie theater.

259
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,480
I understand, boss.

260
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,480
I'll do it right now.

261
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,480
Today, scare Song Yi Ran.

262
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,480
Mr. Li won't treat everyone badly.

263
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,480
Don't worry.

264
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,480
We'll make him regret it.

265
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,480
Mr. Song.

266
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,480
Director.

267
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,480
Today, the heroine of the escape from the desert

268
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,480
will be here.

269
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,480
When you dance,

270
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,480
some of your fighters will approach you.

271
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,480
They want to hurt you.

272
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,480
You're a good fighter.

273
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,480
But don't worry.

274
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,480
These fighters are our brothers.

275
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,480
You'll be safe.

276
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,480
Okay?

277
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,480
Come in.

278
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
Okay.

279
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,480
Three, two, one, go.

280
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,480
Come in.

281
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,480
Come in.

282
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,480
Come in.

283
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,480
Go.

284
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,480
Come in.

285
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,480
Here comes the boss.

286
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,480
But no.

287
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,480
I have to...

288
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,480
Someone wants to hurt you.

289
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,480
How dare they be so reckless?

290
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,480
Don't worry.

291
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,480
I'm here.

292
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,480
I've called the police.

293
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,480
Go on.

294
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,480
Go on.

295
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,480
I'm here.

296
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,480
They're not here.

297
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,480
Okay, cut.

298
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,480
Director Fu.

299
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,480
Why are the actors out of line?

300
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,480
Is the heroine in the picture?

301
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,480
I mean Wu Huang.

302
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,480
Well...

303
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,480
She's gone.

304
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,480
Brother, how are you doing?

305
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,480
I'm fine.

306
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,480
Is this the studio?

307
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,480
Are you all sleeping?

308
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,480
You're all sleeping together.

309
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,480
You...

310
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,480
What are you doing?

311
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,480
Can you respect my privacy?

312
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,480
You're my bodyguard.

313
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
Only I have privacy.

314
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,480
You don't.

315
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,480
Why are you still awake?

316
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,480
Listen.

317
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,480
I feel like someone is trying to hurt me

318
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,480
as soon as I close my eyes.

319
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,480
I need you to be by my side and protect me.

320
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,480
You're still acting?

321
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,480
I'm taking a shower.

322
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,480
Stand at the door.

323
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,480
Don't come in.

324
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,480
Stand here and protect me.

325
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,480
Don't get too close.

326
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,480
Don't get too far away.

327
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
Don't get any closer.

328
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,480
Or I'll bite you.

329
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,480
I'm down.

330
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,480
Do you want me to help you?

331
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,480
I didn't see it.

332
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,480
I didn't.

333
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,480
I'm going to take a shower.

334
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,480
Why is there smoke?

335
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,480
I'm taking a shower.

336
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,480
The actress

337
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,480
is pretty good at taking a shower.

338
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,480
What brand is she?

339
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,480
I'm looking for a good actress.

340
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,480
I'll take a look.

341
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,480
I can't see the scene

342
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,480
because I can only hear the sound.

343
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,480
I'm down again.

344
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,480
Let me help you again.

345
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,480
The police have caught all the goods.

346
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,480
I've told you not to break the law.

347
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,480
Don't do this kind of thing again.

348
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,480
Director Li.

349
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,480
Ye Wu Ming's fight

350
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,480
is like a big wound.

351
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,480
That's not the same as us

352
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,480
It can't hurt her

353
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,480
You have many ways to stop her

354
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,480
There must be a better way

355
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,480
You

356
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,480
I have a big plan

357
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,480
First

358
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,480
At tomorrow's press conference

359
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,480
Announce the female number one

360
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,480
From Song Yi Ran to Yue Ling Long

361
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,480
This year

362
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,480
She is the main person in the company

363
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,480
Sorry, sister

364
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,480
This time

365
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,480
I am talking about your female number one

366
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,480
Then buy a hot search

367
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,480
Let her fall into the phantom

368
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,480
The wind wave

369
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,480
The mouth is blown

370
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,480
The last move is to kill sister

371
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,480
To drive her blood-sucking father

372
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,480
Uncle

373
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,480
Asuigas

374
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,480
A lot of debt

375
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,480
I heard that the interest

376
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,480
It's almost ten million

377
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,480
Ten million

378
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,480
Ten million

379
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,480
She has just been replaced

380
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,480
The Internet said

381
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,480
Her career is over

382
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,480
She has no income

383
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,480
How do you pay your gambling debt

384
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,480
You guys

385
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,480
Plan

386
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,480
No one can betray me

387
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,480
I just want Song Yi Ran's career

388
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,480
And family

389
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,480
At the same time

390
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,480
I know the past

391
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,480
Will be changed

392
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,480
I will be a bird

393
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,480
Stubborn

394
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,480
It's a legend

395
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,480
The whole

396
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,480
Universe

397
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,480
Shining

398
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,480
The end
