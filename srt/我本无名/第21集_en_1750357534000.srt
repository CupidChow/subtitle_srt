1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The whole universe shines because of me

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,520
Episode 31

3
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,260
Excuse me.

4
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,640
Waking up bird

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
How could it be?

6
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You want to leave for someone you don't know?

7
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You think I'm a fool?

8
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
How could I not die?

9
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This...

10
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
San'er.

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I want to die!

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'll kill you!

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Get up!

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The police will be here soon.

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's enough to lock him up for seven or eight years.

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Go!

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You go.

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yiren, I'm sorry today.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's all our fault.

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Why don't you rest today?

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We'll shoot tomorrow.

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
No need, director.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I've been preparing for this scene for a long time.

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I can shoot now.

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Really? That's great.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Everyone, get ready.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Change scene, next scene, keep shooting.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Hurry up!

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Hurry up!

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The shooting is about to start.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The director is in a hurry.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Is the scene ready?

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yes, it's ready, director.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We'll start shooting soon.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Start shooting.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Director Ye,

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm here to take care of Yiren.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm here to report Yiren.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Okay, do whatever you want.

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Cheers.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Well,

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
the informant said that

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Mr. Feng is preparing for the police department.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He's going to shoot a high-end commercial.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Mr. Feng is a tough guy.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What should we do?

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'll answer him myself.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Ye Wu Min got the capital of the troublemaker.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
He's also the big boss of the industry.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Now,

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
he's a big boss.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The higher he stands,

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
the worse he falls.

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We have to surround him in front of us.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It costs 100 million and 200 million.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We have to kill Wu Min.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's a big trouble.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Mr. Feng,

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
don't bother.

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Give me the money.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll change the name of the company's assistant.

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
We win.

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Mr. Ye is so brave.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
He came to us in person.

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's rare to see him.

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I heard someone was going to kill me at the door.

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Mr. Ye, you heard it wrong.

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I have a voice.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's normal to hear it wrong.

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Mr. Feng is still so cautious.

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
He doesn't dare to admit a small thing.

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Our business is so big.

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We rely on him to be cautious.

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
There's a saying that you haven't heard of.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
A wise man will be a wise man.

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You think you can control Mr. Li at will.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But in fact,

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
no one believes in him.

79
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Every time he meets you,

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
he always has a camera.

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The contents of your transaction

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
are all recorded.

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What you see is just the surface.

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What you don't know is that

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I will check every minute.

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The whole signal is blocked.

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Everyone must be checked strictly when they come in.

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Okay.

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Listen to this.

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You definitely don't want

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
to see Song Yan and me

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
perform successfully.

93
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The matter of the first two sisters

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
is all filial piety.

95
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You decide.

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll make the money.

97
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Give me five hundred million.

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Come and discuss with me.

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Their movie is about to start.

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It will be harder to deal with it in the future.

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Don't worry.

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Someone will take the initiative

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
to solve this problem openly.

104
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
They smoke every day.

105
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
In the end, the smoke is caught.

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:46,700
It was set by that psychological

107
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and psychological

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I solved all the people.

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
How can I come in?

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Sit down.

111
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Then you will stay at home tonight

112
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
to sign with me at Mr. Su's house.

113
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Okay.

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm leaving now.

115
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's weird.

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Mr. Zhu is more active than anyone else.

117
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Why is he late today?

118
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Brother.

119
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Mr. Zhu and Mr. Li have become plant people.

120
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
This is the scene of our people's movement.

121
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
No.

122
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
He and he want to steal Mr. Zhu's secret medicine.

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
This is the kind of

124
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Ouyang family claims that no one can avoid.

125
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Even the camera can't catch the traces of his movement.

126
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Ouyang family.

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
That's right.

128
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Ouyang family is best at

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
ambush and assassination.

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Back then,

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
they were defeated by your master

132
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and retreated into the martial arts world.

133
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
They thought they would disappear and return to the world.

134
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Now they are back.

135
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
They even become ghost flash.

136
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Sister-in-law.

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'll go to the Chinese palace.

138
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
They come back and steal Mr. Zhu's secret medicine.

139
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
They want to steal our private money.

140
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Mr. Zhu.

141
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Sister-in-law.

142
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Hurry up.

143
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Sister-in-law.

144
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Come in.

145
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Sister-in-law.

146
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Mr. Feng.

147
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Liu Ming.

148
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Liu Ming.

149
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Back then,

150
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
our Ouyang family

151
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
was defeated by your master.

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
We were convinced.

153
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
However,

154
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
these bad guys

155
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
will be caught off guard.

156
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The Ouyang family

157
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
will not let it go.

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I suggest you

159
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
not to blame the evil things.

160
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
There are four big families.

161
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
None of them are safe.

162
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,400
I'll take it first.

163
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,160
He's poisoned.

164
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,880
I have to rescue him quickly.

165
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,360
Senior.

166
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,520
Will I be the next one?

167
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,960
Senior, don't worry.

168
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,880
I'll arrange someone to protect you tomorrow.

169
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,040
Brother, let's go.

170
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,800
Art

171
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,280
Alright. Cut.

172
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,720
Sha Qing.

173
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,280
Sha Qing.

174
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,440
Congratulations.

175
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,160
Thank you.

176
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,640
Thank you.

177
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,000
One, two, three.

178
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,440
Kill the Green Big Dipper.

179
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,120
Take a picture with the director.

180
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,480
Okay.

181
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:50,960
Come on.

182
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:54,920
Okay.

183
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
Yiran, thank you.

184
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,600
Thank you, director.

185
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,680
Let's work together next time.

186
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,560
The day you left,

187
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,280
did he also die?

188
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,400
He went to your master's door

189
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,320
for the purpose of taking pictures.

190
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,440
He wanted to kill your master.

191
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,440
What are you looking at?

192
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,600
Did you bully my master?

193
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,160
No.

194
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,800
Why?

195
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,400
Nothing.

196
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,640
Brother.

197
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,240
Brother Kai had an accident.

198
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,800
You're missing

199
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,480
even if your mother left.

200
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,560
Let's go.

201
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:27,920
Let's go.

202
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,640
Brother Kai, Dali.

203
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,280
I sent early earlier.

204
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,320
I hadream about it.

205
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,320
I came to see the Bone Shank Cemetery.

206
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,320
Come on.

207
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,040
ChunLou higher.

208
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,320
Please.

209
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,680
Here.

210
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,160
How did it go?

211
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,280
Mr. Xu.

212
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:02,960
Wu Ming,

213
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,320
this clue is so obvious.

214
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,240
I'm afraid

215
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,680
it's a trap that they left on purpose.

216
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,120
Even if we know it's a trap,

217
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,400
we have to go.

218
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,560
Wu Ming!

219
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,200
Tell me

220
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,400
if it's the seats at the Red CRISPR IG!

221
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,040
Sir,

222
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:58,280
you have to throw away the

223
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,360
equipment at the hospital.

224
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,360
I am the legend

225
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:13,360
The whole universe shines because of me
