1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The whole universe shines because of me

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
There is a world that is different from ours.

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
In this world, there are many masters hidden in the city.

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Your martial arts is ready.

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Go down the mountain and start your own business.

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This time, I can finally see my sister.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Do you want to play with us?

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I didn't deliberately choose them.

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I did all of this with my right hand.

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
My name is Ye Wu Ming.

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm a driver.

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I lost some memories when I was driving three years ago.

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
After that, my right hand seems to have its own ideas.

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We found Ye Wu Ming.

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But he seems to remember nothing.

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,840
I'm going to the

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm going to the

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Brother, it's a peak season now.

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You've been tossing and turning all the time.

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Good work is gone.

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Three, help me clean up later.

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Sit down.

24
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Sign the contract.

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'll put it here.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If you don't sign the contract today, you can't leave.

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Mr. Li will take you to the treasure.

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You don't know the station.

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You can sign it.

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You press the handprint.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Come on, where's the stamp?

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Excuse me.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Who is the number 3390?

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Who called the driver?

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I called him.

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He seems to be that female star, Song Yi Ran.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Hello.

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm happy to serve you.

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We're friends.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We drank a little wine.

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We'll send him back later.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Let's go.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Brother, then you

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You don't understand human language, do you?

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Let you go.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let you go.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Help me.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Help me.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What are you doing?

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What are you doing?

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What are you doing?

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Nothing.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Are you sick?

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Are you sick?

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Let him get out.

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You can't hear me, can you?

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Brother, brother.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Say it.

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Brother, brother.

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So powerful.

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Go.

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Go.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Is he the legendary city master?

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The master of the city.

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Send me home.

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Er Dong Yao Lin Yao.

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I suddenly became a master of the city.

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And saved the female star.

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And send her home alone.

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Oh my god.

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Is my life going to be changed?

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Here we are.

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The female star's home is so special.

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You are happy now?

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yes, I am.

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
No problem, no problem.

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
P warum tu so pä becomes soàcies?

78
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,200
Brother, where are you?

79
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,600
I haven't received the order all night.

80
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,240
Song Yi Ran?

81
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,120
You were on Song Yi Ran's order just now.

82
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,680
Why did you run away from home?

83
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,360
Brother, don't do anything wrong.

84
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,680
Don't talk nonsense.

85
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,600
He asked me to do it.

86
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,760
He hasn't received the order yet.

87
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,520
Come here.

88
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,800
Such a good cup.

89
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,800
It's a pity that it's not very good.

90
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,160
Right.

91
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,120
You're awake.

92
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,800
Come on, give me the order.

93
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,440
Come on.

94
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,000
Don't touch me.

95
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,560
Am I home?

96
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,000
Why am I on the bed?

97
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,920
I remember that I was talking to Mr. Li about the termination of the contract.

98
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,480
I remember the favor.

99
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,480
I won't renew the contract.

100
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,560
Do you know what I want?

101
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,320
I've destroyed the bank card

102
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,840
that you want.

103
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,760
It's fine if you don't want the contract.

104
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,680
But you must sign the contract

105
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,240
with this wine.

106
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,760
Good.

107
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,560
Mr. Li,

108
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,560
good wine and good tea.

109
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,640
I don't think...

110
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,840
Luckily, I'm fine.

111
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,800
Qi,

112
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,760
Song Yi Ran has earned two hundred million for me for four years.

113
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,320
If he doesn't renew the contract,

114
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,240
what will others think?

115
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,880
I must get him tonight.

116
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,920
Yes, Mr. Li.

117
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,960
If he doesn't sign the contract tonight,

118
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,200
don't think about getting over it.

119
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,840
Why is someone taking a bath?

120
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,040
You bastard.

121
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,040
Who is this man?

122
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,520
Why is he staring at me?

123
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,920
You're a big bastard.

124
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,840
I didn't mean to.

125
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,440
You're a big bastard.

126
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,440
You're a big bastard.

127
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,440
You're a big bastard.

128
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,440
You're a big bastard.

129
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
You're a big bastard.

130
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,840
Who is this man in what way?

131
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
What man in what way?

132
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,040
Who's that man in what way?

133
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
Go away.

134
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,760
It's you.

135
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,760
Fine.

136
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,600
Uncle.

137
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,400
I bring you some c 발라 map.

138
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,720
Just this.

139
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,760
It's good for your health.

140
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,880
And it's good, uncle.

141
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,920
You'd better explain

142
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,200
why you're at my place.

143
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,760
You're drunk and can't remember.

144
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,120
You asked me to send you back.

145
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,840
Remember to give me a five-star rating.

146
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,280
It's okay.

147
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,920
You hit me like this.

148
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,680
You want a five-star rating?

149
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,880
You've made my eyes red.

150
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,080
You're a bad guy.

151
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,520
You even complained about me.

152
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,440
I saved you.

153
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,240
Saved me?

154
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,880
Oh my goodness.

155
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,800
It was supposed to be three or five kilometers.

156
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,200
I couldn't make much money.

157
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,360
I went there.

158
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,880
Five or six people surrounded you

159
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,480
and asked you to sign a contract.

160
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,600
Then you asked me to save you.

161
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,120
I fought with others for you.

162
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,960
I worked so hard to send you home.

163
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,600
Then I was dragged by the car.

164
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,760
I was so scared.

165
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
I was so scared.

166
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,760
I was so scared.

167
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,760
I was so scared.

168
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
I was so scared.

169
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,760
I was so scared.

170
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,320
Then you threw me out.

171
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,680
You didn't even answer my call.

172
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,840
You can sign it.

173
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But you can't keep your hands off.

174
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,640
I'm happy to help you at any cost.

175
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,400
Then...

176
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,960
What he said is true.

177
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,760
It's just a complaint.

178
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,280
I'll deduct some money from you.

179
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,960
I won't lose my job.

180
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,840
The number you have dialed is 9527 Ye Hongming.

181
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,000
You've been complained.

182
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,520
It involves bad behavior such as breaking into a private house.

183
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,200
The audit will be suspended after the platform is reviewed.

184
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,880
So you can't lose your job?

185
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,560
Don't worry.

186
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,080
I'll call to cancel it now.

187
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,760
Hello.

188
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,400
I want to cancel the complaint against 9527.

189
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,520
Sorry, it's already in the system.

190
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,160
The platform will treat 9527 as a typical

191
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,960
announcement, criticism and serious treatment.

192
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,720
I've already paid the money.

193
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,480
You don't have the attitude to apologize.

194
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,160
You...

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,240
It must be Mr. Li.

196
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,520

200
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,600

201
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,320
Really!
