1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The whole universe shines because of me

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,580
Episode 4

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,960
from Jingxi Studio in Beijing.

4
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,760
Miss Feng,

5
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,320
you asked me to talk about dealing with Ye Wuming.

6
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,160
How dare I deal with Mr.Rai?

7
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,160
Chief, you can't take the responsibility if something happens.

8
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,760
Director Li, I won't say anything if it's his words.

9
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,160
If we don't stop him,

10
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,160
Ye Wu Ming will officially inherit 200 billion in management fund in half a month.

11
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,560
By then, you and I will not be his opponents.

12
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,960
I heard that Song Yi Ran has a bank card in his hand.

13
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,560
Why do you want it back?

14
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,160
If we don't get rid of Ye Wu Ming,

15
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,560
I don't think we can get this card back.

16
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,960
So you have prepared for this.

17
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,760
Let's go to the place we need.

18
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,160
You take care of things.

19
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,960
Okay. No problem.

20
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,960
Stop sleeping. Get up.

21
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,960
Come with me to see my parents.

22
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,160
Let's go.

23
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,160
Uncle, Auntie, I miss you so much.

24
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,160
How is it? How is Zhongnan Mountain's fresh food?

25
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,360
You're still talking?

26
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,760
You asked me to go to the mountains to get some fresh water.

27
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,760
I'm so jealous. I'm almost a beggar.

28
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,760
Daughter, your mom doesn't just sit and cook every day.

29
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,360
She almost hit me.

30
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,960
I'm almost depressed.

31
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,160
Yi Ran, your parents know they're wrong.

32
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,160
They shouldn't be bewitched by Li Tian Hao.

33
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,160
From now on, if you don't want to do anything,

34
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,960
I won't force you.

35
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,760
Dad, what's wrong with my mom?

36
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,360
What is she doing?

37
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,560
Your mom knows you're new to the company.

38
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,760
She's treating you to a meal to communicate.

39
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,760
Who is it?

40
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,960
Mr. Zhao will be here soon. This is our family matter. You shouldn't be here.

41
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,760
We're talking about something very private.

42
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,160
You shouldn't be here.

43
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,960
Okay. I'll leave then.

44
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,760
Go.

45
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,560
Wu Ming is my boyfriend. He has to be here.

46
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,760
Yi Ran, if Mr. Zhao comes,

47
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,960
if you make him unhappy, it will affect your future.

48
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,760
That's right.

49
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,160
And Mr. Zhao told me that your new boss is young and handsome.

50
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,160
He's willing to give you 100 million.

51
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,160
Aren't you touched at all?

52
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,960
That's right.

53
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,760
Actually, it's not that good.

54
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,160
How do you say that?

55
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,760
I know you're jealous, but do you have to have this ability?

56
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,760
But Wu Ming is willing to give up his 200 million for me.

57
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,960
200 million?

58
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,560
What 200 million? I don't think he can even get 200 dollars.

59
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,360
Mr. Zhao.

60
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,560
Mr. Zhao, please sit.

61
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,560
We're not done with the matter.

62
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,760
Serve the dishes.

63
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,360
Oh, Mr. Ye.

64
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,360
When did you come?

65
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,560
You didn't even say hello.

66
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,360
Mr. Ye, please sit.

67
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,160
No, I'll sit next to Yi Ran.

68
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,560
Mr. Zhao, did you get the wrong person?

69
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,960
This is Yi Ran's bodyguard.

70
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,360
What bodyguard? How do you say that?

71
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,760
This is our new boss, Ye Wu Ming.

72
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,560
Mr. Ye.

73
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,960
New boss?

74
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,160
The 200 million he gave me just now...

75
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,360
That's not it.

76
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,760
I told you.

77
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,360
How can you exaggerate?

78
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,960
200 million is just the first quarter of the capital.

79
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,160
There's also a big share.

80
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,760
That's a few hundred million.

81
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,760
What money?

82
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,760
I told you. The more handsome I see, the more I like him.

83
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,160
He's so handsome. My daughter is so beautiful. How perfect.

84
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,960
You're right. The first time I saw you, I knew you weren't an ordinary person.

85
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,360
You're the one among the people... No, the one among the people.

86
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,560
I'll get going now.

87
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,160
Honey, go get the hotpot.

88
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,960
Let them write a good day to register.

89
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,560
What good day? Today is a good day.

90
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,760
Hurry up. We're waiting to have a grandchild.

91
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,160
Okay, okay.

92
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,360
We'll register after we eat.

93
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,760
Waiter, serve the food.

94
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,960
I didn't expect handsome and handsome. And he can also be a public servant.

95
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,760
A public servant for a son-in-law.

96
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,760
That's right. Such a good son-in-law.

97
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,960
He must be from a good childhood to a big one.

98
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,160
Honey, where are you from?

99
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,760
Yes, where are you from?

100
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,760
I'm from the local area.

101
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,160
Local area? Do you have siblings at home?

102
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,560
What do your parents do? Where do you go to study?

103
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,160
Your parents educated you so well.

104
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,760
I don't even know who I am. How can I be responsible for Yiran?

105
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,960
That's right. That's right.

106
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,760
Mom.

107
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,560
Hongming, what are you saying?

108
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,760
He hasn't agreed to be your son-in-law.

109
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,560
It's something that will happen sooner or later.

110
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,360
That's right.

111
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
Mom, the car is here. You guys can go first.

112
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,560
Brother, get on the car.

113
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,760
Xinyi, you go first.

114
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,560
Uncle, auntie, get on the car.

115
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:32,960
Let's go.

116
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,760
Then remember to give me a message.

117
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,360
Let's go.

118
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,760
My parents are like this. Don't mind them.

119
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,760
But...

120
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,760
What they said this time is quite reasonable.

121
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,960
Which words?

122
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,560
It's...

123
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,160
son-in-law and marriage.

124
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,560
Marriage.

125
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,760
It's normal to get married. Don't feel burdened.

126
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,760
I don't feel burdened.

127
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:21,760
I suddenly remembered. I've done a play before.

128
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,960
This one. The leading actor in this one.

129
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,960
When he confessed to me, he was super romantic.

130
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,760
I've seen this one.

131
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,160
The leading actor's surname is Li. He died in a car accident.

132
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,960
There's another one.

133
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,360
There's another play.

134
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,760
This one.

135
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,160
This leading actor confessed to me.

136
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,560
He was super sincere.

137
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,560
Come, I'll find it for you.

138
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,760
I've seen this one too.

139
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,960
The surname is Hu.

140
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,760
He's a loser.

141
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,960
Can you pay attention to the important part?

142
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,760
The important part is to propose.

143
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,760
Propose.

144
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,760
Propose? What's the use of proposing?

145
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,760
Didn't you notice that love dramas end when they get married?

146
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,160
Why?

147
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,160
Because you're not married.

148
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,360
Right?

149
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,360
Yiran.

150
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,360
I know what you're talking about.

151
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,560
It's you.

152
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,160
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,760
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,360
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,160
I'm sorry.

156
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,160
I'm sorry.

157
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,960
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,560
You're awake.

159
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,560
Did you sleep well, Mr. Zuo?

160
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,560
You're pretty good.

161
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,560
I made you breakfast.

162
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,960
I made you your favorite.

163
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,160
Fried egg with tomatoes.

164
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,560
Eat more.

165
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,560
What day is it today?

166
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,560
I heard that

167
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,360
when a man feels the warmth of home,

168
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,160
he will want to get married.

169
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,560
I also prepared beer.

170
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,960
Look at this.

171
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,360
Does it look like a ring that's used when you get married?

172
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,760
No.

173
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,360
It's easy to get your hands dirty with this.

174
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,560
What a domineering boyfriend.

175
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,960
No, I have to make a plan.

176
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,760
Guess what else I prepared.

177
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,160
It smells so good.

178
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,360
Smell it.

179
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,160
Does it smell good?

180
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,160
Yes.

181
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,560
Yes.

182
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,960
Why does this candle seem to have a problem?
