1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The whole universe shines because of me

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Come on, everyone, follow me.

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Everyone, look carefully.

5
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This is Ye Wu Ming, the master of killing Nan Zheng.

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Dear family members,

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid that I'm going to have a good time

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
with this adventure broadcast.

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
If I don't show up these days,

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
please call the police for me.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Come on, everyone, listen to me.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Introduce yourself to everyone.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This is the famous Ye Wu Ming, Mr. Ye.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The original friend who faked a movie

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
killed a friend of Nan Zheng.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Now you can sit here and talk.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Who was killed by the assassin?

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's impossible.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I used the soft-clay.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It can't hurt people.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
This soft-clay

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
can hit a target for more than ten meters.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Everyone, take a good picture.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Look, the internal organs have been hit out.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Brothers, people can't take risks.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Look at how handsome he is.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Who knew he was a poor and evil devil?

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
If I really want to kill him,

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I don't need to be so troublesome.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Did you see it?

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Killing is threatening us.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Everyone, take a good look.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Stop.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Who allowed you to come in?

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Mr. Su, you're here today

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
to cover up for the assassin, right?

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Li Tianhao, stop messing around.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Piao Nan just had a car accident

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
on the way to the hospital.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The court has already issued a report.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It has nothing to do with Brother Wu Ming.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You're lying.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I heard that the fake car accident

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
was caused by you.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's right.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Don't use these false things

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
to fool us.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We want the truth.

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes, we want the truth.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Give us the truth.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay, I'll give you the truth.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
These are photos of the car accident.

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The physical examination record

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
when it was received by the hospital,

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and the autopsy report

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
of the forensic surgeon.

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
These evidences are enough to show

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
that Piao Nan's death

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
has nothing to do with Yi Wu Ming.

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Don't you want the truth?

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Take it.

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What are you taking pictures of?

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Besides,

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
it's easy for you to fake evidence.

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
If Ye Wu Ming didn't hurt Piao Nan,

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
how could Piao Nan come to the hospital?

67
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I dare to say that

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Ye Wu Ming has a direct relationship

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
with Piao Nan's death.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Am I right?

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yes.

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I think you're just here to fool us.

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You want the truth, right?

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I've already called the police

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
before I came here.

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You guys just wait.

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Inform the lawyer

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
that one of the slanderers

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
is counted as one.

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
All of you, please leave.

81
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Sorry, Junior.

82
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm sorry, Junior.

83
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I was careless.

84
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I've disturbed you.

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I was just...

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I was just worried about him.

87
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You mean that tall guy?

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Of course you were worried.

89
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's all because of that Song Yi...

90
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Junior,

91
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
they're trying to

92
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
frame you up on purpose.

93
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
No matter what you say,

94
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
they won't believe you.

95
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Don't feel burdened.

96
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You're innocent.

97
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Don't worry about that.

98
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I understand, Senior.

99
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I know what I'm doing.

100
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Good.

101
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'll share the evidence online.

102
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You can rest assured.

103
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I've already bought

104
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
this nursing home.

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Anbao has become our employee.

106
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This kind of thing

107
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
won't happen again.

108
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
All the slanderers

109
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
are being sued.

110
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
There were too many people at the scene.

111
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The businessmen

112
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
were suspected of not

113
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
being able to get the job done.

114
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
We can only

115
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
be half-truth and half-truth.

116
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
There are two kinds of business online.

117
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Some say they're trying to

118
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
make a name for themselves.

119
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Some say they're trying to kill people.

120
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
This is a competition.

121
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Only by competing can you get the job done.

122
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Mr. Li,

123
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
you did a good job.

124
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's all because of you, Mr. Feng.

125
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Mr. Feng,

126
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
how do you want to push the country forward?

127
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Su Mingzhu

128
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
will definitely

129
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
reveal the evidence.

130
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But everyone

131
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
only likes to hear gossip.

132
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
As long as we

133
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
make things worse

134
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
before he's exposed,

135
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
no one will

136
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
tell the truth.

137
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Hao Zhi and Qian Jing

138
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
only laugh at the family.

139
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
They are cruel and

140
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
do all they can.

141
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
In order to hide the truth,

142
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
they pretend to be suspicious.

143
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You're so smart.

144
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You're so kind.

145
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You're so smart.

146
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You're good at

147
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
killing people.

148
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'll find someone

149
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
to expose this news.

150
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Come in.

151
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Senior.

152
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Junior.

153
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You're taking your medicine.

154
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Why are you dressed like this?

155
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Master will be angry.

156
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Why are you so scary?

157
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I chose this specially.

158
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
How is it?

159
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Do you like it?

160
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I like it.

161
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I like it.

162
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I like it.

163
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I like it.

164
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I like it.

165
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I like it.

166
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I like it.

167
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I like it.

168
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I like it.

169
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Do you like it?

170
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm also very nervous.

171
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
My heart is beating fast.

172
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Do you want to touch it?

173
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Stop it.

174
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Go back to sleep.

175
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Touch it.

176
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You're so mean.

177
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Stop it.

178
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Master taught you

179
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
martial arts.

180
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
He didn't teach you to hide from the truth.

181
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We were engaged.

182
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
We'll be together sooner or later.

183
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Master is joking.

184
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Don't bring this up again.

185
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
How can it be a joke?

186
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
A master is a master.

187
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
A father is a father.

188
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Master wants us to be together.

189
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I think we're a good match.

190
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Senior won't go against

191
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
what Master said, right?

192
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Senior.

193
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Come on.

194
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But in my heart,

195
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
you've always been a sister.

196
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Then you should hug your sister.

197
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Song Yi Ran.

198
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What did you say?

199
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Senior.

200
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Senior.

201
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Now, the news on the Internet

202
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
is saying that you killed someone.

203
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And they all agree that

204
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
someone was hit by the SCU

205
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
in the accident at the scene.

206
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
They also posted some

207
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
malicious videos

208
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
that are not mentioned to the car accident.

209
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Senior, those self-proclaimed information

210
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
are useless.

211
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's a joke.

212
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The law also issued a law

213
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
against their rumors.

214
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's a lie.

215
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's a lie.

216
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's a lie.

217
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's a lie.

218
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's a lie.

219
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's a lie.

220
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The law issued a law against them.

221
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But it didn't work.

222
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
They are just making up the story.

223
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Even if they were caught,

224
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
they would say that

225
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
it's not reported.

226
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
They didn't follow the rules.

227
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It doesn't affect the spread at all.

228
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It seems that they are after me.

229
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's okay.

230
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I think we should stay still.

231
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
They will reveal their secrets sooner or later.

232
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Then you just stay here.

233
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Don't go out recently.

234
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Wait for them to come to their senses.

235
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm leaving.

236
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You should rest early.

237
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Get up.

238
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Senior,

239
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
why are you so disheveled?

240
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Senior, come here.

241
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Junior.

242
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Junior.

243
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Wait.

244
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Don't move.

245
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Junior.

246
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Junior, I said no.

247
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Why not?

248
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Okay.

249
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Senior.

250
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Junior.

251
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Senior.

252
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Junior, wait for me.

253
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Wait.

254
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Is that enough?

255
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Stop it.

256
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Go back to sleep.

257
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Wait for a while.

258
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I thought you had let go of it.

259
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Senior lost his memory before.

260
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I wish him and Yi Ran to meet again.

261
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Now that he has lost his memory,

262
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
why don't I give it a try?

263
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I've lost it once.

264
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I can't lose again.

265
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Only those who are not confident will be afraid of losing.

266
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Senior,

267
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I know you like him too.

268
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Why do you say that?

269
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Then why don't you let him meet Song Yi Ran?

270
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You know that

271
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
it's easy to recover his memory

272
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
when you meet him now.

273
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And

274
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I've never seen you care about someone so much.

275
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Do you like him?

276
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yes.

277
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Senior.

278
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's me who has an engagement with Senior.

279
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I was just joking with you.

280
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You take it seriously.

281
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I won't joke.

282
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Our engagement is real.

283
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Hello.

284
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Sister Yi Ran.

285
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
They said that Wu Ming Brother can't meet you.

286
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
They lied to you.

287
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
This must be his last chance to recover his memory.

288
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Ba San,

289
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
how did you know?

290
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I overheard it in the chat room.

291
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Sister, you should find a way now.

292
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Otherwise, Wu Ming Brother will forget you.

293
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'll go now.

294
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Sister,

295
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
there are many people at the door.

296
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You can't come in.

297
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Why don't you

298
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
think of another way?

299
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Okay, I got it.

300
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'll go now.

301
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The taste can bring back

302
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
the first memory of people.

303
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Brother,

304
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
try this tomato fried egg.

305
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Brother,

306
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
is there anything

307
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
that you want to eat?

308
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's so bad.

309
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Thank you, Brother Kai.

310
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Actually,

311
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
you don't have to be so nervous every time.

312
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's okay.

313
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Mr. Ye has told me

314
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
to protect you

315
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
when he's not around.

316
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So he did

317
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
so much behind my back.

318
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
This is a alarm.

319
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Press this when you're in trouble.

320
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Okay.

321
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'll go now.

322
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'll go now.

323
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'll go now.

324
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'll go now.

325
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'll go now.

326
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'll go now.

327
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'll go now.

328
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'll go now.

329
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'll go now.

330
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'll go now.

331
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'll go now.

332
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Press this when you're in trouble.

333
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
We're nearby.

334
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Thank you, Brother Kai.

335
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'll go now.

336
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But this tastes familiar.

337
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I think I've eaten it before.

338
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
This is made by Yiran.

339
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I finally got it for you.

340
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yiran?

341
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Song Yiran?

342
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yes.

343
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
This name is familiar too.

344
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But I can't remember it.

345
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's okay, Brother.

346
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's okay if you can't remember it.

347
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
We can get to know each other anyway.

348
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You two can do it too.

349
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yiran.

350
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I don't like to make a detour.

351
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Tell me where the bank card is.

352
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I can spare your life.

353
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I've really destroyed

354
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
that bank card.

355
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Then there's nothing you can do.

356
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You could have used it to buy yourself.

357
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
In the case of a weak opponent,

358
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
the first thing to do is to block the most powerful opponent.

359
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'll go now.

360
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'll go now.

361
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'll go now.

362
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'll go now.

363
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'll go now.

364
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'll go now.

365
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'll go now.

366
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
First, you have to block the opponent's vision.

367
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
After the call,

368
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
the attacker will immediately

369
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
guard the gate

370
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
to prevent you from escaping.

371
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Find a place to hide.

372
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Don't make any noise.

373
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Try to find a way to save him.

374
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You want to call the police, right?

375
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You underestimated me.

376
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The signal here has long been blocked by me.

377
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Remember.

378
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
No matter how the opponent seduces you,

379
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
don't come out.

380
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Three years ago,

381
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
you killed Ye Wu Ming's master.

382
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
He will know sooner or later.

383
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I didn't kill his master.

384
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I didn't kill his master.

385
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I didn't kill his master.

386
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I didn't kill his master.

387
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I didn't kill his master.

388
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So it's here.

389
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Then explain to him.

390
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
See if he believes it.

391
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I believe it.

392
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's okay, Yiran.

393
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yiran, I'm coming.

394
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Sister Yiran,

395
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
you don't know that I'm good at imitating, right?

396
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yiran, come on.

397
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Let me take care of you.

398
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I advise you to hand over

399
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
the bank card quickly.

400
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Otherwise, I can hide

401
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
on your face.

402
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I advise you not to do this.

403
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Wu Ming,

404
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
aren't you in the hospital?

405
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm surprised that you didn't hold me back.

406
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Go.

407
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You...

408
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
How did you get out?

409
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
The world is cold and cold.

410
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I am the one.

411
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
When I understand the past,

412
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
there will be a firework.

413
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I will be stubborn and persistent.

414
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I will only be a legend.

415
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The whole universe

416
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
shines because of me.

417
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
The world is cold and cold.

418
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I will only be a legend.

419
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
The whole universe

420
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
shines because of me.

421
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
The whole universe

422
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
shines because of me.
