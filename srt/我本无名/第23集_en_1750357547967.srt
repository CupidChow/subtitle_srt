1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The whole universe shines because of me

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You not only controlled Yiran,

4
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
but also destroyed everyone at the scene

5
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and made them forget about it.

6
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
If Master's death is found abnormal,

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
you will take Yiran as the scapegoat.

8
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So, that video is real.

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But I don't remember it at all.

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Because you controlled me.

11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's really hard for you to play such a big role

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
in the main plot.

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
When did you start to plan it?

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Since I found out that you took Yiran as the scapegoat.

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You let Yiran take the lead

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and yourself killed Master.

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You arranged someone to kill me.

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But you didn't expect me to survive.

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Actually, Mr. Li is also your puppet.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
When he was rescued by us,

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
you were afraid that your identity would be exposed.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So you cut the grass and killed him.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Mr. Hong is the same.

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You arranged the hospital to give him the drug

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
before he died.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
No wonder I dreamt of him every time.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
My heart hurts.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You called the Ouyang family for revenge.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You took the four families' lives.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But you didn't know where Mr. Ma's life was.

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So you arranged a play

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
where you and Mr. Ma were kidnapped.

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Then you threatened Mr. Ma

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
to give the life to me.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I gave it to you.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's the safest to put it in your hand.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You kidnapped Yiran again

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and asked me to give the life to you.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Right, Senior?

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You controlled Yiran and Si'er.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
They are all the people I trust the most.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Didn't Master give you the position of successor

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and make you hate me so much?

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Without you,

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Master wouldn't have let me go.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
He found out I'm from Dongchuan.

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
He's afraid I grew up here.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
He has a deep prejudice against me.

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That's why I went down the mountain.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Senior.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Why did you do this

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
to kill the family?

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You should turn yourself in.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Turn myself in?

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Do you think you can control me?

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'll leave Kai to you.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Senior.

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You left without saying a word?

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Why did you run so fast?

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Because I'm not as busy as Mr. Su.

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I used to be a bodyguard.

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I need to exercise every day.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It seems that Junior

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
is determined to catch me.

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You are a man of your word.

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You are unbearable.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Come on.

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let's have a drink.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The four big groups are all mine now.

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
No one can survive.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm not afraid of them.

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I know they are on your side.

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But they have been controlled by me.

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Only the antidote can wake them up.

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
If you want the antidote,

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
use Mr. Ma's secret medicine.

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It seems that Senior knows me well.

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Okay.

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'll go.

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Where is Senior?

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Kai.

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Senior.

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What's wrong with me?

84
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I was at the door just now.

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Why did I come here?

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Kai.

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You are controlled by Su Mingyu

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
just like me.

89
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Controlled?

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I had a dream just now.

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I dreamed that I beat my brother.

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I was so scared.

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I was so scared.

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You beat your brother?

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Kai.

96
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's true that it's not a dream.

97
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
We are all in the hospital.

98
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm sorry, brother.

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's okay, Kai.

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
If you really beat him,

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
you can't beat me.

102
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Lu Bing.

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Lu Qing.

104
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Although you were controlled,

105
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
you did something illegal.

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You should go to the police station and turn yourself in.

107
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
After the legal process is done,

108
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
you can go anywhere.

109
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Or follow me.

110
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
We are willing to follow Brother Wu Ming.

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Brother.

112
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So many beauties are following you.

113
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Especially sister-in-law.

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So many beauties are following him.

115
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Aren't you happier?

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm happy.

117
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Are you happy?

118
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm happy.

119
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm sure you are happy.

120
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Brother Kai is happy.

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Old Eight.

122
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You are so anxious.

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Let's be happy.

124
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
There must be a way to solve it.

125
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The four big corporations

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
have been taken away by Su Mingzhu.

127
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He is now holding thousands of assets.

128
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
How can I be happy?

129
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I trusted him so much before.

130
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I didn't expect it to be a scam.

131
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
His real identity has been exposed.

132
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
How dare he be so arrogant?

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
This is what I'm most worried about.

134
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
He offended many people now.

135
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm afraid that the little brother will take revenge.

136
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
He definitely can't stay here.

137
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I suspect that he will move his assets overseas.

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Old Man Ma.

139
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You suspect that he is going to escape.

140
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yes.

141
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
If the assets of the thousand-million are transferred,

142
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
plus all the companies that are downstream,

143
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
at least hundreds of thousands of employees will be affected.

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It will be very dangerous.

145
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Look.

146
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I've been sending people to investigate.

147
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Su Mingzhu has been trading in the capital market frequently these months.

148
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
He can't transfer the money at will.

149
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It is very likely that he will change to expensive assets and take away.

150
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Su Mingzhu.

151
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The goods are here.

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Go and ask the people to come back for the goods.

153
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yes.

154
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Director Su.

155
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
We have bought all the goods.

156
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
They are worth 81 yuan in total.

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Put them in the warehouse first.

158
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
When the goods arrive,

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
send them all overseas.

160
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yes.

161
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Brother.

162
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I have sent a message to the people in the Mingzhu Group.

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,800
The key

164
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,720
is the key to the transfer of funds.

165
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,040
Mingzhu Group

166
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,560
has many different vehicles.

167
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,600
I'll take my brothers to mark them.

168
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,280
Send you the map now.

169
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:23,840
Okay.

170
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,800
But he must be transferring assets.

171
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,840
These are all smoke bombs.

172
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,000
They're really protected in other places.

173
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,360
Hongming, how did you know?

174
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,200
These routes

175
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,320
are carefully planned

176
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,120
to lure us to the hook.

177
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,600
People usually want to hide routes

178
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,120
and be unconsciously avoiding targets.

179
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,120
But experts usually overcome this subconsciousness.

180
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,720
They deliberately design routes

181
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,600
to pass targets.

182
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,160
The traffic here is the most convenient

183
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,080
from the dock.

184
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,160
We've already known

185
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,640
the starting and ending points of the maze.

186
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,440
Now we'll connect them.

187
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,760
It seems that we've already

188
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,400
come close to the answer.

189
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,200
This route has gone through all the routes.

190
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,680
But only it hasn't been connected.

191
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,280
Let's go.

192
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,720
Go to the end point.

193
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,800
Brother,

194
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,400
this place

195
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,280
doesn't look like it.

196
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,480
What's the value of this cake stand?

197
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,480
Think about it.

198
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,680
Isn't this the best disguise?

199
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,720
There's only a 10-minute bus stop here.

200
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,840
It's still a fast road.

201
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:31,960
It's a good deal.

202
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,200
The bus is broken.

203
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,880
Sir,

204
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,200
are you rich?

205
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,520
I'm just a broken man.

206
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,480
I'm not rich.

207
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,440
Come on, let me help you.

208
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,320
Okay, okay.

209
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,040
Turn.

210
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,960
Young man, thank you.

211
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,640
Sir,

212
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,800
the broken bus in your car is new.

213
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,760
It's not worth the money.

214
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,360
I just changed a broken phone.

215
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,040
Coincidentally,

216
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,520
I have a new phone here.

217
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,400
I changed it with you.

218
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,720
Young man, you're kidding me.

219
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,000
Don't tease me.

220
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,560
Okay.

221
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,120
The name is Huadou Colored Steel Cup.

222
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,440
The auction price is 2.8 billion.

223
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,960
This one is long-lasting.

224
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,160
It's hard to get the same quality as the auction.

225
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,160
Brother,

226
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,920
this one is worth 3 billion.

227
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,640
This should be the cheapest thing

228
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,080
in the bus.

229
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,080
Young man,

230
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,360
how did you know?

231
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,120
Your car

232
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,160
looks messy.

233
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,920
After all, it's so valuable.

234
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,600
And,

235
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,080
you said you wanted to collect waste goods.

236
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,560
Who would sell the broken bus to you

237
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,840
according to a waste shopping mall?

238
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,360
If I'm not wrong,

239
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,080
your destination is the warehouse behind, right?

240
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,800
You're not wrong.

241
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,800
I can take you there.

242
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,400
But,

243
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,040
you have to let go of me

244
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,240
when you get there.

245
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,040
Take the road.

246
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,240
Young man,

247
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,000
you're too naive.

248
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,160
Do you know why I tricked you?

249
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
You used the warehouse's antiques to lure me here.

250
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,000
You're quite knowledgeable.

251
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,960
Junior.

252
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,800
We are

253
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,800
unknown

254
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,800
and wrong.

255
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,800
We don't care about the world's coldness.

256
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,800
I am

257
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,800
me.

258
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
I know that

259
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,800
there will be a fire.

260
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,800
I will be stubborn

261
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,800
and insist on

262
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,800
being a legend.

263
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,800
The whole universe

264
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,800
shines because of me.
