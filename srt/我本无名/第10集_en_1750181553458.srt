1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let the universe shine because of me

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What's wrong?

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Brother, Song Yan, why are you still here?

5
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Ye Wu Min, you...

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
San Er has no place to live. She has to stay at your house for a few days.

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Listen to my sister.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I have to go to the movie festival right now.

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Stop.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You can't enter the theater without taking the person.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We are here to attend the movie festival.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Where is the invitation card?

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Can we use one invitation card?

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
No.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Ye,

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Ye,

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
you are here to attend the movie festival.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Why are you so excited?

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Brother,

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
why don't you go over there and rest?

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
No.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I have to protect the person.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You think you can enter if you want to?

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Is there such an invitation card?

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
There is no way out.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What's going on?

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's all blocked at the door.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Mr. Ma,

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
it's okay.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Just for the movie festival.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You said she had to go to the movie festival.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You said it's ridiculous.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's right.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
A bodyguard is not suitable

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
to attend the movie festival.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The contract.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Brother,

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I was careless.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yesterday,

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I wanted to give you the movie

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
of the Ma family.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I wanted to express my gratitude.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I signed it today.

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
No, no, no.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's not appropriate.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Mr. Ma,

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
are you kidding me?

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The movie is ranked fifth in the country.

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You gave it to her.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You gave her more than ten star stars.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes, Mr. Ma.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's not appropriate.

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Don't be so modest.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
After Miss Song's contract is terminated,

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
you can sign it under the banner of Wuwei Film.

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Then you can rest assured.

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Welcome our new chairman of Wuwei Film

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Mr. Ye Wu Ming.

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Mr. Ye, please.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Mr. Ma.

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He became the chairman?

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
My senior is really attractive.

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That kid became the chairman.

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
How to deal with him now?

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I wanted to use Mr. Ma to kill people.

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I didn't expect to help him to climb a floor.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What should we do now?

68
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Don't be with Qi.

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Don't play with him.

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
With this contract,

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
you can make it true that Song Yi Ran

72
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
is still in the contract period.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
This is a serious breach.

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
As long as you sue him,

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
you can get a huge compensation.

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll see if he dares to do it.

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No.

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You're so stubborn.

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm leaving.

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm leaving.

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm leaving.

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Let's go.

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Sister, you look good today.

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Your necklace looks good today.

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yi Ran.

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I suddenly remembered that

87
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
you didn't go to the company account

88
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
for the drama last year.

89
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That was the profit of Mr. Li.

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That's not a big deal.

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Your current behavior is already designed to break the contract.

93
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So what?

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It won't be a big deal.

95
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
With your current price,

96
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
the penalty is not much.

97
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's just one hundred million.

98
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Sister, one hundred million

99
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
should be enough, right?

100
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
No one wants

101
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
a star who has worked hard

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
to train himself to be like this to leave.

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Right?

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Or that sentence,

105
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
if you don't go to the hospital,

106
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
you can't get married.

107
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Let's just pretend that this didn't happen.

108
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Mr. Ma.

109
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
How much can the five-way business

110
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
move to the cash register?

111
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Now there are less than two hundred million.

112
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The rest has not been recovered yet.

113
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Then can I take out one hundred million

114
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
as Yi Ran's deposit?

115
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You said you were already in trouble.

116
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
One hundred million?

117
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Are you kidding me?

118
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Now it's your company.

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You have the right to move.

120
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Mr. Ma.

121
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You can't joke like this.

122
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Joke?

123
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Mr. Li.

124
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You think I'm joking?

125
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
No comment.

126
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'll sign the contract and pay the bill in three days.

127
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Then thank you, Mr. Ma.

128
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Don't be in a hurry to thank me.

129
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I have conditions for one hundred million.

130
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Tomorrow, you have to go to a place with me.

131
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
As long as I can help Yi Ran to make a contract.

132
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Okay.

133
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Your favorite meat is here.

134
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's really hard to know

135
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Mr. Ye's cooking.

136
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You said that.

137
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Song Damingxing also made one.

138
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What did you call me just now?

139
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Mr. Ye.

140
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Let me hear you call me.

141
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Mr. Ye.

142
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
No.

143
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You're a little stubborn.

144
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I still like the way you were so arrogant at first.

145
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Call me Little Guard.

146
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yes.

147
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Little Guard.

148
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But you have upgraded from Little Guard to Mr. Ye.

149
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You will be my boss soon.

150
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I dare not call you Little Guard anymore.

151
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay.

152
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Then you just be cold and jump.

153
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It just fits the spirit of Song Damingxing.

154
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Of course.

155
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But your clothes are too low-key.

156
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Not like Mr. Ye at all.

157
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What's wrong with my clothes?

158
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Big boss, do you understand?

159
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Big boss is low-key, luxurious, and has inner peace.

160
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You understand?

161
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Mr. Ye.

162
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Thank you.

163
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You're welcome.

164
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Although I'm the chairman, I'm still your bodyguard.

165
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Protecting you is my job.

166
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Let's try my fried egg with tomatoes first.

167
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Then I'll eat it.

168
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You have to make it for me every day.

169
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Is it good?

170
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's good.

171
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I knew you would like it.

172
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
No, no, no. I'll try something else.

173
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
No, no, no.

174
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'll try something else.

175
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'll give you the egg.

176
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
No.

177
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The wine is good.

178
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The wine is good.

179
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The wine is good.

180
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Come on.

181
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Mr. Wang.

182
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The bow doesn't take the arrow.

183
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You dare to give me a hundred million.

184
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'll ask them to say it directly.

185
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You'll know when you get there.

186
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
This matter concerns more than one hundred million.

187
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Everyone.

188
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Please come out.

189
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Mr. Ye.

190
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
We meet again.

191
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Let's go!

192
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Brother, don't worry.

193
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Sit down.

194
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,840
I'm sorry.

195
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,240
They were all

196
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,080
helped by the Eight Immortal Sects.

197
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,920
They knew you were the successor of the Eight Immortal Sects

198
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,400
and came to meet you.

199
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,280
Actually,

200
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,200
we are the four big corporations

201
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,080
that have been looking for you.

202
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,680
Mr. Ma,

203
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,520
you asked me to come here today

204
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,000
not only to get familiar with the Jibes.

205
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,280
Eight years ago,

206
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,600
all four of us were killed by our opponents

207
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,760
and were killed by the soldiers.

208
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,080
Eight Immortal Sects came to help me

209
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,640
to come back to life.

210
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,280
There was only one condition at that time.

211
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,480
That is, eight years later,

212
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,640
I will donate thirty percent of my wealth

213
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,000
to the Eight Immortal Sects.

214
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,080
The successor will take over the position

215
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,280
and repay the society.

216
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,480
Now,

217
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,920
we finally found the successor.

218
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,120
Mr. Ma, you are so tempting.

219
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,440
I have told you so many times.

220
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,880
I'm not a successor.

221
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,600
Besides,

222
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,160
I can't remember it.

223
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,280
You can only prove that you are the successor

224
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,920
so that I can pay the penalty of the breach of contract

225
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
of Song Yi Ran.

226
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,000
This is at least two hundred billion yuan.

227
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,880
If you can manage it,

228
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,400
no one can make it difficult for you.

229
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,400
Okay.

230
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,600
What if I'm not the successor?

231
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,400
I believe you are.

232
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,160
Mr. Ma,

233
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,240
don't say that.

234
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,560
We have found many

235
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,600
so-called successors over the years.

236
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,520
But they all proved to be fake.

237
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,720
You have seen the shards of stone.

238
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,280
Only the eight immortals of the righteous sect can do it.

239
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,920
The successor is worth millions of yuan.

240
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,880
Although there is no guarantee of similarity,

241
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,640
we don't want to break our promise.

242
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,640
But we must prove that

243
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,560
he is the successor.

244
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,720
If we want to recognize him,

245
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,000
we must follow the rules.

246
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,840
That's right.

247
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,440
We must follow the rules.

248
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,680
I've practiced the eight-pairing boxing with these two.

249
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,320
You might be the successor.

250
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,320
With that in mind,

251
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,560
I have to fight them.

252
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:44,960
Xiao Zui,

253
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,160
are you afraid?

254
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,160
You can admit defeat if you are afraid.

255
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,760
I'm afraid.

256
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,160
I don't care if I'm the successor.

257
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,280
I just want the penalty of Song Yi Ran.

258
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,800
I don't know business.

259
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,120
But when it comes to boxing,

260
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,080
I'm a little suspicious.

261
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,120
When it comes to boxing,

262
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,080
I'm a little suspicious.

263
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,080
Back then, the old man said that

264
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,360
the one who can learn martial arts is important for the cultivation of life.

265
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,600
So the way he left the martial arts

266
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,960
is to practice martial arts and learn the back.

267
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,360
Here are 150 candles.

268
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,040
You can use the steam.

269
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,360
The more candles you blow,

270
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,120
the closer the last candle is.

271
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,120
The higher the score.

272
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,320
That is to say,

273
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,320
the first five candles are 60 points.

274
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,840
The first ten candles are 80 points.

275
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,400
The last one is 100 points.

276
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,120
65 points.

277
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,120
91 points.

278
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,840
You didn't play well.

279
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,120
It should be 95 points.

280
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,760
What's wrong?

281
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,560
Get out if you can't.

282
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,360
You're out.

283
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,400
Not a single candle is out.

284
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,840
The business is full.

285
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,080
Why?

286
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,560
Not a single candle is out.

287
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,920
The last one is out.

288
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,240
You...

289
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,960
How did you do it?

290
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,120
I just...

291
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,360
I just used a trick.

292
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,160
You corked on this retreat,

293
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,120
and used the trick on me.

294
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,120
A extrapolate revenge.

295
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,640
Miss Danka.

296
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,080
Do you take the certificate

297
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
with you?

298
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,440
I'll explain it to them right away.

299
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,840
To be honest,

300
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,120
Three.

301
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,120
Correct.

302
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,120
Five.

303
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,120
Correct.

304
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,120
It's boring to compete like this.

305
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,120
Why don't we have a game?

306
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,120
The position of the candles is determined by the direction of the north, south, and west.

307
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,120
Okay.

308
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
Who will go first?

309
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,120
I'll go first.

310
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,120
I'll go first.

311
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,120
Okay.

312
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,120
Two tables on the east side.

313
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,120
All destroyed.

314
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,120
Correct.

315
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,120
It's your turn.

316
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,120
Please.

317
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,120
One table on the south side.

318
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,120
Two tables on the east side.

319
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,120
The last table on the west side.

320
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,120
One.

321
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,120
One.

322
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,120
One.

323
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
One.

324
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,120
One.

325
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,120
One.

326
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,120
One.

327
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,120
One.

328
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,120
You won the firework competition.

329
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,120
Impossible.

330
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,120
Absolutely impossible.

331
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,120
How can your hearing and taste be so good?

332
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,120
I was born with it.

333
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,120
You're not bad either.

334
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,120
Although you cheated, you still have some real skills.

335
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,120
How did you know?

336
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,120
I was born with it.

337
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,120
Boy, you're amazing.

338
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,120
I can't believe you're the successor of the eight-star.

339
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,120
But,

340
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,120
it's worth two hundred billion.

341
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,120
We must be careful.

342
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,120
Wait for the notice first.

343
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,120
We'll check it again.

344
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,120
Ye Wu Ming.

345
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,120
Don't think it's so easy to get two hundred billion.

346
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,120
Wait and see.

347
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,120
I'll show you how hot the money is.

348
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,120
Wu Ming.

349
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,120
The test this time is the eight-star basic skill.

350
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,120
The hearing and taste are left by the master.

351
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,120
I hope you can get some inspiration from it.

352
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,120
And get some memories back.

353
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,120
It does help me get some muscle memory back.

354
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,120
Among us four,

355
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,120
Mr. Feng is the richest.

356
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,120
He doesn't want to give up 30% of his wealth.

357
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,120
Maybe there will be other actions.

358
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,120
Little Chun Dian.

359
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,120
Be careful.

360
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,120
I understand.

361
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,120
Yiran.

362
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,120
Wu Ming, save me.

363
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:58,120
I'm the one who knows the past will be changed.

364
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,120
I will be stubborn and persistent.

365
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,120
I will tell the story.

366
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:14,120
The whole universe is shining because of me.

367
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,120
The End
