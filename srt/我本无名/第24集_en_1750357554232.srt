1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The whole universe shines because of me

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 29

3
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,160
Young man, you're too naive.

4
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,840
Do you know why I tricked you here?

5
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,880
You used the stock of Mancanggu to lure me here.

6
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,040
You're still not good enough.

7
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,000
Junior.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,080
It is so cold!

9
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,720
Thank you for bringing the keys.

10
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,560
Keys?

11
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,600
The coat 같은 as yours.

12
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,040
you've really made a great effort.

13
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,600
It's nothing.

14
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,200
If you go back to Dongchuan with me,

15
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,360
it will be all yours.

16
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,200
You can't even

17
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,480
get to the customs with these things.

18
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,360
Of course I can't just leave.

19
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,520
I have to use the identity of the successor of the Eight Immortals

20
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,320
to show off the culture

21
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,920
to Dongchuan.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,960
At that time,

23
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,040
there will be a shocking

24
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,280
ancient treasure robbery.

25
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,040
At that time,

26
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,880
I am the victim.

27
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,960
Senior,

28
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,960
you deliberately

29
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,640
made a document on the successor of the Eight Immortals

30
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,320
to frame me.

31
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,280
It's okay.

32
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,440
I'm here.

33
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,600
Don't take these things away.

34
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,400
I can't take these things away,

35
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,480
but I can destroy it.

36
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,600
If you want to take it back,

37
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,920
you have to pay me back with your currency.

38
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,000
First, get a big sum of 200 million.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,800
Yes.

40
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,080
You want this?

41
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,080
I recognized you on the day of the press conference.

42
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,440
I asked you to go to my house

43
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,520
to confirm whether you remember the secret of the currency.

44
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,640
Cheers.

45
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,960
This is the most important treasure of the sect.

46
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,360
You really gave it to me?

47
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,520
It's so shameless.

48
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,200
With the currency,

49
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,200
I can control the inheritance of the Eight Immortals.

50
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,960
I can control the inheritance of the Eight Immortals.

51
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,400
I can control the inheritance of the Eight Immortals.

52
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,520
I, Dongchuan Martial Arts,

53
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,400
will be above you.

54
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,920
I told you earlier

55
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,520
that the currency can increase strength.

56
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,480
Without it, you can't protect the antiques.

57
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,360
I can take the antiques back at any time.

58
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,640
Master,

59
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,880
you've been practicing to throw up in the attic.

60
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,320
I want to learn the most powerful art.

61
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,240
I've taught you before.

62
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,320
I don't understand.

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,920
You'll understand when the time comes.

64
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,120
Master,

65
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,720
this is the one punch that I knew

66
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,240
before you died.

67
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,560
The ultimate punch.

68
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,800
The Eight Bloods of the Sea.

69
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,160
San'er,

70
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,400
call the police.

71
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:09,960
Senior,

72
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,720
you don't know, do you?

73
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,560
My body is special.

74
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,400
I have a pulse on my right arm.

75
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,840
It can train the vitality automatically.

76
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,840
The currency that Master gave me

77
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,840
is used to seal the power.

78
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,200
Impossible.

79
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,200
Impossible!

80
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,160
I can feel the power is increasing.

81
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,800
That's because you haven't practiced enough.

82
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,080
For me,

83
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,920
this currency is a seal.

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,200
But for you,

85
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,080
it can increase strength.

86
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,200
I've been practicing for ten years.

87
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,280
I can't even get you out of it.

88
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,080
The Eight Immortals

89
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,000
are trained to become immortals

90
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,640
after the hardships of the human world.

91
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,560
The Eight Immortals

92
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,280
are used to use the seven emotions and six desires

93
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,320
to exert their power.

94
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,800
You have no feelings.

95
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,440
You can't understand it.

96
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,040
And my currency.

97
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
No one can take it away.

98
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,240
Senior, listen up.

99
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,720
It's just a small thing.

100
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,720
The Eight Immortals

101
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,000
will never understand

102
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,600
the truth of our traditional martial arts.

103
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,000
The wind blows like the spring breeze, the wine is cold.

104
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,800
When I was young, I forgot how I looked like.

105
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,240
I was sad when I was young.

106
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I was so busy with my dreams.

107
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,000
My dream was gone.

108
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,920
I will never forget the fight, no matter the result.

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,760
I was a nameless man.

110
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,720
I didn't care about the world.

111
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,560
I am the one

112
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,400
who knows when there will be a fire.

113
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:22,040
I will be stubborn and persistent.

114
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,040
I will be a legend.

115
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,240
The whole universe

116
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,040
will shine because of me.

117
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,520
Will shine because of me.

118
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,760
The Long Ballad

119
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,760
Episode 16

120
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,240
This is the road I was hit three years ago.

121
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,480
But I can't remember

122
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,440
who saved me.

123
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,680
This road...

124
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,560
What's wrong with this road?

125
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,600
Wake up.

126
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,720
Don't sleep.

127
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,000
Wake up.

128
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,480
Hang in there.

129
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,160
Don't sleep.

130
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,760
Three years ago.

131
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,480
Three years ago.

132
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,080
You saved me.

133
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,720
The Long Ballad

134
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,120
Dear, look.

135
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,400
This is the place

136
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,200
I used to live.

137
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,440
How is it?

138
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,520
Is it beautiful?

139
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
It's beautiful.

140
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,760
Master.

141
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,080
You didn't see it wrong.

142
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
It's me.

143
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,320
Master.

144
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,760
I didn't expect you to be alive.

145
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
I'm back.

146
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,240
Okay.

147
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,320
Where have you been at 13 o'clock?

148
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,880
Baimuru.

149
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,960
Let me tell you.

150
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,880
I wanted to leave the mountain gate

151
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,680
and walk around.

152
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,800
But your master set a rule

153
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,680
that you can't walk around the mountain gate.

154
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,800
I was so depressed.

155
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,240
I caught up with your senior

156
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,520
Su Mingzhu's ambition.

157
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,320
So I pretended to be dead

158
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,320
and went on a trip.

159
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,880
You pretended to be dead?

160
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,600
Do you know how much I missed you these three years?

161
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,560
You brat.

162
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,360
You lost your memory these three years.

163
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,320
How many days have you been thinking about it?

164
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,160
Mu Ming.

165
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,920
These three years are a good start for you.

166
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,200
From today on,

167
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,760
you are officially the leader of our Ba Xian Sect.

168
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,160
But I want to remind you.

169
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,920
The real enemy of our Ba Xian Sect

170
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,840
is back.

171
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,000
We Eight Hills

172
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:26,400
We've known each other all our lives

173
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,280
Never fear how cold the world is

174
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:37,520
I can feel the courage

175
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,680
I will be stubborn, persistent

176
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,680
Only to die in legend

177
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:54,680
The whole universe shines because of me
