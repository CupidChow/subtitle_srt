1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The whole universe shines because of me

2
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,160
Episode 15

3
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,680
Yin Ran!

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,320
Mr. Li, the mission is done.

5
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,080
Song Yi Ran is dead.

6
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,240
Here's the thing.

7
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,880
It's complicated to think about.

8
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,280
Why isn't he awake yet?

9
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,000
We can't find the reason now.

10
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,920
In this case,

11
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,120
we should let him rest in a familiar environment.

12
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,600
Thank you.

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,240
pigs

14
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:19,800
A golden

15
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,080
Sister Yi Ran won't break

16
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,520
Forgetful

17
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,800
Right,Sister Yi Ran will be fine.

18
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:34,800
I hope the flowers of yesterday are still in full bloom.

19
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:41,800
A star in the sky is not as beautiful as you.

20
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,800
It's unreasonable to meet you again.

21
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,800
Yan Ran.

22
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
Wake up.

23
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
I'm sorry.

24
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Brother, you didn't eat.

25
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
You must eat today.

26
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,800
Yan Ran.

27
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
I didn't protect you well.

28
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,800
I heard that

29
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,800
men want to get married after experiencing the warmth of home.

30
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,800
The love of the heart will eventually fall.

31
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Look at this.

32
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,800
Does it look like a ring used when you were married?

33
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:49,180
I've received my

34
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,800
But I think these are not reasons.

35
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,800
I'm sorry, Yan Ran.

36
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
If you give me another chance,

37
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
I will not be with you.

38
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,800
No matter who I am,

39
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,800
it doesn't matter whether I find my memory back.

40
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,800
I should cherish the chance to be with you now.

41
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
Yan Ran.

42
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Yan Ran.

43
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,800
If you can hear me,

44
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
wake up, okay?

45
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,800
Yan Ran.

46
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Yan Ran, you're awake.

47
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,800
A star in the sky is not as beautiful as you.

48
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
I've been with you

49
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,800
until you woke up.

50
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
I heard it later.

51
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
Don't cry anymore.

52
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
I'll cry in the sky.

53
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,800
Yan Ran.

54
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,800
I'm so scared.

55
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
I'm scared.

56
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
If I don't catch it,

57
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,800
I will cry for you.

58
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,800
I'm tired in the evening.

59
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,800
The person who blows the wind together is gone.

60
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
The love of the heart will eventually fall.

61
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Look at this.

62
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
I'm tired in the evening.

63
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
Do not play.

64
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
Do not play.

65
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,800
The person who blows the wind together is gone.

66
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,800
From now on, I will be drunk.

67
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,320
Can't wait for your tenderness

68
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,800
Don't wait in the empty

69
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,320
Listen to the evening wind pushing me away

70
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,600
Then I

71
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,240
I mentioned the words of memory

72
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,320
Let go

73
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,320
Let go

74
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,320
Brother

75
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,320
Brother

76
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,080
I know that you are happy that Yiran is awake

77
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,640
But you can't always laugh like this

78
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
Third

79
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,360
I never dared to let you call Yiran sister-in-law

80
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,880
You can call her openly in the future

81
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,880
Sure

82
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,880
Then the idol will be sister-in-law

83
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,040
I heard that Youming took over Song Yiran's movie

84
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,240
He asked you to hide the certificate

85
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,480
You have to play and promote it in 200 movies

86
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,640
Yes

87
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,000
This is the first time Song Yiran has played a movie with you

88
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,240
They are very important

89
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,680
You must not want

90
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,680
Youming and Song Yiran to be more successful

91
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,280
Of course

92
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,800
But they have signed the contract with the publishing company

93
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,560
They are ready

94
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,960
This contract is dead

95
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,800
The person is alive

96
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,880
Sign the contract

97
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,840
It can't be done well

98
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,400
Mr. Feng, you mean

99
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,000
Mr. Ni, I have prepared the penalty

100
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,720
Money can solve everything

101
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,040
It's nothing

102
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,920
You just make decisions

103
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,400
I just make money

104
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,000
More than 500 million

105
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,200
Let's discuss

106
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
Go

107
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,240
Thank you for your support, Mr. Feng

108
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,560
This is for future

109
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,560
Big又

110
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,920
Ah

111
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,120
Mr. Hu

112
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,000
Let li

113
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,840
About your future

114
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,640
particular

115
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,840
You will not know

116
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,720
key

117
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,340
But

118
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,600
If you do not know

119
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,160
You have no time

120
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
They say

121
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,440
Yes.

122
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,920
It's a contract.

123
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,120
How can you break the contract?

124
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,640
Close the door.

125
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,160
Mr. Li.

126
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,040
Mr. Li.

127
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,880
I'll accept the contract.

128
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,320
I'll pay the penalty.

129
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,840
Just beg me.

130
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,880
What are you talking about?

131
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,080
I asked you to do it.

132
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,720
How could you fail?

133
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,240
Your contract is 20 million, right?

134
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,040
Yes.

135
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,200
The penalty is 30 million.

136
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,480
I...

137
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,880
I have 33 million in my card.

138
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,880
Only one small amount

139
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,840
will be cancelled on the last day.

140
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,760
Mr. Hu.

141
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,640
The contract is written clearly.

142
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,640
You're regretting it now.

143
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,480
What do you mean?

144
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,920
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhao.

145
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,160
Our team didn't do a good job.

146
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,920
Is it a bad thing?

147
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,120
200 movies.

148
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,240
You have only five movies now.

149
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,720
What else can I do?

150
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,240
Did Mr. Li ask you to do it?

151
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,240
It has nothing to do with others.

152
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,320
It's the decision of the movie company.

153
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,400
They don't like the movie of Song Yiran.

154
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,480
They have to follow the contract

155
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,840
to see if it's good or not.

156
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,320
Mr. Ye, I'm sorry.

157
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,240
I'm just a small person in charge.

158
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,160
I can't do anything.

159
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,120
What should we do now?

160
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,600
Unless you go to the movie company yourself.

161
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,360
But it's impossible to get 200 movies

162
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,960
in one day.

163
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
I'll go now.

164
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,880
Mr. Hu.

165
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,600
Forget it.

166
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,400
How about

167
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,520
we choose a new day?

168
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,840
No.

169
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,640
The movie must be released next year.

170
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,440
The promotion has been delayed for so long.

171
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,400
The market will doubt the quality of the movie

172
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,040
and affect your reputation.

173
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,440
But it's only one day.

174
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,880
We can't afford it.

175
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,960
Mr. Ye, what should we do now?

176
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,680
There must be a way to the mountain.

177
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,080
I want to be alone.

178
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,240
You have no money to pay me back.

179
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,840
You have money to drink, right?

180
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,120
Brother Qi.

181
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,640
I'm not a person who can't pay back.

182
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,440
I'm really sleepy.

183
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,880
There are a bunch of brothers who are eating with me.

184
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,200
Give me another month.

185
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,880
You think I'm stupid?

186
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,720
Didn't you say that last month?

187
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,640
Brother Qi.

188
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,960
People always have difficulties.

189
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,080
Are you crazy?

190
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,520
He owes me money.

191
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,280
He's reasonable.

192
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Drink it.

193
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,000
I'll give you another month.

194
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,720
Drink it.

195
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,880
Drink it.

196
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,080
HeEE.

197
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,040
Kai.

198
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,480
Mr. Ye.

199
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,000
It's a misunderstanding.

200
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,040
It's a misunderstanding.

201
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,760
How much is it?

202
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,600
500,000.

203
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,400
This card has 1 million.

204
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,160
Drink it.

205
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,880
We're just playing.

206
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:24,960
Smell it.

207
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,080
Come on.

208
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,440
Mr. Ye.

209
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,320
It's a secret.

210
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,880
Six cards.

211
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,080
Mr. Ye, you're so...

212
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,920
Yin Wo Ming.

213
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,880
I used to bully you.

214
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,880
Why did you help me?

215
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,000
Kai.

216
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,320
It's not in vain.

217
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,560
Maybe only you can do it.

218
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,760
But if you think you can't do it,

219
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,560
then I must be wrong.

220
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,640
Tell me.

221
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,720
What is it?

222
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,240
I don't owe you.

223
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,720
Sit down.

224
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,120
I need you to

225
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,560
get 200 films in the city tonight.

226
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,920
Let them release a movie tomorrow.

227
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,040
Don't worry.

228
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,360
Money is not a problem.

229
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,680
I'm not in a hurry.

230
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,360
I have many brothers.

231
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,200
But they can't negotiate.

232
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,440
I can't do it.

233
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,960
I was stabbed by someone at the last minute.

234
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,400
It's not too troublesome

235
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,360
to talk about it now.

236
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,200
It's just that you have to work hard

237
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,200
with your brothers.

238
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,160
Kai.

239
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,960
This doesn't have any technical content.

240
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,880
If you don't know this,

241
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,400
then you really don't write.

242
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,080
What's the matter with you?

243
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,760
Just take it as I didn't say anything.

244
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,600
I'll answer it.

245
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,000
Mr. Li.

246
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,520
Don't come to Wu Wei.

247
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,120
What's the wind blowing into Ye?

248
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,440
Mr. Li.

249
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,240
I'm here to make a bet with you.

250
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,320
Fine.

251
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,520
I promise you, Lu Yue.

252
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,960
If you lose,

253
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,160
you have to pay off

254
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,680
all the shares of Wu Wei's film.

255
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,700
Heי� 링

256
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,980
The world isn't movies
