1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The whole universe shines because of me

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Senior.

4
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm coming. Don't hide.

5
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Ye Wu Ming.

6
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You're really here.

7
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
How dare you?

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I can't just sit and do nothing.

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Tell me. What's your condition?

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I told you long ago.

11
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Our Ouyang family is coming back

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
to take away the Four Great Groups.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Why do you need to take me with you

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
to take away your Four Great Groups?

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You're the successor of the Ba Xian Sect.

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You want to take away

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
thirty percent of the wealth of the Four Great Groups.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That's all owed to the Ouyang family.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
No one can take it away.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You're talking about the Ouyang family.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But I've checked.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
All the evidence about you being the Ouyang family

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
is false.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Who are you?

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You've checked me?

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I really underestimated you.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's easy to save them.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Do you dare to watch this video?

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
When you open the money,

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
you have to be prepared

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
to face the cruel reality.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You've been trying to find out

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
the truth of your master's death.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
This is it.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Is the AI's fake technology

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
so real now?

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm not a low-level person

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
who is not good at making up.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Zong Yi Ran went to the mountain gate

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
three years ago.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But he said he went out for a trip.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
If he didn't go,

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
why would he lie?

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I've checked the video.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The truth is,

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
the truth is,

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
the truth is,

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
the truth is,

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I've checked the video.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I have to take him away.

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You can take him away.

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'll send you the video.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Thank you, little brother.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You saved me again.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Ma Lang,

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
don't be so polite.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Let's go.

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Junior,

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I think it's not safe

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
to put the life-saving medicine in the safe.

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You should keep it.

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And,

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
talk to Zong Yi Ran

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
about Master.

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
We'll meet later.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'll talk to him alone.

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Let's go to see Mr. Feng

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
to see if he can wake up.

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Let's go.

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Okay.

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Mr. Zong,

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
how do you feel?

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm here.

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Don't worry.

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You're taking the treatment

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
of the hospital.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Do you remember

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
what happened last night?

80
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I remember.

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I saw him with my own eyes.

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Remember?

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That's not good.

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Have a good rest.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Junior,

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
this is my life-saving medicine.

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'll leave it to you.

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yes, little brother.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Now,

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
it's safe

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
to leave it to you.

93
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Okay.

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'll take it.

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Mr. Feng.

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Let's go.

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Mr. Feng

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
doesn't look right.

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Let's take a step back.

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Zan,

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
is Wu Min back?

102
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Okay.

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You're back.

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Don't move.

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I have something to tell you.

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What's this?

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Why can't I remember?

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This is not a film.

109
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's real.

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
August 15, three years ago.

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Three years ago?

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I went on a trip that day.

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Zou Yi Ran

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
went to Shanmen three years ago.

115
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But he said he went on a trip.

116
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
If he didn't,

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
why did he lie?

118
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He wasn't acting at all.

119
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And who is this old man?

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
He's my master.

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Your master?

122
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I've seen your master?

123
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yesterday when you killed Xing,

124
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
this photo was posted on the phone.

125
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Three years ago, you were at my master's door.

126
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
No way.

127
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I have no memory of that.

128
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I went on a trip that day.

129
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I have the photos of that day.

130
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'll find them for you.

131
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That's weird.

132
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Where are the photos of that trip?

133
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I remember I was afraid of the circle of friends.

134
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You found it?

135
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You don't need to look for it.

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Wu Ming,

137
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
you don't think

138
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I killed your master, do you?

139
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
How could I do such a thing?

140
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I don't want to hear your explanation.

141
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'll find out for myself.

142
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Wu Ming.

143
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Wu Ming.

144
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I finally caught you,

145
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Mr. Mysterious Man.

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You don't think I and Yiran

147
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
are really out of our minds, do you?

148
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
We deliberately acted in this play

149
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
to get you out.

150
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You want to catch Yiran threatening me

151
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
for those two secret medicines?

152
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So you're prepared.

153
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Give me the secret medicine.

154
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I won't let him go.

155
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'll make you all die.

156
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Do you think you can escape?

157
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
How can you do such thing?

158
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
bastard!

159
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You're not listening to me.

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Would you be prepared to die?

161
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Now where is that point of the circle of friends taken byOW�전?

162
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Hahaha,

163
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Pay attention!

164
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,880
I'm sorry.

165
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,960
Brother.

166
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,040
I was sleeping.

167
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,880
Ma San, stop pretending.

168
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,080
Who are you?

169
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,760
I...

170
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,160
No wonder you were not there

171
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,400
every time a stranger showed up.

172
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,680
It was you.

173
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,800
Brother, I was really sleeping on the bed.

174
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,080
I know.

175
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,120
Because you were controlled by someone.

176
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,760
Who?

177
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,200
Who controlled me?

178
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,800
Of course, it was our Su Mingzhu.

179
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,600
Mr. Su.

180
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,600
Sister.

181
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,200
Your puppet skills are really amazing.

182
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,880
Even an ordinary person like San'er

183
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,040
can become a master.

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,360
If I'm not wrong,

185
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,320
the bell on your hand...

186
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,080
What are you talking about?

187
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,000
I just attacked you with San'er

188
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,960
to force you to use your magic

189
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,480
and reveal your weakness.

190
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,360
We planned this big show

191
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,160
to get you out

192
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,720
and manipulate everyone behind it.

193
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,520
Although you installed a voice changer for San'er,

194
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,920
the first time I saw the mysterious person,

195
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,480
I heard his voice.

196
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,160
Every time the mysterious person was there,

197
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,800
you controlled him secretly.

198
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,840
San'er

199
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,600
is your puppet.

200
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,320
San'er.

201
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,000
This is what I say about Egg Man's Determination to Tre Yin Aut suscriber.

202
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:22,800
And I just checked my own

203
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,880
and Uncle Tao title.

204
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,000
Ahh.

205
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,080
Hello, Seng拳二.

206
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,080
Neither of you overworked.

207
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,120
So you hate me and Master.

208
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,320
Later, you went down the mountain to do business.

209
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,840
Master was very polite.

210
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
The condition was that you gave 30% of the wealth

211
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,760
to the successor.

212
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,360
You of course disagreed.

213
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,640
So three years ago,

214
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,440
you pretended to arrange someone to go to Shanwen to shoot a play.

215
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,600
In fact, you seduced Song Yi Ran

216
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,120
to kill Master.

217
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,680
Master Yi Ran, just stand here and don't move.

218
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,200
Yi Ran, stand here for a while.

219
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,400
Then you go around the master

220
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,760
and walk to this position.

221
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,000
Then take the sword and stab the master.

222
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,120
Then you hide.

223
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
Okay, that's it.

224
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,280
Okay?

225
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:03,880
Okay.

226
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,160
Okay, get ready to shoot.

227
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,200
Come on.

228
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,920
Get ready to shoot.

229
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,680
Start.

230
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,720
We are nameless

231
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,720
and fearless

232
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,440
I am me

233
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,280
I know there will be a fire

234
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:20,000
I will be stubborn

235
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,080
and only believe in legends

236
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,440
The whole universe

237
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,080
shines because of me
