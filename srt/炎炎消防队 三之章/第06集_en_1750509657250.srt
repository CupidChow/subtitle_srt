1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
There are numerous豊 Sects in the Ak swamp in this land.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,160
M bother, kill, poison.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,300
The reasons why most people in this land are so nervous are…

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,340
…the wins.

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Don't come near me, don't be afraid

6
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Don't give up

7
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I don't know who you are

8
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I believe in you, I keep hurting you

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I keep forgetting about you

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If you're born, you'll be able to overcome it

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Before the day of my heart, I threw myself into the ocean

12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
There was no way to betray me

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The last of my memories, if I can say it to the world

14
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
If I can say it to the world

15
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hey, I want to be strong, I want to be strong now

16
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Come to me, closer than the end

17
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The End

18
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That girl's concentration of prayer is amazing

19
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:29,040
Parent

20
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,200
The Wah gusta 10 found The know what love

21
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,520
Please settle this matter with the lord himself...

22
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,360
Your timing is my cue.

23
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,000
Rad coexistence!

24
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,620
Are you still counting on us, Leonardo Byrnes.

25
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,760
The world has introduced ya to some harsh schemes

26
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,960
by the somewhat overwhelming Already doubts that you

27
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,760
haven't believed in good news like this.

28
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,200
We both witnessed the manufacture of worldly hygrodes,

29
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,200
Why are you praying?

30
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,200
What for?

31
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
What for?

32
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,200
Did you break the remaining one?

33
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Wake up.

34
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,200
Is that how you do it again?

35
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,200
I don't need to speak my words.

36
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,200
I am a god.

37
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,200
I will continue praying for you.

38
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,200
Hey, Burns.

39
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Do you know what freedom is?

40
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,200
What do you mean by a shadow without freedom?

41
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,200
That's why I want to be free.

42
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,200
I don't care about how I think.

43
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,200
I have always believed in God.

44
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,200
I believe in God.

45
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,200
The shape of faith is not changing.

46
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,200
Even if there is no God there?

47
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,200
That's right.

48
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,200
Isn't it painful?

49
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,200
How do you live?

50
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,200
If there is no God there,

51
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:17,200
where is our prayer?

52
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,200
The head of the wife of Raphlus Ise.

53
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,200
The truth of the Holy Ghost I wrote here.

54
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,200
The interpretation of the Holy Ghost was a different existence.

55
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,200
But even if there is no God there,

56
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,200
people have been saved by a miracle called Amaterasu.

57
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:46,200
Then where is the God we believe in?

58
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,200
The time I saw it was a crisis.

59
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,200
A overwhelming world.

60
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,200
A overwhelming crisis.

61
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,200
That was the end of the people's destruction.

62
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,200
What is my prayer in the first place?

63
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,200
What did I pray for?

64
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,200
Friends? The salvation of the people?

65
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,200
What did I pray for?

66
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,200
What?

67
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,200
What did I pray for?

68
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,200
No, I didn't pray for anything.

69
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
I prayed for the end of the world.

70
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
That was my goal.

71
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,200
And I found the end of the prayer.

72
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,200
You gave up?

73
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,200
If I didn't pray for anything,

74
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,200
I would use the end of the prayer.

75
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,200
What a terrible evil.

76
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,200
You too, I understand.

77
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,200
I will never give up!

78
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,200
I told you!

79
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,200
Then try to surpass me!

80
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,200
Young man!

81
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,200
I will not give up!

82
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,200
I will not give up!

83
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,200
I will not give up!

84
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,200
I will not destroy the world!

85
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,200
It's too far!

86
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Don't come!

87
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,200
I have a will to defend!

88
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,200
If you have a will, you are a god!

89
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,200
You are a god!

90
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,200
You can't change anything at this rate!

91
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,200
It's not over yet!

92
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,200
The friendship between the evil and the father.

93
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,200
This battle will never end until the evil surpasses the father.

94
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
I will not give up!

95
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
How many of you have been defeated?

96
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,200
The energy's solidity.

97
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Will I be able to twist it with my power?

98
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
There is not enough speed!

99
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,200
The power of the energy of the movement is the speed that takes the output.

100
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,200
If you give up speed, you will not lose any opponent's power!

101
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,200
Faster!

102
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Your will!

103
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,200
Is that what you want?

104
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
I will not give up!

105
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,200
You are not a dark hero like me.

106
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
You are a hero!

107
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,200
You are a hero!

108
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,200
You are a hero!

109
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,200
I have no time to rest!

110
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
Faster!

111
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,200
You are just a hero like this battle!

112
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,200
If you don't know why, you are the only one who can win!

113
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:46,200
Or are you just a young man who can't win without a reason?

114
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,200
I will not give up!

115
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,200
Do you think I can see such a thing as a man?

116
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,200
Don't underestimate me!

117
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,200
I will give you my power!

118
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,200
The End

119
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,200
Episode 8

120
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,200
If that's the case, I will show you until I can be convinced!

121
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
I will become a hero!

122
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
I made a promise.

123
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,200
I will protect my mother and my family.

124
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,200
I will protect my family and my family.

125
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,200
For that, the world and the gods will be destroyed!

126
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
How was it?

127
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,200
President

128
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Something has been infected in my universe.

129
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
Adralink?

130
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
General!

131
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Who is this warm-hearted person?

132
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,200
Who are you who has been infected in my universe?

133
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
Ani?

134
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,200
When I was a child, I lost my family.

135
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,200
I lost everything that was important to me.

136
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,200
That's why I have no cheap and high life.

137
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Everyone has an important life.

138
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,200
I want to be a hero who saves everyone.

139
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
Even now, it will not change.

140
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:37,200
But there is a life that I want to protect.

141
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,200
Is it too much?

142
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,200
The death pressure is heavy.

143
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,200
The fire that was blue.

144
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,200
It is a fire that is stronger than ever before.

145
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,200
The heat of the Burnt Captain is increasing.

146
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
There is little chance.

147
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
There is little chance.

148
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,200
The Burnt Captain Nova!

149
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
Stage 4!

150
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
My...

151
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,200
Arittake!

152
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
I prayed.

153
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
I was.

154
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,200
I prayed.

155
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,200
Be a God's messenger.

156
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,200
Become the priest of the kingdom.

157
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,200
I will pay for evil!

158
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,200
Is that evil?

159
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,200
The feelings of your hero.

160
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Is that?

161
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
General!

162
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
God has a destruction.

163
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,200
I am God's messenger.

164
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,200
I will take that path.

165
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,200
If you want to stop the rebellion,

166
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,200
you have to fight against the truth.

167
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,200
Don't let anyone who is so stubborn to defeat you.

168
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
I will pay for it!

169
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,200
Why can't you stop my kick?

170
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,200
Even the Burnt Captain is a god!

171
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,200
The Burnt Captain Nova!

172
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
God!

173
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,200
You are so stubborn!

174
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,200
The electrician is the voice of this world.

175
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,200
I am God.

176
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,200
The world is going to be destroyed.

177
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
I will pay for it!

178
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,200
I will pay for it!

179
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Even if the world burns everything,

180
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,200
I will never stop it!

181
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,200
That is...

182
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,200
General and Captain.

183
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,200
Brother...

184
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,200
You don't have to worry.

185
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Wait there quietly.

186
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,200
I will save you.

187
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
Shindou...

188
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,200
From that state...

189
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,200
I am a family.

190
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,200
Then, blow everything away!

191
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,200
Kyaa!

192
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,200
Nobody can stop me who is so stubborn!

193
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,200
What kind of disaster will this world have?!

194
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
Goh...

195
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,200
Goh...

196
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,200
My sweat...

197
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,200
Kuketoba!

198
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,400
Team Bunta

199
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,260
Warming Time

200
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,200
I see.

201
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:51,160
So you were sweatingoshing.

202
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,740
Because of these heavy heh heh ignite!

203
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,820
What important thing do!

204
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,160
The world is big.

205
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,160
Shinra.

206
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,160
But you have hope, young man.

207
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,160
Did you acknowledge it?

208
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,160
I've been beaten up so far.

209
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,160
More than before.

210
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,160
You've become stronger.

211
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,160
Why don't you stop attacking?

212
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,160
Shinra.

213
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,160
You're the one who's going to be punished for this world.

214
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,160
You're going to be punished for everything as an old man.

215
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,160
You're really a tough man.

216
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,160
The electrician is the voice of this world.

217
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,160
If the world and the gods are going to attack you,

218
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,160
you can only trust an old man like me.

219
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:26,160
This eye that has been left in the past cannot be seen.

220
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,160
Let me see it.

221
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,160
And become stronger than the world.

222
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,160
It's coming.

223
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,160
Yeah.

224
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,160
A new pillar has been born.

225
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,160
Odorarink.

226
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,160
What?

227
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,160
He's a tough guy.

228
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,160
A doppelganger?

229
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,160
Play, play, call, dust.

230
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,160
Return to the original.

231
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,160
Dragoon?

232
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,160
I'll take it. Please fight back.

233
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,160
What are you doing to a human?

234
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,160
I'll wait.

235
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,160
What?

236
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,160
What's this?

237
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,160
I'm going to die.

238
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,160
A bad guy.

239
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,160
I'll take it.

240
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,160
Are you out of your mind?

241
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,160
He's alive.

242
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,160
Maki, are you hurt?

243
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,160
That's amazing, Maki. You're trying to save him?

244
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,160
I thought it was impossible.

245
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,160
That's Kango?

246
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,160
You saved him.

247
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,160
Maki, you're the best.

248
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,160
Captain Banzai, now!

249
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,160
Don't come.

250
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,160
I told you I wouldn't come.

251
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,160
Kangyame.

252
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,160
Captain Banzai!

253
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,160
Shinra, I'll remember what you came here for.

254
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,160
But...

255
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,160
I don't know how long you'll last.

256
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,160
Run, Shinra.

257
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,160
Five-Two, please.

258
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,160
Go!

259
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,160
Shinra!

260
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,160
Don't look back. Let's go.

261
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,160
I'll be back.

262
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,160
Pray.

263
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,160
I didn't want anything.

264
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,160
It's my prayer.

265
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,160
Please, at last.

266
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,160
I'm sorry.

267
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,160
You're so good.

268
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,160
You've worked hard so far, Eighth Master.

269
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,160
I see.

270
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,160
Leave it to you.

271
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,160
Yes.

272
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,160
It's no use.

273
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,160
Kill everyone else.

274
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,160
I'll be back!

275
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,160
Save Captain Omi and get him out of here!

276
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,160
Eighth Master is done.

277
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,160
You're so stubborn.

278
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,160
You're still alive?

279
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,160
It's a great name.

280
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,160
What do you mean by stubborn?

281
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,160
What's going on?

282
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,160
The season...

283
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,160
Wait a minute, you guys.

284
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,160
Oh, no.

285
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,160
Just a moment.

286
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,160
I'm Moonlight Kamen.

287
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,160
The battle between the two is my...

288
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,160
Love.

289
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,160
