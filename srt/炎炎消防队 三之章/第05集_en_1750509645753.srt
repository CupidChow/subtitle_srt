1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The End

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
There are many scenes in the human world.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Cold, suicide, and sickness.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The scene that is most terrifying to many people in this world is...

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The death.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The End

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Thank goodness, Arthur came back.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Tamaki, you were well alone.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I thought I'd be able to see you with a pressure.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The End

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Captain!

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Look over there.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
No way...

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I can't believe Captain...

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What?

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
No way...

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
No way!

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
My muscles are too stiff, and my legs can't get in.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
If you failed to put it in the cage, my muscles will be finished!

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Look, Captain!

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What are you doing in such a place?

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Moston Masquilla...

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It seems like it's a emergency.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Everyone, cheer for Captain Obi-Dai!

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Captain Obi-Dai, you're dead!

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Come on, cheer for him as usual!

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's okay, it's okay! Nice cut! It's over!

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The beginning is amazing!

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's huge! It's a good result!

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Are you putting a matchbox on your shoulder?

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The big money is walking!

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You must have had a night of sleep!

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm sorry, Captain!

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's a problem!

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's a big problem! Captain is serious!

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Jista, let's cheer for him!

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Captain!

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Shenzhen Rui!

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Please give him some clothes for his muscles.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Rato...

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Get him!

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What a fool!

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
From the bottom of the cage?

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But if your muscles are free, it's over.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
There's no time.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Captain Burnt...

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'll shoot you down!

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Nice work!

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The answer is different!

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The answer is different!

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Correct! Cut it!

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Cut it!

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Cut it!

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Cut it!

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The End

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Hey, I want to be strong

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I want to be strong now

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Come to me when the beginning is over

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The End

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It seems like they're holding on to us.

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Hurry, we're going there too!

62
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Rato, you're alone.

63
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I can't remember.

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Don't be shy.

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Don't be shy.

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I can't remember.

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
There's nothing to be ashamed of in front of me.

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll drink the sea water after me.

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Captain, please go back.

70
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's different from the previous one.

71
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm the Dragon.

72
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
If you want to run, run.

73
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I just want to breathe.

74
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What? The Dragon?

75
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You were here.

76
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Dragon!

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'll defeat you, Wappa.

78
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Arthur's Excalibur!

79
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's the first time I've ever made this base a Dragon for you.

80
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You've been under my pressure.

81
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The one who can stand in front of a Dragon is the one with the determination.

82
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You guys go back.

83
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
If you're going to be that far...

84
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The video has been cut off!

85
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What's the current attack?

86
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Oh...

87
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
This Dragonic Pressure...

88
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's not a Dragon.

89
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's this one.

90
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Excalibur!

91
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'll defeat him and give you the symbol!

92
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The symbol of the Dragon Slayer!

93
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What's going on?

94
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The power of the Dragon is 1,000!

95
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Dragon's Death!

96
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Dragon's Death!

97
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I heard that this is the 8th one.

98
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But...

99
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Unfortunately, the Dragon didn't listen.

100
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Dragon's Death!

101
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Oh, you're pretty good.

102
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You're a human.

103
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Human?

104
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You don't seem to be human.

105
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm a Dragon.

106
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You're a coward.

107
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm a knight too!

108
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
This is so cruel.

109
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You're a knight.

110
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
My Excalibur is a critical shot!

111
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I don't have a chance to escape.

112
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I want to say this, but if the opponent is a Dragon, I won't say that!

113
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I won't say that!

114
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Dragon!

115
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Keep shaking this Excalibur until you fall!

116
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I've decided to go with this knight seriously!

117
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What?

118
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's only the Dragonic Pressure.

119
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
This is the real thing.

120
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Dragonic Pressure!

121
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll just take this one attack.

122
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
If you're a human, you're dead.

123
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
If you're a human, you're dead.

124
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
If you're a human, you're dead.

125
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
If you're a human, you're dead.

126
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm aiming at the enemy.

127
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm good at fighting against the city.

128
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But I'm a Dragon.

129
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Dragon!

130
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Oh, I'm getting more powerful.

131
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Dragon!

132
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The enemy looks so big and strong.

133
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Is Arthur all right?

134
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Arthur's ability to fire is beyond imagination.

135
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The image is so strong that it's hard to find an ideal opponent.

136
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
There's no one who can stop Arthur right now.

137
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
The way he uses fire and its power is also in the lives of the killer.

138
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Hmph, my sword...

139
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'll use my sword!

140
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You're the best opponent for Arthur.

141
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The enemy's luck was bad.

142
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Hmph.

143
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Captain, don't look at me.

144
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
If you were to use your sword to support Arthur...

145
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I've already shot a few times.

146
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
No matter where you support him, you'll get a fatal blow.

147
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
But he's not in any damage.

148
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm sure Arthur's attack is...

149
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Isn't that strange?

150
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Even though Arthur is attacking him on the one hand...

151
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Arthur's sword is hurt!

152
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You're still a dirty person.

153
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You're still a dragon.

154
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You're a great dragon.

155
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
A great dragon.

156
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You're not a great dragon.

157
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'll defeat you.

158
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Hmph.

159
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'll become a dragon slayer!

160
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You're just getting closer to the attack!

161
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You're so dirty.

162
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You'll get hurt by your scales.

163
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Dragon Scale!

164
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What? Where did he go?

165
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You're so scary, Dragon Scale!

166
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I can't see it clearly from a distance, but that's just like the body of a homerabbit.

167
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Hmph.

168
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I did my best to be a human.

169
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Arthur, are you okay?

170
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Be strong!

171
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
What's with that arm?

172
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's like a homerabbit.

173
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's black and white.

174
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I was saying that I'd strengthen my ability to defeat it.

175
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But I can't get the Adora yet.

176
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Hmph.

177
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
That's all I can do with my sword.

178
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Hmph.

179
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
He's making my body look like a homerabbit!

180
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You're so stupid!

181
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You can't do that!

182
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Hey, Yen!

183
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You were here.

184
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
What's wrong, Karim?

185
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I was looking for the record of the gold record of the lekkers.

186
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I was looking for the record of the lekkers and the foreign currency during the crime.

187
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I found it in a strange place.

188
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What the hell happened?

189
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
The lekkers were assigned to the criminal.

190
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The secret of the lekkers was the location of the research facility of the Doppelganger,

191
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
where the chief of the Daigo-Hibana and the eighth sister were.

192
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
What?

193
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
That means...

194
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yeah.

195
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
The lekkers had something to do with the Doppelganger.

196
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The Doppelganger...

197
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
In the story of the lekkers, it was from the devil who came from the sky like a mirror.

198
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
The devil tried to kill the main body and change it.

199
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Is there a secret relationship between the Doppelganger and the Doppelganger?

200
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
If the Doppelganger's identity is revealed,

201
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
the Doppelganger's identity may be dissolved!

202
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The Doppelganger...

203
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
That dragon is a man.

204
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
He's more special than I expected.

205
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
So he's not an ordinary human being.

206
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But if that's the case, the image of Naosara Arthur will be deepened and his power will be stronger.

207
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm begging you, Arthur!

208
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's okay! I've never seen such a serious Arthur!

209
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Stay away from me, Valkyrie!

210
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Yeah.

211
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Be careful.

212
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Do your best!

213
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
He's the dragon you were looking for!

214
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
He finally used it.

215
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
X-Tream Dragonic Pressure.

216
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The Dragon Code that shows the inner dragon and outer dragon.

217
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's the first time I've seen him.

218
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
He's been living a great Dragonic experience.

219
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You're a human being.

220
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Protect the Knight, Clasmanto!

221
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I was just in the position I was in!

222
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Arthur!

223
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
What the...

224
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
That's Clasmanto?

225
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
The Dragon Code's identity!

226
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
His power has increased even more.

227
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Amazing!

228
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
If this sword and mantle hadn't been found in the past,

229
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
it would have been a waste of time.

230
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
What happened to the past, father?

231
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
The heat of the past is dying.

232
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Do your best, Arthur!

233
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You're the Knight!

234
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Do your best, Knight!

235
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
One-shot to strike the dragon!

236
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
X-Treamer!

237
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
No!

238
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
X-Treamer...

239
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
The Dragon King didn't go.

240
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Arthur!

241
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Be strong!

242
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
There's nothing to be ashamed of before me.

243
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'll show you the true power!

244
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I don't know how much the Captain's muscles are.

245
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
There's no time.

246
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Four cards.

247
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Four cards.

248
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Four cards from these four cards.

249
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

250
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

251
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'll take all your attacks.

252
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
That's my responsibility.

253
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You're a man who's as helpless as you can be.

254
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You're living in darkness.

255
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Did you change this country by taking your freedom?

256
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's not a dark hero who lives in darkness like me who can change.

257
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Hero...

258
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Come! I'll take any of them!

259
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
The Dragon King

260
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
The weak are the ones who are strong.

261
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
If you say you'll destroy that order,

262
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'll show you the power of the young!

263
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
The Dragon King

264
00:20:50,000 --> 00:21:09,000
The Dragon King

265
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
If you don't want anything from me...

266
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I promised.

267
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
For that, the world and the gods will be destroyed!

268
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Next time on the end of prayer.

269
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Live on the flame of eternity.

270
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
