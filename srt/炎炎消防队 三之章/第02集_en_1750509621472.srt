1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The End

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
There are many scenes in the human world.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Old age, suicide, and sickness.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The scene that is most terrifying in this world is...

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The End

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's a death.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This is...

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Adora...

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Adora Link?

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Why is Captain Vance...

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
To the life that has been given to the sun,

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
give us the joy that will return to that fire.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Joy that will return to the fire?

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What is it?

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
To the day of the Akital,

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
we will plant the seed.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Captain Chuu, I will give you the instructions after this.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The high school army will be coming soon.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
First, we will leave here and look for the battlefield.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
If that's the case, there is a place to sell it.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Please guide me.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I will collect information after arriving.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
There is not much time.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What's wrong, Shinra?

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I saw Vance in Adora Link.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I will go to the battlefield.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I will go to the battlefield.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I will go to the battlefield.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I will go to the battlefield.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I will go to the battlefield.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I will go to the battlefield.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I will go to the battlefield.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I will go to the battlefield.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I will go to the battlefield.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I will go to the battlefield.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I will go to the battlefield.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I will go to the battlefield.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I will go to the battlefield.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I will go to the battlefield.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I will go to the battlefield.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I will go to the battlefield.

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
If I'm caught, I will cross the river.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Ah, before the day of the heart,

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Before the song of the heart,

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
There was no crab that could beat me.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Ah, the beginning of the memory,

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
If I'm caught in the world I saw,

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I want to be strong, I want to be strong now.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Come to me, who is starting from the end.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I will go to the battlefield.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I will go to the battlefield.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
There are still many things I can use.

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The thing to be careful about is uniform and beauty.

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It looks good in a matchbox.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I will go to the battlefield.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
After that, how is your life after quitting the army?

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
There is no change in particular.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
By the way, I've never heard of the story of Hinawa.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Do you have a family?

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
My father raised me with a man,

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But last year, I was a second-in-law.

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I see, in the middle of the world.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Is it a girlfriend?

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I don't have such a prejudice.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He doesn't have a girlfriend either.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's such a job.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't know when I will die,

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But I don't feel like making such a person.

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Don't say such sad things.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Are you really glad you came to the eighth grade?

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I didn't think it was such a painful stage.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Even if I quit now.

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
No, it's not good.

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The eighth grade is an outsider who is investigating the dead body.

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Of course, the blood will be shed.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Then, it is aimed at a person like me.

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
In some cases, it may be a traitor for this country.

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
That's why you can't kill yourself.

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You need a strong body that can be treated with a lot of care.

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of body this eighth grade will be.

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You are the king, and you will become the father of the body.

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's a pressure.

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That's right.

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm not strange even if I'm a child.

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I will stop you, Chief Oobi.

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I hope you can make this eighth grade a great family.

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
This is my castle.

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I will save humanity from here.

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Chief Oobi.

91
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Chief Oobi.

92
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I heard that you can come anytime, since the preparation for the matchbox is complete.

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yes.

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You may not be able to return for a while.

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I will definitely rescue Chief Oobi.

96
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yes.

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Chief Oobi.

98
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
How are you?

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Are you quiet?

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm quiet, but...

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I've been in there for a long time.

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Excuse me, can I have some water?

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's a disaster.

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's not a disaster.

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Water is only available to the stage.

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It will die in the water.

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Are you training on your own?

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's a self-proclaimed suicide.

109
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We have to get out of here quickly.

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We can't do it, so we have to be careful and be strong.

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What's going on outside?

112
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Eighth grade,

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm counting on you, Hina.

114
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
News.

115
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The adorabast, who is the winner of the match,

116
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
has been arrested as a member of the Eighth Special Defense Force,

117
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
as a member of the Eighth Special Defense Force,

118
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
and is the head of the Eighth Special Defense Force,

119
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Chief Oobi Akital.

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's scary to see that he's even paying for his own life.

121
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's scary to see that he's the head of the Eighth Special Defense Force.

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I didn't expect that the Eighth Special Defense Force would work like this.

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I didn't expect that.

124
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Something strange has happened.

125
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The Eighth Special Defense Force is here.

126
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The Eighth Special Defense Force is here.

127
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The truth is revealed.

128
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
A fire has been heard at the training ground.

129
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Princess, I'm sorry.

130
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Let the senior officer, the Jari, come in.

131
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The Eighth Special Defense Force has disappeared,

132
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and it's a big trouble to get to that point.

133
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The Eighth Special Defense Force is a very disturbing thing.

134
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It seems that the one who came to the war has disappeared,

135
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
but it seems that he's not happy.

136
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's right.

137
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Because the Jari Ketchiras has been reduced.

138
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm worried about Princess.

139
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You've been helping the Eighth Special Defense Force until now, right?

140
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Now or later, the Eighth Special Defense Force is a traitor who lives in the empire.

141
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
This is no different from before.

142
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Please stop making a mistake.

143
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Benny, there's a new fish in here.

144
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
How about a lot of coins tonight?

145
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Benny?

146
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What's with Benny's thing?

147
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Did he get it in the original box?

148
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The Eighth Special Defense Force is here.

149
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yes, I know.

150
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
As you were worried,

151
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
the country has become one in a bad way.

152
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
What about the contact from the Eighth Special Defense Force?

153
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I don't think it's going to cause any trouble.

154
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's a mess that the country has become a mess.

155
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The Eighth Special Defense Force is here.

156
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm going to report it.

157
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
The Eighth Special Defense Force is not seen.

158
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What?

159
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Gather the target information.

160
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Break the defense barrier.

161
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Their legs are Mach-Vox.

162
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's clear.

163
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Search anything you can.

164
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Roger.

165
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The Mach-Vox is hidden.

166
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The operation is hard.

167
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's a matter of time before we find it.

168
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What's wrong?

169
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Did you find out about it?

170
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You're regretting it.

171
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I felt strongly and followed you.

172
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Your face is scary.

173
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The Eighth Special Defense Force is a professional fighter.

174
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The Eighth Special Defense Force is a professional fighter.

175
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm sure you know about the unarmed fighter's escape.

176
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What are you talking about?

177
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You're a big-time businessman, aren't you?

178
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You asked the Chief of the Big-time Company before.

179
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm not sure which one of the Eighth Special Defense Forces is the one.

180
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I couldn't answer that question.

181
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But it's not a big deal.

182
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Actually, we were outlawing with someone.

183
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
We're all senior fighters.

184
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm sorry.

185
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You're kidding me?

186
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm finally here, demon.

187
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
If the Eighth Special Defense Force is the hero who fights with the mystery of the human body,

188
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
we'll fight with shadows.

189
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You're a weak hero.

190
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I don't want to catch you.

191
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'll teach you how to lose your bad temper.

192
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Wait! Can you trust me?

193
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I know what you're like!

194
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I don't have time for this.

195
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
If you want to catch me, just do it.

196
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You look pretty rough.

197
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm not good at fighting with shadows.

198
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'll just go to bed and get some sleep.

199
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Where are you taking us?

200
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
The Eighth Special Defense Force is about to arrive here.

201
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You're also rebels now.

202
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
We were both lonely and lonely.

203
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'll teach you how to walk in the darkness.

204
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Choose one.

205
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The round of light or the round of darkness.

206
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Which one do you choose?

207
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
There's no choice.

208
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
There's no choice.

209
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I can't use the water anymore.

210
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I don't know.

211
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm glad you're living in a place like this.

212
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
The secret base is also closed and it's not smelly.

213
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm not dead at all.

214
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
This place is forgotten without any map.

215
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Is there a Cerberus?

216
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
No.

217
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I see.

218
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
There is, but there are people who have lost their places in the ground besides us.

219
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Please come in.

220
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
My castle.

221
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
There are a lot of bad memories.

222
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
What is this?

223
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You can understand that it's a warning, but please believe it.

224
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I trust you, Joker and I, the 8th generation.

225
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
So what do we do now?

226
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Captain Ooby!

227
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Hurry up!

228
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Hurry up!

229
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Help!

230
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Hurry up!

231
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Calm down.

232
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
How do we get out of here?

233
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
There's no time for the vision we saw.

234
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
But first, we need to find the location of Captain Ooby.

235
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Captain Ooby's location, but Joker is already there.

236
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
The location is closed.

237
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The Tokyo High School's tonight night market is closed.

238
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's over there.

239
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
God, the Sun God.

240
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I found the existence that I couldn't believe in at that time and place.

241
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I thought you would be smart if you didn't believe it, but you were able to accept us.

242
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I was a priest and a priest, and I used my memory as a Saint-Yokyo.

243
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But at that time, I was born into the Saint-Yokyo in me, Adora Link.

244
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I felt God in the existence of a electrician.

245
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The Saint-Yokyo of the electrician is the true Saint-Yokyo.

246
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,180
I'm not a

247
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm not a Saint-Yokyo.

248
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I saw God who should have believed in the true Saint-Yokyo.

249
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I can read your mind.

250
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You don't seem to believe in that word.

251
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Then, can you make a move for the electrician?

252
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's the duty of the priest to make a move.

253
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Humanity is also one of the trials that human beings have been given to be in the sun.

254
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Human beings can become the sun beyond trials and change into flames.

255
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And there is a chance that that man will be pleased with it.

256
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Akital Obi.

257
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm counting on you.

258
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
We will follow you right away.

259
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Yes.

260
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Then, as the plan said, I'll go to the air first.

261
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'll put the bug in the captain.

262
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
We're going too.

263
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Roger that.

264
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,500
I'm sure he's not this guy.

265
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,000
What do you mean, Shiro Shouzoku?

266
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,000
Money doesn't move.

267
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,000
It's a spiritual and physical meaning.

268
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Money can shake people.

269
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,500
But I don't shake people with money.

270
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,000
Why?

271
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
To give you hope, Chachin.

272
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'll call you.

273
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,500
I'm a fool.

274
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,000
You know your name?

275
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,500
Get out of here!

276
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,000
I can't get my money back.

277
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,500
Because I'm gold.

278
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,500
I'll give you money.

279
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,000
I'll give you money.

280
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
But I'm a fool.

281
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Thanks to Vulcan, I've been able to equip myself.

282
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'm a machine gunner. Of course.

283
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,000
I can equip myself with one sword in the morning.

284
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You're a knight.

285
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,000
Is there something wrong?

286
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Enemy.

287
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Dragon's child.

288
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'll let you see it.

289
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Don't scare me.

290
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,500
Dragon Slayer is a knight.

291
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,500
Where are you?

292
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm here for you.

293
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,500
Aso!

294
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,000
I don't know if you're leaving me again.

295
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,500
Are you going to the sky with the gun? It's taking time.

296
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,500
If you go a little further, there's a foot that uses me and Joker.

297
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,500
If you use the Nether Soldier, you'll be in trouble.

298
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:56,000
I thought it was a new skill, but it was through the Nether.

299
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,500
Can Joker be trusted?

300
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,500
Can't you still trust me?

301
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,500
If you trust me, trust him too.

302
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,500
He's the Dark Hero of Tokyo.

303
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,500
I didn't know you'd be able to join me.

304
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,500
That's why I've been involved in the New World Cup.

305
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,500
I was always like this.

306
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,500
I was too late.

307
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
I haven't trusted you yet.

308
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,500
That's fine.

309
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,500
Humans and countries are fine.

310
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,500
I'm not sure if I can trust you.

311
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:41,500
Then why do you cooperate with the first?

312
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,500
That's a simple reason.

313
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,500
I'll tell you about the people who live in the shadows.

314
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,500
I can't lose you here.

315
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,500
The Great Ghost is a person who needs this country.

316
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,500
I've been in the dark for a long time.

317
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,500
I've been looking at the dark for a long time.

318
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,500
I can understand it naturally.

319
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,500
The light of truth.

320
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,500
The Great Ghost is...

321
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,500
Even if it's a Western Kyorye, it's not a Sun.

322
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:25,500
And the light I found isn't just a Ghost.

323
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,500
You're also a new Raksa.

324
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,500
There are strong enemies in the Great Ghost.

325
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:37,500
They're the people who killed Leonard Burns and Arge.

326
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,500
There are people who are the people of the forest on the bridge.

327
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,500
I'll protect them.

328
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,500
Don't worry.

329
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,500
I've become stronger in Asakusa.

330
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,500
I can also hit strong enemies like you and Burns.

331
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,500
You can do that with your breath.

332
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,500
I can do that with my breath.

333
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,500
That's impossible.

334
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,500
There.

335
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,500
I'll be a good man.

336
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,500
I can't say anything!

337
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
This attack...

338
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,500
It's fun.

339
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,500
It's like a strongman.

340
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,500
They're here.

341
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,500
I'll start the Hero Gokko.

342
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
It's not Gokko.

343
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,500
It's the Hero of the Gachi.

344
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500
It's not Gokko.

345
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,500
It's the Hero of the Gachi.

346
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,500
It's the Hero of the Gachi.

347
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,500
It's the Hero of the Gachi.

348
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,500
It's the Hero of the Gachi.

349
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,500
It's the Hero of the Gachi.

350
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,500
It's the Hero of the Gachi.

351
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,500
It's the Hero of the Gachi.

352
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,500
It's the Hero of the Gachi.

353
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,500
It's the Hero of the Gachi.

354
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,500
It's the Hero of the Gachi.

355
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,500
It's the Hero of the Gachi.

356
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,500
It's the Hero of the Gachi.

357
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,500
It's the Hero of the Gachi.

358
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,500
It's the Hero of the Gachi.

359
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,500
It's the Hero of the Gachi.

360
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,500
