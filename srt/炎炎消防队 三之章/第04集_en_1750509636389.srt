1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'll take care of it!

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'll take care of it!

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll take care of it!

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'll take care of it!

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'll take care of it!

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'll take care of it!

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'll take care of it!

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'll take care of it!

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'll take care of it!

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'll take care of it!

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'll take care of it!

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'll take care of it!

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll take care of it!

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'll take care of it!

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,120
Let's go!

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,000
lt's ahow nanny souls or an octopus!

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Hey don't throw up

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Don't get used to it

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Come to me when you're done

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Don't be afraid

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Don't give up

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I don't know who you are

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I believe in you

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I keep on hurting you

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'll keep on running away

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
If I'm born to be forgotten, I'll cross over

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Before the day of my heart

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Before the day of my heart

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
There was no place to be betrayed

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Before the day of my heart

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If I'm a place to be betrayed

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
If I'm a place to be betrayed

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Hey, I want to be strong

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I want to be strong now

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Come to me when you're done

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The End

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Alone?

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You're so mean!

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Wait, Maki. It's the guy you asked for.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I only made this much in time.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Oh, two?

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
No, thank you. I can't do it without you.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'll come!

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
There's not enough food for a single person.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'll have to pay for the food.

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'll have to pay for the food.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
There's something good there.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Oh, it's a shield!

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Fire!

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Oh, it's a shield!

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's a shield!

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What's the opponent's ability?

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He controls the metal.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
His ability?

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The characteristic of that metal shield.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
No, but if that's the case, this is the possibility.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
No, if that's the case...

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Are you okay with the beatings?

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Mr. Rift will give us something.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
When the wind blows, when the earth is hot,

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Mr. Rift will help us.

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What's the relationship between the two?

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
No, no, it's not about the appearance.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Mr. Rift is a person who has to be in the eighth place.

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Power.

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The ability of fire.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
There's no power in the metal shield.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And the ability of the person who has no power is the ability of fire and heat.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The ability of fire and heat.

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Again?

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The ability of fire and heat.

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Mr. Rift, please stop the attack on the iron wall!

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Mr. Rift, please stop the attack!

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What?

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
That's always the case.

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I don't want to talk about anything like I've done to you.

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm thinking about the right thing to do after the accident.

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I don't care!

79
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Mr. Rift, please stop the attack!

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The iron wall is also stopped!

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Mr. Rift, what's going on?

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's metal.

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's made of metal and heat.

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
First of all, metal is not affected by the power.

85
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It doesn't stick to the magnet.

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Then, isn't he using the power?

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
No, the problem here is the heat.

88
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
When metal is heated, it has a power to hold it.

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The ability of gold.

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The heat energy created by the third generation power is transferred to the metal shield and changed to the magnet.

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It controls the metal.

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
That's not possible! The iron wall is...

93
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The bullet and iron wall are iron.

94
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It affects the magnet.

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
My assassination is the power of weapons.

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I don't need money.

97
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Bye!

98
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
No! No, Captain!

99
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
If you let go, the enemy's hand number will increase!

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I can't throw it away!

101
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'll come again!

102
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's a pretty good move.

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
If you don't leave it like this,

104
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'll make the Vulcan a booster!

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What?

106
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What about the Vulcan?

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The power of the third generation aluminum powder that was made from the powder of aluminum.

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
If you light it up, the magnet will be turned into the power of the shock wave.

109
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The power of the second generation aluminum powder.

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The power of the third generation aluminum powder.

111
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Isn't Asakusa's work successful?

112
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I think the skills and speed have increased.

113
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
But compared to the true and the weak,

114
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm fundamentally weaker in power.

115
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Well, comparing with them...

116
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I think the enemy will be more powerful from now on.

117
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So I want to do something that can be useful to everyone.

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Please.

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I understand.

120
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
If that's the case, leave it to me.

121
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'll make you something good!

122
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh, it's pretty powerful.

123
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
All right, go!

124
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'll take the cat's poison!

125
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Take it!

126
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yeah.

127
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What?

128
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You do this?

129
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I cannot support the visual effect of the wave,

130
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
but it prevents these people from joining forces.

131
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:18,420
!!!

132
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,140
Is that how much money you get?

133
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,940
It seems like you don't know anything about Netherglish.

134
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,860
You idiot!

135
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:04,380
I've lost my body, but I can't help but ask you to stop asking me about Tamaki's special day.

136
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,300
I can't use this weapon unless I do something about that.

137
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,660
You're in trouble.

138
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,660
What are you doing dressed like Teddy Bear?

139
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,860
Stop laughing! Lisa, open the bell!

140
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,780
Have you forgotten my ability?

141
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,900
Issa Ribby!

142
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,500
My fire is a life form.

143
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,380
I can see through your opponent's abilities a little.

144
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,620
Lisa?

145
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,900
Are you okay with fighting?

146
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,380
I'm the Fielder of the original Kaien Knight Group.

147
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,100
I can't let you do anything like this.

148
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:54,340
Even though you're my enemy, you've always welcomed me, Captain Obi-Wan.

149
00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:00,140
I may not be able to control my emotions, but I want to save Captain Obi-Wan!

150
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,540
I'll have to take the time to win, Valkyrie.

151
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,660
Leave it to me!

152
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,020
Lisa, you already know what you're talking about, right?

153
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,340
Of course.

154
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,700
I can see I'm the firstしwas'der.

155
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,300
The enemy's Gauntlet is a third-generation skilled!

156
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,020
After all, this is ridiculous.

157
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:39,260
regardless of how it upon the opponent, they've only been the most effective and most effective deployed team.

158
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,980
The leader of the finaoning of them all is the beast.

159
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,100
It's a good chance to destination the opponent...

160
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,340
But it's a bait against your enemy, too.

161
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:51,120
So, that's why you need to handle the enemy's 5000 power potential.

162
00:11:51,560 --> 00:12:02,280
For instance, a pro

163
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,280
It's a metal.

164
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,280
The gold's gold will be used as a metal.

165
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,280
The opponent controls the metal?

166
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,280
It's impossible.

167
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,280
It's impossible, normally.

168
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,280
So this is a way only the special defense team can do.

169
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,280
How long has Gold been playing?

170
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,280
Isn't it Time Is Manage?

171
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,280
Hurry up and dig it up.

172
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,280
I'll give them a little more time.

173
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,280
Isn't it time to play again?

174
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,280
Hurry up and dig it up.

175
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,280
They don't have any more hands.

176
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
It's over.

177
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,280
Isn't it time to play again?

178
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,280
Shut up.

179
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,280
Issa-Libby!

180
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,280
What?

181
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,280
I'm sorry for the operation.

182
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,280
It's okay, Lisa.

183
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,280
My power is over.

184
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,280
If the opponent is used, it's over.

185
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,280
Lisa, hurry up.

186
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
Right.

187
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,280
Riki, what's the only way to do that special defense?

188
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,280
It's okay. Listen carefully.

189
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,280
I see. That's the way to do it.

190
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,280
First, Tamaki.

191
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,280
Prepare for fire.

192
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,280
I didn't know that well, but what should I do?

193
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,280
Riki, it's ready.

194
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,280
So what are you going to do?

195
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,280
Lisa.

196
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,280
Leave it to me.

197
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,280
Hey!

198
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,280
Start cooking.

199
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,280
Tamaki, make a pot on the tail.

200
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,280
Don't break it.

201
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,280
Wait a minute.

202
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,280
First, let me understand this iron.

203
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,280
Iron!

204
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,280
Iron!

205
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,280
Wait a minute! My fire is not as hot as the iron melts!

206
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,280
To melt the iron, you need to heat it at about 2800 degrees.

207
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,280
Can you do it, Balkan?

208
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,280
Leave it to me.

209
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,280
First, use the thermite.

210
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,280
Okay, Makita.

211
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,280
Okay.

212
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,280
What are you going to do with my iron?

213
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,280
There's not enough heat yet.

214
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,280
What is this?

215
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,280
What are you talking about?

216
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,280
This is a high-node oxygen for the rescue.

217
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,280
I'll use this to heat it up to 2800 degrees.

218
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,280
Okay.

219
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,280
Are you in the way of using your own strength?

220
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,280
But I'm used to it.

221
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,280
Bal, not yet!

222
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,280
What are you doing?

223
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,280
Lisa, you've been doing it well.

224
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,280
Tamaki, go!

225
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,280
What is that?

226
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,280
Is that iron?

227
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,280
If it's iron, I'll use my strength to steal it.

228
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:16,280
Unfortunately, the iron that exceeded 770 degrees has changed its quality.

229
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,280
It won't affect the time.

230
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
Is that it?

231
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,280
I'm so lost!

232
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,280
I can't use my strength now!

233
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,280
If I can stop it, I'll stop it and run away!

234
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,280
I'll use my strength!

235
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,280
I'm in trouble.

236
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,280
What?

237
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,280
I'm in trouble.

238
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,280
You did it!

239
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,280
Gold...

240
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,280
You're in trouble.

241
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,280
You really said you were in trouble.

242
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,280
I'll do it next time.

243
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,280
Do as you please.

244
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,280
You're not on the line anymore.

245
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,280
Of course.

246
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,280
I'm not a man anymore.

247
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,280
Did you see that?

248
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,280
It's the team work of the Eighth Generation!

249
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,280
We can fight with three of them, but we're still being scolded!

250
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,280
We only know how to fight alone.

251
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,280
Next, this stream will be our opponent.

252
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,280
Don't give up!

253
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,280
What's next?

254
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,280
Lisa!

255
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,280
The video is clear.

256
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,280
Let's start the analysis of the enemy's ability.

257
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,280
Targi, be careful!

258
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,280
I'll take care of the flames!

259
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,280
Tamaki!

260
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,280
Are they other than flames and heat?

261
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,280
Considering Tamaki's wound,

262
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,280
the enemy uses the dragon that occurs in flames

263
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,280
to create the Tatsumaki and Kamai.

264
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,280
What's that?

265
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,280
It's a key!

266
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,280
Chris Taito!

267
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,280
A key?

268
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,280
Where are you aiming for?

269
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,280
Hurry up!

270
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,280
The analysis won't be successful!

271
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,280
First, I'll use one of them.

272
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,280
Isn't it strong?

273
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
I can't do this!

274
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,280
Die!

275
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
You're in the Eighth Generation.

276
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,280
Are you still alone?

277
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,280
My name is Kishi.

278
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,280
Arthur Boyle.

279
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,280
I don't have a name for you.

280
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,280
I see, Arthur Boyle.

281
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,280
Then, take my four beauties and die!

282
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,280
Four goddesses!

283
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
What?

284
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,280
The early stream is coming up.

285
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,280
Arthur, where are you going?

286
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,280
I'm still in the Eighth Generation!

287
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,280
Why didn't you come?

288
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,280
Sorry, it was late.

289
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,280
You were too late.

290
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,280
I lost it!

291
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,280
I'm doomed!

292
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,280
I have been praying for the sake of the world.

293
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,280
I do not wish for anything.

294
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,280
The truth of the truth of the human body.

295
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,780
Shou, mother.

296
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,780
What have you been looking for so far?

297
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,780
Your wish is nothing.

298
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,280
And from now on, nothing can be done.

299
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,280
I vowed to become a hero.

300
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,280
I will save everything!

301
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,780
I will save everything!

302
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,780
Put your gun in the closet!

303
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,780
Your wish is...

304
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,780
Stop it!

305
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,780
Nothing can be done.

306
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,780
Stop it!

307
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:51,780

Do not be deceived

312

Please retreat
