1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You can change the world and the world.

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Can you trust Joker?

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
If you trust me, trust him too.

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
He is the Dark Hero of Tokyo.

5
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And the light I found is not just a gift.

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You too, Shinraksakabe.

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'll give you money and stuff.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But you're a thief.

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm asking you to be careful.

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I can't say anything!

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Captain Obidai...

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I believe in you.

13
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm searching for you.

14
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm going to cross the river.

15
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
If you're afraid, just keep going.

16
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Before my heart,

17
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Before my heart,

18
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
There was no one to beat me.

19
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm a machine of memories.

20
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If you're afraid, just keep going.

21
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Hey, I want to be strong.

22
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I want to be strong now.

23
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Come to me from the beginning.

24
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Captain Obidai, where are you?

25
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Akital Obi.

26
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He's a gift from the Sun God,

27
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and I'll return to fire.

28
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Why?

29
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Captain Banzu, why are you here?

30
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I've been living as a mission to give everything to God.

31
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But after experiencing that Adorarink,

32
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I found a ghost in me.

33
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I feel a God that is not suitable for a electric vehicle.

34
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
A truth that is reliable.

35
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Then, I'll give my life to God.

36
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll give my life to God.

37
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'll give my life to God.

38
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'll give my life to God.

39
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll give my life to God.

40
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll give my life to God.

41
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'll give my life to God.

42
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That Adorarink was like a God.

43
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
But I don't think God has given me such justice.

44
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The White Shadows are trying to destroy this world by the Great Great.

45
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
There's a disaster after the destruction.

46
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's not the end.

47
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
There's only the right of God.

48
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's just a word.

49
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What will happen to the people of Tokyo you've saved?

50
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Everything is a miracle.

51
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Especially the great great.

52
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll fix it.

53
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Chief!

54
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Aki Tarouobi.

55
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You've lost a great existence for humanity.

56
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
What will you get?

57
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That's your...

58
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
...my heart!

59
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Damn it!

60
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:31,480
GOLDEN

61
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,960
If a fight lasts...

62
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,960
Burn's heat is rising and decreasing.

63
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,960
As time goes by, power rises and you can't reach it.

64
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:17,960
What are you thinking about, Captain Burn?

65
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,960
Why do you think I'm a fighter who fights with fire?

66
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,960
I was...

67
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,960
...having my father's shadow.

68
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,960
Why have you changed?

69
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,960
Can't you give me time to listen to the reason?

70
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,960
The eighth is coming.

71
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,960
This is my sword.

72
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,960
You guys go down.

73
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,960
I understand. Leave the scum and leave it to you.

74
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,960
I will take the Yohashira.

75
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,960
What's wrong, Hamya?

76
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,960
I'm just a little tired. I want you to touch me.

77
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:56,960
How many times have I told you to fight with the Yohashira?

78
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,960
I can't believe this planet is going to be like the sun.

79
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,960
I can't believe it.

80
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:11,960
Captain Burn's stupidity is so stupid.

81
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,960
Adora's world was so vast.

82
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,960
I can't believe it's going to be like the sun.

83
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,960
But we believe in God and act.

84
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,960
Captain Burn's is the same, right?

85
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:35,960
That's why it's strange to attack Captain Ooby.

86
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,960
The first attack is coming.

87
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,960
It's about time to attack the sky.

88
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,960
Get out of here!

89
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,960
I'm taking the punishment of the truth and the proof. Get ready.

90
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,960
Um...

91
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,960
It's dangerous to stand in the warehouse.

92
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,960
The captain always tells us.

93
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,960
Shut up.

94
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,960
We are the enemy.

95
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,960
What's the point of standing in the warehouse?

96
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,960
We don't need the support.

97
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,960
We're going to make the entire universe collapse.

98
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,960
Let's destroy the big old man.

99
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,960
What's going on?

100
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,960
I can't believe we're going to be the enemy.

101
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,960
We're going to be the enemy.

102
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,960
What's wrong?

103
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,960
You're too loud.

104
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,960
Destroy the big old man.

105
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,960
Destroy the big old man.

106
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,960
The voice is too loud.

107
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,960
Destroy the big old man.

108
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,960
Destroy the big old man.

109
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,960
Destroy the big old man.

110
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,960
Not yet.

111
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,960
Destroy the big old man.

112
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,960
Destroy the big old man.

113
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,960
Destroy the big old man.

114
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,960
Burn's is the one who did the adoraring, right?

115
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,960
Why?

116
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,960
Haumea is trying to get rid of this toy bar.

117
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,960
He's going to make the doppelganger drink.

118
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,960
We're the other big eights' attack.

119
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,960
The darkness of despair leads this planet to the sun.

120
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,960
We'll crush them together with despair.

121
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,960
So, what about Haumea?

122
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,960
She's still in the cell.

123
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,960
She's gathering her conscious.

124
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,960
Haumea.

125
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,960
Haumea.

126
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,960
Haumea.

127
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,960
Haumea.

128
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Haumea.

129
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,960
Haumea.

130
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,960
Haumea.

131
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,960
Haumea.

132
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,960
Haumea.

133
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,960
Haumea.

134
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,960
It's a waste of time.

135
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,960
I'm...

136
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,960
It's night.

137
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,960
I'm going to kill you.

138
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:28,960
The Chinese unconscious is gathering Haumea.

139
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,960
I can't see it.

140
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:36,960
It's almost time for the end of the era.

141
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,960
If you don't see Haumea suffering, what can you do?

142
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,960
Haumea.

143
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,960
Wait.

144
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,960
It seems that the princess is not here.

145
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,960
If it's the princess,

146
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,960
she'll be in the lab since she's been discharged.

147
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,960
What?

148
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,960
The lab.

149
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,960
Shabelle, Homurabi,

150
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,960
Miyamoto,

151
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,960
the princess,

152
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,960
and the doppelganger.

153
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,960
Why are they here?

154
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:44,960
Is it because the main cause I and Iris were involved in some experiment?

155
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,960
The human discovery that the sisters burned.

156
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:58,960
And that's related to doppelganger in some way.

157
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,960
If I do that...

158
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,960
The doppelganger is against the burns.

159
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,960
The rest of the doppelgangers should come to the rescue.

160
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,960
I see.

161
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,960
Then let's dig those guys up.

162
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,960
The fact that the doppelgangers are involved in the investigation is their fault.

163
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,960
I don't know where they're coming from.

164
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,960
Let's warn them.

165
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,960
This wall.

166
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,960
They can't come in from the front.

167
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,960
They're coming from the front.

168
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,960
Gold, you were a good boy.

169
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,960
I'm sorry.

170
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,960
But I'm sorry.

171
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,960
I'm sorry.

172
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,960
I'm sorry.

173
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,960
I'm sorry.

174
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,960
I'm sorry.

175
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,960
I'm sorry.

176
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,960
I'm sorry.

177
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,960
I'm sorry.

178
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,960
I'm sorry.

179
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,960
I'm sorry.

180
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,960
Gold, you were a good boy.

181
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,960
I found you, Captain.

182
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,960
What?

183
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,960
I'm sure of it.

184
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
Barcan is waiting for you in the back.

185
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,960
You should backup with Lys.

186
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,960
Roger that.

187
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,960
Arthur, I'll take care of you.

188
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,960
Arthur.

189
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,960
What?

190
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,960
I don't think I've seen you before.

191
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,960
I fell in the truck while I was moving.

192
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,960
No way.

193
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,960
What will they do to the whole world?

194
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,960
That's why I always said Tatsuna was in the warehouse.

195
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:46,960
I don't think I've had time to stand up from the front.

196
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,960
The Z-class is your life.

197
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,960
Chachin.

198
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,960
Who will do the whole world without Captain Arthur and Shinra?

199
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,960
I have no choice but to do it with Maki.

200
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,960
I will do it!

201
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,960
I will do it!

202
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,960
Tomaki.

203
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,960
The enemy's attack is not as strong as the fire.

204
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,960
Be careful.

205
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,960
Leave it to me.

206
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,960
I won't call Shinra at the top speed, but if it's a problem, I'll do it!

207
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,960
Hurry up!

208
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,960
There's only one Z-class left.

209
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,960
Chachin.

210
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,960
Maki, we're Tamaki's support.

211
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,960
Roger that.

212
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,960
Lys, can you see the city?

213
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,960
This is the other side of the wall.

214
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,960
The image is perfect.

215
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,960
You can also see the enemy.

216
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,960
We'll backup the three of you.

217
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,960
Leave it to me.

218
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,960
This is it!

219
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,960
If it's from above, it'll hit.

220
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,960
You're a piece of cake!

221
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,960
Tamaki, let's get out of here!

222
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,960
The bullets are back!

223
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,960
Maki, let's go to the ground.

224
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,960
Yes!

225
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,960
I want to be a powerful second generation.

226
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,960
It's just a waste.

227
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,960
Here it comes!

228
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,960
You've got a good amount of points.

229
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,960
Well, that's fine.

230
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,960
Thank you very much.

231
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,960
How was your ability?

232
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,960
I felt the power on the right arm of the enemy,

233
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,960
but it was more like a heat than a fire, so I couldn't summon it.

234
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,960
We, the Fulibids, are the experts of the anti-powerful.

235
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,960
It seems like the second generation is quite capable of fighting.

236
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,960
Damn, isn't it too early?

237
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,960
I've already entered the second stage.

238
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,960
If I keep doing this, I can't get my hands on it.

239
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,960
No, I should have already given up.

240
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,960
Riki, did you know what the other party's ability was?

241
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,960
It seems that there is a secret to the right arm of the enemy,

242
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,960
but that's all there is to it.

243
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,960
But I'll definitely show you how it works.

244
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,960
The battle and the analysis are the battle of the defense team.

245
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,960
That's right.

246
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,960
We'll be out of the analysis soon.

247
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,960
We'll also rebuild the formation.

248
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,960
Roger!

249
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,960
What? The discussion of the money?

250
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,960
But it's useless to try to buy it.

251
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,960
The cut of the money is the cut of the fortune.

252
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,960
I'm enough for you guys.

253
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,960
I'll do it!

254
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,960
Hey!

255
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,960
I'll let you regret that you've thrown the first eight!

256
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,960
How many people are involved?

257
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,960
We're just going to fall here!

258
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,960
Let's go!

259
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,960
The second half is the first-ever fight of the O-Bi Party's Chief, Damashii!

260
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,960
The second half of the O-Bi Party's Chief, Damashii!

261
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,960
The second half of the O-Bi Party's Chief, Damashii!

262
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,960
The second half of the O-Bi Party's Chief, Damashii!
