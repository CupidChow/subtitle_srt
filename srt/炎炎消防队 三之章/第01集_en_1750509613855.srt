1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,900
They're coming!

2
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,340
Tada!

3
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,780
рузing

4
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,480
Heartbeat too slow

5
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,620
no need to talk

6
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,560
We'll go

7
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,920
Let's meet them

8
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:24,980
Yeah

9
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,680
Yeah

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,420
Looks like they're getting a taste of it will be you killed

11
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:49,240
Seems like it about time they saw exactly who they are

12
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:50,840
등

13
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,480
QUOTE

14
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,080
There's a party and my・

15
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,080
Oh!

16
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,760
Yeah!

17
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,760
Let's thank the sun god and spend a peaceful day.

18
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,760
It's hot.

00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:10,760

00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,760

00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,760
That's all for the report.

41
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,760
The second report of the National Liberation Army.

42
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,760
Mr. Asakusa and Mr. Haejima promised us their cooperation.

43
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,760
The report that was so far is finally one.

44
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:31,760
This time, the connection should be strong.

45
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,760
Good job, O-B.

46
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:42,760
If the report is one, it will be a big step to solve the mystery of the human body.

47
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,760
I've been here for the last time after I've finished the eighth.

48
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,760
It's all thanks to the power of the General.

49
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,760
No, O-B, it's your hand.

50
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,760
You've made a good report.

51
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,760
It's still going on.

52
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,760
You're so noisy.

53
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
Excuse me.

54
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,760
I'm the Tokyo National Liberation Army.

55
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,760
I'm reporting the general's report.

56
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,760
What's the need for the military?

57
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,760
I'm going to contact you on the day of the fall.

58
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,760
Please don't resist.

59
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,760
I'll use my hand.

60
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,760
Contact? What do you mean?

61
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,760
It's okay.

62
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,760
There's a mistake.

63
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,760
Please tell the police.

64
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,760
What kind of a general is that?

65
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,760
I'm sorry.

66
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,760
That's enough.

67
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,760
What the hell is this?

68
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,760
I'll seal this place.

69
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,760
Thank you, you devil.

70
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,760
You're a hero.

71
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,760
You're a hero.

72
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,760
You're so...

73
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,760
Sister, that's the one from the Balkans.

74
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,760
Please take it.

75
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,760
It's a joint.

76
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,760
It seems that the guy who prepared it for the year has been useful.

77
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,760
I gave you my arm when I went to Asakusa, right?

78
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,760
Thank you.

79
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,760
I'm sorry for being so rude.

80
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,760
I'm sorry.

81
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,760
But you've been attacking people who attacked you with a nether, right?

82
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,760
Was it Assault?

83
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,760
No, that's...

84
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,760
That guy did it on purpose.

85
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,760
I'm sorry.

86
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,760
Shinda and Asa also learned a new technique in Asakusa.

87
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,760
Yes.

88
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,760
Shinda imagined Shii and pulled out the idiot of Kaziba.

89
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,760
Asa also imagined Shii?

90
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,760
No, I heard it from Asa too.

91
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,760
How did you get the idiot?

92
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,760
Imagine that the game data of Level Const disappeared with the strongest equipment.

93
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,760
That's it.

94
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,760
You're saying that idiot and genius are gods.

95
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,760
Yes, you're right.

96
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,760
You're an idiot and genius.

97
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:13,760
After the disaster in the past,

98
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,760
the people of Tokyo High School were afraid of the fear of human discovery.

99
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,760
Now, the high school must be reborn and become one.

100
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,760
High school?

101
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,760
It's about the senior high school.

102
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,760
It's all because of you.

103
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,760
Did something big happen?

104
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:53,760
I've been waiting for you, Colonel Ronald Burns.

105
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,760
What do you think?

106
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:03,760
As the high school has been under various restrictions,

107
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,760
the students have not been able to get along.

108
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,760
But now, there is a need to be one.

109
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,760
For the high school.

110
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,760
For me.

111
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,760
And for the senior high school.

112
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,760
Be one with them.

113
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,760
They are the senior high school students who have Adler-Burst.

114
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,760
They are the enemies of the high school.

115
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,760
Colonel, hurry up!

116
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,760
Is it that strange that we are here?

117
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,760
Ronald Burns.

118
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,760
Of course!

119
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
Your father's blood is the smell of the blood!

120
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,760
We just came back to the place we should be.

121
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,760
You're a traitor.

122
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,760
You stupid fool.

123
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,760
Get back, Haume.

124
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,760
It's okay.

125
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,760
I'll tell you my own story.

126
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,760
This is the high school.

127
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:43,640
It's the middle school of the Western

128
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
High school.

129
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,760
The first floor.

130
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,760
The electric vehicle.

131
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,760
The God.

132
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,760
The Holy Spirit.

133
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,760
The Adler-Burst.

134
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,760
The head of Burns.

135
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,760
The head of the talking.

136
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,760
Captain Burns.

137
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,760
You've already noticed.

138
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,760
What do you mean?

139
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,760
Isn't that the evidence of your lost right eye?

140
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,760
You should have seen it.

141
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,760
The world's truth.

142
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,760
But we can't confirm it.

143
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,760
You who are in the deep of the deep of the deep.

144
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,760
We should be the same.

145
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,760
You and the others are the same!

146
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,760
You're not saying anything wrong!

147
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,760
Are you Rekka Hoshimiya?

148
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:36,760
Rekka Hoshimiya was a very experienced Shinto.

149
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,760
You killed him, didn't you?

150
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,760
It was a sacrifice that we had to make for our great goal.

151
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,760
What do you mean?

152
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,760
It was just a murder!

153
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,760
What's the point of such a person's creation?

154
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,760
It's not a murder.

155
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,760
What's the point of such a person's creation?

156
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,760
Even if it's the form of God, it's your fault!

157
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,760
Don't you feel it?

158
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,760
Our words.

159
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,760
My words are the God's great blessing.

160
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,760
I should feel the spirit of the great universe.

161
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,760
You know your goal.

162
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,760
It's the final round of the Grand Festival, right?

163
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,760
That's only the result of the many results.

164
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:32,760
We, the Holy Ghost, are only depending on the will of the Great Ocean.

165
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,760
The Grand Festival is not your goal.

166
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,760
The Great Ocean is not what you want.

167
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,760
You don't want the Great Ocean to be what you want, do you?

168
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,760
Colonel Leonard Burns.

169
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,760
You must have seen the right eye of the Grand Festival.

170
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,760
The way this world is.

171
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,760
The future from now on.

172
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,760
What is your goal?

173
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,760
To make this Earth the Great Ocean.

174
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,760
The Great Ocean of the past.

175
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,760
You're talking such a stupid story.

176
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,760
Are you really going to burn this planet?

177
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,760
Show me your true identity, Leonard Burns.

178
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,760
If you're a experienced priest, you should have seen it.

179
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,760
The feeling of the great world.

180
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,760
The overwhelming truth.

181
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,760
The overwhelming spirit.

182
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,760
The unwavering liberation.

183
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,760
The holy spirit.

184
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,760
The Great Ocean.

185
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,760
The Grand Festival has been re-established!

186
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,760
It seems that the military has been re-established in the report of the General Manager.

187
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,760
Now, the military is under the control of the government.

188
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,760
The military was with the White House.

189
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,760
In other words, the General Manager was arrested by the White House.

190
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,760
What do you mean?

191
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,760
Why is the General Manager arrested?

192
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,760
And the White House and the military are cooperating?

193
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,760
It's a mystery how the White House invaded the center of the country.

194
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,760
But their goal is to protect the Adler Burst.

195
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,760
It's a mystery how the Adler Burst is cooperating.

196
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,760
Draw!

197
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,760
I will summon the General Manager to the center of the country!

198
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,760
Hey!

199
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,760
I want to say something, but I don't mind.

200
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,760
No!

201
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,760
The Eighth Amendment will never sell its friends.

202
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,760
This is the word of the Great General Manager, no one else.

203
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,760
I respect that word and throw the Adler Burst away.

204
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,760
Why do you want to chase me?

205
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,760
If you don't hurry, the military will come here in time.

206
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,760
You can leave the rest here.

207
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,760
I will prepare to save the General Manager.

208
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,760
If that happens, you will fight with the hands of the King.

209
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,760
What if the General Manager is...

210
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,760
That's right.

211
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,760
I will become a traitor.

212
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,760
That's why this is a personal act.

213
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,760
It's not an order.

214
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,760
If you are a traitor, you will be a traitor.

215
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,760
I will go, too!

216
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,760
Of course!

217
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,760
Let's save the General Manager!

218
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,760
I will go, too!

219
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,760
I will...

220
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,760
I will go!

221
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,760
I will save the General Manager!

222
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,760
What?

223
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,760
I will save the General Manager!

224
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,760
The General Manager is not a traitor!

225
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,760
Don't run away!

226
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,760
Don't say sad things!

227
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,760
I love you!

228
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,760
Shut up!

229
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,760
Maki, you have a place to go back.

230
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,760
I have decided to go to the Eighth Amendment.

231
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,760
If you say anything more, I will get angry with the General Manager.

232
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,760
Don't overdo it.

233
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,760
You have a family.

234
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,760
I don't want to be a traitor.

235
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,760
Everyone is going, right?

236
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,760
So I'm going, too!

237
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,760
Is that okay?

238
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,760
It's not just that everyone's opinions are being discussed.

239
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,760
It's not being discussed with a weak feeling!

240
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,760
I will go because everyone is going with my strong will!

241
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,760
Let's go!

242
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,760
You said something weak and powerful.

243
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,760
We are the General Team!

244
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,760
We are always ready!

245
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,760
Of course!

246
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,760
We are always ready!

247
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,760
The country's numbers and the number of people are low.

248
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,760
The first and the second are all enemies.

249
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,760
The Eighth Amendment is completely isolated.

250
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,760
But no one can escape it.

251
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,760
This is the Eighth Amendment.

252
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,760
The Eighth Amendment is a family.

253
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,760
General Manager, what do you do?

254
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,760
The Eighth Amendment is a mystery that follows the world, called the Humanity.

255
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:40,760
That's why I knew that someday I would become an enemy of the world.

256
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,760
Because I will become a traitor against the world.

257
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,760
The next opponent is...

258
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,760
what?

259
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,760
That's a약ouko.

260
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,760
I don't know why I'm so sad

261
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,760
I believe in you, I keep hurting you

262
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,760
I'm so happy

263
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:42,760
If you keep forgetting me, I'll be able to overcome you

264
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:50,760
Before the day I had a heart, before the day I cried

265
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,760
There was nothing I could give you

266
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,760
I'm a machine of memory, I can pull this off and go to the world

267
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,760
If it's a place to go

268
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:21,760
Hey, I want to be strong, I want to be strong now

269
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:28,760
Come to me from the beginning, rather than the end

270
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:51,760
I caught the Akital Orbe

271
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,760
I see

272
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,760
The new-born Sakabe is the leader of the electrician who holds the Adora Burst

273
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:04,760
Yes, the Orbe is a warrior who can make the Yohashira look good

274
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:10,760
And he bought a lot of people for the Adora Burst called Shinra

275
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,760
I have to reward you for that

276
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:23,760
Give me the joy of changing that flame to the life that made the sun die

277
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,760
I'll give you the light of the Akital Orbe

278
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,760
I'll tell you how long, but I don't care

279
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,760
I'll just be silent, just follow our footsteps

280
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,760
I'm just waiting for the heart to get up

281
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:23,760
I'm a machine of memory, I can pull this off and go to the world

282
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,760
If it's a place to go

283
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,760
Come to me from the beginning, rather than the end

284
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,760
I'll give you the light of the Akital Orbe

285
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,760
I see

286
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,760
The new-born Sakabe is the leader of the electrician who holds the Adora Burst

287
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,760
I can't stop my heart beating so fast

288
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,260
I can't stop my heart beating so fast

289
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,260
The world's rocker is dancing

290
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,260
Ah ah ah, I pop pop pop

291
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,760
I'm a rocker

292
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,260
Silence, I like you

293
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,760
Pop pop pop, silence

294
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,260
I like you, pop pop pop

295
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,260
Silence, I like you

296
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,260
Pop pop pop, silence

297
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,260
I like you, pop pop pop

298
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,260
Silence, I like you

299
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,260
Pop pop pop, silence

300
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,260
Pop pop pop, silence

301
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,260
I like you, pop pop pop

302
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,260
Pop pop pop, silence
