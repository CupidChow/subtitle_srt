00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,770
[Episode 15]
Gosh! Officer!

10
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,500
How come you are...

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,920
Move aside!

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,380
Hurry and notify the Minister of General Affairs.

13
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,240
And you, go and tell the Hanseongbu about this case.

14
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,870
Yes, Sir.

15
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,370
Is it all right if I take a look?

16
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,590
Why are you, the youngest son of the chief state minister, getting involved in this?

17
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,970
It is a proper procedure for the head of the jurisdiction to do the first inspection when someone dies in the city.

18
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,040
By the time the physicians and body inspectors come

19
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,440
receiving the orders for the first inspection according to the procedure, it will be the middle of the night!

20
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,710
The condition of the body will deteriorate over time,

21
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,730
- so let me inspect it quickly before it is too late–
- Go away!

22
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:41,150
We will take care of this following proper procedure, so do not get involved.

23
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,010
She suddenly ended up this way.

24
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,360
I opened the carriage when we arrived...

25
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,220
If she died in the palanquin, then she did not get attacked by someone.

26
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,690
She ate rice cakes, but she threw up blood.

27
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:08,550
If she merely got indigestion while eating rice cakes, she wouldn't have thrown up blood.

28
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,050
Do you not think she died of poisoning?

29
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,180
If she was killed by poisoning, there must be a motive for the murder...

30
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,570
It does not seem like she would have had anyone hold a grudge against her.

31
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,410
What is wrong?

32
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,890
Perhaps, the woman who is in love with me did this out of jealousy–

33
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,840
Yes, that is probably not the case.

34
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,430
If it is not that, why did she get poisoned?

35
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:41,410
Whoever it is, they would not have done that to her for having a grudge against her father.

36
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:45,740
But you know... Eunuch Go.

37
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:50,940
I clearly saw you take the bracelet off of her wrist.

38
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,360
You, too, Friend.

39
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,430
Why did you stay quiet when you saw Eunuch Go take something from the dead at the scene?

40
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,640
Also, you also knew something.

41
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,510
Why did you hold me back?

42
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,810
That bracelet belongs to the murderer of Gaeseong,

43
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,140
Min Jae Yi.

44
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,410
[Maiden Min Jae Yi, whom I love]

45
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,980
You probably also know about the scandal revolving around Min Jae Yi.

46
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:41,150
This is the bracelet that was given to Min Jae Yi by Shim Young, who was rumored to be her secret lover.

47
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,670
Supposedly, he and Min Jae Yi exchanged and wore similar bracelets together.

48
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,910
T-Then

49
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:50,500
are you saying Maiden Jae Yi is connected to the death of the Minister's daughter?

50
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,660
How could that death be connected to Min Jae Yi?

51
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,640
It was just that she was in possession of Min Jae Yi's bracelet.

52
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,300
Then why did you smuggle this item away?

53
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:04,630
Did you not take this bracelet because you are suspicious that there may be a connection?

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,450
Hanseongbu will figure out the cause of death soon.

55
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:15,860
We will find out if there is a connection to Min Jae Yi.

56
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,310
I mean,

57
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,890
I suppose a person would not have died because of this bracelet.

58
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,940
It is not like this bracelet was cursed.

59
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:29,570
However, that does not seem to be what is important right now.

60
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,890
How did you know right away that this was Maiden Jae Yi's bracelet?

61
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,150
You, too, Friend.

62
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,270
You also knew that this bracelet was Maiden Jae Yi's.

63
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,940
That is why you held me back.

64
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,000
Is that not so?

65
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,940
Why are you all quiet? All of you but me recognized this bracelet right away.

66
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,700
Are not the three of you all strange?

67
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,240
His Highness showed me the bracelet of Shim Young, the secret lover of Min Jae Yi.

68
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,090
I knew because it was the same bracelet.

69
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,500
I heard it from Eunuch Go.

70
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,430
I heard from the Crown Prince.

71
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,220
Gosh, why does Myung Jin feel like

72
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,540
His Highness, His Highness is nearby?

73
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:26,810
I am suddenly starting to wonder if His Highness did not drop by Manyeondang in disguise.

74
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:33,350
If so... that would mean one of you two is the Crown Prince.

75
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,490
This was a fake.

76
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,910
You were not a eunuch.

77
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,970
Your Highness!

78
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,020
Manyeondang's Kim Myung Jin greets you, Your Highness, the Crown Prince!

79
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,460
Your Highness.

80
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,590
Your Highness!

81
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,830
Forgive me for the past lack of respect, Your Highness!

82
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,350
He is not. Let go of his hand and talk.

83
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,180
What do you mean he is not? Your Highness!

84
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,520
He is not. Let go of his hand- Stop holding his hand!

85
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,330
- There is no way he is not...
- I told you he is not!

86
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,180
- He is not!
- I told you he is not!

87
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,740
Your Highness, Your Highness!

88
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,080
- This guy!
- Your Highness!

89
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,240
Gosh, Your Highness.

90
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,310
Forgive me, Your Highness!

91
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,370
[Maiden Min Jae Yi, whom I love]

92
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,650
A chance to dethrone the Crown Prince

93
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,960
landed on my lap.

94
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,140
He dared to

95
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:39,770
bring in a girl into the Eastern Palace under the disguise of a eunuch?

96
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,390
Manyeondang's student is not a man, but a girl.

97
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,930
She is Jang Ga Ram, your maidservant.

98
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,700
If that were not the case, she would not have recognized that bracelet immediately.

99
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,280
If the master commits the crime of murdering one's family and the household perishes,

100
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,390
the servants must become government servants.

101
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:17,280
But... how could you smuggle her and keep her by your side, breaking the law?

102
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,850
- You must send her back even now–
- I cannot send her back.

103
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,820
There is no place to send her.

104
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:34,290
If she left Gaeseong with you, a capture-and-return order would be out for her.

105
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,260
She put her life on the line to keep me safe.

106
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,580
If I didn't have Ga Ram,

107
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,220
I could not get past the city walls and would have been arrested.

108
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:49,170
I would never have gotten the chance to meet Your Highness and clear my name.

109
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:55,440
I must... find a place for her to return.

110
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:02,930
I must give her back a house where she can rest without fear of being chased,

111
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:09,540
and a daily life filled with only light worries.

112
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,670
She is like a sister to me, Your Highness.

113
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,800
She helped me to persevere.

114
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,180
People are able to persevere when they have someone to protect.

115
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,470
If she is captured due to capture-and-return order,

116
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:31,130
not only you but Manyeondang would be in danger. Do you not realize that?

117
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,780
Thus, I must clear my name as soon as possible.

118
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,540
Your Highness,

119
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,650
could you not also protect her as well?

120
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,130
What happened with that bracelet?

121
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:01,710
Would your bracelet and that maiden's death be connected?

122
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,030
I do not know...

123
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,640
Are you sick?

124
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,500
We must go back to Manyeondang.

125
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,450
I must take a closer look at that bracelet.

126
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,240
No matter how much I think about it, it is strange.

127
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,650
Did he not tell you he is not the Crown Prince?

128
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:33,270
How could Eunuch Go be His Highness?

129
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,470
He was a woman.

130
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,240
Eunuch Go is a woman.

131
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,140
What?

132
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,400
What do you mean by that? He is a woman?

133
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,670
Did I not grab Eunuch Go's hand earlier?

134
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,930
It was a woman's hand.

135
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,650
It is not like the hands of a man and a woman are different.

136
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,410
No.

137
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,510
Myung Jin knows about bones very well.

138
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,740
It was definitely the bones of a woman.

139
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,030
Even if it was not visible, I could see it all.

140
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,780
Then what about my hand?

141
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,480
What... Do you also have a woman's hand?

142
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,810
Gosh!

143
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,360
How could you have a woman's hand when you are a man?

144
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,580
A man can have soft hands like those of a woman.

145
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,320
How could you say you could see his bones after just grabbing his hand?

146
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,060
You just wait! One day in the future, there will be a machine that shows only the bones!

147
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,490
Why not say a machine that eats poop?

148
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:48,390
Goodness... What a smart student you are!

149
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,590
Then how about a machine like this?

150
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,770
After Myung Jin poops, water comes out

151
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:58,690
and carries that poop away neatly. How about a machine like this–

152
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,080
Master! You should say things that make sense!

153
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,040
Gosh, seriously!

154
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:12,000
But if a world like that does come, it would be really clean.

155
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,380
If a world like that where poop is carried away comes,

156
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,130
I will sell water and become rich!

157
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,830
Come on! If you go outside, water is everywhere!

158
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,800
Why would anyone pay money to drink water?

159
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,230
I guess since Joseon is a nation with lots of water,

160
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,950
people would not pay money to drink water.

161
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,830
Gosh, Joseon is such a good country!

162
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:38,850
I, Myung Jin, will make Joseon even better.

163
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,910
I will accompany you.

164
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,100
I will remain your student forever, Master.

165
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,810
All right!

166
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,910
What is the matter?

167
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:00,040
How... How could this be?

168
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,880
Wait, this is...

169
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,130
My goodness...

170
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:28,500
This is the house where Oh Man Shik's sister-in-law lives.

171
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,590
Did the homeowner go somewhere?

172
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,770
I just moved here a few days ago. Who are you?

173
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,560
Where did the previous owner go?

174
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,840
Oh, the widow with two kids?

175
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,680
She said she was going back to her hometown.

176
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,420
I think she said it was Gaeseong?

177
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,490
They said they were sending stuff to their hometown,

178
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,740
but it was a whole boatload of things!

179
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,450
Did you hear about where his hometown was?

180
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,930
He said it was Gaeseong.

181
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,040
How come it is Gaeseong again?

182
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,590
What are you doing over there?

183
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,880
You are late in coming home today.

184
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,410
Is that not dried mugwort?

185
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:33,730
Do you believe the superstition that evil spirits would go away if they smelled dried mugwort?

186
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,610
I just liked how it smelled in the night breeze.

187
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,500
I felt like it calmed me down.

188
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,310
Are you anxious about having come to a foreign place?

189
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:46,780
Or are you worried about the Queen selection that you are so downcast?

190
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,260
Do not worry. Everything will go well.

191
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,590
Do you not think my father had a plan when he called you to come?

192
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:00,260
What kind of person is His Highness?

193
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,830
I heard he was your friend, Orabeoni.

194
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:07,800
His Highness is a naturally gifted leader.

195
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,700
He is wise and cautious,

196
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,010
and has an inner fortitude that keeps him from easily bending

197
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,210
or breaking under any circumstances.

198
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:20,690
Also, he is considerate and warm to people,

199
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,490
so he should treat you well, too.

200
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,860
I can guarantee it.

201
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:30,830
I heard that women get mixed feelings right before they get married.

202
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:34,240
- It must be the case for you as well.
- Is it different for men?

203
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,620
How was it for you, Orabeoni–

204
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,700
I am sorry, Orabeoni.

205
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:46,000
Supposedly, the woman you were engaged to died...

206
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,680
Although the world tells me that she died, I feel like

207
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,250
she is still alive for some reason.

208
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,750
People tell me that my fiancee betrayed me

209
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,180
and murdered her family to be with another man.

210
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,410
However, I do not believe the rumors from Gaeseong.

211
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,780
You never even got to converse with her

212
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,170
and you were engaged to her between families' agreement,

213
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,440
so how could you believe her unwaveringly like that?

214
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,100
If we promised to get married,

215
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,220
whom would I believe?

216
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,830
Would I believe the world or...

217
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,370
would I believe her?

218
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,930
I guess I want to believe her.

219
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,960
Since everyone else points fingers at her,

220
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,700
I guess...

221
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,480
I want to believe her for her.

222
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,840
Are you still waiting for that woman?

223
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,220
Are you still waiting for that woman?

224
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,510
She is apparently dead.

225
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:52,460
She committed a grave sin and brought me shame.

226
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,770
How could I wait for her?

227
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,320
I once received that same question.

228
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,960
That time, I said I was not.

229
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,500
Because I felt like a fool for waiting.

230
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,550
That is right.

231
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,690
I am waiting. I am still...

232
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,170
waiting for that woman.

233
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,570
But...

234
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,080
if she is still alive...

235
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,720
If she is alive and is not coming to you,

236
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,060
it could be that she has no intention of returning to you, Orabeoni–

237
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:34,140
I am sorry, Orabeoni.

238
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,020
I do not even know much about this, and yet...

239
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,660
You may be right.

240
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,130
If she is alive, she should have come to me.

241
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,910
And if she did not come to me, even though she is alive,

242
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,170
as you have said,

243
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,820
she may not have any intention to return to me.

244
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,120
It is nice to have a female relative.

245
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,710
I get to talk about things like this.

246
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,820
You can also tell me your secrets if you want.

247
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,410
I do not disclose other people's secrets rashly,

248
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:10,590
- so you can trust me.
- Yes, Orabeoni.

249
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,390
It is death by poison.

250
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,370
There was arsenic in this part.

251
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:33,550
Since this bracelet was given to Maiden Jae Yi by Shim Young...

252
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:37,050
The one who put the arsenic inside was probably him as well.

253
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,850
Right before Min Jae Yi dipped the ladle into the soup,

254
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,310
he would have rotated this bracelet here.

255
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:46,090
That is how the arsenic would have ended up in the soup.

256
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:50,370
The one who put the poison inside probably intended to kill the entire family,

257
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,380
but he probably did not expect Min Jae Yi not to eat the soup.

258
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:59,040
Then... that bastard Shim Young tried to kill My Lady–

259
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:04,070
He was trying to kill Lady Min Jae Yi as well?

260
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,030
Then why did he kill the Minister's daughter?

261
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:13,000
That death was probably a coincidence.

262
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,800
Someone in Gaeseong probably sold this bracelet,

263
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,740
and probably ended up in Hanyang, passing through several hands.

264
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,200
It just so happened that the Minister's daughter bought it.

265
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,370
On the day she died...

266
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,120
I am a bit hungry,

267
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,260
can you go buy some rice cakes?

268
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,220
Yes, My Lady.

269
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,890
I like it.

270
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,630
What is this?

271
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,450
It opens.

272
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,170
It is an interesting bracelet.

273
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,230
I like it even more.

274
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,960
My Lady.

275
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,140
My Lady! My Lady!

276
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,280
- Are you okay, My Lady?
- Goodness!

277
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,980
- Goodness!
- My Lady!

278
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,080
Someone, please help!

279
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,290
My Lady!

280
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:14,130
However, how come...

281
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,130
why did Shim Young...

282
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,150
Should we not take this bracelet to the Royal Investigation Bureau

283
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,860
and demonstrate Min Jae Yi's innocence?

284
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,140
That is right. We should tell the Royal Investigation Bureau right away and catch that guy.

285
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,750
We cannot do that.

286
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,580
The world is talking about this bracelet as a

287
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,440
token of love shared between the two of them.

288
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,180
If they say the two plotted this together, what can we say?

289
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,960
That guy...

290
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,600
is dead.

291
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,550
After leaving a will confessing his love for Min Jae Yi,

292
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,800
he killed himself.

293
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,470
Then were the rumors about him being Min Jae Yi's secret lover true?

294
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,530
That is not true!

295
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,190
How do the two of you know?

296
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,600
I mean, that is just what I think.

297
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,010
Me, too. I just think so...

298
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:14,030
Since Min Jae Yi disappeared after falling off a cliff, there is no way for us to know the truth.

299
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:18,270
However, based on the will that the Crown Prince showed me,

300
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:23,720
Shim Young seemed to completely believe that he was Min Jae Yi's secret lover.

301
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:29,050
Wait... how could he mistakenly believe such a thing as truth?

302
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,440
It is not like he was stung by a bee somewhere...

303
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,120
Did he get deluded by a ghost?

304
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,000
Even if he was deluded by a ghost, this is...

305
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,900
Tell me. What else do I not know?

306
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,140
Tell me everything that the three of you know!

307
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,940
The peony petals from the head shaman's house

308
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,870
was also found at the house of the Governor of Gaeseong.

309
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,410
The peony petals from the head shaman's house were found in Gaeseong?

310
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:57,380
Also, Shim Young was found dead with white hair.

311
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,340
Supposedly, he was not white-haired before.

312
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:17,450
He was not white-haired before, but he became white-haired...

313
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,990
You are home late.

314
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,940
Oh, yes, Father. I was busy with both public and private matters.

315
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,970
All you do is loiter around the streets. You actually had matters that kept you busy?

316
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:43,730
As you probably heard on the streets, the daughter of the Minister of General Affairs died.

317
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,320
Act cautiously for the time being.

318
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,130
Yes, Father.

319
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,540
Welcome home.

320
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:05,010
You. You do not even greet your mother as you come and go for the past few days.

321
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,160
Father.

322
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,330
Yes?

323
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,530
Have you seen the head shaman at the interrogation site?

324
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:15,520
Of course, I have. Why are you asking about that wretched lady?

325
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,870
Was her hair white by any chance?

326
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,350
How did you know that?

327
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,750
Was she really white-haired?

328
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,780
She was quite bizarre. An amur viper even appeared and bit her neck.

329
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,800
Amur viper?

330
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:30,280
A snake appeared out of nowhere and bit her neck.

331
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,640
When I asked about it later, they said it was an amur viper.

332
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,430
An amur viper as well...

333
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,100
Okay. I will be heading out again.

334
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,250
Where is this bastard going again without greeting his mother after coming home?

335
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,830
- Let him be.
- Where are you going at this time of night?

336
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,670
- Leave him alone, wife.
- That son of the damned Kim family...

337
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:51,610
Come now. I am also of the Kim family. Hold yourself back.

338
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:54,060
Gosh! That damned seed!

339
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:58,820
Is that something you should be saying in front of me?

340
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:18,970
The commonality between the Sabangahn case and the Gaeseong murder case...

341
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:22,760
and an amur viper as well...

342
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:28,750
Wait, does this not...involve the Crown Prince as well?

343
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:40,440
I need to find out why Shim Young put poison into this bracelet and who was behind it.

344
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,040
So, we can find out who sent you the ghost's letter, Your Highness.

345
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,380
You said you would not return to Sergeant after the case is resolved.

346
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,890
Are you thinking of returning to Gaeseong with Jang Ga Ram?

347
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,790
If I return to being Min Jae Yi,

348
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,750
I will not go back to Gaeseong.

349
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:07,300
- Why not?
- It was the house I lived in with my family.

350
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,080
It would be lonely to live there by myself.

351
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:15,030
I will send Ga Ram off to get married to a good household,

352
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:18,730
and I will live alone in Hanyang.

353
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:24,350
I would need to live in Hanyang so that once in a while,

354
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:28,310
I will get to see Your Highness's procession after you take the throne.

355
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:31,690
If I can see Your Highness's face after you have become King,

356
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:36,330
I would run over 2 miles just to see your procession.

357
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:42,330
What are you planning on doing if you live by yourself?

358
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:47,370
Would it not be good to drop by Manyeondang at times and help the Young Master?

359
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:51,000
We can solve cases together and help innocent people clear their names.

360
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,090
Oh, right! It would also be good to teach kids how to write Korean.

361
00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:00,160
Scholars use Chinese characters, but written Korean language is an excellent and easy language,

362
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,600
so people of the low class could learn it in a day.

363
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:07,670
I will teach kids who need to learn the written Korean language, not kids of wealthy families.

364
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:12,460
When you become King, could you give me some donation of Heesa?

365
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,180
[Heesa | Donation of money or things for a specific purpose]

366
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,980
You would live by yourself in Hanyang, you say...

367
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,660
What kind of house do you want to live in?

368
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:28,530
It does not matter whether it is a straw-thatched house or a single-occupancy home. However,

369
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,290
I would like it if there was an apricot tree in the front yard.

370
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:41,590
If you live alone like that, would you think of me from time to time?

371
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,450
I would think of you whenever the sun comes up from the East,

372
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:49,520
for you reside in the East, Your Highness.

373
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:57,450
Since the sun comes up every day, I will end up thinking of you every day.

374
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:00,680
You would also probably...

375
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,510
think of me from time to time, right?

376
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:12,460
I suppose, occasionally...I may think of you.

377
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:17,600
Whenever I see a young eunuch rushing about clumsily, or when I see a eunuch who is good at cursing,

378
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,250
or when I see a eunuch who is rude to his superiors...

379
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,610
I guess I would be reminded of you.

380
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,710
Why are you buying so many things?

381
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:01,250
Why do you worry about selling many of your goods? I am buying them because I need them.

382
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:05,110
Of course. Are you sending them to your hometown again?

383
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:10,000
How many people are in your household in your hometown that you are buying so much to send periodically?

384
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,990
Are you the only one providing for your family back in your hometown?

385
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:15,290
You do not need to know.

386
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:25,060
Move aside! The Minister of Justice is passing through! Move aside!

387
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,740
- Stop him!
- Hey! Move aside!

388
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,960
This is a very valuable and expensive item! Watch yourself and move aside!

389
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,790
Go over there!

390
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,230
- Let us go.
- Shoo!

391
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:40,440
Move aside! The Minister of Justice is passing through!

392
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:51,670
Why are you not answering me? Lift your head. Lift your head!

393
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,830
You... Who are you, and what do you do?

394
00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:01,640
I am just a lowly man who barely scrapes by every day, Your Excellency.

395
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,320
Wait.

396
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:08,630
Lift your head.

397
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,840
N-No, not you! You, with the round face that is, like a clove of garlic.

398
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,730
Y-Yeah, you! Lift your head!

399
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,840
Yes, Your Excellency.

400
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,380
Let me down!

401
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:33,120
Hey, you! Have you ever seen me before?

402
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,190
I saw you on the streets on the day your pottery broke-

403
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,220
Not that day!

404
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:41,000
Where would a lowly man like me have seen you again before?

405
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,010
Be careful with this.

406
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,610
I have definitely seen you somewhere before.

407
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:56,150
All right, look at me. Have you really never seen me before?

408
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:00,290
I swear to heaven that I have not.

409
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:03,570
You swear to heaven? Gosh, I am sure...

410
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:07,950
Gosh, where did I see you before? Your face is familiar.

411
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:11,720
Gosh, I... Gosh, forget it.

412
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,770
I guess I mistook you for someone else since you look so common like a clove of garlic.

413
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:18,510
Gosh, where did I see him before...

414
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:27,220
You wretch! I remember you now!

415
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:36,010
Are you not the man

416
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:44,030
who brought wet charcoal to my house last winter?

417
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:49,460
No, I am not. I sell herbs.

418
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:53,510
Then forget it. Gosh, where did I see you before...

419
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,890
Be careful with that pottery!

420
00:29:55,890 --> 00:30:00,500
If that pottery breaks again, your life will also be broken into pieces.

421
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,400
You are hiccuping? Give it to me!

422
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:11,560
Go to the front and lead the way! Gosh, seriously.

423
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:16,610
Move aside! The Minister of Justice is passing through!

424
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:18,760
Move aside!

425
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,830
The Minister of Justice is passing through!

426
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:26,700
I gave you guys a lot. Please enjoy the food.

427
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:32,330
You do not need to do stuff like this.

428
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,440
My sister said we needed to work for our food.

429
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,500
We will clean that section, too.

430
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,710
Do not try to work for your food. You do not need to do that.

431
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:44,640
You should not raise children like that.

432
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:53,150
Go ahead and try it.

433
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:56,940
People need to work for their food.

434
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,210
I am not trying to receive credit for feeding you guys.

435
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:04,050
Parents should not raise their children like that.

436
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:08,320
I am saying this as your father.

437
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,610
Hey, Man Duk!

438
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,980
Come here for a moment.

439
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:19,400
Well, you children should go. Go.

440
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,620
You know about that place called Manyeondang?

441
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,000
You know that house is mine, right?

442
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,120
You know how I let that crazy young master rent my house.

443
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,580
But I think I should kick him out.

444
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,340
I do not know what he is doing in my house!

445
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,930
Things seem quiet without blowing up your roof, so why are you being like that?

446
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:43,330
The two scholars who drop by often are weird, too.

447
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,040
Are you talking about the two handsome scholars?

448
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,590
Those scholars are good people.

449
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,110
Why are you being like that?

450
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:52,840
A-Are you playing high and mighty because you have a house?

451
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,710
I do not have one house. I have two.

452
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:58,440
Is it common for a man around here to own two houses?

453
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,910
So what? What are you going to do?

454
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:03,380
Come close.

455
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,660
Actually, on the day the Minister's daughter died,

456
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:13,150
I saw the small girlish eunuch take the bracelet off of the wrist of the Minister's daughter.

457
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,910
How could he steal a bracelet when a person has died?

458
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:20,400
The two from Manyeondang and the two handsome scholars schemed together and stole the bracelet!

459
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,900
They were sending signals to each other like this and this.

460
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,520
They plotted this together. Are they not so evil?

461
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,430
A person has died.

462
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:32,780
How could they steal off her dead body, even if it is an expensive bracelet?

463
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,990
Those bastards... Those thieving bastards!

464
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,960
They cannot be from Byeokcheon, right?

465
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,200
That Chief State Minister's youngest son.

466
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,920
How could he hang out with the bandits from Byeokcheon?

467
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,030
If he were my son, I seriously would—

468
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,120
You would what? What would you do?

469
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,440
Seriously!

470
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,660
I mean, if they were from Byeokcheon, I would have to drive them away-

471
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,910
Go! Go and clean up chicken poop!

472
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:02,790
- Go, go, go, go!
- Gosh.

473
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:10,090
Why do people hate people from Byeokcheon?

474
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,780
I told you.

475
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:15,280
I saw someone getting kicked out of the market because he was from Byeokcheon a few days ago.

476
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:19,820
That is why you should never tell anyone you are from there.

477
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:26,530
Is it true that everyone from Byeokcheon are bandits?

478
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,410
I heard you improved a lot.

479
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,590
I am sorry for making you worry.

480
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:44,080
I will rush your wedding.

481
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,450
Father. You should give it more thought-

482
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:52,390
Your princess will be the daughter of the Han family of Yeongsan.

483
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,490
By that, you mean–

484
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:59,040
I think you know better than anyone how loyal the Left State Minister and Sergeant are.

485
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,220
Also, the Han family of Yeongsan is altruistic and dutiful.

486
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,330
They are an elite family that is loyal to the King and has great integrity.

487
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:08,180
They do not compare to the greedy Jo family of Seongju.

488
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:12,710
However... that would make the Han family of Yeongsan the Queen's family.

489
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:18,070
In order for you to rise to the throne, you need a family to support you.

490
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:21,880
Using one force to stop the other force is also part of politics.

491
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:27,330
The Han family of Yeongsan is the only family that can stop the Jo family of Seongju in Joseon right now.

492
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:31,930
If the Right State Minister was behind the man who shot you in Paju, as you said,

493
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:33,740
what do you think that means?

494
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:40,890
They already revealed their ambition to drive you out and put Prince Myung Ahn on the throne.

495
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:47,140
Putting Prince Myung Ahn on the throne means that they will be taking control of the Royal Court.

496
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,840
If you cannot rise to the throne,

497
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:53,030
the country will be in danger.

498
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:59,950
This royal marriage is necessary for this country and for you right now.

499
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:02,240
Join forces with the Han family of Yeongsan.

500
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,210
That is the only way for you to take the throne safely.

501
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:07,980
Do you understand?

502
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,740
Despite having arms, you will not be able to use them.

503
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,150
And, despite having legs, you will not be able to walk.

504
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:32,490
You will grow old alone without a wife and will die lonely without any children.

505
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:04,310
This is a reward from His Majesty to the eunuchs who passed the loyalty test.

506
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:08,700
Continue to be loyal to the King from now on.

507
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,960
Yes.

508
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:16,400
I never thought I would eat this precious thing.

509
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,870
I think I would cry.

510
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,090
Is it good?

511
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,150
- Try it.
- Yes.

512
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:52,480
What did you discard?

513
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,130
It is my heart.

514
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:00,330
Court Lady Choi.

515
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:03,850
You served my late Hyungnim, did you not?

516
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,500
Yes, Your Highness.

517
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,280
Do you know

518
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,360
what he did with his personal feelings?

519
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,500
As the foundation of the country, Crown Prince Ui Hyeon

520
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:19,960
did not forget that he would become the king of the country someday.

521
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,780
He said the King is like the Heavens for the people.

522
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:27,740
So he guarded himself against having personal feelings.

523
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,160
Yes.

524
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:37,660
It is just my personal feelings.

525
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:41,470
What is the point of having feelings I cannot speak of?

526
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:46,890
And what is the point of having a gift I cannot give?

527
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,540
It is...

528
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,260
over now.

529
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:27,070
I was on my way to see you. I need to tell you something.

530
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:32,690
Go on without me. I need to discuss something with Sergeant.

531
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:50,470
When I visited Oh Man Shik's sister-in-law as you ordered, she had already gotten rid of her belongings.

532
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:55,030
I asked the neighbor and she said she was going to Gaeseong a few days ago suddenly.

533
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:57,870
Considering Oh Man Shik sending his belongings to Gaeseong,

534
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:00,830
how could they be connected to Gaeseong in any way?

535
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,440
I understand.

536
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,010
Thank you for looking into it.

537
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,860
I am glad that you look healthy.

538
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:10,650
Has your wound healed completely?

539
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,460
It is much better.

540
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:16,360
By the way, I did not see Eunuch Go earlier.

541
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,070
Is his leg okay?

542
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:25,020
He injured his leg in Paju that day.

543
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:28,440
He searched the whole mountain looking for you with his injured leg.

544
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,510
Did you not know?

545
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:58,030
Your Highness, allow me to treat you today.

546
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,380
It is a special snack from the King.

547
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:09,120
Have you ever even heard of a special snack from the King?

548
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,890
I brought that precious thing to enjoy with you.

549
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:16,150
Can you tell how much I care?

550
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,070
Did you get injured at all?

551
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:37,030
No. Thankfully, I am okay.

552
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:39,140
Did you only injure your face?

553
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,350
It is nothing.

554
00:40:56,470 --> 00:41:01,080
I told you to wash the ink slab and grind the ink stick after you come back from the Eunuch's Office.

555
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,700
Oh, yes. I will do it right away.

556
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,310
Did His Majesty say anything in particular?

557
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:23,580
You look worried since you saw him.

558
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:26,670
He talked about my marriage.

559
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:31,920
Oh, the royal marriage.

560
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,860
Did you not say you had something to tell me?

561
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,560
Pardon?

562
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,960
When we were in the pharmacy's storage in Paju.

563
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,170
Your Highness, there is something I need to tell you.

564
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:47,210
Please wake up and listen to me!

565
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:51,270
Tell me what you... wanted to say then.

566
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:56,380
It is not something I can tell you when you are about to get married.

567
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:59,420
How come you are not saying anything?

568
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:04,000
I forgot.

569
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:09,350
I heard you injured your leg in Paju.

570
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,450
How come you did not tell me?

571
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:13,840
I get injured all the time.

572
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,750
That is not something to worry about.

573
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:19,500
You should report to me, regardless of whether I would worry or not!

574
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,290
Also, you told me a lie.

575
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,490
You said you did not get injured!

576
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:25,710
You got injured so seriously.

577
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:29,780
Did you want me to whine about a small wound on my leg?

578
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,360
Why are you nitpicking something that is already in the pass?

579
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,490
"Nitpicking?"

580
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:35,390
If your master points out your fault,

581
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:38,840
you should say, "My apologies." You rude bastard.

582
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,630
I told you to grind the ink stick, and you forgot that, too.

583
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,650
You will never apologize to me, will you?

584
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:51,560
You are as stubborn as an ox, too.

585
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,400
- What?
- You told me to grind the ink stick. Please hold your brush.

586
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,440
My apologies!

587
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,370
That is fine.

588
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:19,090
You can leave now.

589
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:25,940
What are you doing? I told you to leave.

590
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:31,010
It is time for me to stay with you right now.

591
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:35,070
I feel so uncomfortable when you are around.

592
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,910
Pardon?

593
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:38,990
How do you find me uncomfortable?

594
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:40,780
You...

595
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:44,340
are so loud and chatty.

596
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:48,180
You make me repeat myself several times because you are stubborn.

597
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,270
You make mistakes often because you are clumsy.

598
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:53,990
You only care about your thoughts. You do not care about serving your master.

599
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:55,420
That is unfair.

600
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,770
- I have been so caring all this time–
- Also,

601
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:00,490
you have no virtue as a woman at all.

602
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:04,100
You drink liquor and say vulgar things without hesitation.

603
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,340
And you reveal your dirty thoughts without any shame.

604
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:10,650
Also, you say you love someone wearing the eunuch's uniform.

605
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:13,870
You do not know when to run or walk, and you fight anything!

606
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:15,440
That is why you keep getting injured!

607
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,600
You injured your leg in Paju and your face during the loyalty test.

608
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,560
You do not listen to me when I worry about you.

609
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,310
You are not going to Sergeant, even though I told you to!

610
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:26,190
Who is the person you are in love with, anyway?

611
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:31,000
Why do you need to know so badly?

612
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,800
Will you marry me off to that man or something?

613
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,300
Yes. Just go to him.

614
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:42,430
I think you are determined to hurt me today.

615
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,320
Is there anything else?

616
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,190
You...

617
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,410
Above all things, you...

618
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,690
are not beautiful to look at.

619
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:57,000
Are you criticizing my face now?

620
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:04,250
Yes, I am so ugly that even the dimwit I love seems to hate me.

621
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:05,940
Leave now.

622
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:09,250
It is an order! Leave! Leave right now!

623
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,930
This is a special snack given by the King

624
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:31,050
to the eunuchs who passed the loyalty test.

625
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:34,950
I wanted to bring it to you and share it with you.

626
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:38,280
I wanted to eat as soon as I got it, but I held back and ran here.

627
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,670
But you listed all of my faults you never mentioned before and told me to leave.

628
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:46,800
I will go away and clean the library instead.

629
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,050
Please enjoy.

630
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:28,800
He talked about my marriage.

631
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,330
Marriage.

632
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:36,140
Yes, His Highness was about to get married.

633
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:05,740
They say it's fate even if your clothes brush against each other.

634
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:10,840
How come that ambitious woman left so easily like this?

635
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,170
I hope you go to a nice place to be.

636
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:16,080
Please go to a nice place to be.

637
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:20,170
Goodness!

638
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,260
Oh my goodness, Soo Hyang!

639
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:34,030
Gosh!

640
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:42,430
- Take care.
- Thank you for coming by.

641
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:44,420
His Majesty ordered

642
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:48,130
you to take time off to mourn. You should–

643
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:51,120
No. I should ask for Gibok.
(T/N: Gibok - Breaking the rule of not holding a position while mourning)

644
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:55,540
The crown princess selection is starting soon with so many political affairs. How could I do that?

645
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:59,260
I know you are greatly heartbroken. Take care of your body and spirit.

646
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,420
Yes, His Excellency.

647
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,530
Go in now.

648
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:07,230
What a tragedy.

649
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:09,680
His daughter just died.

650
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,000
Should he not have figured out the cause of death, at least?

651
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,160
- He should have inspected the body.
- Seriously!

652
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,950
His daughter did not even get married.

653
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:23,150
How could he let some lowly body inspector touch her?

654
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,550
Seriously.

655
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:28,760
Are you offended? Huh?

656
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,940
The Minister did not check his daughter's body

657
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:38,160
and concluded the process by skipping the inspection?

658
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:40,620
When a lady of a noble family dies,

659
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,630
the family often requests to skip the body inspection

660
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:45,620
in order to avoid the shame of showing their naked body.

661
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,820
But at this rate,

662
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:52,240
there would be no way to seek justice on her behalf.

663
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:56,350
Your Highness, this is Tae Kang.

664
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,100
Come in.

665
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:11,220
Is Park Han Soo really from the Jo family of Seongju?

666
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,970
Yes, that is definitely what I heard.

667
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:15,370
He was not the only one.

668
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:19,210
The other officials of the Jo family of Seongju received even more money.

669
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:22,150
The Right State Minister definitely seems to be the one who paid them.

670
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:24,930
He could not have just paid them.

671
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:28,680
It must be related to what happened in Byeokcheon 10 years ago.

672
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,820
He said he needed to talk to the Right State Minister.

673
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:35,070
He said the world would turn upside down if anyone heard about it.

674
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:40,530
Show me the proof that he received money from the Right State Minister 10 years ago.

675
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:44,670
If so, I will meet him myself.

676
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:56,030
Your Highness. Why do you wish to know what happened in Byeokcheon 10 years ago?

677
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,070
If you find out... what will you do about it?

678
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:05,700
If something is wrong, I will have to fix it.

679
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:11,790
If someone were framed, I would clear their name and if someone was hurt,

680
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:13,890
I will comfort them.

681
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:15,570
Also...

682
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:19,330
if someone needs to be punished,

683
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:23,310
they shall be punished.

684
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:29,850
And along with that...

685
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:37,140
Is there another order you wish to give me?

686
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,320
Find me a house.

687
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:44,520
Somewhere not too far from Manyeondang of Jangtongbang.

688
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,440
It will be a place to educate children,

689
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,680
so the living room has to be big and bright

690
