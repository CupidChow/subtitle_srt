[The use of animals during filming was done with props or special effects.]

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,180
What is wrong with you?

10
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,830
I had no idea you were taking medicine with white Atractylodes and its root.

11
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,530
I did not know that you would die if you eat a peach with it.

12
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,030
If I knew... If I knew...

13
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,780
If I knew...

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,890
I would never have given you a peach!

15
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,070
Mother, I gave it to him!

16
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,550
I gave Hyungnim the peach–

17
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,380
What are you talking about?

18
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,460
Do you really want to die?

19
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,280
Your Highness! His Majesty is here.

20
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,980
Your Majesty. Greetings.

21
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,210
What is going on? What happened?

22
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,440
Why were you covering the Grand Prince's mouth?

23
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,580
It is nothing, Father.

24
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,280
The Grand Prince was speaking nonsensically because he was not able to sleep.

25
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,150
It appears the Grand Prince is hallucinating.

26
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,340
What do you mean, hallucinations?

27
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,770
What did you see?

28
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,820
He kept saying that he saw a burning oyat tree.

29
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,360
He is burning up with a fever.

30
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,190
That is why he sees hallucinations.

31
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,900
It is because he has grown weak.

32
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,180
The plum tree being set on fire was not due to the curse of the ghost of Song.

33
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,680
It will not do for a man to be so weak of heart.

34
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,880
I heard he has been talking nonsense and throwing up what he ate.

35
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,330
What kind of nonsense is he saying?

00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,250
[Episode 16]

37
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:03,000
Your Highness. May I ask who will be the woman who will live in this house?

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,270
This house will be used as a school to teach children.

39
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,170
Furnish that upper deck with desks.

40
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,860
- Giyeok!
- Giyeok!

41
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,900
- Kieuk!
- Kieuk!

42
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,960
- Digeut!
 - Digeut!

43
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,420
By chance, is the woman who will live here Eunuch Go?

44
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,720
Does she not have a fiance?

45
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,480
Did she say she would not return to the Sergeant?

46
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,580
She says that she will not return to him and live by herself.

47
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,060
Gosh, she is quite an incredible girl–

48
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,860
Woman.

49
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,450
Marriage is a covenant between two families.

50
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,610
Not return to him when the marriage acceptance letters have been exchanged already...

51
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,660
What did she say was her reason?

52
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,410
I am in love with someone else.

53
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,110
I have someone I secretly love.

54
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,870
That is why I cannot go to him.

55
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:26,670
By chance, have you seen Soon Dol meet another man?

56
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,330
Pardon?

57
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,400
The only people she would meet were either palace ladies or eunuchs,

58
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,470
so if you can think of eunuchs as men, then I suppose so.

59
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,550
What I mean is,

60
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,750
have you seen her meet a man in private,

61
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,040
consistently,

62
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,710
personally, just the two of them by themselves?

63
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,530
- I have!
- Who is he?

64
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,920
Is she not with you all the time like that?

65
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,580
Not me. Someone who is really stupid.

66
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,570
A dimwit who is smart but lacks awareness.

67
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,230
Pardon?

68
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,580
Forget it.

69
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,380
Never mind.

70
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,020
What does it matter who that guy is...

71
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,290
Just fix the door.

72
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,940
You should take extra good care of him.

73
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,780
- He's your younger sibling.
- Yes, Father.

74
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,570
I will command the Royal Physician to take extra good care of him

75
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,820
so do not be too worried, Queen.

76
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,950
Yes, Your Majesty.

77
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,390
Oh, Mother!

78
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:57,170
Please escort her to the Queen's Palace. I will follow you.

79
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:02,390
No. I must stay by the Grand Prince's side.

80
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,800
That is what I will do.

81
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,070
Grand Prince.

82
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:18,590
I must know the truth in order for your mother to protect you, Grand Prince.

83
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:26,230
Did you really give a peach to Crown Prince Ui Hyeon?

84
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:31,300
Grandfather... gave me a peach.

85
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,100
[Three years ago]
Grandfather!

86
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,640
Wow, peaches!

87
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,730
Elder Hyungnim! Guess what is in my sleeve!

88
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,680
What have you hidden inside it this time?

89
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:59,420
This is yours, Elder Hyungnim, and this is mine.

90
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,480
It looks quite delicious.

91
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,220
Looking at the peaches reminded me of you!

92
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,860
He gave the peaches to me to share with Elder Hyungnim...

93
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,470
After the Elder Hyungnim ate that peach, he...

94
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,890
I heard what the eunuchs were saying.

95
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:19,730
The reason Elder Hyungnim passed away was because of a peach.

96
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:24,160
Younger Hyungnim did not give him a peach. It was me.

97
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,150
Because of the peach I gave him, Elder Hyungnim...

98
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,250
No.

99
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,690
It is not your fault.

100
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:37,530
Do not cry. You did not know anything.

101
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,490
All you did was carry out what Grandfather told you to do.

102
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,790
Pay attention and listen carefully to what your mother is saying.

103
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:46,100
You must never speak of such things ever again.

104
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,700
This never happened. It was just a dream.

105
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,590
You only dreamed of such a thing.

106
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,760
You have never done something like that.

107
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,880
You must forget it.

108
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,250
You must forget it so that you can live.

109
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:01,170
You must live in order for your mother to live as well.

110
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,350
Answer me.

111
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:09,550
Tell me that you will not ever speak of this again!

112
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,270
Yes, Mother.

113
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,570
I will go to my orabeoni.

114
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,040
His Highness is not here right now.

115
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,140
He is currently reading in the library,

116
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,320
but he ordered us not to let anyone enter the library.

117
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,920
I see.

118
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,900
- Never mind. Perhaps this is for the best.
- Pardon?

119
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,610
Do not tell Orabeoni that I came by.

120
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,580
Eunuch Go, follow me.

121
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,340
Pardon?

122
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,080
The Grand Prince said such a thing?

123
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,580
What do you think happened?

124
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,580
You solved the Sabangahn case,

125
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,680
and I heard your wisdom played a big factor in proving the innocence of the Left State Minister.

126
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,020
Do you think what the Grand Prince said was true?

127
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,140
How could I know that?

128
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,360
Only the Grand Prince would know the truth-

129
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,580
However, when Crown Prince Ui Hyeon passed away, the Grand Prince was only seven years old.

130
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,850
And even if he did give him the peach, he would not have had any malicious intentions.

131
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,040
Would the intentions be important?

132
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,850
Once this comes to light, the entire palace will be in an uproar,

133
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,830
and I do not know if the Grand Prince will be safe.

134
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,270
I am sorry, Your Highness,

135
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:06,510
but I feel this is something you should tell His Highness.

136
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:10,730
So why did you say it was a good thing that His Highness was not in his chambers?

137
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,740
He will soon be married.

138
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,380
The Grand Prince has been saying nonsense like

139
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:19,680
seeing a ghost and a snake, and now he says he gave a peach to Crown Prince Ui Hyeon.

140
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,110
How could everything that he says be true?

141
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,740
It would just trouble Orabeoni for no reason.

142
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,510
He says he sees a ghost and a snake?

143
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,230
He saw a snake come out from the head shaman's body.

144
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,740
He already gets easily scared, so how shocked must he have been?

145
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,060
No. Never mind.

146
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,110
My mind was so chaotic. I should not have told you.

147
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,890
Do not tell His Highness about this.

148
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:47,120
You, too, should forget this.

149
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,720
Yes, Your Highness.

150
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,020
Scholar Park–

151
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,950
Is Young Master Kim inside?

152
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:28,320
Yes, but... he wrote down what we discussed on a big piece of paper,

153
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,910
and he keeps staring at it without even eating.

154
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,490
He will soon figure out the answer.

155
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,320
But what brings you here?

156
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,590
Is this not the fabric for woman's clothing?

157
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,660
How many dresses would you be able to make with this?

158
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:55,920
Well, if you do not waste any fabric, you could probably make about 6 or 7 outfits...

159
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,150
I mean, how would a man like me know that...

160
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:05,370
but my mother does sewing work, so I am telling you this from having seen her work.

161
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:09,520
Then make some woman's clothing for me with this fabric.

162
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,970
Make about five dresses for Min Jae Yi and make two dresses for yourself.

163
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,600
If you lack fabric, then I will get you some more.

164
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:22,850
Wait... how will I know that murderer, Maiden Min Jae Yi?

165
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:28,530
Also, why do you tell me to use this fabric to make dresses for me when I am a man? Gosh.

166
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,850
I know that you are Jang Ga Ram—

167
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,460
I-I am sorry, Scholar Sir.

168
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,970
- Then...
- I also know that Go Soon Dol

169
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,920
is Min Jae Yi.

170
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,870
Watch yourself.

171
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:55,190
Do not go around by yourself, but always go with your master.

172
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,890
Is not a capture-and-return order out for you?

173
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,620
But...

174
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:08,630
why are you having clothes made for My Lady?

175
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:13,810
When everything is resolved, will she not have to return to her life?

176
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,290
How long can she stay in the palace wearing a eunuch uniform?

177
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,500
And the same goes for you as well.

178
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,730
How long can you live wearing a man's clothes?

179
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,630
Why are you blocking the road?

180
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,960
I mean, you can just pass through this way...

181
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,210
We always stick to the side of this house when we pass by.

182
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:58,080
The Grand Prince has been saying nonsense like seeing a ghost and a snake,

183
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,580
and now he says he gave a peach to Crown Prince Ui Hyeon.

184
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,670
Is he truly speaking nonsense?

185
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,680
Your Highness, welcome. You have returned.

186
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,170
Sit down.

187
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,420
How come you did not take me with you? Going out of the palace with the Guardian Warrior is dangerous.

188
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,660
I have not stopped being suspicious of him yet.

189
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:40,800
It is all right. Have I not returned safely without any problems?

190
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,500
So where did you go?

191
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:55,710
When you cross the Tongun Bridge from Jangtong-bang and take a left at the first fork in the road,

192
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:59,950
you will see a quiet tile-roofed house. That place is...

193
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:12,060
Who is it? Who is the dimwit you are in love with?

194
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,700
Are you asking me that again?

195
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,960
Are you sure you are even in love with him?

196
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:21,330
Tell me who it is that you ended up loving him.

197
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:27,240
If I were to send you to him, should I not know what kind of a man he is?

198
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:33,000
If he really is a stupid dimwit like you say he is, would someone sharp like you have fallen in love with him?

199
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,690
If you cannot tell me his name,

200
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:39,510
tell me why you ended up secretly loving him.

201
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:43,620
He is tall and handsome.

202
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,210
I guess you do not know that a good-looking man could cost you heartache.

203
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,640
Also, how could you look at just his external appearance?

204
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,560
He also excels in both pen and sword.

205
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,330
Also, that man

206
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:03,810
possesses inner fortitude and overcomes all sorts of hardships.

207
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:08,730
He learned the basics of medicine that can save a life, despite others looking down upon it.

208
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:14,150
He is also a warm and compassionate person and is considerate.

209
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:19,540
Even though you may be wearing a man's clothes, I have never forgotten that you are a woman.

210
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,820
He is a reliable man who knows to protect a woman walking by herself at night.

211
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:28,830
Did you say that Joseon does not tell a girl, "Yes, you can. Do it. Try it"?

212
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:34,130
As the one who will become my first people, I will give all of those permissions.

213
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:38,170
Yes, you can. Do it. Try it.

214
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:43,010
He is someone who opens a new path

215
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:47,740
for a woman who is stuck, blocked by a high wall.

216
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,710
Where is such a man like that? He is someone who might show up in fantasy novels on the streets?

217
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,340
There is a man like that!

218
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:07,150
I am saying that he is a dimwit for not knowing he is that kind of a man.

219
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,540
Go away.

220
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:16,320
- Pardon?
- I was going to give you a great gift to you today, but I just cannot because I do not like this.

221
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,750
How could you do that? You should give me what you were going to give me. What kind of gift is it?

222
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,820
I told you to go away.

223
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,880
D-D-Do you like it?

224
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,150
It is beautiful.

225
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,420
This is why people talk about Goryeo celadon so much.

226
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,520
Oh, yes!

227
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,460
Gosh, if I just did not break that white porcelain last time,

228
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:46,170
I would have given you celadon pottery to place on your right and white porcelain to place on your left.

229
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,840
Gosh, because of that lowly young bastard...

230
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,390
You can bring it next time.

231
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,280
It would be great if I could place...

232
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,400
white porcelain right next to this celadon pottery.

233
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,880
What would be an appropriate way

234
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,940
for me to kill that evil and wretched man?

235
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,950
The time will come soon, Your Highness.

236
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:32,640
He dares to use even my son for his greed...

237
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,280
That he would put blood on that young child's hands when he was only seven...

238
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,660
I will... have him torn apart from limb to limb.

239
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,730
He will have no burial place under heaven.

240
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,250
I will throw his flesh and bones as food for the animals.

241
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:59,480
The children of that wicked man will be ashamed of their father's name,

242
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:05,720
and the whole world will spit at the mention of his name.

243
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,580
Even if I were to die and become a ghost,

244
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:16,130
I will not... forgive him.

245
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:24,730
Do so, Your Highness. It will be as you have said.

246
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,650
Well, Hyungnim. Have you heard?

247
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:35,490
I heard that the Han family of Youngsan sent someone as a Queen Selection candidate.

248
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:39,760
Of course, I heard. Do you think anything happens in Hangyang that I do not know about?

249
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,070
Will it be okay to let that happen?

250
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:46,390
If the Crown Princess ends up coming from the Han family of Youngsan, gosh...

251
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,850
If the Han family of Youngsan fully supports the Crown Prince...

252
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:54,060
Gosh, would it be easy to depose the Crown Prince?

253
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,630
I have a plan for everything.

254
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:03,430
I hold the card that would disable the Han family of Youngsan from protecting the Crown Prince.

255
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,790
- Shall I show you my plan?
- Yes.

256
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:09,830
Since you brought me the celadon pottery, I will show you my plan.

257
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,180
- Wait.
- You will know when the time comes.

258
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:31,240
Your Excellency, you have a guest.

259
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:38,280
Your Excellency, I, Jo Han Seo, offer you my greetings.

260
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,030
What brings you here?

261
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,090
Gosh, look who this is!

262
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:46,340
Is this not the commander who came all the way to Byeokcheon to rescue me?

263
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:50,260
Gosh, it is so good to see you!

264
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:57,030
Wait, I believe you are my great-great-grandfather's cousin's grandson's uncle's son. Right, right!

265
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:00,200
Minister of Justice, you are a hyungnim twelve times removed from me.

266
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:06,500
Yes, if we are twelve times removed cousins, we are pretty close, are we not? Is that not so, Hyungnim?

267
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,640
- So what brings you here?
- The thing is...

268
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,290
Speak. It is all right.

269
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:17,640
Do you remember Park Han Soo, who was one of the commanders at the time?

270
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,650
Not too long ago, I met him.

271
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,650
This is of utmost importance, so I cannot speak it rashly.

272
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,780
The whole world will be turned upside down.

273
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,930
Are you not curious about what words will come from my lips?

274
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:30,310
Please tell him that I said that.

275
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,260
He said something like that?

276
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,650
Your Excellency, he is full of spite, barely hanging on the edge

277
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:40,040
barely hanging on the edge from wasting all his money on gambling.

278
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,660
If he exposes what happened in Byeokcheon...

279
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,610
No, no! That cannot be!

280
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:50,110
Hyungnim, what does he know about that he is rambling on like that?

281
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:53,690
What do we do if he goes somewhere and starts talking about those things?

282
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:57,090
We cannot let something like that happen.

283
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:10,250
This is the transaction record of the landlord who sold the land around Mapo to Park Han Soo ten years ago.

284
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,900
It shows that Park Han Soo made the transaction using certified promissory notes

285
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,210
under Jo Won Bo, the household manager of the Jo family of Seongju.

286
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:19,030
It is the only corroborative evidence that proves the connection between

287
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:21,070
Park Han Soo and the Jo family of Seongju.

288
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,950
What is Park Han Soo doing these days?

289
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,790
He is still going around gambling houses drunk.

290
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,710
I must meet him in person.

291
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:32,090
Since we have corroborative evidence, I must ask him

292
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:37,170
what transaction took place that the Right State Minister gave him so much money.

293
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,940
Your Highness.

294
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,920
Your opponent is the Jo family of Seongju.

295
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,560
I fear that your safety may be at risk

296
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,000
after going up against them, Your Highness.

297
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,560
If that happens, you can protect me.

298
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:01,010
How could you trust me so steadfastly?

299
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:07,100
You have never let me down.

300
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,760
So, how could I not trust you?

301
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:17,070
I will... never betray your trust, Your Highness.

302
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,110
You must watch out for this man.

303
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,810
You must distance yourself from him! You must oust him!

304
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,690
The herald who came to Gaeseong was him.

305
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,500
I am not confused. My memories are clear.

306
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:42,750
The one who shot the arrow at you a year ago would have been possible because it was him.

307
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,820
Are you outside, Gap Soo?

308
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:58,840
Did you call for me, Your Excellency?

309
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,710
Find the man named Park Han Soo.

310
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:04,450
Since he goes around gambling houses, you should be able to find him pretty easily.

311
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:10,000
Since he says he has something to tell me, should I not hear him out, at least?

312
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,260
Shall I drag him here?

313
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,590
Make about five dresses for Min Jae Yi, and make two dresses for yourself.

314
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,790
Since this is something that a scholar of high standing brought,

315
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:55,880
you probably cannot find a fabric like this on these streets here.

316
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,410
Please change them into these.

317
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:01,870
All right. Let us take a look.

318
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:04,570
Hey! Give me more! More!

319
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,730
It is such a valuable fabric!

320
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,830
You should at least give me this much!

321
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,890
All right!

322
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:22,940
Wait... You are...

323
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,900
Who are you?

324
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:31,040
Hey, why did you leave without your fabric? Sir!

325
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:45,060
Sir, where are you going?

326
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,530
Sir. What is the matter?

327
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,680
- I am sure it was her.
- Pardon?

328
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,660
Whom did you see?

329
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,580
The maidservant at the Governor's private residence in Gaeseong.

330
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,950
I saw that maidservant.

331
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:05,000
She should've become a government servant if she is that family's maidservant.

332
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,700
That is what I mean.

333
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,060
How is she in Hanyang dressed up as a man?

334
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,810
Gosh, you probably saw it wrong.

335
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:14,060
Maybe it was someone who looked like her.

336
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:35,810
Meo Roo, Dal Rae.

337
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,120
Come here.

338
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,670
It is the student of Manyeondang.

339
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,280
Let me take a look at you.

340
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,060
Stand up straight.

341
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,480
All right.

342
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,430
Your height is about this tall.

343
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,550
Dal Rae, you should come here, too.

344
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:52,650
Dal Rae is about this tall.

345
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,920
Now, stretch out your arms.

346
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,200
Like this. Dal Rae, you, too.

347
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,570
What are you doing?

348
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:09,510
I got some nice fabric, so I will ask my mother to make your clothes.

349
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,910
- Really?
- Yes.

350
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:16,960
But Mother and Father recently bought us new clothes.

351
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,730
Of course, they did.

352
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:22,700
But is it not always good to have more clothes?

353
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,170
Thank you. I do not know what to say.

354
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,880
Are you sending things to your hometown again?

355
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,960
- Yes.
- You two are really amazing.

356
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,230
That you would work day and night to take care of your family in your hometown...

357
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,320
Where is your hometown?

358
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:47,240
Well, it is such a small, faraway place that you would not know even if I told you.

359
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,930
Help me with this.

360
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:07,740
You asked me if the Byeokcheon people are all bandits, right?

361
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,370
That is not true.

362
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:13,260
Byeokcheon people are not bandits.

363
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,540
How do you know that?

364
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:19,150
Then, can I tell people that my hometown is Byeokcheon now?

365
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:24,730
If someone... asks where your hometown is, you do not need to tell them it is Byeokcheon.

366
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:29,220
However, you should not be ashamed of coming from Byeokcheon.

367
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:33,170
Among the people of Byeokcheon, there were no bandits.

368
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,760
How could it be a sin to be born in Byeokcheon?

369
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,800
Just for being born in that land,

370
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,860
if they accuse you of being a thief, point fingers at you, and discriminate against you,

371
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:44,240
those people are the ones to blame. It is not your fault.

372
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,140
But everyone hates people from Byeokcheon.

373
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,900
Even the King hates the Byeokcheon people,

374
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,720
Byeokcheon people cannot even take the State Exam.

375
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,750
Not everyone hates Byeokcheon people.

376
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,210
Look at the handsome scholars who brought you here.

377
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:05,890
Did they not help you even though they knew you were from Byeokcheon?

378
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:06,940
That is right.

379
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:11,210
Manyeondang's young master and his student said they would make clothes for us.

380
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:15,070
By chance, have you ever been to Byeokcheon?

381
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:19,360
A lot of affectionate people lived there together.

382
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:25,690
Although government officials came barging in to take this and that,

383
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:32,280
they barely managed to survive with a gaunt appearance and empty stomachs.

384
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:38,060
But they knew how to share even a bean with one another.

385
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,380
The people of Byeokcheon.

386
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:43,850
I saw government officials beat the people of Byeokcheon.

387
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:46,920
Do you remember anything from Byeokcheon?

388
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,350
When it was spring, dandelions would bloom in the fields,

389
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:53,820
and the whole village would be filled with a warm color.

390
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:57,730
I remember blowing those dandelions with my friend.

391
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,380
By chance,

392
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:06,870
do you remember... your friend's name?

393
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,980
Oh Wol?

394
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,440
I am...

395
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,660
I am Oh Wol's mother.

396
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,300
Hey!

397
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,580
If my Oh Wol did not die and was alive,

398
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:59,530
she would have grown tall like you.

399
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:03,280
Then, do you know our parents as well?

400
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,070
Of course, we know them.

401
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:09,590
When you were born, your father planted a royal foxglove tree in the front yard.

402
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:13,290
He said he would make you a wardrobe when you got married...

403
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,340
I was right beside him then.

404
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:33,460
Do you remember anything else about Byeokcheon?

405
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,820
I remember a fish.

406
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,420
It was a redfish.

407
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:40,210
We prayed to that fish.

408
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:42,910
I heard it was a thousand-year-old fish.

409
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:48,670
I heard my mother's mother's mother also prayed there.

410
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,040
Goodness.

411
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,070
That she would remember that fish...

412
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:57,560
I heard that fish ate the blood of human beings.

413
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,030
Dummy. How does that make sense?

414
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,870
What could a fish eat human blood?

415
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:05,330
Also, how can a fish live a thousand years?

416
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,690
It was probably that fish's descendant.

417
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:10,550
No. That fish does not have offspring.

418
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:14,910
Because although it lays eggs, the eggs do not hatch into fish.

419
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:17,230
Come on, how could you believe that?

420
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,420
That egg is really dangerous.

421
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:22,460
If a person eats that egg, they will go crazy.

422
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,530
Do the two of you know this story, too?

423
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:27,850
Yes. There was a fish like that in Byeokcheon.

424
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:32,820
I heard from my mother that it was a fish brought by a monk from a faraway land.

425
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,690
Supposedly, it really was a thousand-year-old fish.

426
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:38,880
You see. You do not even know anything.

427
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,280
The first round of selection is happening today.

428
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:04,440
That is why all the impressive ladies from all eight provinces of Joseon are here.

429
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,100
But the rumor says there is a lady who was already selected internally.

430
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,230
Apparently, she is from the Han family of Yeongsan.

431
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:14,470
Have you not heard that it is a lady from the Left State Minister's family?

432
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,640
The Left State Minister?

433
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:29,480
Will you just sit back and watch?

434
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,870
The Left State Minister could not have gotten involved in the selection without any plan.

435
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:35,310
- He must have had something to rely on–
- Come on! Seriously...

436
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:39,180
Do you think the Queen will want the Han family of Yeongsan as her royal relative?

437
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,380
You are so thoughtless.

438
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,610
Also, Hyungnim must have it all figured out.

439
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:46,610
Just be quiet and watch.

440
00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:00,040
Minister, how come you are back in the office already?

441
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,110
Did you really request Gibok?*
(Breaking the rule of not holding a position while mourning)

442
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:05,500
The royal marriage that determines the country's well-being is approaching.

443
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,750
I cannot keep mourning my dead child.

444
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:12,380
Did you send her off well?

445
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:17,770
Yes. Thanks to your help, I put the grave in a mountain that has a good spirit.

446
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,530
However, Your Excellency,

447
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:26,740
I heard a strange rumor when I went to Jangju to find a grave for my daughter.

448
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:45,260
You must feel quite pressured.

449
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,830
You did it out of loyalty. What could I do even if it went wrong?

450
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:53,280
How could I not know about your unyielding loyalty?

451
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,420
However, I am afraid you might get hurt

452
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,980
by carrying all the weight on your own.

453
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:05,350
Her heart must be even heavier.

454
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:09,670
But she is a strong child. I am sure she will hang in there.

455
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,060
Yes.

456
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,530
Han Joong Seop's house is in Jangju, as you know.

457
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:23,290
The rumor was that his wife had died.

458
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:27,610
If someone died, they should have announced the death–

459
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:32,350
Could it have been because they wanted to apply for the selection...

460
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:37,640
In order to become the crown princess, both of her parents have to be alive!

461
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:42,640
A woman who does not meet the criteria cannot even apply for the selection!

462
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:47,930
If they applied by hiding the fact that they disqualify,

463
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:51,820
it means that the high and mighty Han family of Yeongsan

464
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:54,670
lied to the country, does it not?

465
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:58,250
Apparently, they snuck the body out at night

466
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:01,040
and buried her without even putting up a gravestone.

467
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,260
But it is just a rumor among the servants.

468
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,640
I am not certain whether the rumor is true or not.

469
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,760
It is something we just need to find out about.

470
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:17,200
The Han family of Yeongsan volunteered to destroy themselves like this!

471
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,260
What a blessing this is!

472
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:27,180
What is this? What a strange lady.

473
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:30,250
- She kept this until it attracted bugs–
- What is going on?

474
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,920
Sir.

475
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:37,340
We kept seeing bugs in the Jangju lady's room while cleaning, so we looked through her stuff and...

476
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,720
we found this mugwort.

477
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,630
I think the dried mugwort absorbed moisture and attracted bugs.

478
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,950
It indeed belongs to her. Dry it well and put it back.

479
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,640
Yes.

480
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,000
She burns mugwort every night?

481
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,600
Gosh...

482
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,210
it is not like she is mourning.

483
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:57,040
"Mourning"?

484
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,760
How could you say something like that?

485
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,390
Why would So Eun need to mourn any dead person?

486
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:05,550
But she burns mugwort facing North every night.

487
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,900
Is that not strange?

488
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,940
Come on! She is going to be the Crown Prince's wife.

489
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,510
Do not run your mouth like that.

490
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:25,350
Yeon Ha of the Shim family.

491
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:37,380
So Eun of the Han family.

492
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,300
Gyeong In of the Ham family.

493
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,380
The first round of selection is happening today.

494
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:04,310
That is why all the impressive ladies from all eight provinces of Joseon are here.

495
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:09,870
Where is he going at this hour?

496
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,840
I know!

497
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,680
I am sorry! Are you all right?

498
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,000
I am sorry.

499
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,750
Hey!

500
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,270
"Hey"?

501
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:23,460
Seriously, that little...

502
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:27,460
Do you not know I am above you?

503
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:30,020
Are you fearless now that you are a woman in the eunuch's uniform?

504
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,810
I am the guardian warrior of the seventh rank.

505
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:33,550
You are a maintenance eunuch of the eighth rank.

506
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,470
How dare you "Hey" me like that?

507
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,560
Why did you pass the Royal Kitchen just now?

508
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,410
Why would I go there? I am coming from the Royal Bodyguard Unit.

509
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:44,370
I definitely saw you near the Royal Kitchen.

510
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:50,030
Sure. I must have walked by the Royal Kitchen since you insist.

511
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,730
Do you think that is the only place I passed?

512
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:54,240
I walked around Mt. Geumgang this morning

513
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,990
and I went to Mt. Jiri at midday.

514
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,760
I am about to go to Gaeseong now.

515
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,090
According to you, I should be able to travel that distance in a minute.

516
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:05,210
How annoying.

517
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,540
I definitely saw him.

518
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,720
I could not even win once. Not even once.

519
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,150
Who are you?

520
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:07,290
You wanted to see the Right State Minister, did you not?

521
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:09,790
His Excellency sent me.

522
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:12,040
I knew he would be looking for me.

523
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,840
Let us go!

524
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:22,640
I am sorry, but I need to check first if what you need to say

525
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,110
is worthy of His Excellency's time.

526
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:30,540
How could I trust you and reveal everything right now?

527
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,020
Let us go. I will see him first–

528
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:39,020
Tell His Excellency that the girl from the Song family of Byeokcheon is alive.

529
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,850
Tell him that I know who that girl is.

530
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:47,870
I definitely saw her coming out of the Right State Minister's house and getting on a carriage.

531
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:50,590
If His Excellency hears where that

532
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:56,960
carriage was headed to, he would be shocked.

533
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:04,510
I will relay your message to His Excellency.

534
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:10,050
Also... I will tell you about the order he gave me, too.

535
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:11,360
Listen carefully.

536
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:15,890
What is the use of bringing that blabbermouth here?

537
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:23,150
When he finishes talking, cut his throat.

538
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:31,360
I am sure he is bringing up something insignificant trying to leech off the Jo family of Seongju.

539
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:37,560
He is less than a bug. Why let him live?

540
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,980
We are late.

541
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:01,110
Park Han Soo apparently left a moment ago.

542
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,680
I should go to his house.

543
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:27,970
It is Park Han Soo.

544
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,970
Look! Wake up!

545
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:43,050
Who hurt you?

546
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:45,400
Was it the Right State Minister?

547
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:50,880
Who... sent you here?

548
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,140
Tell me. What exactly happened in Byeokcheon?

549
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:57,520
What are they trying to hide by doing this to you?

550
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:02,180
Ten years ago, in Byeokcheon,

551
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:08,700
there was no such thing as a flag for a new country at all.

552
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:14,250
What we saw was... a white flag.

553
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:16,420
The people of Byeokcheon...

554
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:23,580
Those foolish people... put up a white flag without knowing they would die.

555
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,740
They were just sitting in the government office like fools.

556
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,550
They...

557
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,050
They tried to hide that.

558
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:39,150
That is why they paid the officials.

559
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:42,610
But there is something the Right State Minister does not know.

560
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:44,710
A woman...

561
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,160
from the Song family is in the palace.

562
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,960
A woman from the Song family is...

563
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:19,760
A woman from the Song family came out of my house and got on a carriage?

564
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,380
Crazy bastard.

565
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,810
He must be really out of his mind.

566
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:30,350
He tried to get money from me by making that up?

567
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:51,550
A woman from the Song family is in the palace?

568
00:45:54,390 --> 00:46:00,380
The woman wearing a hood, the shaman of the Shamanist Bureau mentioned.

569
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:04,190
That woman must be the wife of the Song family.

570
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,910
But how could a wife of the Song family be able to enter the palace?

571
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:10,830
She cannot have become a court lady, can she?

572
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:15,020
A married woman cannot become a court lady.

573
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:25,710
Get out of my chamber right now!

574
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:27,120
I do not want the medicine or the acupuncture!

575
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,380
Get Elder Hyungnim out of here!

576
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:32,890
Your Highness, please calm down!

577
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:34,420
He must have gone insane.

578
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:37,670
Get the ghost out of here! Immediately!

579
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,160
Your Highness! We deserve to die!

580
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,290
Your Highness, what do you mean a ghost...

581
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:46,110
By "Elder Hyungnim," you mean...

582
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:01,080
- What is the matter?
- Noonim!

583
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:05,240
I cannot live here! Elder Hyungnim is...

584
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,780
there...

585
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:08,800
He is right there.

586
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,870
Can you not see him?

587
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:14,790
He is staring at me right there!

588
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:39,630
I heard you sent the lunch back, too.

589
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:44,320
Stop worrying about Grand Prince and start taking care of yourself.

590
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,040
I am sorry, Princess.

591
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:54,890
I feel like I always... make you worry.

592
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:02,710
Your Highness, it was not the Grand Prince.

593
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:05,470
He could not have given Crown Prince Ui Hyeon the peach.

594
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:07,210
He is a kind and docile kid.

595
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:10,590
How could he do something like that?

596
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:15,740
He just said that because of the fever.

597
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:20,690
There have been so many rumors since Crown Prince Ui Hyeon passed.

598
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:23,100
You are aware of that, too.

599
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:27,650
He must have heard the rumor that the Crown Prince gave Elder Orabeoni the peach.

600
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:29,680
That must be why he said that.

601
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:34,370
Having that rumor about the Crown Prince suffocates me, too.

602
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:38,270
But now even the Grand Prince... I am afraid, Princess.

603
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:40,650
Do not worry, Your Highness.

604
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:45,290
I will make sure to cure the Grand Prince.

605
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:47,770
He is my only younger sibling.

606
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:50,170
Princess.

607
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:52,680
Thank you.

608
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,000
Do not mention it.

609
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:59,690
When my mother... passed away,

610
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:04,250
you mourned without eating or changing for three days.

611
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:08,340
And when I got smallpox, you set the young Grand Prince aside

612
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:13,050
and took care of me by staying by my side.

613
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,580
How could I forget that?

614
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:21,020
It was my duty.

615
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:25,430
Any mother... Any mother would have done that.

616
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:28,460
Yes, that is true.

617
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:33,660
So I will protect you and the Grand Prince as well.

618
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,610
Do not worry.

619
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:38,070
Princess.

620
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:42,970
Thank you for considering me as your mother.

621
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:46,480
You gave birth to my younger brother.

622
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,340
You are my mother as well.

623
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,320
Please take extra care of Mother.

624
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:27,590
Would it be okay to leave Princess like that?

625
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:31,670
Should I give her to the Chief State Minister?

626
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:33,810
Just leave it.

627
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:37,580
I will do it myself.

628
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:50,790
A woman from the Song family came out of my house and got on a carriage?

629
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:55,720
A woman from the Song family...

630
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:09,410
How did a woman from the Song family come to my house and if she did,

631
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:12,390
could she have left alive?

632
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:32,730
Oh Man Shik said something similar in Paju once, too.

633
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:35,770
It reeked of blood everywhere.

634
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:38,090
The father died, the mother died,

635
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:40,720
the son died, and the daughter died.

636
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,590
Because of your father's order!

637
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:45,850
None of them were a bandit.

638
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:48,130
Just as Oh Man Shik said,

639
00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:51,600
if there were no bandits in Byeokcheon from the beginning, and just as Park Han Soo said,

640
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,920
if there was a white flag when the soldiers arrived, they were not bandits.

641
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,940
They were just the people of the country.

642
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:01,570
If the people put up the white flag and waited for the royal forces at the government office–

643
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:04,940
At least, they could not have been the bandits

644
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:08,580
who were treacherous to start a new country, as the Diaries of the Royal Secretariat said.

645
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:12,030
If they put up a white flag and waited for the royal force...

646
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:15,800
They must have asked to be rescued.

647
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,440
If that were true,

648
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:22,520
the report from the Minister of Justice, Jo Won Oh, the governor of Byeokcheon

649
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:27,700
and Right State Minister's report, which said he subjugated Byeokcheon and the people there were traitors.

650
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:31,060
All of that was a lie!

651
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:35,940
We must find the remnants to find out the truth about Byeokcheon from ten years ago.

652
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:39,360
If Park Han Soo was right about the wife of the Song family being in the palace,

653
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,200
there must be a way to find out.

654
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,520
Even if she were in the palace, she must have changed her identity already.

655
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,490
Perhaps...

656
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:53,260
she left when the palace workers from Byeokcheon were expelled recently.

657
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:36,120
[Princess Ha Yeon]

658
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:49,230
Song. Ga. Myeol. Yi!

659
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:53,200
The Song family will destroy the Yi family!

660
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:09,080
How could he believe something like that to be true?

661
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,300
Was he possessed by a ghost or something?

662
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:18,070
Could Young really have been possessed by something and be mistaken about his relationship with me?

663
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:20,050
Why did he kill my family?

664
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:22,530
He wasn't even from Byeokcheon.

665
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:24,300
Why?

666
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:42,550
[Showing up in the East and then in the West...]

667
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:47,410
Showing up in the East and then in the West.

668
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:54,450
He is in the East and in the West as well.

669
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:22,060
[Assassinate Princess Ha Yeon]

670
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,390
There is someone who could cure the Grand Prince?

671
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:40,410
Yes, according to what I heard from other court ladies,

672
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:44,500
a monk with a special power that gives peace to people

673
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:48,840
who are grief-stricken, just arrived in the capital recently.

674
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,900
So he is not a physician.

675
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:54,820
That is why... I am worried.

676
00:55:54,820 --> 00:56:00,820
Using... sorcery might cause us trouble.

677
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:04,680
We cannot just leave Grand Prince like that.

678
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,780
The medicine from the physician does not even work.

679
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,550
I will be responsible for everything.

680
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:12,510
I will save the Grand Prince.

681
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:16,760
Does Mother know about this, too?

682
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,370
If you make up your mind, I will let her know.

683
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:21,690
You cannot.

684
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:26,500
Mother is too fainthearted to allow sorcery from outside of the palace.

685
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,110
This must stay between you and me.

686
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:30,690
Do you understand?

687
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:32,200
Yes, Your Highness.

688
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:36,040
Also, they must not find out who we are, either.

689
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,050
That would be out of the question.

690
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:40,650
Do not worry about that.

691
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:46,330
But... there is no way for him to enter the palace.

692
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:48,150
I will find a way.

693
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:50,450
You should try contacting him.

694
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:52,730
Every minute counts.

695
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:01,810
By chance... do you have a solution?

696
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:05,690
I do, but...

697
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:41,240
[Assassinate Princess Ha Yeon]

698
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:05,230
Do you see how cleanly and perfectly I sorted everything out?

699
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:10,260
I even found out about the things you did not tell me and summarized everything.

700
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:16,390
No matter how you try to leave me out, there is no use at all.

701
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:19,310
We all work for His Highness together.

702
00:58:19,310 --> 00:58:21,960
How come the three of you chitter-chatter behind my back?

703
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,990
What do you mean, "chitter-chatter"?

704
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:29,820
- Oh, was it... jibber-jabber then?
- Seriously!

705
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:32,330
We were going to tell you when things become clearer.

706
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:33,650
I will keep an eye on you, Friend.

707
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:37,960
Do not ever try to leave me out!

708
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,660
There is a secret I found out about.

709
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:44,690
Yes, let us talk about that later. I will go first.

710
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,900
The Guardian Warrior.

711
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,520
He shows up in the East and then in the West.

712
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,650
Is that not strange?

713
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:07,370
Noonim, where are we going?

714
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:10,680
I am scared.

715
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:15,830
Do not worry.

716
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:19,300
You just need to trust me.

717
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:32,080
The air is cold at night.

718
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,170
Princess.

719
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:41,300
Did she dress warmly?

720
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:55,250
He showed up in Gaeseong, and he was at the palace at the same time.

721
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:58,240
Even when the red letters that said "Song Ga Myeol Yi" were spread,

722
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:03,970
we were definitely with him, and he was at the palace, too.

723
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:05,400
That is so strange.

724
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:11,330
How could a person show up here and there, too?

725
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:15,450
Right? Right?

726
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:16,750
What is wrong?

727
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:20,270
How could one person show up in multiple places at once?

728
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:22,510
Sir, where should I put this?

729
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:25,060
Put the pot in the kitchen.

730
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:28,530
- It is late of night. Hurry!
- Yes!

731
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:49,410
There are two Tae Kangs.

732
01:00:49,410 --> 01:00:53,550
Do you mean the Guardian Warrior has two bodies?

733
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:56,330
That is correct. He has two bodies.

734
01:00:56,330 --> 01:00:58,910
If there were two Tae Kangs,

735
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:04,810
one of them could have shot the Crown Prince and the other could have stayed by his side.

736
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,060
They are twins.

737
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:12,030
That is right. That would have been possible if they were twins.

738
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:14,430
[Showing up in the East and then in the West]

739
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:17,250
[The Guardian Warrior's face]

740
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,400
[Our Blooming Youth]

741
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:50,890
One of them was next to the Crown Prince and the other one, with the same face, is related to horrible crimes.

742
01:01:50,890 --> 01:01:52,350
They must be on the same side!

743
01:01:52,350 --> 01:01:54,080
Why are you doing this to me?

744
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,800
You mean it can control people's minds?

745
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:00,200
Your painful memories will disappear now.

746
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,880
Your Highness!

747
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,630
Someone tried to kill the princess and the grand prince of the country.

748
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:06,980
Father must know about this.

749
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:11,390
Crown Prince, how much did you find out?
