[Episode 11]
The year I turned two years old,

11
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,920
my father left that place to start his business, and my family followed him.

12
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,730
Thus, even though Byeokcheon is my hometown, I know nothing about that place.

13
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:33,610
The Crown Prince is calling in people from Byeokcheon to the Eastern Palace.

14
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,370
Still, if it is your father's hometown, you would have heard something about Byeokcheon.

15
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:44,730
I vaguely remember him saying that it was cold. Being located in northern Joseon,

16
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:51,420
its land was barren and located in the border town, so it was really hard to live there.

17
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,300

45
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,870
Hyungnim, you probably already know this,

46

but the rumor says the Crown Prince is bringing eunuchs and

47

court ladies from Byeokcheon into the Eastern Palace.

48
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,450
And that is not all.

49

As I was returning home, someone shot an arrow toward my palanquin,

50
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,100
and this was tied to it.

51
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,080
Take a look at it. "Du Guk Byeong Min." What bastard did this without having any fear?

How do I catch him so that I can relieve my anger?

You really don't know who those men are?

If you do not have any more questions, then I will be on my way.

74
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,210
It appears there is no one in the palace who knows anything useful.

75
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,950
There was no piece of information about Byeokcheon to take note of,

76
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:22,600
and none of them seemed to be lying.

77
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,400
Your Highness.

78
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,160
What are you trying to find out?

79
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,680
Bring a lantern and follow me.

80
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,710
Your Highness, are you going to the library?

81
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,210

82
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,480

83
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,620
Watch your step.

84
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,460
What in the world are you doing?

85
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:10,370
I tried to move this rock, fearing that you may hit it...

86
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,870
Thus, I am blocking it with my body.

87
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:25,170
You think that I will not see a rock this big?

88
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,710
Follow me.

89
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,180
If I did not watch out for you, you would most definitely have tripped over that rock, Your Highness.

90
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,950
What are you thinking so deeply about that you are not even responding—

91
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,010
While you are watching my steps, do you not watch your own?

92
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,180
Who cares about my step?

93
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,290
How come you are walking to and fro without any destination?

94
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,330
If you tell me the destination...

95
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:06,690
By chance, do you just want to stroll?

96
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,170
I get it now.

97
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,520
Meander all you want.

98
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,550
Go wherever you please, and walk as much as you want.

99
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:22,490
No matter where it is, I will escort you there until you say,

100
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,120
"I am done. That is enough."

101
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,690
Shine the way properly.

102
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,010
Understood, Your Highness.

103
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,960
Do you not find the Diaries of the Royal Secretariat strange?

104
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,210
What about it do you find strange?

105
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:01,130
The report of the Byeokcheon's governor Jo Won Oh.

106
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,970
The report of Jo Won Bo, who went out to suppress the rebellion.

107
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,780
That was it.

108
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,850
Is not the most important thing missing?

109
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:17,200
- You damn bastard!
- Die!

110
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,710
There was no record of an interrogation of Song.

111
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:26,640
For such a terrible crime, it is only natural to demonstrate the severity of the crime.

112
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,140
But there was no interrogation?

113
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,750
The rebels' leader was Byeokcheon's blacksmith, Song.
[Song]

114
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:39,590
About forty bandits led by him stormed the Byeokcheon government office,

115
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:43,050
and attacked the officials and soldiers.

116
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:49,080
Supposedly, by the time the Right State Minister arrived, the group of forty bandits

117
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,270
had already conquered five villages nearby and set up a new nation.

118
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,630
That means, in less than a month,

119
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:59,110
all the people of Byeokcheon turned into bandits and joined the rebellion.

120
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:02,210
Does that seem plausible?

121
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:05,150
- Is it not strange?
- But...

122
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:09,900
since it is written in the Diaries of the Royal Secretariat, would it not be true?

123
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,230
If...

124
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,300
that really is the truth...

125
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,190
What is wrong, Your Highness?

126
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,130
I hope that the ones who sent me the ghost's letter,

127
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:40,920
killed your family, and shot a poisoned arrow at me

128
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,260
are not the people from Byeokcheon.

129
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,490
Are they not also my people?

130
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,650
Your Highness, they are not your people.

131
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:56,330
They are rebels and bandits.

132
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,160
Do you remember the curse written in the ghost's letter?

133
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,220
It said everyone would turn their backs on me, and I would become alone

134
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,300
and wander mad through all the land.

135
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,670
If my people...

136
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:16,510
are cursing me like that,

137
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,250
then would that not be so sad?

138
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,190
Is that why you, Your Highness,

139
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:28,980
hope that they are not the ones behind all this?

140
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,330
I did not know you were investigating the Byeokcheon case with that in mind.

141
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,200
However, do you not think the remaining bandits

142
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,340
instigated the Sabangahn case and declared "Song Ga Myeol Yi"?

143
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:46,090
But the report from the Minister of Justice and the words of the Right State Minister after he returned could be false.

144
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:53,630
Manyeondang's young master said he would look into the dried peony petals in the head shaman's incense burner.

145
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:58,350
That should act as a key to unraveling the case.

146
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,270
Does the monk ever tell us when he is coming?

147
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:22,410
All I do is provide him with a meal whenever he drops by.

148
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,650
A few days ago,

149
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:27,980
I heard there is a house where he stays whenever my master comes into the city.

150
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,820
Do you know it, by chance?

151
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,890
Is that true? I do not know about it.

152
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:36,570
This is the first time I'm hearing of this.

153
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,630
There is an item that came over from India, so I want to ask my master about it.

154
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,160
If he comes, please send a word to Manyeondang.

155
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,550
Yes.

156
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,510
Please do so.

157
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,950
Eunuch Go and Scholar Park, you two are here.

158
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,960
It has been a while.

159
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,800
Is Manyeondang's young master inside?

160
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,650
He is... but it is almost like he is not, either.

161
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:04,180
Master! Get up!

162
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,910
Scholar Park and Eunuch Go are here.

163
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,840
I have not heard from you and was getting curious. It is nice of you to come.

164
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,160
What happened?

165
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,090
There is a hidden sorrow deep in my heart.

166
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:21,760
Although I may not be famous or renowned, I, too, am a strong, mature man.

167
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,420
I may be different, but I am not lacking.

168
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,060
Gosh.

169
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,830
Fly, woodpecker!

170
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,270
Peck at my heart!

171
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,730
He got rejected by a woman he was in marriage talks with...

172
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,940
cruelly and miserably.

173
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,450
That is why he is so out of it.

174
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:45,640
It has only been a few days, so he goes back and forth between being fine and weird,

175
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,820
normal and crazy, and going mad.

176
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,600
Oh, goodness...

177
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,800
You, beautiful one... do not pass by so cruelly, but comfort me also.

178
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,590
My body is weak because the spring breeze is too strong.

179
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,560
I fear that I may fall over.

180
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,070
It so happens it is snowing in the middle of the night,

181
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,610
outside the window.

182
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,120
It is snowing when the spring breeze is blowing...

183
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,600
What a complete mess.

184
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,170
Myung Jin's heart...

185
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,290
is cold...

186
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,190
Have you looked into the peony petals?

187
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:26,440
Yes. I heard that my master's master had visited India.

188
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:31,180
We are waiting to ask him, hoping we may be able to find a clue.

189
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:36,350
But I do not know when that master would come...

190
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,370
I mean, is that all you two care about?

191
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,600
Myung Jin's heart, Myung Jin's feelings! You do not care about that?

192
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,570
How could you be so uncaring of me!

193
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:51,490
Is my wounded heart, poked full of holes from the woodpecker's pecking,

194
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,650
- not important at all?
- Woodpecker's...

195
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,370
That cruel woman looks like a woodpecker.

196
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,130
Oh, goodness...

197
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,500
Everyone, please leave. I want to be alone.

198
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,630
Gosh, seriously, this is so frustrating!

199
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,830
Just let it go and move on.

200
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,500
Forget it! You do not know how I feel, friend!

201
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,350
With your handsome face, would you have ever been rejected by a woman before?

202
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,490
Everyone, please leave.

203
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,980
Young Master, are you inside?

204
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,460
The Buddhist priest is here.

205
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,200
What?

206
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,760
- My master is here?
- Yes.

207
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,340
He is my master's master.

208
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,040
These are my friends.

209
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,380
Oh, yes, my student. Did you not say you had something to ask my master?

210
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,870
You may ask right now.

211
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,390
Well...

212
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,190
Oh, no, never mind. It was all my misunderstanding.

213
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,510
You do not need to pay attention to it.

214
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,060
There is a pretty fish living in that gourd bottle.

215
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,740
It is fascinating, right?

216
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,720
Is that not fascinating?

217
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:04,950
Why were you looking for me?

218
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,090
I have something I want to ask you, Master.

219
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,540
Yes.

220
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:33,130
It does appear to be an item

221
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,810
from India.

222
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:39,080
In India, they would pour oil mixed with various perfumes

223
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,390
on dried flower petals

224
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,170
and use it for various purposes.

225
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,470
Then, do you know what these dried peony petals are used for?

226
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,440
These are...

227
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,310
nothing special.

228
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:18,170
They are commonly used in incense made for

229
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,800
helping someone relax.

230
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,400
Wait, then in the process of drying—

231
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,980
Wait, you there!

232
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,580
What have you stolen, you rascal!

233
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,330
- Gosh!
- Oh, my!

234
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,160
- Gosh!
- Catch that thief!

235
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,690
Thief! Thief!

236
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,000
Catch the thief!

237
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,850
You rascal!

238
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,250
Catch that thief!

239
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,360
Catch that thief!

240
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,950
Oh my!

241
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,890
Let me down, let me down!

242
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,600
Open it, open it!

243
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,200
Gosh...

244
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,400
That rascal...

245
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:12,690
No... This precious... This expensive thing...

246
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,740
This kid did it!

247
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:20,300
Do you know how difficult it was to obtain this!

248
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,180
You! You little rascal!

249
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,820
You rascal! You are no better than a dog or a pig!

250
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:30,770
Not only did you block the path of a noble,

251
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:34,550
but you broke this blue-white porcelain!

252
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:37,330
Do you think this is easy to obtain?

253
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:41,260
Do you know how much this costs? This is really expensive, you rascal!

254
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,460
How about you break, too? Break!

255
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,330
Please do not get involved. They will pick on you for going out under disguise.

256
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,970
- Break! You should break too!
- What?

257
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,900
How could you stomp on a little child?

258
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,960
Are you all right?

259
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,220
This child did not do that on purpose.

260
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,790
How could you beat him so harshly?

261
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:07,590
H-How did the laws and customs of this nation end up in this pitiful state?

262
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:11,410
W-Who does this bastard think I am? All right.

263
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:15,030
Everyone, show your respect! He is the Minister of Justice.

264
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,700
Oh, we did not know.

265
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,780
I am sorry that I did not recognize you, Your Excellency.

266
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,450
However, could this porcelain be worth more than someone's life?

267
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:33,910
Although there are lowly classes, there is no such thing as a lowly life—

268
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,860
Are you, a lowly person, trying to teach me?

269
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,740
If you speak to me one more time with your lowly lips,

270
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:46,110
I will rip open your mouth and kill you so I can at least take your life as payment.

271
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:49,490
All right, say something. Go ahead and say something!

272
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:52,150
Hurry up! Come on!

273
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,730
Who are you?

274
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,690
Huh?

275
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,660
My apologies, Your Excellency.

276
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,090
This is my student, but he is uneducated and foolish,

277
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:12,230
so he dared talk to you, not realizing how great you are, Minister of Justice.

278
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:23,810
As this foolish fellow's master, I am embarrassed and apologetic.

279
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:28,670
However, if I think from this fellow's perspective,

280
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:33,480
how could he not step in when he saw this poor child

281
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,510
and can sense his difficult predicament?

282
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:41,340
Also, how could you tell him to shut his mouth?

283
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,090
You have a mouth for speaking.

284
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:48,110
If you shut people's mouths because they are lowly, young, or foolish,

285
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:52,790
where will you hear the people's voices, Your Excellency?

286
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,470
Whose son and what family do you belong to?

287
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:10,700
I do not want to use my family and my father's name in a place like this.

288
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,180
However, I will tell you my name.

289
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,110
My name is...

290
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,600
Kom Mung Jin!

291
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,600
Kom Mung... Kom Mung Jin!

292
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:33,690
I do not know how prestigious your family is,

293
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:39,180
but seeing how they educated their child so poorly, there is no point in knowing.

294
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,070
However!

295
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:46,560
It is the duty of adults to educate a foolish young man like him

296
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,920
who in his youthfulness lacks fear, so I will teach you.

297
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,230
Bring me that little bastard.

298
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,040
Y-Yes...

299
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,090
- Come over here!
- No, you cannot!

300
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:00,350
- Come here!
- Please spare me!

301
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,690
Go over there, you rascal!

302
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,060
Well, in Joseon,

303
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,630
there is something called the national law.

304
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:12,770
You would know that too if you read.

305
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:16,240
Then you would probably already know that

306
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,560
this rascal needs to compensate me for the harm done to me, right?

307
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:28,270
Tell him how much money I spent on that broken porcelain.

308
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:31,200
It was around 200 nyang.

309
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,980
- Whoa! It costs that much?
- 200 nyang?

310
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,500
Your Excellency, how could this child pay you such a large sum?

311
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,290
Then, does it not make sense for him to pay for it with his body?

312
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:47,520
If he were to be put in jail, about 200 years should do it.

313
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,450
P-Please spare me! Spare me!

314
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:55,390
Even if you were to go to my house and work all your life as a slave,

315
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:58,030
would you be able to pay that back?

316
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,990
Not only that, you rascal.

317
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,060
You!

318
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,280
Did you not chase this little kid?

319
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:07,390
I am sure I heard you yell out, "catch the thief."

320
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,060
Well...

321
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,510
I thought he had stolen something very important,

322
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,460
but it was not worth your attention, Your Excellency-

323
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:17,460
Did this rascal steal that?

324
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,880
Why are you not answering me?

325
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,350
Lift your head. Lift your head!

326
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:48,090
You... You're...

327
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:52,000
Who are you, and what do you do?

328
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:58,670
I am just a lowly man who barely scrapes by every day, Your Excellency.

329
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,700
Show us what that little kid stole from you.

330
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:08,880
Everyone, look here closely.

331
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,990
I am not merely doing this to take out my anger.

332
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:16,150
I am executing the dignified national law.

333
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,830
Bring what that kid stole over here.

334
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:34,840
Well, just as they say that a needle thief becomes a cow thief,

335
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,840
it is bastards like him who become the nation's worst thieves.

336
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,900
The traitors!

337
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,840
No!

338
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:49,350
This clearly counts as a crime of theft,

339
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:53,500
I will turn this bastard over to the Police Bureau!

340
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:00,020
Confucius said this,

341
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,740
"You cannot carve a rotten tree,

342
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:07,160
and a wall made of dirty soil cannot be repaired."

343
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:15,040
I suppose such lowly people like you would not know the words of Confucius.

344
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:19,730
It means there is no use in scolding bastards like him.

345
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:23,840
They need a scalding punishment to learn their lesson.

346
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,450
Yes, very wise of him.

347
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,930
All right, let us drag him away.

348
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,990
Yes...

349
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:33,940
I told you to come. Come with me!

350
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,870
You should stop, Minister of Justice.

351
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,830
Gosh, what is with today?

352
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,960
Let me down. Let me down.

353
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,810
What bastard today...

354
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:45,100
Fine. All right.

355
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,990
Wait...

356
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,390
How are you here...

357
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:24,460
Could a passing scholar say a word to you, Your Excellency?

358
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,840
Oh, a scholar? I-I suppose...

359
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:31,330
I watched everything from the beginning, and this child did not break the valuable porcelain

360
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:33,950
intentionally but it was an accident.

361
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:38,580
Though it was theft, it was just a few pieces of cold rice and sweet potato.

362
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,840
The law of Joseon leaves room for extenuating circumstances,

363
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,970
so how about you just let him go?

364
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,490
My title is that of the head of the Justice Department,

365
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:56,900
so how could I turn a blind eye toward a law-breaker like this

366
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,140
while I get paid with government money, S-Scholar?

367
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:05,220
Also, punishment is necessary because by punishing one person,

368
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,280
it causes ten million people to fear the law.

369
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,190
So I have no choice but to make an example out of him.

370
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:17,750
You are so knowledgeable about the law,

371
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,700
but you must not have read the words of Mencius.

372
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,870
You do not know anything about compassion.

373
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:28,740
Mencius said if you lack compassion, you are not human.

374
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:33,680
What that means is that if you lack a compassionate heart,

375
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,470
you are not a human being.

376
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,120
Take a look at this child.

377
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,440
Judging by his appearance, he either has no parents to take care of him,

378
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,270
or even if he did, they were unable to take care of him for some reason.

379
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:52,850
He probably stole because he was hungry, ran because he felt guilty about stealing,

380
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:56,620
and in the process, broke your porcelain, Your Excellency.

381
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:02,000
Well, you think I would not have compassion at all?

382
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,670
Yes, I knew you would.

383
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:11,190
However, having a compassionate heart and running to save a person in need are two things completely different.

384
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:15,620
Anyone can feel compassion, but it is difficult to put it into action.

385
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,840
What will you do, Your Excellency?

386
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:23,880
Will you just feel compassionate or put it into action?

387
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:29,230
Put it into action!

388
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,910
Yeah, I agree.

389
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,200
Even so, he broke my valuable porcelain-

390
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:44,670
As I understand, blue and white porcelain ware was considered luxury items by the late kings.

391
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:48,880
So they banned private usage except for using them as drinking cups.

392
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,080
You are the Minister of Justice, who should be administrating the law.

393
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,040
Yet how is it that you possess the banned goods?

394
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,660
I am so curious about that.

395
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,200
Well...

396
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:07,070
It is okay. I do not mind keeping it a secret for you, Minister.

397
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,470
Between you and me, you know.

398
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,880
I feel compassionate toward you.

399
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,870
So I will forgive you!

400
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,830
It is a secret.

401
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,400
Let us go, let us go, let us go!

402
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,290
I will walk.

403
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:29,490
- Follow me!
- Move! Hurry!

404
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,700
Are you all right?

405
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,800
Geez...

406
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,550
Put it here.

407
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:31,260
Step aside!

408
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,620
Here comes the Minister of Justice!

409
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,690
You should have done it sooner! Much sooner!

410
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:39,690
Step aside!

411
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,770
Did you get something to eat?

412
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:13,390
- Sister.
- Have you been starving, too?

413
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:16,720
No, I ate a lot of food.

414
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,000
I ran errands because there was a party at some lord's house.

415
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:25,610
I am sorry that I ate alone.

416
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:28,470
I am happy that you ate, at least.

417
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:44,460
I cannot believe he became a minister.

418
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,770
Did you know that?

419
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:51,360
How could that bastard be alive and well?

420
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,720
Just let it go.

421
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,920
Where are your parents?

422
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,700
I heard they passed away.

423
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,140
That is apparently why my sister piggybacked me and ran away.

424
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,140
Ran away? From where, exactly?

425
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:31,470
Sister said our hometown is Byeokcheon.

426
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:35,390
As we ran away from there, my parents

427
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,850
passed away, as I heard.

428
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,790
Use this money to get medicine for your sister.

429
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:04,000
I will pay in advance at the tavern from earlier.

430
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,430
Go eat there whenever you feel hungry.

431
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:10,230
But if I go back there and get sent to the Police Bureau again...

432
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:13,020
That will never happen. You can feel free to go there.

433
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:17,430
I live next to that tavern. Ask them and visit me anytime.

434
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:20,090
You heard my master's name, right?

435
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,320
It's Kim Myung Jin.

436
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:41,470
They are homeless children without parents. Please take good care of them.

437
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:45,340
I will give you more money if needed.

438
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,470
Thank you in advance.

439
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,070
Y-Yes.

440
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:53,120
See you next time.

441
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,800
- Thank you in advance.
- Yes.

442
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,220
Oh, boy, that Fellow...

443
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,370
The more I see him, the more I like him.

444
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:12,040
He is crispy on the outside but soft on the inside.

445
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:15,800
His exterior is crispy, but he is soft inside.

446
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,940
Do you not think so, Student?

447
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,960
Yes, it seems so.

448
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,700
I like that Scholar Park.

449
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:29,410
I think you are... not so bad, either.

450
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:37,020
Your Highness was right.

451
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:40,940
Byeokcheon could not just have bandits.

452
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:45,870
Even if those homeless children belonged to the bandits,

453
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:48,630
they did not do anything wrong.

454
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:04,410
It is so nice to see us standing side by side.

455
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:09,480
I meant the shadow. Were you not looking at that?

456
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:18,010
We look friendly. Do you not think so?

457
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,390
Do not cling to me!

458
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,650
I did not cling. It was the shadow.

459
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,770
I told you not to cling.

460
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,560
Just go your way! Why are you doing this?

461
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,720
I am on my way. This is my way.

462
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,570
Seriously!

463
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,500
Do not follow me.

464
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,620
- It is an order.
- Yes.

465
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,970
Hong Je Yong, a citizen of Byeokcheon

466
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:30,100
is writing to you on behalf of the poor people of Byeokcheon.

467
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,960
Jo Won Oh, the governor of Byeokcheon, is someone who eats the country away

468
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,810
and makes the people ill. I could not help but report this to you.

469
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:46,320
Du Guk Byeong Min...
(T/N: Du Guk Byeong Min: Eat the country away and make the people ill)

470
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,630
[Du Guk Byeong Min]

471
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:54,420
Du Guk Byeong Min...

472
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,930
[Hong Je Yong]

473
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:09,500
Did somebody survive?

474
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,560
The rumor says the Crown Prince is bringing

475
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,410
eunuchs and court ladies from Byeokcheon into the Eastern Palace.

476
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,140
[Song Ga Myeol Yi]

477
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:35,010
Your Majesty, I, Jo Won Bo,
[Song Ga Myeol Yi]

478
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:38,570
wish to clearly reveal the evil doings of the rest of the rebels from Byeokcheon.

479
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:41,340
That is why I dared to present that irreverent letter to you, Sire.

480
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:45,180
Tell me where you got this letter immediately.

481
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:52,200
I am ashamed to report this, but when the former head shaman of the Shamanist Bureau

482
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,430
announced her horrible curse,

483
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:59,020
that letter, which contains the same curse, was spread to the people of the capital.

484
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:03,170
"The Song family will destroy the Yi family."

485
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:07,920
Your Majesty, Joseon's law says an anonymous letter must be burnt

486
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,850
after reading, even if it is regarding the country's affairs and not speaking of the content.

487
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:17,010
But how could it be considered an anonymous letter if it is clear who wrote it?

488
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:20,610
The head shaman mentioned the name Song, the bandit of Byeokcheon,

489
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:22,930
and admitted that she was one of them.

490
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:25,330
Do you mean their people are outside the palace as well?

491
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:29,530
I believe you must prevent anyone from Byeokcheon from being given

492
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:33,380
any government position, so we do not hear of Byeokcheon anymore.

493
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,390
Please stop them from holding office.

494
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:39,230
Ban the people from Byeokcheon from applying for the state exam.

495
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,910
Where is Byeokcheon? It is in the West.

496
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:46,330
That region is close to where the barbarians are, and they are uneducated.

497
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:52,190
Even the former king left an instruction not to hire people from that region.

498
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,920
How could a minister of a nation be worse than a street ruffian?

499
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,860
Chief State Minister, we need to find a way to stop them.

500
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:15,110
How could we stop them? If you have an idea, let us hear it.

501
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,580
You know His Majesty.

502
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:21,280
If someone gets in his way, he abandons them no matter how faithful of a servant they are.

503
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,450
He saw that evil letter.

504
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:27,960
He must be already leaning toward the Right State Minister.

505
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,330
Master! There is a notice from the palace!

506
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:44,060
They will prevent the people from Byeokcheon from applying for the

507
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,130
state exams and getting any government positions!

508
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,500
What on earth...

509
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,030
Get out of the way!

510
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,170
Those poor people from Byeokcheon.
[Notice]

511
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:58,890
- They are banned from holding office!
- That is what they deserve.

512
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:00,440
Have you not been to Byeokcheon?

513
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,310
It was totally filled with bandits.

514
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:08,190
If you have not gotten your bundle stolen there, you cannot be considered a peddler!

515
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,780
You are right. You are right.

516
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:15,880
My cousin took in someone who ran away from Byeokcheon as a slave out of pity,

517
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,720
and he got everything in his storage shed stolen!

518
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,720
They say not to hire anyone from Byeokcheon,

519
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,950
not even as a slave because they lie and steal all the time!

520
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:26,340
Even if there were bandits in Byeokcheon,

have you been reviewing the directories of civil service examinees due to the Byeokcheon incident?

Since Right State Minister defeated the rebels of Byeokcheon,

595
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:28,500
there were only three people from Byeokcheon who passed

596
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,380
the civil service exam in the past decade.

597
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,350
Same with the military service exam.

598
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:39,730
Even if they passed, they were assigned to the countryside or islands.

What should we do about this?

Father, please rescind the decision to ban people from Byeokcheon from taking the state exam.

603
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:07,730
This decision will put countless people from Byeokcheon's lives on the brink.

00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:14,180
Also, His Majesty only allowed a eunuch to enter your room so others cannot go in and out frequently.

696
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:23,850
It has been ten days since His Highness was trapped inside

697
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:26,200
the Eastern Palace.

698
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,130
Today is the 15th day.

699
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:35,610
There is nothing I can do for His Highness.

700
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:41,580
How come we do not hear from the palace?

701
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:45,910
Did His Highness forget about us?

702
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:49,730
Gosh...

703
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:52,180
There is no way!

704
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:57,400
Scholar Park is not coming, and neither is Eunuch Go.

705
00:59:58,410 --> 01:00:00,460
I miss them.

706
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:03,300
Do you not?

707
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,790
- Yes.
- Geez!

708
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:10,930
The four of us should be drinking on a night like this!

709
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:13,900
Yippee, whoopee, hurray! Hurray!

710
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:16,820
- How nice!
- How nice!

711
01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:23,230
The weather is so nice.

712
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:39,760
Today is the 20th day since I saw His Highness.

713
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:13,490
His Highness has been confined in the Eastern Palace

714
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,440
for a month.

715
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:35,390
His Highness, are you enduring all right?

716
01:01:41,710 --> 01:01:47,550
His Highness. It is way past your bedtime.

717
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:57,250
Do you know what

718
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,060
the crown prince's duties are?

719
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:03,020
What are they?

720
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:05,550
Moon Chim Shi Seon.

721
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:08,120
It is also called Woon Jung Shin Sung.
(T/N: The crown prince's duty to greet the king and queen)

722
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:12,750
I ask how the king and queen are

723
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:15,380
and inspect royal meals.

724
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:20,050
Do you know what else is there?

725
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:29,040
Attend the law lecture review sessions and polish your studies.

726
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,800
However,

727
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:37,800
Father banned me from doing any of that.

728
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:43,320
How could I be considered a crown prince?

729
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:49,870
I cannot do anything.

730
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:56,120
All the things that the crown prince can do.

731
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:00,580
I cannot do any of those things.

732
01:03:04,310 --> 01:03:07,140
How could I be the crown prince anymore?

733
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:09,860
I am already...

734
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:15,320
a fallen crown prince.

735
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:02,730
I think Father is trying to abandon me.

736
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:08,880
If he is not,

737
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:15,420
he cannot be doing this.

738
01:04:54,100 --> 01:05:06,800
♫ Your cry is steeped in pain ♫

739
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:13,120
♫ The words you swallowed ♫

740
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:17,710
♫ Tell me everything ♫

741
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:25,270
♫ The world has coldly ♫

742
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:27,990
[Our Blooming Youth]

743
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:32,070
Was it true that the Crown Prince is confined in the Eastern Palace?

744
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:34,310
It means he has been ousted.

745
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:37,760
I know that you are not Go Soon Dol.

746
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,700
You cannot trust this person.

747
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:42,370
Who is whose mother, exactly?

748
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:43,960
What are you doing right now?

749
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,900
Your Highness, you must oust this person!

750
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,860
Did you also kill my family?

751
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:52,430
I can protect you, and you can protect me.

752
01:05:52,430 --> 01:05:54,780
The herald who came to Gaeseong.

753
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,880
It was him.
