1
00:00:12,103 --> 00:00:16,120
I'll have an audition for my new show this Friday, and I'll have Jib reach out to you.

2
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,160
You've chosen this path already.

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,840
After this, you have to be more committed than this.

4
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,800
What're you doing here?

5
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,560
Can I stay with you for a week?

6
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,880
What's going on? Why did you show up out of nowhere?

7
00:02:10,603 --> 00:02:11,800
What happened?

8
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,560
I have a problem with my old place

9
00:02:17,783 --> 00:02:19,640
and I can't go back home.

10
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,120
My life is quite busy lately.

11
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,960
I don't think I can let you stay.

12
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,120
Can you ask your other friends? / They can't let me stay with them either.

13
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,840
I know that you don't want me here.

14
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,800
I really don't want to bother you.

15
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,200
But you're my last friend.

16
00:03:07,543 --> 00:03:09,960
I don't think you should be here, sorry.

17
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,800
You're still mad at me about that?

18
00:03:15,617 --> 00:03:17,120
I shouldn't have thought of you in that horrible way.

19
00:03:20,277 --> 00:03:21,320
I wanted to apologize to you but

20
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,760
you didn't want to talk to me so I didn't know how to tell you.

21
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,300
I really am sorry

22
00:03:34,577 --> 00:03:36,320
but can you help me out this time.

23
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,441
I honestly have nowhere to go.

24
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,520
You use the same serum as me, can I use it?

25
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,000
You can use this puffy blanket.

26
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,840
I'm fine with anything.

27
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,497
I don't want to hear you whine.

28
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,000
You don't like the feather one, do you?

29
00:05:12,263 --> 00:05:13,400
How are you?

30
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,300
Well, I mostly

31
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,601
go to school,

32
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,720
go to cram school, do this and that.

33
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:44,600
Like what?

34
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,100
I'm about to be on a runway.

35
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,080
Wow! Is it good money?

36
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,321
I worked on graphic design as my side hustle and it paid s--t.

37
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,720
I needed to focus on big volume instead.

38
00:06:17,603 --> 00:06:19,200
Can I ask you one more question?

39
00:06:25,543 --> 00:06:26,544
You know

40
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,081
Diesel? I see you followed him.

41
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,921
I..

42
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,840
the brand that I will be working with

43
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,500
called DEVI

44
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,600
it is Diesel's mom's brand.

45
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,100
So you're close to him.

46
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,280
He's around our age so I just followed him.

47
00:07:13,597 --> 00:07:14,960
Why did you ask?

48
00:07:29,643 --> 00:07:30,680
Who is Anyone?

49
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,401
So what? Pick one!

50
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,160
Anyone is Dream, my friend from school.

51
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,440
Dream Danupha?

52
00:07:44,277 --> 00:07:45,278
Hey!

53
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,881
I…

54
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,050
I'll go to sleep now, I'll turn off the lights.

55
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,160
You're so bold.

56
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,000
Is it true that you fooled Mhong into kissing you?

57
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,880
Stop asking her that. / Is it true?

58
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:45,760
And you stole his song? That DM song?

59
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,160
He just launched a new version, so awesome.

60
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,720
Did you hear it? / Did you?

61
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,320
You got nothing better to do?

62
00:08:57,081 --> 00:08:58,440
Why don't you go and sniff some stuff?

63
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,240
You're close with her. / None of your business.

64
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,291
Get to your classroom.

65
00:09:20,857 --> 00:09:25,760
Dream is a girl who grew up with her mom's vast collection of history and politics books.

66
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,600
She learned about oppression in the past well enough

67
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,160
to understand the phase

68
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,170
everyone is equal.

69
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,361
She has started to fight for it since small society

70
00:09:39,557 --> 00:09:42,880
that power flows in one-way called school.

71
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,240
The more you cut flowers, the more they bloom, as well as ideologies.

72
00:09:47,357 --> 00:09:50,760
The more she got forbidden, the more she thought she needed to fight.

73
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,360
Her online followers reached hundreds of thousands and they're not just numbers,

74
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,700
but they are voices to confirm that she's not fighting alone.

75
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,440
If we do nothing wrong, why do they need to silence us? / A teacher chopped off

76
00:10:02,737 --> 00:10:04,760
This account who attacked the school / my friend's braid in front of a whole school.

77
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,440
is Danupha, your best friend, right?

78
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,700
Dream hesitated if

79
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,320
her best friend was really a snake,

80
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,200
or it was all made up in her head.

81
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,041
When trust was destroyed, no matter what the reason was,

82
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,880
Dream couldn't go back to normal.

83
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,881
Dream's life shouldn't be this tough,

84
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,840
if only she was raised in a house where everyone was allowed

85
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,320
to share their different opinions. / Please come in.

86
00:10:42,443 --> 00:10:43,443
Dad?

87
00:10:44,158 --> 00:10:45,890
You know damn well that Mom is inside, what are you doing?

88
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,601
Your mom is guilty.

89
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,530
What makes you think that she's guilty?

90
00:10:55,977 --> 00:10:57,350
Because she has different opinion than you have?

91
00:10:59,797 --> 00:11:02,263
Dad, you're a teacher

92
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,110
you teach people to think differently.

93
00:11:06,397 --> 00:11:07,600
You can think differently

94
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,557
but you can't break the laws.

95
00:11:14,603 --> 00:11:15,804
Are you blind?

96
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,910
Or you've been brainwashed?

97
00:11:21,897 --> 00:11:24,520
After that, Dream realized that

98
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,081
if your friends or family who were supposed to be your safe zone

99
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,600
could betrayed you,

100
00:11:30,143 --> 00:11:31,240
can you really trust

101
00:11:31,463 --> 00:11:35,200
anyone in this world?

102
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,264
Mom!

103
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,080
Mom!

104
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,311
This bitch?

105
00:11:53,511 --> 00:11:55,512
Mhong should have known better.

106
00:11:55,612 --> 00:11:57,613
Lying bitch! Song thief!

107
00:12:02,737 --> 00:12:05,640
We need to turn off comments for now.

108
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,120
We haven't started it yet.

109
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,760
What did Ms.Duangtawan say about it?

110
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,960
We need to stop the deal.

111
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,880
And you need to take care of your mess.

112
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,600
We could work together when there's a chance.

113
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,680
Why don’t you invite your friend here?

114
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,451
Go on.

115
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:11,650
Hey! / What?

116
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,300
They want to get to know you.

117
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,920
But I don't know anyone.

118
00:13:18,137 --> 00:13:19,320
I'll introduce you to them.

119
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,600
No, I'm shy. / Come on.

120
00:13:23,563 --> 00:13:24,800
Fine, I'll go.

121
00:13:25,463 --> 00:13:26,464
Mother,

122
00:13:26,943 --> 00:13:29,920
this is Jay, my boyfriend. / Gay!

123
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,321
Gay is fantastic and cute.

124
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,040
I need to go out to smoke.

125
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,760
Are you ditching your friends to be out here?

126
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:23,051
Nope. I have a lot of friends inside.

127
00:14:23,857 --> 00:14:25,000
Mother? / Yeah?

128
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,640
I need to see my boyfriend.

129
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,880
What? But we're having fun.

130
00:14:28,957 --> 00:14:31,360
Just a minute. / Fine, hurry back.

131
00:14:43,837 --> 00:14:48,160
Well, well, well...are you hitting on her? / Nope.

132
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,880
Take a good care of your boy.

133
00:14:52,163 --> 00:14:54,164
Sure, I will. / He looks so exhausted.

134
00:14:55,497 --> 00:14:56,498
Sure thing.

135
00:14:58,963 --> 00:15:00,670
I need to see Ly inside.

136
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,840
Fine, I'll be right there. / See you.

137
00:15:08,297 --> 00:15:09,298
What's wrong?

138
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:13,600
You don't like that Ly called you gay?

139
00:15:15,163 --> 00:15:16,600
She said nonsense things all the time.

140
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,360
Don't mind her.

141
00:15:27,243 --> 00:15:29,480
Maybe I just didn't get used to it yet.

142
00:15:35,297 --> 00:15:38,320
Stop thinking that. We're all peers here.

143
00:15:38,717 --> 00:15:40,800
They're your friends, not mine.

144
00:15:46,197 --> 00:15:47,198
But…

145
00:15:49,137 --> 00:15:50,138
when…

146
00:15:51,677 --> 00:15:53,050
When you're inside,

147
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,000
you acted so differently than when you were with me.

148
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,001
But you looked happier

149
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,080
like you can be yourself.

150
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,440
So mayber I didn't want to disturb you.

151
00:16:13,863 --> 00:16:15,300
You look like you have something to say.

152
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,360
Nope, nothing.

153
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,240
Nothing much.

154
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,921
Spill it.

155
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:43,320
1…2…3...all done.

156
00:16:43,563 --> 00:16:45,840
Thank you, thank you so much.

157
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,400
Thank you, we can finally work together.

158
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,080
My team is a big fan of you.

159
00:16:50,101 --> 00:16:53,760
You look so cute together. / Thanks.

160
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,920
We're gonna do our best for this.

161
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,440
Should we film a TVC tomorrow?

162
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,400
We're always ready.

163
00:17:02,943 --> 00:17:05,520
You guys are so nice, we'll see you all year long.

164
00:17:05,703 --> 00:17:06,997
I gotta go, bye.

165
00:17:07,057 --> 00:17:09,120
See you later. / Bye.

166
00:17:09,223 --> 00:17:10,524
This way please.

167
00:17:13,857 --> 00:17:15,520
You guys did a great job this month.

168
00:17:16,043 --> 00:17:18,290
There's a gathering at Siam next.

169
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,600
Tang is already there so

170
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,360
keep up your good work, okay?

171
00:17:23,863 --> 00:17:25,703
Okay? / Joe,

172
00:17:29,617 --> 00:17:30,618
Keep it up!

173
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,520
Well done. Good luck, guys. / See you. Thank you.

174
00:17:41,397 --> 00:17:42,398
What's the matter?

175
00:17:47,871 --> 00:17:48,872
You're worried about Bambi?

176
00:18:03,623 --> 00:18:04,624
Hey,

177
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:10,964
can you help me with something?

178
00:18:20,617 --> 00:18:22,618
Someone threw rock at my friend and invaded our house.

179
00:18:22,718 --> 00:18:25,109
I moved out and I'm safe.

180
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:01,800
Are you okay?

181
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,520
You can tell me.

182
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,271
What is it?

183
00:19:56,343 --> 00:19:57,360
It's nothing.

184
00:20:11,917 --> 00:20:13,720
He is earning money from your missed calls.

185
00:20:14,317 --> 00:20:15,680
Everyone, look!

186
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,880
If she did nothing wrong, why can't she just sit still? Look?

187
00:20:21,037 --> 00:20:24,080
See? / I know, what's wrong?

188
00:20:24,503 --> 00:20:25,520
Not cool.

189
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,480
See you in game tonight.

190
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,081
See you.

191
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,280
How bad was it?

192
00:20:44,983 --> 00:20:45,984
I…

193
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,520
I made out with him.

194
00:20:55,517 --> 00:20:57,000
And he gave me his song.

195
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,240
It's cool.

196
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,250
But I was wrong about this.

197
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,161
I think you were both wrong.

198
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:14,840
He got to make out with you and you got his song, it's a win-win situation.

199
00:21:16,203 --> 00:21:19,720
It's up to one's perspective. They can choose to see from different side.

200
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,700
It's like

201
00:21:29,183 --> 00:21:30,760
what happened to my parents.

202
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,841
Or when we

203
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,520
fought when we were young something like that.

204
00:21:38,277 --> 00:21:39,800
I saw it from my point of view.

205
00:21:43,078 --> 00:21:45,750
You know that you did wrong, I didn't even know back then.

206
00:21:46,417 --> 00:21:48,783
I'd be like, who hurt me.

207
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,650
I didn't look from your point of view that

208
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,480
you were also in trouble.

209
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,691
I'm sorry.

210
00:22:38,923 --> 00:22:40,960
I….

211
00:22:42,657 --> 00:22:43,658
I have

212
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,720
something to tell you.

213
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:06,771
Hello?

214
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,800
Can you come outside?

215
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,480
Is he a star?

216
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,840
I used to.. / Right.

217
00:23:37,077 --> 00:23:39,640
work on graphic. / Yeah?

218
00:23:39,863 --> 00:23:43,560
I worked on your BL couple. / Cool.

219
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,480
That's right.

220
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,440
I'm straving.

221
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,300
I need to eat something. / Go find something to eat.

222
00:23:57,367 --> 00:23:59,960
I need to find something to eat. / Bye, just go.

223
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,960
Watch where you're going. / See you.

224
00:24:16,537 --> 00:24:19,280
Is it okay for you to be here? Your company didn't mind?

225
00:24:21,077 --> 00:24:23,680
Not at all, they're just worried.

226
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:32,320
I saw the song that just released.

227
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,700
Full of bulls.

228
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:37,600
I don't think you should watch something like this.

229
00:24:39,643 --> 00:24:41,300
I don't know what to do.

230
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:46,200
I think you should stay put for a while.

231
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,597
Don't say anything much about it.

232
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,617
I experienced

233
00:24:53,317 --> 00:24:54,600
something like this once.

234
00:24:55,797 --> 00:24:58,700
Someone posted me and my tiring face at the event,

235
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:00,903
and they said that I disrespected the host.

236
00:25:01,463 --> 00:25:04,200
Eventually, my fans protected me, they said that I worked too much.

237
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:06,990
They spoke the truth for me.

238
00:25:08,503 --> 00:25:09,504
That's good.

239
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,957
But it's harder in my case.

240
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:18,184
Do you know anyone

241
00:25:21,297 --> 00:25:24,800
with a trustworthy account? They can vouch for you.

242
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,391
What is it?

243
00:25:48,043 --> 00:25:49,700
I think I can think of something.

244
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,520
can you help me with something?

245
00:25:55,403 --> 00:25:58,480
When Mhong goes live, can you log into your gaming account

246
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,360
and bring me there to talk to him?

247
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,401
Let's do this.

248
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,717
You made up an excuse of a sick mom?

249
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,031
I can explain.

250
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,151
If I didn't worry about your mom

251
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,403
and went all the way to see her with a fruit basket,

252
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:29,400
I wouldn't have known about this,

253
00:26:29,803 --> 00:26:32,250
that you all fooled me. / It's just a little gathering

254
00:26:34,337 --> 00:26:37,208
it had nothing to do with the movie. I went to all the events,

255
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,441
but I really couldn't go this time. / Listen to me,

256
00:26:39,917 --> 00:26:42,600
if you want to benefit from this job,

257
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,101
you can't make any more excuses.

258
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,650
How could you let Namkhang attend the event alone? You two should be together.

259
00:26:51,263 --> 00:26:54,457
Think of the people you disappointed. This is not just about your fans.

260
00:26:55,103 --> 00:26:56,700
You ditched on your work.

261
00:26:57,563 --> 00:26:59,017
You had no responsibility.

262
00:26:59,817 --> 00:27:02,960
No matter what your job is, you can't do that.

263
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:04,840
Tang, you!

264
00:27:07,177 --> 00:27:08,720
You said that you could control them.

265
00:27:08,857 --> 00:27:10,080
Tang has nothing to do with this.

266
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,523
Namkhang and Tang have nothing to do with this, it's my mistake.

267
00:27:14,237 --> 00:27:16,417
Can you give me another chance? / Enough.

268
00:27:21,297 --> 00:27:23,097
I must have protected you way too much.

269
00:27:23,337 --> 00:27:25,120
You think you can get away with anything.

270
00:27:29,417 --> 00:27:31,520
People don't get that many chances.

271
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,500
I can't tell you

272
00:27:36,717 --> 00:27:38,400
if you deserve one more chance.

273
00:27:41,857 --> 00:27:44,040
It's up to our clients, and your fans.

274
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,050
They have rights to call it.

275
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:50,183
Be prepared for consequences.

276
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,431
Where is he?

277
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:09,851
Found him.

278
00:29:14,863 --> 00:29:15,864
Mhong,

279
00:29:16,383 --> 00:29:17,650
can you text me back?

280
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,700
Why did you do it?

281
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:24,484
Who's that?

282
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,760
We didn't do anything.

283
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,800
We just made a fun song.

284
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:38,120
How did you assume that it's about you?

285
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,000
You got something on your back?

286
00:29:42,077 --> 00:29:45,320
That's crazy? / If it's not about me, can you delete the clip?

287
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,480
My life is a big mess because of your song.

288
00:29:53,563 --> 00:29:55,430
Nice.

289
00:29:57,643 --> 00:30:00,077
Now you know how I feel.

290
00:30:02,177 --> 00:30:03,978
You know how it feels like when your life

291
00:30:04,078 --> 00:30:06,179
is going down the cliff.

292
00:30:06,663 --> 00:30:07,664
Do you get me now?

293
00:30:12,423 --> 00:30:14,840
Are you a child? That's so stupid.

294
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,200
Why did you do that?

295
00:30:17,343 --> 00:30:19,103
Damn it!

296
00:30:20,823 --> 00:30:24,040
There're two? Your voice sound familiar.

297
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,241
Are you Dream?

298
00:30:30,023 --> 00:30:32,000
You two are friends again?

299
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,961
Can I ask you something, Dream?

300
00:30:35,817 --> 00:30:37,170
When you were young,

301
00:30:38,217 --> 00:30:39,720
did your friend really rat you out?

302
00:30:40,237 --> 00:30:41,880
Or you were just delusional?

303
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,643
None of your f--king business. It got f--king nothing to do with you.

304
00:30:47,757 --> 00:30:49,300
Hey, I asked you nicely.

305
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:52,817
I'm worried for you that history would repeat itself.

306
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,720
Why did you say something stupid like this?

307
00:30:54,961 --> 00:30:56,480
I'm here to talk to you nicely.

308
00:30:56,983 --> 00:30:58,400
And I'm talking to you nicely.

309
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,480
Do you have any idea that you just ruined our happy moment?

310
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,400
Get the hell out of here! / Go!

311
00:31:05,117 --> 00:31:06,760
Get her! / That's right, get her out of here.

312
00:31:07,003 --> 00:31:08,124
Let's do this.

313
00:31:14,357 --> 00:31:16,760
You son of a bitch! You can't fight so you chose violence?

314
00:31:17,523 --> 00:31:20,000
Shoot her! Let them know that

315
00:31:20,077 --> 00:31:22,240
this is Mhong Muangthai!

316
00:31:31,043 --> 00:31:33,960
Get her! / Get her good!

317
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,351
You assholes!

318
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,240
You son of a bitch! You're so tough in game, why don't you shoot me in real life?

319
00:31:59,037 --> 00:32:01,477
MISTER_J / Gunman : Stupid woke feminist, I'll shoot you for real.

320
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,401
Damn it!

321
00:32:10,163 --> 00:32:13,720
About what Mhong said earlier….

322
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,960
I don't think someone like them should have a place in this society.

323
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,801
I recorded when they shoot us earlier.

324
00:32:22,417 --> 00:32:24,343
This will create another drama.

325
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,120
But I think people need to see what they did.

326
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:29,000
Why did you fold to them easily?

327
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,720
They ruined your life.

328
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,960
This is the proof.

329
00:32:47,057 --> 00:32:49,120
You saw what they just did.

330
00:32:56,243 --> 00:32:57,244
Fine.

331
00:32:58,463 --> 00:32:59,464
I'll expose them.

332
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,040
It has become a hot topic

333
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:05,000
when #DickHeadMhong made a song called 'Watch Your Back'

334
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,040
aiming to attack a young woman.

335
00:33:07,117 --> 00:33:10,288
She tried to talk to him in the game

336
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:13,520
instead, gamers chose violence and shoot her.

337
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:15,480
The footage of their attack

338
00:33:15,544 --> 00:33:18,480
was recorded and posted on social media channels later

339
00:33:18,545 --> 00:33:19,680
by Anyone.

340
00:33:19,743 --> 00:33:23,320
In the end, it seemed like people started to agree more with Anyone than Mhong.

341
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,640
Mhong's song gained higher number of dislikes.

342
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:29,040
From this story, we can see that

343
00:33:29,137 --> 00:33:32,520
people who choose violence in both real and online worlds

344
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,160
shouldn't have a place in society.

345
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,520
I will talk about this one time and one time only.

346
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:45,240
Nowadays, when women choose to do what they like,

347
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,300
they receive backlash from people.

348
00:33:47,561 --> 00:33:50,680
On the other hand, when men do what they like,

349
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,480
people praise them.

350
00:33:54,757 --> 00:33:58,400
I just want you to ask yourself

351
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,400
is this the society we want to live in?

352
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,281
Stupid song from a stupid guy, such a loser. #RealManKeepOnFalling

353
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,921
An anthem for real men like Andrew Tate, so disgusting.

354
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,341
They will blame the games, I can't wait to see the same old excuses.

355
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,560
I admitted that I didn't

356
00:34:11,121 --> 00:34:13,600
think it through for what I did.

357
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,600
I didn't think that it'd turn out like this.

358
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,520
I'd like to ask for another chance

359
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,680
from everyone.

360
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:26,720
I think we fucking got the clip.

361
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,720
But I just said from my perspective.

362
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,771
I know but I feel like

363
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,250
people who look sadder seem to be on the right side.

364
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,360
See? Many people are on your side.

365
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,920
Dear members, I don't think it's fair

366
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,640
that Mhongmuangthai is the only one to blame.

367
00:34:44,883 --> 00:34:47,120
Anyone askes for equality.

368
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,480
But when there're problems,

369
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,080
you always blame the men. Does it seem right to you?

370
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,801
If you want equality so bad, why don't you go to war instead of us?

371
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,960
There's no equality since the beginning.

372
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,841
Which one do you prefer, rice or noodles?

373
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,223
I like rice more.

374
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:11,640
Why's that? Well, I prefer rice too.

375
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,400
I get to chew, I don't like something soupy. / It's nothing about chewing.

376
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,400
You still have to chew. / That's right.

377
00:35:17,277 --> 00:35:20,700
You think you said the right thing?

378
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,440
What're you doing?

379
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,000
You think you're cool? / So what?

380
00:35:39,943 --> 00:35:40,944
You want a piece of me?

381
00:35:52,237 --> 00:35:54,357
Thank you for helping me out with the speech.

382
00:35:55,643 --> 00:35:56,880
If you didn't help me, I would be in so much trouble.

383
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,610
What? / I was just thinking about

384
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,697
us hanging out when we were kids

385
00:36:10,117 --> 00:36:13,800
your mom bought you a unicorn onesie and I wanted one.

386
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:17,180
I cried, then you gave me your onesie.

387
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:18,903
And all you left was your tank top.

388
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,957
I think that onesie looked ugly so I gave it to you.

389
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,281
You still wan to wear it?

390
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,700
I don't want to lose you again.

391
00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:43,244
I missed you.

392
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,200
I missed you too.

393
00:36:53,143 --> 00:36:54,144
You want some Mookrata?

394
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:55,851
Where?

395
00:36:56,383 --> 00:36:57,384
Khun Earn.

396
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,840
You don't want to go other places? I think…

397
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:03,040
Yeah? Khun Earn made all the dishes?

398
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:08,720
Well, it's good. I've been to this place since I was a kid.

399
00:37:08,903 --> 00:37:11,360
I want to help them out. / They still do that?

400
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:15,250
Your parents aren't home? / Did you see them?

401
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,440
Why don't we just go to the restaurant?

402
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,711
I need to change one sec.

403
00:37:22,757 --> 00:37:24,000
You don't have to change, it's just Mookrata.

404
00:37:24,563 --> 00:37:25,840
Can't we go now?

405
00:37:46,257 --> 00:37:49,920
One sec? / How long is it?

406
00:37:52,857 --> 00:37:53,858
This uniform isn't….

407
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,960
I don't want to waste time. / Just a second.

408
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,600
You're done? / Nope.

409
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,961
Hey! / What?

410
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,670
What is it? Dream?

411
00:38:36,463 --> 00:38:37,464
Bambi?

412
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:39,700
Did you tell someone else that Anyone is Dream?

413
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,040
Now everyone knows her identity.

414
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,170
Bambi? Can you hear me?

415
00:38:47,337 --> 00:38:48,600
I'm heading to your place.

416
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,400
Did someone call me?

417
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,700
Where are you going?

418
00:39:04,337 --> 00:39:05,560
Do you have anything to say to me?

419
00:39:09,603 --> 00:39:10,604
What's going on?

420
00:39:18,497 --> 00:39:19,498
Anything to say to me?

421
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,120
What's wrong with you?

422
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,600
Did you tell Diesel that I'm Anyone?

423
00:39:38,157 --> 00:39:39,158
Tell me.

424
00:39:46,397 --> 00:39:47,560
You are a f--king monster.

425
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:53,280
I'm sorry. / Don't touch me.

426
00:39:54,757 --> 00:39:56,960
Listen to me.

427
00:39:58,003 --> 00:40:00,183
He kept on pressuring me to tell him.

428
00:40:00,743 --> 00:40:02,003
If I didn't….. / What pressured you?

429
00:40:05,863 --> 00:40:07,300
About you walking a runway?

430
00:40:13,717 --> 00:40:15,270
So you knew?

431
00:40:17,397 --> 00:40:19,830
You knew that I ran away because of him?

432
00:40:22,163 --> 00:40:24,240
You knew? How could you do this to me?

433
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:28,760
I'm sorry. / We shared the same bed every night.

434
00:40:28,997 --> 00:40:30,920
I'm sorry. / I was right there.

435
00:40:31,483 --> 00:40:33,320
You could have just told me.

436
00:40:37,157 --> 00:40:39,640
How could you sleep at night being a monster like this?

437
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,320
I don't want to lose you again.

438
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:43,600
So I chose not to tell you. I didn't dare to tell you.

439
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,600
I'm sorry.

440
00:40:47,783 --> 00:40:50,360
I'm sorry, please don't go.

441
00:40:50,884 --> 00:40:52,040
Stay.

442
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,960
I'm really sorry.

443
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,250
When we fought back when we were kids,

444
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,840
did you rat me out to the teachers?

445
00:41:06,457 --> 00:41:07,458
I'm sorry.

446
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,521
Dream.

447
00:41:12,343 --> 00:41:13,520
Sorry.

448
00:41:13,983 --> 00:41:15,160
You've never f--king changed.

449
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,961
Dream.

450
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,921
Dream!

451
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:41,160
Listen to me. / Dream?

452
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:43,951
Dream?

453
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,700
Can I talk to you?

454
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,560
Dream? / Diesel? What the hell?

455
00:41:49,243 --> 00:41:51,480
Dream!

456
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,640
Dream!

457
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,561
Dream!

458
00:42:10,177 --> 00:42:11,640
Dream!

459
00:42:12,957 --> 00:42:13,958
Dream!

460
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:20,571
Dream!

461
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:38,871
Dream!

462
00:43:24,157 --> 00:43:25,158
Diesel!

463
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,501
If you choose to be benefited from this job, you can make any excuses.

464
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,501
You can't just ditch on your job,

465
00:43:42,601 --> 00:43:43,902
no matter what your job is. - Joe Pastel Bay.

466
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,561
Take care of her.

467
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,650
Where are you going?

468
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,450
Please help her!

469
00:43:53,663 --> 00:43:55,320
My people looked everywhere and

470
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,040
Job did it.

471
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,600
I know that you're worried about Bambi

472
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,720
But Tang just got fired.

473
00:44:05,063 --> 00:44:06,200
If you go to the audition,

474
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,520
you could go further than what you said

475
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,480
and you could be as famous as Kimia.
