1
00:00:12,577 --> 00:00:14,600
Yo! Aloha! / My name is Dream.

2
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,161
Mhong.

3
00:00:16,361 --> 00:00:19,840
They are thinking of your debut in showcase next month.

4
00:00:20,997 --> 00:00:23,120
If you want something, you need to give something first.

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,321
I need to trade it.

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,520
I really like the song you just played for me.

7
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,520
Can I have this song?

8
00:00:29,683 --> 00:00:30,500
Liar!

9
00:00:30,543 --> 00:00:33,280
Can you please tell me that you didn't do it because you wanted a song?

10
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,760
Did you have any feeling for me?

11
00:00:35,057 --> 00:00:37,200
If I wanted something, I needed to give something in return, right?

12
00:01:43,017 --> 00:01:46,160
Will you be my girlfriend?

13
00:01:49,383 --> 00:01:51,600
Be his girlfriend!

14
00:02:00,423 --> 00:02:01,424
The girl should have just accepted it. She didn't have to do that.

15
00:02:01,477 --> 00:02:04,080
If the girl didn't start it, he wouldn't have had enough courage to ask her.

16
00:02:06,057 --> 00:02:08,560
It's okay. It's alright, bro.

17
00:02:10,277 --> 00:02:13,161
I felt bad for that DM girl. Poor thing.

18
00:02:13,278 --> 00:02:15,362
He didn't even ask for consent. He used others to pressure the girl.

19
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:16,417
This label trained artists to be this cringe?

20
00:02:16,577 --> 00:02:18,443
In the end, the label issued an announcement.

21
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,700
MHONGMUANGTHAI

22
00:02:20,123 --> 00:02:22,124
Termination of trainee

23
00:02:37,503 --> 00:02:41,077
Pink Lava Chicken Nuggets

24
00:02:45,097 --> 00:02:48,160
New! Chicken nuggets with pink lava sauce.

25
00:02:48,217 --> 00:02:50,440
Deliciousness shining through your mouth.

26
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,491
Fuck!

27
00:03:00,957 --> 00:03:02,558
This is so cringe, everything is so confusing. / Hilarious. She should focus on being funny.

28
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,601
It's funny but the song keeps haunting me. / This commercial is so annoying.

29
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,781
I laughed so hard at the dress, is this serious?

30
00:03:06,081 --> 00:03:07,682
What the heck?! I lost my appetite.

31
00:03:08,317 --> 00:03:09,880
What's your name? / Tokyo.

32
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,760
Somon. / Alright, Tokyo and Somon.

33
00:03:11,823 --> 00:03:14,250
You guys dressed so cool. Can I do a drip check?

34
00:03:14,337 --> 00:03:17,080
What are you wearing? / I thrifted this top from Red Building Vintage

35
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,560
I got the pants from Japan. Not sure how much but I love them.

36
00:03:20,723 --> 00:03:22,920
How much are you wearing? / Around 50,000 baht.

37
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,441
Oh my gosh! Second-hand items cost 50,000 !?

38
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,491
It's nothing much, right?

39
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:28,680
Nothing much. / I see. What about you, Somon?

40
00:03:28,723 --> 00:03:30,480
You think you got the drip? / Sure I do.

41
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,600
How much would you rate your style? / 10 out of 10.

42
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,800
Wait! What? Are they part of your school uniform?

43
00:03:33,937 --> 00:03:36,420
So chic! / Shoes from school uniform?

44
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,080
Giving Mary Jane vibe. / What?

45
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,560
So cool. Last question.

46
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:42,000
Who's the right guy to be your guy?

47
00:03:42,112 --> 00:03:43,113
Right now. I want him right now.

48
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,721
I mean guys from what country? What nationality?

49
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,530
Come on! / I want him right now!

50
00:03:47,563 --> 00:03:49,600
That's it. Okay, thank you so much.

51
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,300
Have a nice day, bye. / Have a nice day.

52
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,960
I need to see styling items for Ida.

53
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,080
See you tonight. / Sure.

54
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,280
I saw your commercial, you're bouncing or something.

55
00:04:03,601 --> 00:04:04,602
So funny.

56
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,200
I don't like it one bit.

57
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,577
They didn't tell me when they reached out to me that

58
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:11,284
it would turn out to be this funny.

59
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,440
Well, you made funny song.

60
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,880
And the commercial just matched the vibe. That's why people

61
00:04:17,961 --> 00:04:20,120
think that it's funny. Why're you so moody?

62
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,360
Look at Kimia, she's so gorgeous.

63
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,440
I just want to be pretty like her.

64
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,480
I understand you.

65
00:04:44,463 --> 00:04:47,200
Hey, are you free tonight?

66
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,961
Yeah.

67
00:04:49,283 --> 00:04:52,840
I'm gonna take you to showbiz.

68
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,691
Have you ever heard of

69
00:04:55,437 --> 00:04:56,760
Cobra House?

70
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,881
What?

71
00:05:08,123 --> 00:05:10,200
You said you're gonna take me to showbiz

72
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,560
but you invited me here for Mookrata?

73
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,441
Want some?

74
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:35,960
I don't know how to smoke cigarettes.

75
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,680
Oh my gosh!

76
00:05:38,403 --> 00:05:41,680
This is not just a cigarette. Don't you know that this is

77
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,360
a golden ticket to get into showbiz?

78
00:05:45,517 --> 00:05:49,080
You think that I'm that talented

79
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,440
to help out Ida?

80
00:05:52,757 --> 00:05:56,050
When you're drunk, you'll strip off your social status,

81
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,640
your mask, your everything

82
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,280
and you can be your trueself.

83
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,240
When you're getting drunk with someone and you're matching up their vibes,

84
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:09,050
then the rest will fall into places smoothly, you hear me?

85
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,280
There're so much for you to learn.

86
00:06:24,337 --> 00:06:26,840
Attagirl!

87
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,760
Bitch! You're done?

88
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,560
You're taking too long!

89
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:42,920
Let me get a refill.

90
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,040
What's with the face?

91
00:06:48,257 --> 00:06:50,640
Can I ask you something. / What is it?

92
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,200
You have long hair, why don't you get a boob job?

93
00:06:55,697 --> 00:06:59,680
I like the way I am. I feel confident with this body.

94
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,250
Look at my sexy body moving.

95
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,960
What's going on? You want some boobs?

96
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,050
Want to get bigger boobs? / I don't know.

97
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,840
I want people to come talking to me like Ida, look.

98
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,750
Since she got her boobs done,

99
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,960
men are chasing her like crazy, like non-stop crazy.

100
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,200
Listen to me, Ida saw herself with big boobs

101
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,250
and I saw myself without big boobs.

102
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,120
You need to ask yourself about it.

103
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,080
I don't know

104
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,440
which way is the right one for me.

105
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,320
I just feel lonely.

106
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,080
You're lonely? / Yeah.

107
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,481
Listen to me,

108
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,601
The first thing you gotta do is to

109
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,000
forget about your ex first, then you can think about the next one.

110
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,320
Ouch! Too harsh.

111
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,800
Bambi, you done?

112
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,600
I'm coming.

113
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,640
Look at your outfit, it's hard to wear.

114
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,000
Come with me.

115
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,481
Where ?

116
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,080
Sorry, excuse me.

117
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,760
Mother, this is my friend, Bambi.

118
00:08:18,183 --> 00:08:22,080
Her look is styled by me. / OMG! Turn around!

119
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,400
Yes! Yes! And Yes! / You think we should include her in shooting next week?

120
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,640
It could turn out great.  / Wait.

121
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,800
Yeah. I can see it.

122
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,280
It's gonna be a shooting next week.

123
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,880
They're looking for new faces.

124
00:08:40,963 --> 00:08:43,080
Yeah? / I think you are it.

125
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,600
You look great today. / Really?

126
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,691
Yup. / Really.

127
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,280
Why would I lie?

128
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,360
So right, just right.

129
00:08:51,517 --> 00:08:53,040
What do you say? / I'm in.

130
00:08:55,097 --> 00:08:56,920
See you next week, honey.

131
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,360
Okay. / Let's dance.

132
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:04,720
Hi, how are you?

133
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,440
Forget about your ex first.

134
00:09:33,097 --> 00:09:35,200
Tokyo, the city of fashion,

135
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,320
wasn't built in a day,

136
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,443
but he was built with love

137
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,320
and understanding from both Mom and Dad.

138
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,121
The CSR project that our engineers installed

139
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:47,600
solar cell panels in Tak was completed.

140
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,960
That's right. The villagers are happy about it.

141
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,520
I gotta go, I'll inform you about the updates later.

142
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,080
No matter how nature created Tokyo

143
00:09:56,377 --> 00:10:00,200
but to be surrounded by unconditional love like this

144
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,160
has formed Tokyo

145
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:06,320
to be a person who can love oneself wholeheartedly.

146
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,800
What do you think? You like it?

147
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,800
Let me help you with that. / Here.

148
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,801
So pretty.

149
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,200
You can wear whatever you like.

150
00:10:16,343 --> 00:10:18,080
You're my angel no matter what.

151
00:10:23,163 --> 00:10:26,360
But our lives can't be completed with just loving yourselves.

152
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,600
Foreign exchange students camp, USA / When starting your reproductive years,

153
00:10:33,121 --> 00:10:35,280
you will start liking others, hoping that / Hey!

154
00:10:35,357 --> 00:10:36,920
they will like you back. / You picked the same thing.

155
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,000
To meet Jay, his middle school classmate, in another side of the world, / I picked it first.

156
00:10:45,283 --> 00:10:48,400
loneliness caused people to long for familiar faces. / What is it?

157
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,651
You hand is freezing.

158
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,080
Aren't you cold? It's freezing outside.

159
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,760
And they started to get closer.

160
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,411
You feel warmer?

161
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,760
What is it?

162
00:11:00,883 --> 00:11:03,720
Your hands are freezing too. Can't you get anything warmer?

163
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,251
What about this?

164
00:11:19,857 --> 00:11:20,858
Just a little.

165
00:11:22,617 --> 00:11:23,680
Hey, Jay!

166
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,300
You're not hanging out outside with Pod.

167
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:28,560
Sure. Let's go.

168
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,440
But getting closer didn't mean that he'd think of you like that.

169
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,600
You haven't eaten yet?

170
00:11:34,797 --> 00:11:37,280
I'll have some outside. / Okay, let's go.

171
00:11:37,398 --> 00:11:38,399
Let's go.

172
00:11:38,837 --> 00:11:42,120
People can't choose how they were born, but we can choose

173
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:46,440
how we could accept ourselves or change ourselves

174
00:11:46,543 --> 00:11:48,360
so that someone would see our values.

175
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,381
I'm not sure about photo shooting.

176
00:11:58,977 --> 00:11:59,978
It's okay. I'll help you out.

177
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,001
See you tomorrow, fashion people.

178
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,411
This one is cute.

179
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,880
This one'd suit you well.

180
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:14,080
Julia Fox once said that

181
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,840
fashion is fun.

182
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,560
It's more than just beauty of cuteness.

183
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:24,480
If you can tell your stories through clothes

184
00:12:26,363 --> 00:12:27,720
then you're a genius.

185
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,320
Fashion is also a political statement.

186
00:12:44,117 --> 00:12:46,600
All done. / Thank you.

187
00:12:48,457 --> 00:12:50,960
Well, well, well… long time no see.

188
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,640
Who decided not to show up?

189
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,050
Are you still have to join the shooting?

190
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,680
Not amymore. I'm done.

191
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,360
We can see each other more often.

192
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,800
What is it with Mhong?

193
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,880
Did you talk to him?

194
00:13:29,277 --> 00:13:30,960
I haven't talked to him.

195
00:13:38,523 --> 00:13:40,360
Actually, it's my song.

196
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,640
I should love it.

197
00:13:59,443 --> 00:14:02,000
Can you please change the music?

198
00:14:02,144 --> 00:14:03,640
Okay. / Thanks.

199
00:14:16,443 --> 00:14:19,040
After this,

200
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,320
I'm going to audition in a play.

201
00:14:21,647 --> 00:14:24,160
Yeah? For real?

202
00:14:25,057 --> 00:14:27,920
You have time for that?

203
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,520
Not really. Busy as usual.

204
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,720
But from what you said the other day,

205
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,480
I had enough courage to ask them.

206
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,760
Thank you so much.

207
00:14:53,303 --> 00:14:58,000
Can I get free tickets in advance?

208
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,880
Give me 500.

209
00:15:05,643 --> 00:15:06,644
Joking.

210
00:15:21,883 --> 00:15:25,600
Do you think Tokyo is acting strange lately?

211
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,171
I see.

212
00:15:32,237 --> 00:15:33,470
Someone is in love.

213
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,320
Were you just talking about me?

214
00:15:35,557 --> 00:15:37,400
Nope. Nothing.

215
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,480
I heard that, you bitch! / You're eavesdropping?

216
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:43,120
I heard you two loud and clear. It's not like you're whispering.

217
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,200
Let's go. / Go ahead.

218
00:15:48,497 --> 00:15:50,120
I'll catch up later. / See you.

219
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,080
Love stinks.

220
00:15:53,323 --> 00:15:54,960
You're in love?

221
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,200
Are you going to the foreign exchange students reunion?

222
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,451
I miss you, really want to see you there.

223
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,311
What if they do this?

224
00:16:27,003 --> 00:16:28,004
Good.

225
00:16:28,217 --> 00:16:29,440
Turn the other side.

226
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,240
Your leg, move your leg.

227
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,480
Easy there. / Don't look up.

228
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,071
Easy, easy.

229
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:48,080
I think you look a little too stiff. / Right.

230
00:16:48,317 --> 00:16:50,560
Can you smile with your eyes, not your lips. / Right.

231
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,280
Bambi, I think you should pose with no hands.

232
00:16:53,563 --> 00:16:56,250
Easy, you need to pose it gently.

233
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,160
Relax yoru lips. Smile through your eyes.

234
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,200
Smile with your eyes, but not too much.

235
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:06,811
Okay, let's give it a try.

236
00:17:09,183 --> 00:17:11,240
You're still stiff, Bambi.

237
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:13,280
Please relax it.

238
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,600
We should close it.

239
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,400
I don't think it'd work.

240
00:17:23,223 --> 00:17:24,880
I don't think I get it.

241
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,200
Bitch, you keep saying that you don't get it. When will you get it?

242
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,560
Just give it another try, you're here already.

243
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,720
You think so?

244
00:17:35,823 --> 00:17:38,720
You can do it. I believe in you.

245
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,201
Let's try it.

246
00:17:42,023 --> 00:17:44,000
Okay? Give me your best shot.

247
00:17:44,423 --> 00:17:47,880
Smile with your eyes, be seductive.

248
00:17:48,913 --> 00:17:50,050
Wow! Looking great.

249
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,600
Look at her eyes.

250
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:56,960
This is great, I like it.

251
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,920
Got pictures already.

252
00:18:06,017 --> 00:18:07,760
It's getting better. / Better.

253
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,160
Let me fix her hair.

254
00:18:09,957 --> 00:18:11,800
She can feel it. / She can.

255
00:18:12,437 --> 00:18:14,120
That's right. It's getting better.

256
00:18:14,857 --> 00:18:17,160
Give me more attitude. / Give strong attitude.

257
00:18:17,693 --> 00:18:19,400
Great. / So great.

258
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,600
Wow! Your friend is super great.

259
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,200
I told you.

260
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:26,640
This is the best, I'm about to burst. / You're bursting?

261
00:18:26,663 --> 00:18:28,564
So spicy / Spicy!

262
00:18:30,183 --> 00:18:31,560
You can move.

263
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,400
Finally. / You're so pretty.

264
00:18:39,363 --> 00:18:40,680
She's my girl!

265
00:18:41,317 --> 00:18:43,160
See? I told you that you could do it.

266
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,680
I really like this feeling.

267
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,720
Can I be fashion people now?

268
00:18:52,217 --> 00:18:56,160
Breaking news! Photoshoot of Bambi and Pure will be showcased at this exhibition.

269
00:18:56,237 --> 00:18:58,040
You're all invited.

270
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,010
Woah! / Super!

271
00:19:00,043 --> 00:19:01,044
Are you really excited, Lukjan?

272
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:05,360
I'm inviting you all, are you coming? / Sorry, need to go to Germany with my grandma.

273
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,600
Pure, you and I have somewhere to be that day. So No.

274
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,720
Damn, can't go.

275
00:19:09,937 --> 00:19:12,280
Diesel? / I don't think he'd go. He only plays games.

276
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,800
So it's just gonna be Bambi and I, right?

277
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,411
You're free? / Super free.

278
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,481
What should I wear? / Don't sweat it. I got you.

279
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,560
But I need to see a man first.

280
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,121
Fine.

281
00:19:43,597 --> 00:19:45,320
Tokyo, hi.

282
00:19:45,963 --> 00:19:48,480
Hurry up. / Sorry.

283
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:52,320
You're always late. / Don't tell me off, do we need to boil tomatoes?

284
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,561
You don't eat spicy foods?

285
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,720
You think? / No idea.

286
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,640
You're always joking.

287
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,280
You SUPER LUV'ED me.

288
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,100
If I didn't, you wouldn't see me.

289
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,160
I'd be blended in with some other guys.

290
00:20:07,277 --> 00:20:09,680
When did you come back from the US? I didn't know.

291
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,761
You didn't?

292
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,200
You didn't care about me.

293
00:20:15,003 --> 00:20:16,640
You care that I didn't care?

294
00:20:16,703 --> 00:20:18,920
Stop playing around. / What is it?

295
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,700
I'm not.

296
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,503
Let's take a picture. / Come on.

297
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,360
Let's get closer. / Can you bend a little for me?

298
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,251
One..two…three.

299
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:38,600
One..two…three.

300
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,120
One..two…three.

301
00:20:46,483 --> 00:20:48,240
Can you check them? / I should check them.

302
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,520
Can I see the pictures? / Sure.

303
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:01,440
Hello, where are you at? I'm about to leave.

304
00:21:02,203 --> 00:21:05,480
Diesel, I'm not in the mood right now, okay? Rain check?

305
00:21:07,903 --> 00:21:09,120
What? What happened?

306
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,320
But I booked the restaurant already.

307
00:21:11,423 --> 00:21:12,680
Can you just cancel it?

308
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,360
I'll take you to a fine dining restaurant later, okay?

309
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,361
Cancel what? Where're you at? / Bye.

310
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,560
What the fuck!

311
00:21:30,423 --> 00:21:32,800
You can go hang out with your friend, I can wait.

312
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:39,280
Don't you say a f--king word.

313
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,680
Are you online to play?

314
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,400
Let's play.

315
00:21:54,037 --> 00:21:55,038
I'm about to leave my place.

316
00:21:56,597 --> 00:21:57,598
Why're you calling me?

317
00:21:59,137 --> 00:22:01,200
Hey, wanna hang out?

318
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,121
Dream?

319
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,881
It's me, Diesel.

320
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,711
Nainoi (Little Boss)

321
00:22:51,797 --> 00:22:52,880
Hey! Wait!

322
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,241
Where're you going?

323
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,440
Something is coming up. Sorry. / Urgent?

324
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,640
But you wanted to eat here.

325
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,040
What's your deal? I drove all the way here.

326
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,040
You can drive to get here and you can drive to get back.

327
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,920
It shouldn't be a burden to someone like you.

328
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:16,520
Someone like me?

329
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,040
I don't think this is the reason.

330
00:23:20,157 --> 00:23:21,920
What's going on? You can tell me frankly.

331
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:31,640
I don't like your father.

332
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,240
He sued people and sent them to jail for nothing, many people.

333
00:23:38,703 --> 00:23:40,200
You think I'm a big fan of my Dad?

334
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,720
I am the one who invited you out, not my Dad.

335
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,440
And you were the one who told me not to judge people.

336
00:23:48,923 --> 00:23:49,924
Look at you.

337
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,440
What is it called? So good.

338
00:24:10,263 --> 00:24:12,480
You've never had spicy clams growing up? Like how?

339
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,600
How're you getting back home? Will your Dad pick you up?

340
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,120
He can't fucking come here.

341
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,840
I can give you a ride.

342
00:24:38,123 --> 00:24:39,124
No need to.

343
00:24:39,943 --> 00:24:41,080
I can take a bus.

344
00:24:42,057 --> 00:24:43,680
Why would you trouble yourself by doing that?

345
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,600
Fine, if you don't want me to give you a ride, I can call you a cab.

346
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:48,920
No need to.

347
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,520
I said no need to.

348
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,311
We have to wait.

349
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,600
So you don't like your Dad?

350
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,280
You want to compete? What level?

351
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,561
99

352
00:25:16,457 --> 00:25:17,560
Woah! To the max.

353
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,601
Why did you hate him?

354
00:25:29,157 --> 00:25:30,800
What if your Mom was in jail,

355
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,600
would you help her out, if you were a dad?

356
00:25:34,723 --> 00:25:35,724
Sure I will.

357
00:25:36,877 --> 00:25:38,000
My Dad won't.

358
00:25:58,923 --> 00:25:59,924
This one?

359
00:26:30,437 --> 00:26:31,438
Action.

360
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,920
I'm so fucking tired of this kind of life.

361
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,000
Today I held a pen

362
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,320
and I run down the stairs for 11 floors,

363
00:26:49,743 --> 00:26:51,600
then I stopped at the window.

364
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:52,778
DAD!

365
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,561
LISTEN TO ME!

366
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,960
Why did I bother to work at this stupid office?

367
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,760
I don't even want to.

368
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:02,840
What I like is not here.

369
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,760
What I like is over there.

370
00:27:06,063 --> 00:27:07,064
CUT!

371
00:27:16,463 --> 00:27:19,800
Tang, they gave me the part, they really liked it.

372
00:27:20,603 --> 00:27:21,604
I see.

373
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,680
I'm glad to see you happy.

374
00:27:25,921 --> 00:27:27,640
But..

375
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,040
They sent me the schedule. / And?

376
00:27:32,257 --> 00:27:33,320
It's quite a lot.

377
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,760
Can you help me with the time management?

378
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,280
I can boost my energy here.

379
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,960
Please? / You don't have enough on your plate already? You don't even have time to eat.

380
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,560
Fine, I'll talk with Joe.

381
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:53,440
But you need to work on your BL couple.

382
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,920
They wanted you to boost up your chemisty with him.

383
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,640
If you can do it, I believe that

384
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,440
you two can go further than this.

385
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,680
You know that I try.

386
00:28:07,683 --> 00:28:10,560
Here, have some.

387
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,961
We still have more to go.

388
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,041
I'm hungry.

389
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,120
Slow down.

390
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,720
Let's go. / Thank you.

391
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,560
I'll be there in a minute.

392
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,080
Hello?

393
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,050
Bambi? You're free?

394
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,280
Why do you want to meet after everyone left?

395
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,520
I passed the audition for the play.

396
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,120
The director really liked me.

397
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,160
I'm so glad.

398
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,160
Thank you so much.

399
00:29:44,497 --> 00:29:45,498
What are you doing?

400
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,441
What is it?

401
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:50,164
What are you doing?

402
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,360
If you don't think of me that way, don't do it.

403
00:30:17,323 --> 00:30:19,240
But I think of you that way.

404
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,560
What about you?

405
00:30:27,957 --> 00:30:28,958
Do you think the same?

406
00:30:59,277 --> 00:31:00,278
Should we go?

407
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,880
Bambi..

408
00:31:26,203 --> 00:31:27,520
Will you be my girlfriend?

409
00:32:33,397 --> 00:32:35,680
Let's go. / I'll walk you off.

410
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:48,840
So chic!

411
00:32:48,957 --> 00:32:50,760
See you later. / Sure.

412
00:32:50,823 --> 00:32:52,400
See ya. / I'll see you later.

413
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,200
Well, you famous star.

414
00:33:00,403 --> 00:33:04,240
From being Princess of Trash to your new look.

415
00:33:04,437 --> 00:33:06,400
Oh my goodness!

416
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,137
My model. / How are you, sis?

417
00:33:10,223 --> 00:33:13,800
Love your outfit. / Who's your stylist?

418
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,880
Of course it's you. But who styled you anyway?

419
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,601
Why?

420
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:25,481
Sweet look. I haven't seen you like this before.

421
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:28,200
I want to look pretty, so what?

422
00:33:28,403 --> 00:33:29,404
Spread positive energy

423
00:33:29,997 --> 00:33:30,998
in negative ways.

424
00:33:32,183 --> 00:33:34,720
Well, you look beautiful, I didn't say otherwise.

425
00:33:59,883 --> 00:34:02,840
Hey, Miss Duangtawan is here.

426
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,960
Who is she?

427
00:34:08,443 --> 00:34:10,560
She's the owner of Devi.

428
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:13,160
This is a witch of fashion world.

429
00:34:13,363 --> 00:34:16,920
When she comments on someone, they will either be famous or a flop.

430
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,400
Who can impress her

431
00:34:19,523 --> 00:34:21,400
will be a bigger star like Kimia.

432
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:29,120
I need to say hi to her. See you.

433
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,561
You go and say hi.

434
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,101
No. You go and say hi.

435
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,930
Duangtawan, hello.

436
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,120
How is it? Do you like it?

437
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,801
It's nice.

438
00:34:49,803 --> 00:34:50,960
This girl is good.

439
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,441
You know her?

440
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,840
Of course I know her.

441
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,561
Bambi..

442
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,960
Hello. / She's my friend.

443
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,681
I'll let you two talk.

444
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,760
Hello, Miss Duangtawan.

445
00:35:17,637 --> 00:35:18,800
My name is Bambi.

446
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,011
This is a great photo.

447
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:23,531
Thank you.

448
00:35:28,737 --> 00:35:29,738
Jib,

449
00:35:30,657 --> 00:35:32,100
her outfit is cute.

450
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,700
Did you put it together by yourself?

451
00:35:46,703 --> 00:35:48,600
Yes. / You're good.

452
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,360
No stylist?

453
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,240
Nothing.

454
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,650
If I have a chance, I'd really love to work with you.

455
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,081
Are you free tonight?

456
00:36:10,017 --> 00:36:11,018
Yes, I am.

457
00:36:14,757 --> 00:36:15,758
Free tonight?

458
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,600
I'm outside, about to head home, what's up? / Yeah?

459
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,101
Can I see you?

460
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,160
What? Why? / I want to see you.

461
00:36:24,257 --> 00:36:26,680
Get water in

462
00:36:26,823 --> 00:36:30,040
and interaction happens inside.

463
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,801
Don't take it off.

464
00:37:00,743 --> 00:37:01,744
I'll do it now.

465
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,560
Just relax.

466
00:37:26,803 --> 00:37:28,120
Mine is barely getting hard.

467
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,081
Can we change position?

468
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,000
Go ahead.

469
00:37:53,203 --> 00:37:54,104
Feel so fucking good.

470
00:38:05,703 --> 00:38:06,704
Fucking good.

471
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,600
Let me ask you something.

472
00:38:29,597 --> 00:38:32,040
You know that

473
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,040
I really like you.

474
00:38:38,161 --> 00:38:40,040
You're gonna see me as

475
00:38:41,263 --> 00:38:42,640
a sex object, just like that?

476
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:48,480
It's not like that. / What do you think of me?

477
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:56,771
I like you.

478
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,000
I wanted to flirt with you.

479
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:02,500
But I was too young back then.

480
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:05,840
So I wouldn't dare to.

481
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,240
Stop pouting, okay?

482
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,960
I'll start flirting with you now.

483
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,080
Okay?

484
00:39:15,961 --> 00:39:16,962
I don't know.

485
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,170
Come on, let's cuddle.

486
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,250
Sure, man.

487
00:39:21,323 --> 00:39:23,063
First day of being mine.

488
00:39:25,843 --> 00:39:26,844
You're talking nonsense.

489
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:28,891
Isn't it true?

490
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:31,291
Yup.

491
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,640
You like to play with boobs?

492
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:52,360
Sure, I do.

493
00:40:20,143 --> 00:40:21,144
Hello.

494
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,400
Make yourself at home.

495
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,641
I got my new collection here and some archive pieces.

496
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,040
You can pick your favorite pieces and then

497
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,360
style them for me.

498
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,441
Okay.

499
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,640
Nothing serious, just see it as playing paper dolls.

500
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,801
Right, Jib,

501
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,040
about the meeting…

502
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,080
Why don't you visit my showroom for a Go-See?

503
00:40:53,157 --> 00:40:54,240
What? Go-See?

504
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,080
What the hell did you do to get a Go-See?

505
00:40:57,443 --> 00:40:59,200
Can you tell me what it is?

506
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,000
This is your chance.

507
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,120
If you go to hang out with her

508
00:41:04,217 --> 00:41:07,720
and she likes you, this is your chance to work with her.

509
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,191
Who'd have know,

510
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:12,040
this could be the next DEVI girl.

511
00:41:25,457 --> 00:41:28,120
If everything is all set, then I want to do it next week.

512
00:41:29,103 --> 00:41:31,880
So we don't have to rush it, what about Wednesday?

513
00:41:33,343 --> 00:41:34,320
Sure.

514
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:13,911
Well…

515
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:18,051
it's fine.

516
00:42:22,917 --> 00:42:24,080
What's your passion?

517
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,480
I like fashion.

518
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,320
People who are standing right here have a passion for fashion, all of them.

519
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,520
But what's your other passion beside fashion?

520
00:42:42,997 --> 00:42:46,840
I think I really like fashion, Ms.Duangtawan.

521
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,480
Do you know Tom Ford?

522
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,881
Yes.

523
00:43:00,823 --> 00:43:04,240
Do you know that before Tom Ford became a designer

524
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,003
he liked art history

525
00:43:08,597 --> 00:43:10,360
and architecture.

526
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:15,200
When he started his fashion journey, he used it

527
00:43:15,703 --> 00:43:17,680
to film industry.

528
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,840
It's not enough to have

529
00:43:21,637 --> 00:43:22,920
only one passion for fashion.

530
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,641
And do you know

531
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,560
what Tom Ford didn't like the most in clients coming to buy his clothes?

532
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,920
I don't know.

533
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:53,640
He didn't like it when they bought the whole look

534
00:43:54,523 --> 00:43:56,880
right off the runway looks that he styled them.

535
00:43:59,443 --> 00:44:00,480
Those people

536
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:03,760
don't even know what they like.

537
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,880
They don't even know who they are.

538
00:44:08,881 --> 00:44:10,000
Isn't that pathetic?

539
00:44:12,937 --> 00:44:14,397
I invited you here

540
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,600
because I wanted to get to know you better.

541
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:22,920
But you chose the same look at Kimia.

542
00:44:25,777 --> 00:44:28,120
You wasted my time, you know that?

543
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:33,800
You said that you didn't have any stylist,

544
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,400
were you lying back then?

545
00:44:59,917 --> 00:45:01,640
My friend helped me out.

546
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,440
Some people see

547
00:45:12,121 --> 00:45:14,280
fashion as something so shallow.

548
00:45:15,143 --> 00:45:17,120
Actually, fashion is a way

549
00:45:17,457 --> 00:45:20,520
to tell history, economic,

550
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:24,400
and politics in different ages.

551
00:45:25,263 --> 00:45:26,324
Let me ask you something,

552
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:32,120
models with no thoughts, no knowledge,

553
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,801
full of lies,

554
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,120
or claiming ideas of others,

555
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,640
are no better than clothes hangers, don't you think?

556
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,920
I used to believe that

557
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,320
taste is something ones can learn

558
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,280
but you're the first person

559
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,080
who makes me question about my belief.

560
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:22,960
You can walk back, right?

561
00:46:46,177 --> 00:46:47,250
I feel like

562
00:46:47,557 --> 00:46:50,400
I poured my heart and soul into this work, like really meant it,

563
00:46:50,477 --> 00:46:52,480
I thought I could communicate to the audience,

564
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:54,720
but when it's launched

565
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,920
people didn't get it, they didn't even understand it.

566
00:47:00,177 --> 00:47:01,360
Shine through my mouth.

567
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,240
So I am the only one who gets it.

568
00:47:11,217 --> 00:47:14,440
I will divide my troubles into two piles.

569
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,040
The first one is something that I can manage or control.

570
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,400
And the other one is something that I can't control at all.

571
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,971
Selling nuggets or jokes. / What the heck?

572
00:47:26,101 --> 00:47:27,102
So funny. / Confusing.

573
00:47:28,477 --> 00:47:31,478
This type of problem is the one that

574
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,400
I can't manage or control.

575
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,960
When I know that I can do nothing about it.

576
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:53,800
The only thing you can do is to live in the moment.

577
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,560
I need to live with it.

578
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,080
We don't like ourselves today but

579
00:48:03,337 --> 00:48:03,880
Bambi's new look is the best.

580
00:48:04,037 --> 00:48:08,080
it doesn't mean that we won't like ourselves tomorrow or the days after that.

581
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,321
Face, hair, outfits are well put. / So pretty.

582
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:10,341
She's here to slay. / A star can shine anywhere.

583
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:38,120
We don't like ourselves today but

584
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,680
it doesn't mean that we won't like ourselves tomorrow or the days after that.

585
00:48:45,503 --> 00:48:48,640
Ms.Duangtawan is the one who started it all.

586
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:50,360
I really need to thank her because

587
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,781
nobody knew me five years ago

588
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,700
but she invited me to be her muse.

589
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:59,160
That's when people started to know me better.

590
00:48:59,243 --> 00:49:01,680
And it gave me a chance to work with many global brands.

591
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:12,584
Oh my!

592
00:49:32,077 --> 00:49:35,000
A model who claimed ideas from others

593
00:49:35,808 --> 00:49:38,710
is no better than a clothes hanger, right? - Duangtawan.

594
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:43,160
I wrote a piece, can you share it for me? / I can't.

595
00:49:43,277 --> 00:49:46,120
You haven't talked to her since the fight?

596
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:49,560
When you're super mad, what did you do? / Like this.

597
00:49:55,723 --> 00:49:56,880
Fucking Name!

598
00:49:56,923 --> 00:49:59,320
I met Mhong. / What happened?

599
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,960
What is it like to be a wealthy person?

600
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:06,000
Can I join your Mom's birthday party?
