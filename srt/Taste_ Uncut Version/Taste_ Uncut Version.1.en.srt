1
00:01:12,617 --> 00:01:16,480
Taste, beauty and aesthetics

2
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:19,440
are seemed to be abstract thing to say and hard to understand.

3
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,720
As a matter of fact, everything is based on its principles.

4
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,920
The livings with their outstanding beauty

5
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,960
are likely to have a higher chance to survive and preserve their species.

6
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,600
Beauty is one of various traits to indicate good genes.

7
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,400
Humans are social animals.

8
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,922
Some humans with good taste will be seen better than other humans.

9
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,682
This is the reason why

10
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,921
taste becomes a hidden factor to help categorize

11
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,280
classes in society ingeniously.

12
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,360
To be a special someone in this day and age

13
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,600
comes with many privileges.

14
00:01:54,012 --> 00:01:57,013
Many people want to be special persons by many ways,

15
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,680
either to have good taste

16
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,720
or being tasteless.

17
00:02:04,217 --> 00:02:07,280
Bambi, an ordinary teenage girl,

18
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,320
is someone who is yearning for something special.

19
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,921
(Notifications : Try out for a drum major)

20
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,760
An A-list new actress like Kimiya Issaranee

21
00:02:31,877 --> 00:02:35,160
has turned from being a model to be an international star.

22
00:02:35,337 --> 00:02:36,240
You're so great at this.

23
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,760
I got started in this industry because of Ms.Duangtawan.

24
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,640
I feel truly grateful for her because

25
00:02:40,883 --> 00:02:43,160
she invited me to be a muse of her brand.

26
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,681
(Kimiya's makeup look)

27
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:08,720
Girls, let's go to drum major's try out.

28
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,160
Didn't you put too much makeup under your eyes?

29
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,800
That's right, I don't think the facial scan machine would recognize you.

30
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,800
Well, it's a try out day. I need to look extra cute.

31
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,880
Please, join me. I know you want to.

32
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,600
Am I right, Model?

33
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,320
You want to?

34
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,161
I'm cool with anything.

35
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,360
She wanted to, let's go.

36
00:03:33,063 --> 00:03:34,064
Please?

37
00:03:35,563 --> 00:03:36,600
Please?

38
00:03:39,757 --> 00:03:42,560
Alright everyone, I'll announce the finalists now.

39
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,000
The first one, Khaocheum.

40
00:03:47,803 --> 00:03:48,804
Dollar.

41
00:03:53,223 --> 00:03:54,224
Yogurt.

42
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,791
Model.

43
00:03:59,817 --> 00:04:01,200
And the last one,

44
00:04:04,397 --> 00:04:05,398
Peanut.

45
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,880
The finalists can stay and learn the moves.

46
00:04:10,803 --> 00:04:12,760
We'll have the grand opening of drum majors this Friday.

47
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,320
For those of you who didn't make the cut,

48
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,200
you can stay to be our staffs if you want to, got plenty of works to do.

49
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,501
Let's go.

50
00:04:25,823 --> 00:04:26,824
Model.

51
00:04:32,157 --> 00:04:33,158
Hey,

52
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,161
it's okay.

53
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,240
If you can't make it, then we won't be a part of it either.

54
00:04:40,357 --> 00:04:42,920
Or should we ask them?

55
00:04:43,323 --> 00:04:44,241
You think it'd work?

56
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,400
I think I'll try.

57
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,360
Pin?

58
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,560
Can you give me another shot? I really want this position.

59
00:05:03,183 --> 00:05:05,520
I don't think your appearance is quite suitable for a drum major.

60
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,681
What kind of appearance is the right fit?

61
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,800
I think you look….

62
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,880
too much. It's so unnatural. It's hard to explain.

63
00:05:19,337 --> 00:05:22,840
You can be a staff member this year and we'll see how it goes next year.

64
00:05:29,377 --> 00:05:30,378
Let's go.

65
00:05:50,963 --> 00:05:52,760
Is it cute? / Super cute.

66
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,800
Did you post it? Come on.

67
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,921
You think that

68
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,040
my makeup isn't too much, right?

69
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,800
It's looking good, you're looking good.

70
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,601
Come on, be proud of it.

71
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:21,960
See? It's cute.

72
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:31,240
I see, okay.

73
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:35,280
Bambi, we've got something to do. See you tomorrow.

74
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,840
Don't forget to tag me in the pic, see ya. / See you. Bye.

75
00:07:03,717 --> 00:07:05,440
So cute. / Let's have a look.

76
00:07:05,523 --> 00:07:08,400
I want this one. / Sure, let's go.

77
00:07:59,557 --> 00:08:01,880
For those of you who're  looking for a cram school,

78
00:08:01,977 --> 00:08:04,920
I'd like to recommend The New Standard Prep.

79
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,640
It's more than a good place to learn,

80
00:08:07,037 --> 00:08:08,880
it offers good friends and good community.

81
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,440
More importantly,

82
00:08:10,683 --> 00:08:12,320
Mr.New is the nicest tutor here.

83
00:08:12,377 --> 00:08:14,800
Join me in the class. / See you.

84
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,120

00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,880
It's more than a good place to learn,

Hello / Hello.

91
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,600
Hey, my face is big. So ugly.

92
00:09:08,023 --> 00:09:09,960
Excuse me. / Sorry.

93
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,761
Hey.

94
00:09:18,563 --> 00:09:19,100
Yeah?

95
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,080
What do they teach here?

96
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,000
Right, they focus on SAT and IELTS tests to submit for international courses in colleges.

97
00:09:29,441 --> 00:09:30,400
Is it costly?

98
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,291
Here, have a look.

99
00:09:40,617 --> 00:09:43,280
It costs 30,000 baht per person for private class?

100
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,910
Well, international courses, you know?

101
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,520
If you're looking for the similar courses, you can check out other places,

102
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,120
they have similar lessons.

103
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,091
What?

104
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,160
Why did you choose this place?

105
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,800
I….

106
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,720
I see.

107
00:10:13,297 --> 00:10:17,240
I didn't pay for it, they ask me to promote the place.

108
00:10:18,043 --> 00:10:21,680
But my classmates are all in for good connections.

109
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,640
It's quite costly but you got a whole new group of friends.

110
00:10:25,643 --> 00:10:27,337
Like you've never hung out with before.

111
00:10:27,857 --> 00:10:28,960
I think it's great.

112
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,480
You're right. They all look like somebody to me.

113
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,640
Is that Thara's son? A minister?

114
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,560
That's right. His name is Diesel. He's in my class.

115
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,560
That's Lukjan, an heiress of airline business, you know her?

116
00:10:45,977 --> 00:10:46,978
So pretty.

117
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,400
You think? / Yep.

118
00:10:49,723 --> 00:10:50,724
And…

119
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,231
you are….

120
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,960
My name's Pure.

121
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,200
I see. / And you're?

122
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,960
I'm Bambi.

123
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,280
Bambi, alright. / Yes.

124
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,120
Good. See you later.

125
00:11:11,823 --> 00:11:13,840
Bambi, okay. / Bye.

126
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,641
What're you doing?

127
00:11:28,197 --> 00:11:29,200
I'm playing this.

128
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,960
Can I try?

129
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,640
Nope. It's 30,000 !

130
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,880
I think it's too expensive.

131
00:11:39,017 --> 00:11:41,240
Well, it's private tuturoing class.

132
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,640
I checked out this place and it's not like the other places.

133
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,480
it offers good friends and good connection.

134
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,277
So you want to join

135
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,800
because you want to study for find friends.

136
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,000
You have friends in school.

137
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,200
Can you just be patient?

138
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,600
You're in 11th grade, you'll graduate soon. / That's right.

139
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,600
Cram schools are all the same.

140
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:05,840
Listen  to your mom.

141
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:09,000
If you earn money, you can pick your own school.

142
00:12:16,957 --> 00:12:19,441
Hey, you free this afternoon?

143
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,960
I'm so bored, let's watch a movie.

144
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,440
What's wrong?

145
00:12:34,017 --> 00:12:37,080
I saw it yesterday, spill it.

146
00:12:44,943 --> 00:12:47,880
I….We decided to be drum majors.

147
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,200
Pin asked us to join

148
00:12:54,703 --> 00:12:55,840
She was worried about not enough people to fill in.

149
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,520
But you said that you wouldn't do it.

150
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,920
Well, she asked us to, I wouldn't dare to say no.

151
00:13:10,977 --> 00:13:13,840
Come on, it's fine.

152
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,360
Don't be mad. We can watch a movie after practice.

153
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,017
Please? / Or you want to do something?

154
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,520
Right, you want to do something?

155
00:13:33,623 --> 00:13:34,680
Hey! Bambi!

156
00:13:35,683 --> 00:13:37,480
You're heading to a drum major practice?

157
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,400
I was about to ask you.

158
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,960
Why did you decide to be their staff member?

159
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,320
They told you to do this and that, so tired.

160
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,520
And you got nothing in return.

161
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,040
Sure I do. They'd see my face so often and I'd get picked next year.

162
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,360
There must be some other way.

163
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,000
Sometimes we don't have a lot of choices.

164
00:14:44,437 --> 00:14:46,438
Hey, we ordered milk tea

165
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,840
and rider's here, can you pick up for us?

166
00:14:49,077 --> 00:14:50,078
Please?

167
00:14:52,903 --> 00:14:53,904
Where is he?

168
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:12,680
Milk tea's here, everyone.

169
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,680
You want some?

170
00:15:15,657 --> 00:15:18,040
Which one's for me? / Less sugar.

171
00:15:18,058 --> 00:15:19,640
Where's the less sugar one? / Where is it?

172
00:15:22,103 --> 00:15:23,104
Hey!

173
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,400
it just a quick break, Yogurt and Model.

174
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,041
You two asked for another chance from me.

175
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,880
Can you show me that you really want it?

176
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,521
Thank you, Ms.Duen.

177
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,680
What Duen?

178
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,141
It's nothing.

179
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,840
It's just a long time ago.

180
00:15:56,063 --> 00:15:57,720
Spill it, come on.

181
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,081
Tell. / Tell us.

182
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,300
Alright, alright. Bambi and I used to be classmates back in the day.

183
00:16:09,163 --> 00:16:10,164
Peanut!

184
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,651
Hi.

185
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,600
Mom, can you take my jacket home? It's hot.

186
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,840
Are you sure? / Yep.

187
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,280
Did you forget something.

188
00:16:26,617 --> 00:16:28,080
Thank you, Ms.Duen.

189
00:16:35,983 --> 00:16:37,800
Why did she wear the same clothes as her?

190
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,320
Enjoy your movie.

191
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,160
Thanks, bye.

192
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:48,160
Are they siblings?

193
00:16:49,337 --> 00:16:50,338
Let's go.

194
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,720
In a world full of special someone,

195
00:16:53,923 --> 00:16:55,640
Bambi has never realized that

196
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,600
her ordinary life would be her weakness.

197
00:17:03,703 --> 00:17:04,720
Can you hold it for me?

198
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,091
Sure.

199
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,800
Bambi, can you hold it for me?

200
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,440
Bambi, can you hold it for me?

201
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,560
Thank you, Ms.Duen.

202
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,600
Stop making jokes about Ms.Duen.

203
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,680
She raised me.

204
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:28,264
Let's go.

205
00:17:32,617 --> 00:17:34,680
Why did you want to throw them away?

206
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,121
Don't care about what other people say.

207
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,050
Be confident.

208
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,760
If we're confident, then we can wear anything.

209
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:48,080
We're not celebs, we don't have to follow other people.

210
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,040
This is nonsense.

211
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,920
The sadder part is that the adults see

212
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,160
your crumbling world as nonsense.

213
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,283
Bambi has tried everything to run away from her ordinary life

214
00:18:05,443 --> 00:18:07,800
and she's always seeking  for something special.

215
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:09,600
Holy! Aint that too harsh?

216
00:18:09,863 --> 00:18:12,200
Whatever, it's nothing.

217
00:18:42,697 --> 00:18:45,600
Model won't wear dress made from recycled items anymore.

218
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,520
She's gonna be a drum major instead, what a bitch!

219
00:18:49,303 --> 00:18:53,480
What? Who would keep this dress? It's too huge.

220
00:18:57,743 --> 00:19:01,000
Bitch! You weren't supposed to wear this uniform today. No shame at all?

221
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,800
So what? I still can shine. It's something new, you know?

222
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:07,280
That TikTok clip you posted of me this morning,

223
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,080
it's famous now, thousands of people liked it.

224
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,991
Film me another clip, okay?

225
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:15,000
1…2…3…

226
00:19:20,017 --> 00:19:22,400
What? Who would keep this dress?

227
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:28,120
Model won't wear dress made from recycled items anymore.

228
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,640
She's gonna be a drum major instead, what a bitch!

229
00:19:29,723 --> 00:19:31,430
You're the one asking for another chance.

230
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,510
No shame at all?

231
00:19:34,797 --> 00:19:36,347
What? Who would keep this dress?

232
00:19:36,433 --> 00:19:38,000
We don't have so many choices.

233
00:19:38,883 --> 00:19:40,480
Hey, I'll keep the dress.

234
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,480
Everyone, let's go to the gate.

235
00:19:56,037 --> 00:19:57,038
What is it?

236
00:20:21,337 --> 00:20:24,720
The contest for recycled items dresses are next Friday, right?

237
00:20:26,037 --> 00:20:27,360
Like a queen.

238
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,880
Hello, kids.

239
00:20:30,423 --> 00:20:32,560
Your princess will tell you a story.

240
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,751
Do you want to hear it?

241
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,081
Search : Bambi Princess of Trash.

242
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:40,040
Do you believe that school for princess is real?

243
00:20:40,177 --> 00:20:42,760
You don't, do you? Let's have a look.

244
00:20:43,063 --> 00:20:46,520
Hello, kids. Let's eat like a princess.

245
00:20:48,597 --> 00:20:49,598
I'm trying to watch my weight

246
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,160
so I'll have this one and this little rice. / And eat it like this.

247
00:20:58,237 --> 00:21:00,960
Oh my, Bambi girl, you're just right. So right.

248
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,320
The only thing wrong about you is you wore this dress on the wrong date.

249
00:21:04,487 --> 00:21:06,760
And now you got a new content and it went viral.

250
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,840
#Princessoftrash.

251
00:21:10,743 --> 00:21:12,960
Let's eat with the princess.

252
00:21:13,143 --> 00:21:15,440
Let's eat with the princess.

253
00:21:16,637 --> 00:21:18,200
#Princessoftrash.

254
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:26,680
Hello?

255
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,360
You want my princess attitude when trying your new dipping sauces?

256
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,881
Sure I can.

257
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,080
Hello, today, Princess Bambi will review

258
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,760
dipping sauce in cheddar cheese flavor,

259
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,560
made from the real cheese from the Netherlands.

260
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,080
Looks so good.

261
00:21:44,397 --> 00:21:45,600
Let me cut it in pieces.

262
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,920
Hello, today, Princess Bambi will review…

263
00:21:58,063 --> 00:22:00,480
Thank you Princess Nong Nune.

264
00:22:10,197 --> 00:22:12,720
Hi, you're so pretty, can I get a picture with you?

265
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,520
Thanks.

266
00:22:15,663 --> 00:22:18,920
Bambi dear, I really love your videos.

267
00:22:22,183 --> 00:22:23,240
Everyone,

268
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:27,000
we're activists from environment club in Thada Wittaya School.

269
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,680
We disagree with the contest of recycled items dresses tomorrow.

270
00:22:31,921 --> 00:22:35,360
Who're with me? Please raise your shoes.

271
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,320
From what I saw last year,

272
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,121
what did we do after the contest?

273
00:22:39,223 --> 00:22:41,280
We threw away the dresses.

274
00:22:41,397 --> 00:22:44,250
Who picked up trashes from last year would understand.

275
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:47,120
We don't want the recycled items contest.

276
00:22:47,243 --> 00:22:50,080
Raise your shoe if you're with me on this.

277
00:22:50,223 --> 00:22:51,837
Come on, do it with no shame.

278
00:22:51,933 --> 00:22:53,600
No fake recycled items.

279
00:22:53,677 --> 00:22:57,080
No fake recycled items. / Why're you so dramatic?

280
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:01,250
They organize this contest every year. They'll take care of it.

281
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,040
I picked up the trash and it's tired, you bitch!

282
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,400
You don't like it?

283
00:23:07,237 --> 00:23:08,920
No fake recycled items.

284
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,840
No fake recycled items.

285
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,251
Hello?

286
00:23:17,057 --> 00:23:18,680
What? I'm going ot POPA?

287
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:24,404
Okay.

288
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:31,960
We are Strawberry Morrakot.

289
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,480
And the Best Alternative of the Year award goes to…

290
00:23:35,703 --> 00:23:37,160
BOY MARX.

291
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,560
I knew that I would win this award.

292
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:45,440
Hi, I'm FLUKKARON, please say hi to my vlog.

293
00:23:45,517 --> 00:23:48,640
We're so happy to win Girl Group of the Year award.

294
00:23:48,737 --> 00:23:53,640
And we're sorry for all the mistakes. Thanks.

295
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,480
We're about to shoot our first series.

296
00:23:56,637 --> 00:23:58,100
Please support us.

297
00:23:58,143 --> 00:24:00,144
Thank you to all of our fans

299
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,040
Princess of Trash.

300
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,960
I listened to your podcasts all the time.

301
00:24:23,063 --> 00:24:25,360
Thank you. / Can I get a picture with you?

302
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,480
Thanks. / Thanks.

303
00:24:37,723 --> 00:24:39,360
Wait, what's your name?

304
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,480
Hold on one sec.

305
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:47,160
Yo! Bambi!

306
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,520
Mhong! / Bambi!

307
00:24:54,657 --> 00:24:57,088
Long time no see. / I know.

308
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,520
How many years?

309
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:01,000
Since covid,

310
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,120
I've transferred school closed to my house.

311
00:25:04,617 --> 00:25:07,000
And I help out my mom with her noodles stand.

312
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:08,584
So busy.

313
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,480
You should come by.

314
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,280
It'll be my treat.

315
00:25:15,703 --> 00:25:17,320
Why're you here?

316
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:22,000
I'm a trainee in Bangkok Banger.

317
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:24,480
Trainee? / Yep.

318
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,360
It's because of you.

319
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:32,760
Are you heading to an after party?

320
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:46,120
You want to join me?

321
00:25:47,243 --> 00:25:48,244
I can take you.

322
00:25:48,323 --> 00:25:49,137
You sure?

323
00:25:49,263 --> 00:25:50,264
No!

324
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,720
Why, bro? Why can't you let her in?

325
00:25:53,403 --> 00:25:56,720
She's on on the guest list.

326
00:25:57,543 --> 00:26:00,200
I can't let her in.

327
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,760
Well, she's here already.

328
00:26:02,837 --> 00:26:05,080
Look at her dress, please let her in.

329
00:26:06,036 --> 00:26:07,037
That's fine.

330
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,157
It's okay.

331
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,920
I'm sorry I can't help you.

332
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,080
Are you heading back? If so, I'll send you off.

333
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:20,800
It's okay. You should get in. / You sure?

334
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,271
See you later.

335
00:26:26,637 --> 00:26:27,720
Your arm please?

336
00:26:51,917 --> 00:26:52,918
You can't get in.

337
00:26:54,717 --> 00:26:57,440
Why's that? My name is on the list.

338
00:26:57,877 --> 00:26:59,720
Men can wear tank tops.

339
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:03,691
Excuse me?

340
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,120
Did you just assume my gender?

341
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,471
Huh?

342
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:10,760
They all know that I'm not really men.

343
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:15,280
And this is not a regular tank top.

344
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,360
It's Helmut Lang.

345
00:27:20,457 --> 00:27:23,120
You're a man, so no. Look at this!

346
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,720
Fine.

347
00:27:27,037 --> 00:27:28,038
Fuck.

348
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,520
I'm here, you have a jacket?

349
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:36,920
Security guards are tough crowd.

350
00:27:40,203 --> 00:27:43,920
Women can wear spaghetti strap. Why can't you just let me in?

351
00:27:44,543 --> 00:27:46,601
I'm sorry, this is my friend.

352
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,831
Show me your hand.

353
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,191
Sure.

354
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,200
You have to wear this.

355
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,350
Nope. / Seriously?

356
00:27:58,457 --> 00:28:01,320
So tasteless, why do I have to wear it?

357
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,320
Sorry. / Not wearing it.

358
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:11,524
Pure.

359
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:20,680
Bambi?

360
00:28:25,577 --> 00:28:26,920
I'll follow you.

361
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,720
So cool.

362
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,600
The best screen couple and you can get me in.

363
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:46,320
I just met you not long ago

364
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,270
and now you showed up here at POPA.

365
00:28:49,317 --> 00:28:52,360
I thought you wouldn't recognize me.

366
00:28:53,923 --> 00:28:55,200
Sure I do.

367
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,250
You drunk?

368
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:08,280
Who're you with?

369
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:16,250
You want to join me?

370
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,720
Bambi Princess of Trash.

371
00:29:33,777 --> 00:29:34,950
Everyone.

372
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:38,000
This is Bambi.

373
00:29:38,257 --> 00:29:40,120
Introduce yourselves, okay?

374
00:29:45,263 --> 00:29:46,264
Namkhang

375
00:29:50,803 --> 00:29:52,560
I'm Diesel, make yourself comfortable.

376
00:29:53,643 --> 00:29:55,241
Hi, I'm Lukjan.

377
00:29:56,563 --> 00:29:57,840
You're so pretty.

378
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,280
Are you an actress?

379
00:30:00,877 --> 00:30:02,840
Or an influencer?

380
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,400
I'm Bambi.

381
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,760
I got to go to POPA because of this dress.

382
00:30:10,283 --> 00:30:11,440
Oh, this dress.

383
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,000
Is it made from trash?

384
00:30:21,723 --> 00:30:23,760
Nope, just the materials.

385
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,200
School's project.

386
00:30:26,301 --> 00:30:30,680
So brave.

387
00:30:34,737 --> 00:30:37,040
Lukjan, I just ordered Long Island iced tea for you.

388
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,680
You know me so well, Namkhang. Thank you.

389
00:30:40,717 --> 00:30:41,718
Thank you.

390
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,000
Unlike you.

391
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:46,978
The fuck?

392
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,880
I haven't introduced myself.

393
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,360
I'm Tokyo.

394
00:30:54,683 --> 00:30:57,360
I go to the same school as Pure and Namkhang.

395
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,440
Honestly, I thought you went to an international school.

396
00:31:02,517 --> 00:31:04,440
I was an exchange student to the US for a year.

397
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,200
It's not that hard to create an international school's kid attitude, you know.

398
00:31:11,297 --> 00:31:12,560
Look at these.

399
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,000
Kanjiko Hiroshi

400
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:18,180
Just one and you're wide awake. / Awesome.

401
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,191
Give me one.

402
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,960
Hey, take one.

403
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:27,070
I'll get this one and you get this one.

404
00:31:30,717 --> 00:31:34,440
It's fine, just liquor is quite strong for me already.

405
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,271
You're weak.

406
00:31:37,443 --> 00:31:38,880
Fine, don't take it.

407
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,240
I'll get it.

408
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:43,280
Let's play Truth or Dare.

409
00:31:43,517 --> 00:31:44,440
You need to play.

410
00:31:48,137 --> 00:31:49,160
Love it.

411
00:31:49,603 --> 00:31:50,520
Let me start.

412
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:54,040
Lukjan, Truth or Dare.

413
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:56,720
I have nothing to hide. Truth.

414
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:03,640
What's your body count?

415
00:32:05,277 --> 00:32:07,680
Seriously? / That's so spiced up.

416
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,961
Nine.

417
00:32:12,217 --> 00:32:13,200
Huh? / Since when?

418
00:32:13,497 --> 00:32:15,240
Nine people? / What?

419
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,400
What is body count?

420
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:20,638
What?

421
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,121
Let me explain this to you, New Girl.

422
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,600
It means how many people have you slept with?

423
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,240
Like among your body count guys,

424
00:32:32,523 --> 00:32:34,480
I'm the number one, right?

425
00:32:35,617 --> 00:32:38,400
So cocky. / Why're you so full of yourself?

426
00:32:39,217 --> 00:32:40,218
I'm cocky.

427
00:32:42,503 --> 00:32:45,040
What about you? What's your body count?

428
00:32:46,323 --> 00:32:49,960
Hey, it's my turn. Let me ask.

429
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:56,200
Nope, I'll ask Namkhang.

430
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:58,360
Namkhang,

431
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,040
Truth or Dare, honey?

432
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,040
Truth. / Okay.

433
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,120
Have you ever slept with Pure?

434
00:33:08,203 --> 00:33:09,680
Dude what the fuck!

435
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,210
No!

436
00:33:11,843 --> 00:33:13,290
We're just friends.

437
00:33:14,103 --> 00:33:16,760
What kind of question is that? Be nice to Bambi.

438
00:33:19,603 --> 00:33:20,680
Now it's my turn.

439
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,320
Bambi, Truth or Dare.

440
00:33:33,663 --> 00:33:34,664
Dare.

441
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,280
Okay. / So brave.

442
00:33:36,337 --> 00:33:37,600
She's bold. / She's coming.

443
00:33:40,963 --> 00:33:41,964
Well,

444
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,201
make out with Diesel.

445
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,280
No..no, I won't.

446
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,880
I'm cool with that.

447
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:01,120
It's just a game. / That's enough.

448
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,600
I'm fine. / Enough.

449
00:34:03,403 --> 00:34:06,280
What the fuck! You're so protective of her.

450
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,320
Let me suggest

451
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,880
both of you to make out.

452
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:18,000
Is it that our Pure is so pure that she's never kissed a girl?

453
00:34:18,063 --> 00:34:20,000
Hey! You want my foot to kiss your lips?

454
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:22,720
You can make out with her like you did Namkhang.

455
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:24,064
Namkhang.

456
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,760
If you're so protective of her, then kiss her already.

457
00:34:27,543 --> 00:34:29,080
I really want to see.

458
00:34:29,597 --> 00:34:30,640
Let's do this.

459
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,681
Kiss!

460
00:34:34,023 --> 00:34:36,124
What're you waiting for?

461
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:38,560
Go, kiss her like you kissed Namkhang.

462
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:41,611
So spicy.

463
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,320
Take her. / Can I change it to Truth?

464
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,760
What? / Come on, New Girl.

465
00:34:47,883 --> 00:34:49,960
You didn't want to do anything.

466
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:52,100
Don't be such a party pooper, my gosh.

467
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,000
I'll shove this into your mouth.

468
00:34:53,077 --> 00:34:54,360
What's your body count?

469
00:34:58,657 --> 00:35:00,000
Woah! I really want to know.

470
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,751
You're just jealous.

471
00:35:04,037 --> 00:35:06,090
Come on, we want to know. / That's enough.

472
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,121
It's even worse.

473
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,071
How many?

474
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:11,791
Guys, shut the fuck up!

475
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,520
I need to use a bathroom.

476
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,000
What? / Come on.

477
00:35:29,263 --> 00:35:30,264
Bambi,

478
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,280
Where are you going?

479
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,761
I think I should go.

480
00:35:41,823 --> 00:35:43,720
But you just got here.

481
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,280
Let's head back, they're waiting.

482
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,640
You want me to hear terrible words from your friends?

483
00:35:52,241 --> 00:35:54,880
Come on, don't be so sensitive. They're drunk.

484
00:35:55,097 --> 00:35:56,720
I don't get it.

485
00:35:57,003 --> 00:36:00,840
I want to be their friends, I try to be nice.

486
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,360
But your friends treated me like I'm a clown.

487
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,480
I don't feel like I don't belong anywhere.

488
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:18,040
I don't like my school.

489
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,561
My friends betrayed me.

490
00:36:27,197 --> 00:36:28,600
You don't get it.

491
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,271
Of course, I do.

492
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,478
I know that they are such assholes.

493
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,601
But they're really good friends.

494
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,081
When I first started to join the cram school,

495
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,640
I didn't feel like I truly belonged.

496
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,280
They called me

497
00:36:53,641 --> 00:36:55,000
a fame-by-luck star

498
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,160
or something like that.

499
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,600
I don't think the speaker would remember it

500
00:37:05,881 --> 00:37:07,200
but the listener never forget.

501
00:37:11,977 --> 00:37:13,520
I chose this life

502
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,960
I need to get used to it.

503
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,601
How did you get used to it?

504
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,120
Let it fly pass my brain.

505
00:37:27,081 --> 00:37:31,200
Think of the horrible words as bubbles like in comics.

506
00:37:34,137 --> 00:37:36,280
Let them fly pass you.

507
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,281
It could really help.

508
00:37:42,537 --> 00:37:43,538
You sure?

509
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,551
Short girl.

510
00:37:55,063 --> 00:37:56,064
How does it feel?

511
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,001
I still feel something.

512
00:37:59,657 --> 00:38:02,360
But I feel better.

513
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,720
That's enough.

514
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,520
I'll use this method.

515
00:38:13,681 --> 00:38:14,480
Thanks.

516
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,960
What's next?

517
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,280
I'll head back, come on.

518
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,040
Going back? / Yep.

519
00:38:32,897 --> 00:38:34,600
Hey, New Girl, you back?

520
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,760
My name is Bambi.

521
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,231
Yay! / Yay!

522
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:02,600
1…2…3…

523
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:19,880
Super drunk! Super fun!

524
00:39:21,743 --> 00:39:23,560
Lukjan, you need to sit with me in the front. It's so packed in the back.

525
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:25,560
Nope, I'm gonna sit with Name.

526
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,591
Hey!

527
00:39:30,963 --> 00:39:31,964
Wait,

528
00:39:32,677 --> 00:39:34,720
Bambi, you know how to drive, don't you?

529
00:39:40,663 --> 00:39:43,200
But I just drive in my neighborhood.

530
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:08,600
What kind of this fucking song?

531
00:40:08,983 --> 00:40:10,120
You won't like it?

532
00:40:15,357 --> 00:40:18,040
Tokyo, can you change the song, please?

533
00:40:19,963 --> 00:40:21,800
I want to listen to Name's song.

534
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,080
I can sing in private for you.

535
00:40:31,657 --> 00:40:33,320
Let's take IG's story.

536
00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:48,720
Get the phone.

537
00:41:22,117 --> 00:41:23,160
Holy shit!

538
00:41:38,897 --> 00:41:40,200
Shit! Oh my gosh!

539
00:41:40,643 --> 00:41:42,360
Bambi.

540
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:44,320
What did you hit?

541
00:41:44,863 --> 00:41:45,864
Bambi!

542
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,680
Who did you hit? / It's gonna be in news.

543
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:50,560
Did he dead? Go check on him.

544
00:41:53,217 --> 00:41:54,218
Bambi!

545
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:59,680
Are you okay? Are you alright?

546
00:42:01,243 --> 00:42:02,680
Namkhang, you need to calm down. / Lukjan,

547
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,320
you need to call your house. / Calm down.

00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,160
Call your house. / I can't.

549
00:42:07,303 --> 00:42:08,920
Focus! / Are you out of your mind?

550
00:42:09,503 --> 00:42:12,440
Why? / I hit someone once, my grandma will kill me.

551
00:42:12,443 --> 00:42:13,960
I can't call my house.

552
00:42:16,223 --> 00:42:17,224
Focus! / Bambi!

553
00:42:19,097 --> 00:42:20,440
Are you okay? Are you alright?

554
00:42:20,757 --> 00:42:21,800
Is he dead?

555
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:25,920
Your dad… / I didn't mean to.

556
00:42:26,183 --> 00:42:29,420
It's okay, calm down. / I didn't mean to.

557
00:42:29,423 --> 00:42:31,580
Police? / Calm down.

558
00:42:31,663 --> 00:42:33,720
Please. / My grandma can't know about this.

559
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:37,051
Police?

560
00:42:37,683 --> 00:42:38,684
Police?

561
00:42:38,757 --> 00:42:39,840
What're you doing? / What the hell?

562
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:42,680
Police. / Hey! What did you do?

563
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:44,200
No. Stop, you can't do that.

564
00:42:44,643 --> 00:42:45,560
I'll handle this.

565
00:42:49,063 --> 00:42:51,520
You're going to call the police? Are you out of your mind?

566
00:42:55,077 --> 00:42:56,080
You need to calm down.

567
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,680
Stop yelling.

568
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:59,200
Did he dead?

569
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:02,371
My family can't know about this. / Focus!

570
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:06,960
I didn't mean to. / Focus, okay. Focus.

571
00:43:10,557 --> 00:43:12,760
I didn't mean to! / I know, but you need to focus.

572
00:43:12,817 --> 00:43:13,760
I drove a car and crash someone.

573
00:43:17,423 --> 00:43:19,000
I didn't mean to.

574
00:43:32,183 --> 00:43:34,720
Thank you so much, please take care of this.

575
00:43:36,277 --> 00:43:37,278
Yes, sir.

576
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:40,200
Your dad handled this already.

577
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:42,171
Thank you so so much.

578
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:48,160
You think he'll make it?

579
00:44:52,477 --> 00:44:55,000
I drank too much last night.

580
00:44:55,478 --> 00:44:57,520
And guess who's having Omakase for brunch?

581
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:00,840
My freakin grandma!

582
00:45:06,623 --> 00:45:07,624
Hey! Diesel!

583
00:45:11,817 --> 00:45:12,818
Good shot!

584
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,703
(Show cancellation tonight. He's injured)

585
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,881
(Thank you everyone for your votes)

586
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:27,881
It's all cleared.

587
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,761
Where should we go tonight?

588
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,681
How's the uncle?

589
00:45:40,183 --> 00:45:42,920
Hello, this is 191 Bangkok, what's your emergency?

590
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:47,271
Hello?

591
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:50,480
What's your emergency?

592
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:55,240
Hey!

593
00:45:56,897 --> 00:45:58,360
What's your emergency?

594
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:02,311
Hello?

595
00:46:05,483 --> 00:46:06,484
Hey?

596
00:46:08,803 --> 00:46:09,804
Can you hear me?

597
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:13,240
Are you okay?

598
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:16,250
It's fine. It's nothing.

599
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:17,840
I'm sorry.

600
00:46:18,877 --> 00:46:22,360
This is not a joke. You can't just call for nothing.

601
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,520
This is the wrong thing to do.

602
00:46:51,077 --> 00:46:53,560
It's all done. / Thank you.

603
00:46:58,183 --> 00:46:59,360
Bambi.

604
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:03,360
You study here, too?

605
00:47:52,457 --> 00:47:53,458
Let's go.

606
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:01,504
Let's go.

607
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,641
I don't think the speaker would remember it

608
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,701
but the listener never forget.- Pure

609
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:31,600
Yo! Aloha! How to say your username?

610
00:48:31,943 --> 00:48:33,200
Kwamfhundanupha

611
00:48:34,143 --> 00:48:35,144
My name is Dream.

612
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,200
Do you remember what you told me?

613
00:48:37,303 --> 00:48:38,517
Do whatever I want.

614
00:48:38,683 --> 00:48:41,280
I want to ask about music.

615
00:48:41,597 --> 00:48:43,040
How to start on this?

616
00:48:43,423 --> 00:48:46,720
Can you moan right into my song?

617
00:48:46,783 --> 00:48:48,400
I don't think so.

618
00:48:48,403 --> 00:48:51,240
I really like the song you played for me.

619
00:48:51,263 --> 00:48:53,000
Can I get that song?

620
00:48:54,237 --> 00:48:56,440
Nothing comes for free.
