1
00:00:12,237 --> 00:00:14,317
Your fans, they have rights to call it.

2
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,120
Be prepared for consequences.

3
00:00:17,543 --> 00:00:19,300
You know how it feels like when your life

4
00:00:19,503 --> 00:00:21,640
is going down the cliff.

5
00:00:22,563 --> 00:00:25,000
You son of a bitch! You're so tough in game, why don't you shoot me in real life?

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,241
Bambi? Did you tell someone else that Anyone is Dream?

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,161
Now everyone knows her identity. I'm heading to your place.

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,040
Did you tell Diesel that I'm Anyone?

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,281
You've never f--king changed.

10
00:00:38,217 --> 00:00:39,080
Dream!

11
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,871
Diesel!

12
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:51,991
An ambulance….

13
00:01:55,803 --> 00:01:56,804
Bambi.

14
00:01:59,243 --> 00:02:00,000
I'll handle this.

15
00:02:02,477 --> 00:02:03,840
Who did this to you?

16
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,320
Dad, can you…

17
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,800
find an ambulance for my friend please? Someone shot her.

18
00:02:14,097 --> 00:02:15,440
Can you send help?

19
00:02:20,183 --> 00:02:21,760
Okay. Thank you.

20
00:02:23,917 --> 00:02:25,680
Is he gonna help her?

21
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,440
Can you hold her?

22
00:02:31,657 --> 00:02:34,500
My Dad will send someone to help. Don't let anyone find out that I'm here.

23
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,721
Take care of Dream.

24
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,600
Diesel? Where are you going?

25
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,760
Please help my friend!

26
00:02:51,443 --> 00:02:52,600
Please!

27
00:02:54,003 --> 00:02:56,520
Please help her!

28
00:02:57,603 --> 00:03:00,120
Please help her!

29
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,800
Let's follow up on a case of 17-year-old

30
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:12,250
female student got shot.

31
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,720
She was admitted to the hospital already.

32
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,520
We still can't find out who the gunman is.

33
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,400
Our team is asking around for the witnesses.

34
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:25,100
She deserved it for taking side with Bambi.

35
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:32,000
Bambi? How is Dream?

36
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,200
Did the doctor say anything?

37
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,643
She's still in an emergency room. No one came out. / Danupha's relative?

38
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:38,602
I'm her sister.

39
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,680
Can you fill out the form and get me her ID card please?

40
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,400
Thank you. Please save her.

41
00:03:43,937 --> 00:03:45,800
Sure, when her guardian arrives,

42
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,080
please tell them. / Sure, thanks.

43
00:03:50,457 --> 00:03:51,458
Where's her phone?

44
00:03:54,283 --> 00:03:57,520
Do you know who did it? The home invader?

45
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,480
Her mom called.

46
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:06,960
Bambi? How are you?

47
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,960
Did you get hurt as well?

48
00:04:10,503 --> 00:04:12,760
How's Dream? Did her parents come?

49
00:04:13,103 --> 00:04:15,680
What's going on? What did you do?

50
00:04:15,803 --> 00:04:18,170
Why did he shoot her?

51
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,040
I don't know.

52
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,600
Is there anything you haven't told me?

53
00:04:22,937 --> 00:04:26,760
If you didn't do anything, who would shoot her like that?

54
00:04:27,317 --> 00:04:28,440
Anyone is….

55
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,840
Can I stay with you for a week?

56
00:04:31,283 --> 00:04:32,920
Did you tell Diesel that I'm Anyone?

57
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:34,700
You've never f--king changed.

58
00:04:35,517 --> 00:04:36,518
Dream!

59
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:41,240
I don't know who did it. I don't know why he did it.

60
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:45,124
He could come back to shoot you as well. / Mom!

61
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,280
I have no idea.

62
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,520
I don't know.

63
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,400
Alright, I'm sorry.

64
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,840
Breaking news from a school girl got shot.

65
00:05:02,897 --> 00:05:06,560
It is reported that

66
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,880
they caught a gunman already.

67
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,600
He is a 17-year-old student from

68
00:05:11,623 --> 00:05:13,840
international school. / My people found him already.

69
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,680
Job did it.

70
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,040
Job found out about that girl

71
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,721
because of you.

72
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:24,124
Same passcode?

73
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,480
I think we talked about this already.

74
00:05:42,243 --> 00:05:43,280
I'm sorry.

75
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,481
Car key?

76
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,400
If you cause so many troubles when you're out of the house,

77
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,960
then from now on

78
00:06:01,017 --> 00:06:02,920
you need to stay inside. You can't go anywhere.

79
00:06:07,763 --> 00:06:09,650
Do you want to know how I've been?

80
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,520
You're a grown-up now.

81
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,760
How long do I need to coddle you?

82
00:06:41,337 --> 00:06:43,370
Alright, next step

83
00:06:43,623 --> 00:06:45,200
is your roadmap.

84
00:06:45,537 --> 00:06:49,480
We'll start with the second season of Paint Your Dream.

85
00:06:50,303 --> 00:06:54,720
Marketing team will prepare for Asia tour.

86
00:06:55,477 --> 00:06:56,760
This one is for you, Namkhang,

87
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,960
because on the last day of the tour,

88
00:07:00,377 --> 00:07:02,920
we will announce your solo album.

89
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,400
In the meantime, I want you to expand your fan base as much as possible.

90
00:07:08,757 --> 00:07:09,758
You get it right?

91
00:07:10,157 --> 00:07:11,880
Move on to TVC.

92
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,360
I think that both of you

93
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,480
should be presenters for at least seven products.

94
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,320
If we follow the plan, we'll earn enough

95
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:27,240
to make our first feature film.

96
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,280
This one is for you.

97
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,160
You can share your input to writing team

98
00:07:33,841 --> 00:07:36,200
about the characters you'd like to portrait.

99
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,600
On one condition,

100
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,081
you have to reach this goal only,

101
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,360
if it's less than this, we don't have enough fund to do so.

102
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,081
You get it right?

103
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,960
Can the number be a littler lower?

104
00:07:53,703 --> 00:07:55,560
It's twice more than last year.

105
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,911
Pure.

106
00:08:01,277 --> 00:08:04,720
I need to be honest with you, but think about it,

107
00:08:06,078 --> 00:08:08,840
who choose to be in this industry?

108
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,160
You need to be more professional.

109
00:08:13,323 --> 00:08:17,160
Don't you even think that your lifeline is more important than others.

110
00:08:18,117 --> 00:08:20,120
Look around this room.

111
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,000
Did you see the consequences of your actions?

112
00:08:23,657 --> 00:08:25,600
Who disappeared from this room because of you?

113
00:08:28,957 --> 00:08:30,210
Tang loved you so much.

114
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,840
But I think she loved you two too much.

115
00:08:35,117 --> 00:08:36,913
That's why I replaced her with Boss.

116
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,440
You need to focus

117
00:08:41,847 --> 00:08:44,600
and stop dragging people down to hell with you.

118
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,311
Pure,

119
00:09:00,223 --> 00:09:02,703
I know that you're worried about Bambi.

120
00:09:06,077 --> 00:09:07,640
But Tang got fired.

121
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:11,490
Be careful of your action.

122
00:09:20,117 --> 00:09:21,360
I need to leave.

123
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,720
Hello. How is Dream?

124
00:09:39,243 --> 00:09:41,080
She's better. I'll be right back.

125
00:09:55,483 --> 00:09:56,440
How are you?

126
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,801
It's because of me.

127
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,717
It's because of me again.

128
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,400
If I hadn't let her stay here,

129
00:10:19,297 --> 00:10:21,760
if I hadn't told Diesel about her,

130
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,360
if I hadn't been so selfish,

131
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,800
if I hadn't wanted any of these,

132
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,403
it wouldn't have turned out to be this way.

133
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,630
Don't blame yourself like that.

134
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:46,937
Things happened.

135
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,680
But I believe that it will be okay.

136
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,520
You called me so many times.

137
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,037
I'm sorry, I didn't touch my phone.

138
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:25,664
It's okay.

139
00:11:31,797 --> 00:11:32,798
What is it?

140
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,450
Jib texted me to go to see Ms.Duangtawan tomorrow.

141
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,120
But I don't want to anymore.

142
00:11:49,563 --> 00:11:50,564
I…

143
00:11:51,743 --> 00:11:53,170
I don't want it anymore.

144
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,920
It still won't help it if you stay here and stress out.

145
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,760
You should get out of the hospital to do something.

146
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,517
I know that you feel guilty about Dream.

147
00:12:04,037 --> 00:12:06,583
But you should wait until she wakes up first.

148
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,411
Just try it.

149
00:12:43,543 --> 00:12:46,303
We can use weeds for Ikebana arrangement,

150
00:12:47,623 --> 00:12:51,680
if we accept it and see beauty in imperfections.

151
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,840
Even wilted weeds

152
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:58,440
can be pretty if they're in the right place.

153
00:13:06,903 --> 00:13:09,720
The speech that you said in live,

154
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,481
I admired it.

155
00:13:13,697 --> 00:13:17,720
I know this director and he's looking for a new face for his film.

156
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,730
I think it should suit you well, you should try.

157
00:13:21,743 --> 00:13:25,640
Kimia started out with something like this, I offered her a role.

158
00:13:29,937 --> 00:13:30,938
I think…

159
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,040
I'm not sure

160
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,983
if I'm the one for this role.

161
00:13:52,243 --> 00:13:53,244
You know what?

162
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:59,000
Weeds that weren't chosen for Ikebana arrangement

163
00:14:00,123 --> 00:14:03,757
they became unwanted and neglected plants by their owners.

164
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,040
They will be plucked out.

165
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:11,200
If you go to this audition,

166
00:14:12,563 --> 00:14:14,597
you can go further than what you said.

167
00:14:15,963 --> 00:14:19,880
You could be as famous as Kimia.

168
00:14:21,423 --> 00:14:25,120
And this will benefit our brand.

169
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:31,840
This is not a request.

170
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,240
If you refuse to do so,

171
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,400
perhaps you wouldn't be valued to us anymore.

172
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,640
This is Job, a gunman of a feminist.

173
00:15:28,837 --> 00:15:32,480
Bambi brought it for you, I saw it outside

174
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:33,960
so I brought it in.

175
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,441
How are you?

176
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,881
Still alive.

177
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,760
If you got nothing to say, then leave.

178
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,201
I want to talk to you.

179
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,000
About f--king what?

180
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,000
You never talk to me.

181
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,961
You got me so bad earlier as well.

182
00:16:18,197 --> 00:16:19,198
What about you?

183
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,280
You let your Dad protect your guilt, you lied,

184
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,240
you didn't take responsibilities for anything.

185
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,200
You have no idea what I faced.

186
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,240
And you know what I encountered?

187
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,040
You know what others encountered?

188
00:16:43,143 --> 00:16:45,280
You know how is the woman that you hurt?

189
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,223
You don't know, you don't know anything about anyone.

190
00:16:50,297 --> 00:16:51,640
All you care is yourself.

191
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,280
You live a comfortable life.

192
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:58,284
Selfish one.

193
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,080
You'll end up just like your Dad.

194
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,680
I can't choose.

195
00:17:07,603 --> 00:17:09,760
You should be the one who gets me the most.

196
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,880
How can I choose?

197
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,000
Can I choose my own Dad? / I can't either.

198
00:17:15,191 --> 00:17:16,360
You also have a problem with your Dad.

199
00:17:16,477 --> 00:17:18,360
But I choose not to be like him.

200
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,920
I only have good intentions to you.

201
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,920
I hope that deep down you wouldn't end up like your Dad.

202
00:17:30,863 --> 00:17:32,120
But look what you did to me,

203
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,440
you told me off, you blocked me and you told me to go away.

204
00:17:35,957 --> 00:17:37,480
What do you think I'd feel?

205
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,400
I'm so disappointed in you.

206
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,440
I just want to be your friend.

207
00:18:24,697 --> 00:18:27,680
Fine, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

208
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,241
Thank you for your good intentions but I…

209
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,400
I don't get it. / Diesel!

210
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,280
Diesel! Diesel! / I'm so sorry.

211
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,160
Diesel! Stop!

212
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,720
Are you crazy? Stop! / I'm stupid.

213
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,361
That's right, I'm so stupid.

214
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,321
Stupid.

215
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,640
You don't have to do that.

216
00:18:56,737 --> 00:18:57,738
I don't know.

217
00:19:01,437 --> 00:19:02,600
I have no idea.

218
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,611
Come here.

219
00:19:08,763 --> 00:19:10,040
It's alright.

220
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,440
It's fine.

221
00:19:17,063 --> 00:19:18,080
I'm sorry.

222
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,280
This place makes me think of the past.

223
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,840
All the wounds and bad stories that I made.

224
00:19:45,203 --> 00:19:47,204
No matter how far I tried to run.

225
00:19:48,423 --> 00:19:51,160
These memories still keep haunting me.

226
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,800
Cut! Cut!

227
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,320
Okay, fine.

228
00:19:55,911 --> 00:19:57,120
What about this?

229
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,360
Ms.Duangtawan sent a clip

230
00:20:00,411 --> 00:20:02,200
of your speech and I saw it.

231
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,000
I want you to try

232
00:20:05,223 --> 00:20:07,480
sharing what happened.

233
00:20:07,563 --> 00:20:08,700
What was going on back then.

234
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,000
I promise you that it's gonna be a director and us to see.

235
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,241
That's it.

236
00:20:16,603 --> 00:20:17,604
Well…

237
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,161
I….

238
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,320
I used to be friend with that rapper.

239
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,410
And I want to have my own song.

240
00:20:28,017 --> 00:20:29,400
So I asked for his help.

241
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,400
That song was supposed to be his.

242
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,680
But he gave it to me because

243
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:39,838
he liked me.

244
00:20:41,357 --> 00:20:44,310
I didn't really like him so I rejected him.

245
00:20:45,343 --> 00:20:49,120
He must be furious so he wrote a song to diss me.

246
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,200
And my best friend

247
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,881
helped me write that speech.

248
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,760
She wrote that because that's what she believed.

249
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,600
She believed in me.

250
00:21:05,743 --> 00:21:07,480
After that,

251
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,000
she caught me lying about something.

252
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,640
I got a chance to tell her the truth.

253
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:18,800
But I didn't.

254
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,600
If I hadn't lied to her,

255
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,640
she wouldn't have….

256
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,040
Okay.

257
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,320
It's okay. What about this?

258
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:39,560
I want you to think of this feeling and tell it to the camera.

259
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,801
Look at the camera.

260
00:21:41,703 --> 00:21:42,704
Ready?

261
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:44,904
Action!

262
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,450
This place makes me think of the past.

263
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,777
All the wounds and

264
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,603
bad stories that I made.

265
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,610
No matter how far I tried to run.

266
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,480
These memories still keep haunting me.

267
00:22:23,303 --> 00:22:25,490
Dream can go home.

268
00:22:25,603 --> 00:22:28,040
If her wound is hurting or swelling up,

269
00:22:28,343 --> 00:22:30,190
you can bring her back to heal it.

270
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:31,440
Okay. Thank you.

271
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,337
Can I have some snacks?

272
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:41,960
I brought it for her last night.

273
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,880
I'm not sure if the doctor allows her to have it.

274
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,720
It's her favorite. / Sure, she can.

275
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,920
Congrats on going home.

276
00:23:05,943 --> 00:23:06,944
What is it?

277
00:23:15,343 --> 00:23:16,400
How is she?

278
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,800
She's fine.

279
00:23:18,281 --> 00:23:20,520
But her wound hurt this morning.

280
00:23:21,263 --> 00:23:22,960
The doctor let het go home now.

281
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,840
Can she go back home?

282
00:23:33,337 --> 00:23:34,338
Please?

283
00:23:36,317 --> 00:23:38,040
If she wants to, then fine.

284
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,250
But she needs to understand that

285
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:43,920
if we can't change her opinion,

286
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,777
then she can't change mine either.

287
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:50,880
Whatever,

288
00:23:53,023 --> 00:23:54,000
in the end,

289
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,920
I never want anything to happen to her.

290
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,320
No matter what

291
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,800
she's still my daughter.

292
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,520
Cut! / Cut!

293
00:24:44,763 --> 00:24:45,997
Please take care of them.

294
00:24:47,157 --> 00:24:48,960
Pure, well….

295
00:24:49,077 --> 00:24:51,270
can you act it short and clean?

296
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,800
When you smile, can you do it faster?

297
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,000
One more time, okay?

298
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:57,760
Reset!

299
00:24:59,257 --> 00:25:00,280
My smile didn't look real?

300
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,081
You can do it.

301
00:25:03,181 --> 00:25:05,400
And…action!

302
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:12,040
Cut! Lower the product and focus on the face. / And action!

303
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:16,000
Cut! I need you to smile more than the last one. / And action!

304
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,081
Cut! Cut!

305
00:25:18,181 --> 00:25:20,160
Give me sultry smile.

306
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:21,720
Cut! No smile at all.

307
00:25:21,783 --> 00:25:23,160
Cut! More smile than the last one.

308
00:25:23,223 --> 00:25:24,997
Cut! / Action!

309
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,520
No smile at all. Cut!

310
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:30,120
Pure? Are you okay?

311
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,760
Didn't you sleep well last night?

312
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,921
Take a look at him.

313
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:39,811
Are you alright?

314
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,297
This is not our fault at all.

315
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,397
Why didn't they talk it through first?

316
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,000
Drop the attitude, the clients are watching.

317
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,360
This is normal for shooting TVC.

318
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,160
Hang in there, okay? / That's right.

319
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,920
Hang in there.

320
00:25:58,503 --> 00:25:59,504
Let's rolling.

321
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,600
One more time, okay?

322
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:10,080
And…action!

323
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,141
Hello, everyone.

324
00:26:21,241 --> 00:26:24,542
I'm here with the hottest BL couple

325
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,920
on soeical media.

326
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:31,950
Please welcome Pure and Namkhang. / Hello.

327
00:26:32,017 --> 00:26:35,303
You're all settled in, right? Let me get to the point.

328
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:38,360
About Paint Your Dream series,

329
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:42,760
it's so blown up and it gains big success.

330
00:26:43,023 --> 00:26:46,080
On behalf of your fans, I need to ask

331
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,400
have you ever thought of your partner

332
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,281
more than just a scene partner?

333
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,377
Well,

334
00:26:56,943 --> 00:26:58,843
we worked so hard on this series

335
00:26:59,697 --> 00:27:02,760
and we played according to the director and the characters' emotions.

336
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,360
The characters' emotions.

337
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,520
If that so,

338
00:27:09,723 --> 00:27:12,600
well, Pure must feel the same thing.

339
00:27:22,257 --> 00:27:23,258
That's right.

340
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:27,200
When we're acting, of course we can feel it.

341
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,520
So cute, you see that?

342
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,600
They're so supportive of each other.

343
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,120
I started to see where this is going.

344
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:37,600
Since you're here already,

345
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,600
can you reenact one of your scenes

346
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:43,160
right here right now?

347
00:27:44,737 --> 00:27:47,080
The scene that people've been talking about.

348
00:27:47,317 --> 00:27:48,440
This is not included in the script.

349
00:27:57,583 --> 00:28:00,640
Well, just a little.

350
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:03,520
Okay? Your fans have been asking for it.

351
00:28:03,843 --> 00:28:04,844
Just a little.

352
00:28:12,837 --> 00:28:14,200
Can you teach me watercoloring?

353
00:28:18,557 --> 00:28:19,560
Can you?

354
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,880
When you paint,

355
00:28:33,161 --> 00:28:34,162
you need to wipe it off first,

356
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,201
so it won't get messy.

357
00:28:46,043 --> 00:28:47,044
Cut!

358
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:52,400
It's something like this and please watch the rest in the series.

359
00:28:53,197 --> 00:28:55,960
Oh my! You almost gave me a heart attack.

360
00:28:58,743 --> 00:29:02,200
Can we take a break brieftly?

361
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,480
Then we'll come back to see

362
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,680
if they really know each other.

363
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:11,640
They will play a game called Know Your Partner.

364
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,240
You passed an audition.

365
00:29:23,423 --> 00:29:27,040
Next step, the director wanted to see your chemistry with the rest of the cast members.

366
00:29:27,177 --> 00:29:29,720
If you didn't show up, you're automatically out.

367
00:29:40,683 --> 00:29:41,684
Dream.

368
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,330
Bambi? / Hello.

369
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,123
Why didn't you call us first?

370
00:29:48,663 --> 00:29:50,720
I'm here to talk to dream.

371
00:29:50,903 --> 00:29:52,320
Sure.

372
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:55,760
I'll catch up with you.

373
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,641
What's going on?

374
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,250
I want to apologize to you face to face.

375
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,523
I'm sorry.

376
00:30:31,577 --> 00:30:32,578
Sorry

377
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:36,911
about everything.

378
00:30:42,577 --> 00:30:44,800
I know that you won't believe a word that I said.

379
00:30:47,523 --> 00:30:50,830
But I want you to know that since we've made up,

380
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,570
I felt really bad.

381
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,760
I don't know how to tell you the truth.

382
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,403
I don't know when to tell you.

383
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,671
I'm scared.

384
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,760
I lost you once and I..

385
00:31:21,743 --> 00:31:22,920
this time

386
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,320
I don't want to lose you again.

387
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:34,523
Why did you realize about it after you ratted me out to Diesel?

388
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,920
You came here to say sorry, expected me to forgive you and that's it?

389
00:31:50,243 --> 00:31:52,337
You can't do as you pleased.

390
00:31:56,477 --> 00:31:58,120
You have to be responsible of your own actions.

391
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,720
What changed you?

392
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,080
What do you want?

393
00:32:13,837 --> 00:32:15,040
You don't have to tell me actually.

394
00:32:19,417 --> 00:32:21,440
In the end, we can't be friends again.

395
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,080
I'm sorry.

396
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:31,280
Can't you give me another chance?

397
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:38,080
I'm sorry that I was selfish

398
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,400
that I was a bad friend,

399
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,880
that I lied to you,

400
00:32:49,957 --> 00:32:52,440
I just want to be friend with you.

401
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,250
I'm sorry.

402
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,721
I still want to be friend with you. Get well soon. From Bambi.

403
00:33:41,077 --> 00:33:42,278
What're you doing?

404
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,461
Can you come out to see me?

405
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:51,000
You're done? Are you hungry?

406
00:34:09,537 --> 00:34:10,880
Are you okay?

407
00:34:12,597 --> 00:34:13,960
You're done with shooting?

408
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:19,457
I can't do this any longer, I felt like a robot.

409
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,831
People gave me orders and I just followed.

410
00:34:26,643 --> 00:34:27,683
Well done.

411
00:34:39,003 --> 00:34:41,520
How are you? What were you doing earlier?

412
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,161
Am I disturbing you?

413
00:34:48,683 --> 00:34:50,400
Do you remember about

414
00:34:51,503 --> 00:34:53,523
my audition for a film?

415
00:34:55,483 --> 00:34:57,600
I've never heard of this film.

416
00:34:58,243 --> 00:34:59,244
I….

417
00:35:00,383 --> 00:35:02,110
I don't want to go. / What?

418
00:35:03,397 --> 00:35:04,560
It's Toey's film.

419
00:35:05,413 --> 00:35:06,833
He's so famous.

420
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:11,560
Are you sure? Everyone would kill to work with Toey.

421
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,640
Do you want to run lines with me? Just for fun.

422
00:35:19,057 --> 00:35:20,357
I want to see you act.

423
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:23,451
Sure, let's do this.

424
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:30,117
Are you crazy? Why do you want a cage for?

425
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,597
My birds,

426
00:35:34,303 --> 00:35:35,910
I can't leave them.

427
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:38,470
They are… / Wait..

428
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:42,600
I think you should take it slow this time.

429
00:35:42,983 --> 00:35:44,760
This line is important.

430
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,671
Let's do it again.

431
00:35:47,037 --> 00:35:48,160
You go first.

432
00:35:49,923 --> 00:35:50,560
Sure, let's do this.

433
00:35:51,577 --> 00:35:54,120
Are you crazy? Why do you want a cage for?

434
00:35:56,927 --> 00:36:00,360
I can't leave my birds.

435
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,903
They're the only things that I love. / Okay, wait….

436
00:36:05,017 --> 00:36:06,400
I don't think you quite understand it,

437
00:36:06,897 --> 00:36:08,320
they want to interpret it like this,

438
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,170
to present birds as freedom.

439
00:36:10,677 --> 00:36:12,170
When you speak the line, can you make me feel that?

440
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,603
Let's try again.

441
00:36:15,311 --> 00:36:17,103
Let's go. / Can we stop?

442
00:36:21,403 --> 00:36:22,683
You said that you wanted to run lines.

443
00:36:23,737 --> 00:36:26,920
I did that because I wanted to see you act.

444
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,440
I didn't think that it'd be this serious.

445
00:36:32,177 --> 00:36:33,920
It's just running lines and you can't focus on it.

446
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,243
You think you can star in the film?

447
00:36:40,937 --> 00:36:41,990
What's wrong with you today?

448
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,800
Are you mad or something?

449
00:36:52,957 --> 00:36:55,400
I'm not irritating, I don't know.

450
00:36:56,277 --> 00:36:58,130
I mean running lines is part of acting.

451
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:01,550
If you don't want it to be that serious, then it's fine.

452
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,157
You don't have to do it. I really think….

453
00:37:05,337 --> 00:37:07,160
it will be a waste of time if you don't mean it.

454
00:37:11,443 --> 00:37:12,440
It's like….

455
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,960
You got the part so easily, you don't have to take it seriously.

456
00:37:22,577 --> 00:37:23,578
Easy?

457
00:37:25,357 --> 00:37:28,383
Didn't I say that I didn't want to get this role?

458
00:37:29,243 --> 00:37:30,244
Why?

459
00:37:31,183 --> 00:37:32,450
You want this role?

460
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:36,430
You want it so bad? Or you want to audition it and now you're jealous of me?

461
00:38:08,483 --> 00:38:09,484
I'm sorry.

462
00:38:23,897 --> 00:38:24,898
Actually

463
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:26,863
you were right about it.

464
00:38:28,417 --> 00:38:29,840
Otherwise, it wouldn't have hit me this bad.

465
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,320
I'm sorry

466
00:38:42,043 --> 00:38:43,640
for talking to you like that.

467
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:56,911
I…

468
00:38:58,697 --> 00:39:00,080
I really don't want to do this anymore.

469
00:39:02,577 --> 00:39:05,200
I thought that I could make it through.

470
00:39:06,217 --> 00:39:07,680
I thought that I could do it but

471
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:11,040
I couldn't do it anymore, it's like

472
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:14,603
I lie to my audience every day.

473
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:16,891
I think I...

474
00:39:17,591 --> 00:39:18,720
I feel really bad about it.

475
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,760
I don't like this feeling.

476
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:30,560
I get you but…

477
00:39:31,263 --> 00:39:33,290
when I try to do something

478
00:39:34,503 --> 00:39:36,640
I suddenly see Dream's face.

479
00:39:39,217 --> 00:39:41,440
I try to let it go

480
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,000
but I couldn't.

481
00:40:04,397 --> 00:40:05,880
You went to see Bambi again, didn't you?

482
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,600
Why didn't you think it through?

483
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,311
Hey!

484
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,110
I think I need to tell you this.

485
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,720
I think we shouldn't continue with the second season.

486
00:40:34,483 --> 00:40:36,640
I want to quit. / F--king quit what?

487
00:40:40,143 --> 00:40:41,080
What the hell?

488
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,520
Listen to me.

489
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,840
It looks good at the end.

490
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,160
I know that you want it, I want it too.

491
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,120
How do you know that they're not fooling us with the dream?

492
00:40:53,703 --> 00:40:57,280
Look at our jobs, they never protect us.

493
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,850
I think we should call it off, I don't want to waste their time anymore.

494
00:41:01,837 --> 00:41:04,640
They could invest on someone else instead. / Are you out of your mind !?

495
00:41:06,243 --> 00:41:09,244
You know that I want this job, I want this opportunity.

496
00:41:11,563 --> 00:41:13,423
My Dad is still lying and disabled at home.

497
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,320
How could you say that?

498
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,681
You selfish son of a bitch!

499
00:41:19,843 --> 00:41:21,744
Can you listen to me? / Listen to f--king what?

500
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,840
If we quit now, we still have fans.

501
00:41:25,063 --> 00:41:28,480
We can find our own way, we don't have to rely on them.

502
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,281
Please stop talking.

503
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:32,400
The more you say it, the more shitty you sound.

504
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,251
What about this?

505
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:41,931
I've been thinking about this.

506
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:46,080
I'll announce on the stage of our next fan meeting

507
00:41:48,223 --> 00:41:49,480
that I'll take a break,

508
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:52,851
that I want to focus on my personal life

509
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,680
and my solo works.

510
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:56,830
But I'll

511
00:41:58,303 --> 00:41:59,720
ask the fans to take care of you.

512
00:42:00,757 --> 00:42:01,760
I believe that

513
00:42:02,337 --> 00:42:05,120
everyone still loves and supports you the same.

514
00:42:10,137 --> 00:42:11,280
I truly believe that.

515
00:42:16,577 --> 00:42:17,578
If you want to quit,

516
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,440
can I say this?

517
00:42:24,703 --> 00:42:26,760
You will stop acting

518
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,423
and you will announce your girlfriend.

519
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:33,960
I'll cheer you and Bambi on this journey.

520
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:37,080
I believe that the fans will understand

521
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,761
and bless us. / What the hell is wrong with you?

522
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,240
You don't care about me.

523
00:42:43,317 --> 00:42:44,480
Why do I need to care about you?

524
00:43:12,817 --> 00:43:13,818
Where are you? It's about time for audition.

525
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,400
If you can't make it on time, then you're automatically out.

526
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:27,480
If you refuse to do so,

527
00:43:29,251 --> 00:43:32,040
perhaps you wouldn't be valued to us anymore.

528
00:43:32,557 --> 00:43:34,200
Don't you want this life so bad?

529
00:43:35,057 --> 00:43:36,440
What changed you?

530
00:43:37,763 --> 00:43:38,800
What do you want?

531
00:43:47,903 --> 00:43:49,240
Should we quit them all?

532
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,520
Everything that we're doing.

533
00:43:54,283 --> 00:43:55,920
That easy?

534
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,700
It is that easy.

535
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,520
Let's live a normal life.

536
00:44:03,183 --> 00:44:04,200
And ignore them all.

537
00:44:18,617 --> 00:44:20,080
Can you please stand by for a sec?

538
00:44:38,803 --> 00:44:39,804
Hey,

539
00:44:46,023 --> 00:44:47,024
I'm sorry.

540
00:44:55,097 --> 00:44:56,250
You don't need to apologize to me.

541
00:45:01,577 --> 00:45:02,578
It's my own fault.

542
00:45:06,657 --> 00:45:07,840
If it wasn't because of you,

543
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:13,400
I wouldn't have been here. I should thank you instead.

544
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,700
I'm sorry.

545
00:45:26,923 --> 00:45:27,924
Really sorry.

546
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,001
You know that

547
00:45:39,843 --> 00:45:41,600
you're my best friend.

548
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:52,671
From now on,

549
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:57,160
you can follow your dream and do it well.

550
00:45:59,797 --> 00:46:00,960
Don't you worry

551
00:46:02,077 --> 00:46:03,160
about my debts.

552
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:05,320
I can handle this.

553
00:46:08,843 --> 00:46:09,844
I….

554
00:46:11,837 --> 00:46:13,200
I still want to be your friend.

555
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:23,191
I'm sorry.

556
00:46:30,823 --> 00:46:33,560
Stop with that face alreay, you look so ugly.

557
00:46:36,557 --> 00:46:37,558
Don't you want to look good?

558
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:40,391
You're right.

559
00:46:46,297 --> 00:46:47,720
It's time.

560
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:07,200
Can I hear you scream for them one more time?

561
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:15,880
Let's meet Pure and Namkhang.

562
00:47:46,623 --> 00:47:48,640
Okay, that's quite enough.

563
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,560
Wow! So many people come here to see both of you.

564
00:47:51,677 --> 00:47:53,160
Right. / Okay.

565
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:56,240
The first season has been so successful.

566
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,600
It's on the trend every single day.

567
00:47:58,857 --> 00:48:01,560
I heard that both of you

568
00:48:01,697 --> 00:48:05,250
have something special to share with your fans, right?

569
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,081
That's right.

570
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:19,960
We have something really important to share.

571
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:24,560
It's one crucial milestone for both of us.

572
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:30,480
First of all, I'd like

573
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,120
to thank everyone for your support

574
00:48:33,441 --> 00:48:35,360
all along this journey.

575
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,040
I'd like to say thank you

576
00:48:39,157 --> 00:48:41,800
for your encouragement.

577
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:48,200
I will never forget this feeling.

578
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,400
The feeling that

579
00:48:51,423 --> 00:48:53,800
you all give to us, thank you.

580
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,240
Should we quit them all?

581
00:49:31,117 --> 00:49:32,400
Everything that we're doing.

582
00:49:35,803 --> 00:49:37,560
That easy?

583
00:49:43,857 --> 00:49:45,000
It is that easy.

584
00:49:46,797 --> 00:49:49,700
I'm gonna say goodbye to the second season since the beginning.

585
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:53,050
And you don't have to go auditioning.

586
00:49:54,597 --> 00:49:55,960
And we will find something fun to do.

587
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,040
Right…

588
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:09,960
And ignore them all.

589
00:50:21,543 --> 00:50:22,640
Therefore….

590
00:50:29,177 --> 00:50:30,600
both of us….

591
00:50:41,517 --> 00:50:43,440
will create even better memories.

592
00:50:44,177 --> 00:50:45,600
Please continue to support us

593
00:50:46,017 --> 00:50:47,018
in the second season.

594
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,001
You can't do as you pleased

595
00:51:32,101 --> 00:51:34,402
if you're not ready for its consequences. - Dream

596
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:39,440
Do you know how one person

597
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,280
could inspire an art piece?

598
00:51:44,137 --> 00:51:45,160
It's their true self.

599
00:51:45,657 --> 00:51:47,700
What's wrong? Your home isn't your safezone?

600
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,660
I think my dad can't change.

601
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,480
Tokyo, your boy is here.

602
00:51:52,403 --> 00:51:55,200
You're so lucky to meet someone like us, you know that?

603
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:56,800
If I want something, I need to trade it with something else.

604
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,920
I've risked it with everything, what about you?

605
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,120
You said you'd stop starring in BL series.

606
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:05,000
Can I ask for another chance, Ms.Duangtawan?
