1
00:00:11,897 --> 00:00:13,278
I….We decided to be drum majors.

2
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,920
What do they teach here?

3
00:00:16,277 --> 00:00:17,278
Here, have a look.

4
00:00:17,378 --> 00:00:19,960
It costs 30,000 baht per person for private class?

5
00:00:20,497 --> 00:00:24,480
It offers good friends and good connection.

6
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:28,520
I just met you not long ago and now you showed up here at POPA.

7
00:00:29,437 --> 00:00:30,760
1..2...3...

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,920
Super drunk! Super fun!

9
00:00:35,637 --> 00:00:38,450
Bambi. You study here, too?

10
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,080
Hey guys, watch this.

11
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:51,000
Look at her!

12
00:01:51,977 --> 00:01:53,560
That is soooo good!

13
00:01:53,717 --> 00:01:56,320
Lukjan, you're so goddamn gorgeous!

14
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:58,680
I know.

15
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,160
You seemed so close to Name. I thought you didn't like him.

16
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,600
It's nothing. He asked me to join his MV, just for fun.

17
00:02:07,923 --> 00:02:10,280
Why? / Nothing.

18
00:02:10,537 --> 00:02:13,481
You think I'm that stupid. You think I don't know you?

19
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,560
You don't actually look like a smart person anyway.

20
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,200
Guys! Look at this!

21
00:02:19,577 --> 00:02:20,878
What a freakin guy!

22
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,680
He woke up, posted a clip and hundreds of thousands people liked his clip already.

23
00:02:26,217 --> 00:02:27,430
Wow! / Look at that!

24
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,160
Cocky! / Switch!

25
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:37,440
I didn't do it by myself.

26
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,640
Unlike you, edited it and everything. / Stop mocking me.

27
00:02:42,277 --> 00:02:44,760
Let's search about Bambi.

28
00:02:45,337 --> 00:02:46,800
Right.

29
00:02:49,457 --> 00:02:50,200
Here she comes!

30
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:52,720
Just Princess of Trash.

31
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:58,000
Nobody looks at you, waste of society.

32
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,331
Let's skip.

33
00:02:59,983 --> 00:03:01,440
Sustainable is real messed up.

34
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,841
You're the trash girl!

35
00:03:06,703 --> 00:03:10,520
No! I mean it in a good way. I like it.

36
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,720
Let's go back to our lesson, you're having too much fun.

37
00:03:16,803 --> 00:03:17,840
Okay, so…

38
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,640
we're going back to 14.

39
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,531
Bambi.

40
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,880
You're not going to the party?

41
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,400
I can't, I'll have a meeting after this.

42
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,371
What're you doing?

43
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,440
It's so refreshing.

44
00:03:57,883 --> 00:04:01,243
See? I flicked it open and I inhaled it.

45
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,760
Wow! Free acting for me?

46
00:04:09,343 --> 00:04:11,080
Wanna try? / Sure.

47
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,263
It's freezing. / Right?

48
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,371
Nice smell too.

49
00:04:20,077 --> 00:04:21,078
You like it?

50
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,560
You can have it.

51
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:29,177
What're you gonna use after?

52
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,640
I can get a new one.

53
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,603
Think of it as

54
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,480
a welcoming gift for joining our class.

55
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,401
Thank you.

56
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,440
How is it? Feeling any better

57
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,480
after getting to know them?

58
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,400
They're fine but

59
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,360
when they looked up your names

60
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,400
you all have good stories up there.

61
00:05:08,281 --> 00:05:11,640
But when they looked up my name, I was Princess of Trash.

62
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,200
It was funny in the beginning but when I heard it a lot

63
00:05:18,063 --> 00:05:19,064
it was really annoying.

64
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,410
If you don't like it, then you should do something else.

65
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,321
It can wipe away.

66
00:05:25,517 --> 00:05:26,840
It is that easy?

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,320
The problem is that I don't know what to do.

68
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,121
Why don't you start from something you like?

69
00:05:36,081 --> 00:05:37,320
What do you like to do?

70
00:05:39,477 --> 00:05:40,478
I like….

71
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,561
listening to music.

72
00:05:44,763 --> 00:05:47,160
See? Then you should sing.

73
00:05:48,243 --> 00:05:50,080
Anyone can launch their singles.

74
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,840
I have a friend and he's super ordinary.

75
00:05:55,697 --> 00:05:58,640
He came up with a fun idea to make music

76
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,880
he made good song with good beats.

77
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,880
Now he becomes famous.

78
00:06:05,777 --> 00:06:06,778
You should try.

79
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,560
You can think of something?

80
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,251
Wow! I really missed it.

81
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,680
You want to make music? / Yep.

82
00:06:40,043 --> 00:06:42,280
Sure. No problem.

83
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:48,280
I haven't had it for such a long time.

84
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,850
Let it cool down first.

85
00:06:53,597 --> 00:06:54,598
How is it?

86
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,360
The familiar taste.

87
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,040
Even though hip-hop is originated from the west side of the world,

88
00:07:04,117 --> 00:07:06,280
it has found its way into Thailand

89
00:07:06,363 --> 00:07:09,000
and flourished to the highest level in the past 10 years.

90
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:11,000
A boy named Mhong is another person

91
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,840
who was influenced by this culture.

92
00:07:13,103 --> 00:07:14,120
Mhong!

93
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,961
Go to the front of the class.

94
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,000
You can't trust human's heart.

95
00:07:21,131 --> 00:07:22,760
It's too deep to understand.

96
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,017
Even the most twisted of vines

97
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:27,440
seems benign compared to the soul.

98
00:07:30,037 --> 00:07:33,038
Still, he has never had a dream before.

99
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,431
Hey,

100
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,177
what's your IG account?

101
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,200
I'll tag you in your rap video.

102
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,340
You're Mhong, right? I'm Bambi.

103
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,320
Until A$AP Rocky met his Rihanna,

104
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,400
an ordinary boy like Mhong started to be interested in his talent.

105
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,321
Why does he need to stop growing?

106
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,680
To be a professional rapper

107
00:08:10,737 --> 00:08:13,481
has become a boy's dream before he knows it.

108
00:08:20,117 --> 00:08:23,240
I'm here to ask about

109
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,321
music.

110
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,761
What should I do to start?

111
00:08:28,561 --> 00:08:30,960
Start it? / Mhong!

112
00:08:31,023 --> 00:08:32,960
Table five wants noodles with no veggies.

113
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,201
Got it.

114
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:38,240
I think you should start with

115
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,560
asking yourself what kind of music you like.

116
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,990
Music that I like?

117
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,240
I can listen to anything, like pop music.

118
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,200
Like Sabrina or AESPA?

119
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,000
I love Sabrina. / Yeah?

120
00:08:55,123 --> 00:08:56,760
You serious? Me too.

121
00:08:56,923 --> 00:08:59,040
Starting with grouping your ideas.

122
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:03,120
Like Sabrina mostly tells stories about her life.

123
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,840
If you can think of anything, just send them to me.

124
00:09:06,243 --> 00:09:07,320
I can handle the rest.

125
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,700
Don't worrying about recording studio, we can do that at my company.

126
00:09:11,397 --> 00:09:12,398
No worries.

127
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,320
You think I can use it? I'm not a trainee like you.

128
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,160
I need to help out my friends

129
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,440
in a studio this Friday.

130
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,800
I can ask them about it.

131
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,881
Can I come?

132
00:09:31,243 --> 00:09:34,320
Maybe I can them myself and

133
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,400
I want to see how they make music.

134
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,760
But if it's not okay, then I'm cool.

135
00:09:40,817 --> 00:09:43,720
For you, anything.

136
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,600
Thanks. / No problem.

137
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,720
What are you fucking shooting?

138
00:09:59,877 --> 00:10:01,920
Why didn't you do something? Aloha?

139
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,200
Green, what the! What are you playing at?

140
00:10:04,281 --> 00:10:07,440
What? Have you ever fucking played this game?

141
00:10:07,783 --> 00:10:09,960
This is crazy, oh my!

142
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:13,200
Damn it! / Diesel, can you keep it down?

143
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,520
Your dad asked

144
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,880
if you still feel guilty about that car accident?

145
00:10:20,723 --> 00:10:21,724
Sure.

146
00:11:23,043 --> 00:11:25,440
That's so cool, bro. / Of course.

147
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:28,600
But I want some ad-libs that

148
00:11:28,717 --> 00:11:32,880
could balance my song to make it better.

149
00:11:32,923 --> 00:11:33,924
Sure you can.

150
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,920
Hey, can you moan for my song?

151
00:11:40,703 --> 00:11:42,704
Moan it like when you sleep with your boyfriend.

152
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,081
Can you try?

153
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,411
I want the sound that you're about to finish.

154
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,520
You should try it could go well with the song.

155
00:11:50,537 --> 00:11:52,680
Can you try?

156
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,680
I don't think she can.

157
00:11:55,877 --> 00:11:56,878
Why's that?

158
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,840
She has never sung in the studio before.

159
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,320
But she wanted to record a song, didn't she?

160
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,200
Why's that? / It could ruin her reputation

161
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:06,120
if she moans. / What reputation?

162
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,240
No one knows it was you.

163
00:12:11,103 --> 00:12:14,160
Why? You're here already.

164
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:21,158
Fine.

165
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,710
I don't want to force you or anything.

166
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,680
Let's go find something to eat.

167
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,640
See you.

168
00:12:39,303 --> 00:12:40,304
See you.

169
00:12:49,323 --> 00:12:50,680
I can try.

170
00:12:50,697 --> 00:12:53,800
That's more like it. Make it hot.

171
00:12:54,017 --> 00:12:55,018
Okay?

172
00:12:55,077 --> 00:12:57,560
(Singing)

173
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,231
Let's do this.

174
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,840
You want me to record it?

175
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:06,218
But

176
00:13:07,377 --> 00:13:10,320
Can I be in this room with only Mhong?

177
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,920
I can't do it around too many people.

178
00:13:13,383 --> 00:13:16,040
Sure thing.

179
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:17,600
Mhong, can you do it?

180
00:13:28,697 --> 00:13:29,698
Hey,

181
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,800
are you sure about this?

182
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,160
If you don't want to, you don't have to.

183
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:44,160
I just think that if I help him out,

184
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,841
he could help me out in the future.

185
00:13:50,057 --> 00:13:51,558
Please guide me.

186
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,120
I trust you.

187
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:10,360
Wait! No!

188
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,000
Let's do this one more time, you could try

189
00:14:14,663 --> 00:14:17,000
to close your eyes and

190
00:14:17,717 --> 00:14:21,288
breathe out slowly, okay?

191
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,921
You want me to turn off the lights?

192
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,760
You could feel better without anyone looking at you

193
00:14:35,957 --> 00:14:37,600
and it could help you with that, okay?

194
00:14:39,637 --> 00:14:41,800
Wait a minute. / Thank you.

195
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:51,958
Okay?

196
00:14:54,003 --> 00:14:55,240
Let's try again.

197
00:15:18,797 --> 00:15:19,800
Let's go, Bambi.

198
00:15:34,043 --> 00:15:36,317
What do you think?

199
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,960
Well…Um…I think it's fine.

200
00:15:39,257 --> 00:15:41,360
Good. Well done.

201
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,960
Won't you turn on the lights?

202
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:48,440
Right. Sure.

203
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,351
Okay.

204
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:11,000
This serum is the starter item for someone who wants to take care of themselves,

205
00:16:11,363 --> 00:16:14,440
Garnier Bright Complete Overnight Booster Serum.

206
00:16:14,523 --> 00:16:17,360
Just a few drops on your palm and tap them to your face.

207
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,160
It's easy to use.

208
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,880
I can guarantee you that ladies will fall in love with your bright skin.

209
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,960
Hello, Gunner.

210
00:16:31,641 --> 00:16:35,000
Mhong, they like how you mixed the song.

211
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,800
They are thinking of your debut in showcase next month.

212
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,424
So dope!

213
00:16:41,963 --> 00:16:45,120
No shit! You serious?

214
00:16:45,677 --> 00:16:47,760
This is too much!

215
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,600
But they need to hear your demo first, okay?

216
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,000
If it's not that good, they won't let you on stage, you hear me?

217
00:16:54,337 --> 00:16:56,640
Just try it. / Whoa!

218
00:16:56,783 --> 00:17:00,120
Don't worry. I'll give you my best shot, bro.

219
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,080
About recording studio for Bambi,

220
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:06,920
if nobody is scheduled to use it, then you can book it.

221
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:10,720
Okay? / You guys are too kind.

222
00:17:15,023 --> 00:17:18,160
This is so cool. You're so good at this.

223
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,200
You're gonna be famous.

224
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:23,720
I can go this far

225
00:17:26,043 --> 00:17:27,240
because of you.

226
00:17:32,797 --> 00:17:35,480
You crazy? It's a team effort.

227
00:17:35,617 --> 00:17:37,040
I didn't do anything.

228
00:17:37,243 --> 00:17:38,244
Well, it's true.

229
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,800
I'm thinking about writing a new song.

230
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,800
How's your new song going? Need any help?

231
00:17:47,897 --> 00:17:49,200
I'm about to show it to you.

232
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,100
I wrote a little of it but…

233
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,800
It's okay. Let me see.

234
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,650
I'm not sure if it's good enough.

235
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:17,000
I know! Why don't we go up to my room?

236
00:18:18,037 --> 00:18:20,800
We can sing it out loud and I could add some beats.

237
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:24,560
Let's go.

238
00:18:27,603 --> 00:18:29,840
Mhong, don't forget to close the shop for me.

239
00:18:30,597 --> 00:18:32,383
Make yourself at home, dear.

240
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,440
I'm about to head home.

241
00:18:34,677 --> 00:18:37,440
You are? / Yeah, I should go. It's getting late.

242
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,921
See you.

243
00:18:43,877 --> 00:18:44,920
See you later.

244
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,850
Okay. / Bye.

245
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,411
Bye.

246
00:19:00,283 --> 00:19:03,160
When you paint with watercolor,

247
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,920
don't forget to clean your brush first

248
00:19:06,761 --> 00:19:07,762
so colors won't mix.

249
00:19:15,317 --> 00:19:16,318
Here.

250
00:19:19,697 --> 00:19:21,250
It's messed up.

251
00:19:26,717 --> 00:19:27,718
I'm sorry.

252
00:19:29,563 --> 00:19:30,600
It's okay.

253
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,801
You can get closer if you want.

254
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,631
CUT!

255
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:49,680
Good, let's move on to the next scene.

256
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:51,080
Thank you.

257
00:19:54,963 --> 00:19:57,840
What is it? Your brows are twisting.

258
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,560
I mean…

259
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,400
Honestly, I don't know.

260
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,560
I..I think I didn't really into this scene that much.

261
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,721
I'm not sure.

262
00:20:09,823 --> 00:20:11,600
You think viewers would feel that scene?

263
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,680
I think it's fine.

264
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,560
I looked at you so much and I started to feel something.

265
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,680
Yeah? / Yeah.

266
00:20:23,177 --> 00:20:24,178
Don't stress out.

267
00:20:26,178 --> 00:20:27,360
Thank you. / Thank you.

268
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,840
Tang. / What?

269
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,681
What is it?

270
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,281
I think…

271
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,320
Can you talk to the director for me?

272
00:20:40,277 --> 00:20:41,480
I want to try it again.

273
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,800
I understand you.

274
00:20:46,603 --> 00:20:49,880
And I know that viewers can feel how hard you work on this.

275
00:20:50,604 --> 00:20:53,120
The director has his reasons.

276
00:20:56,343 --> 00:20:58,280
It's okay. / No, I feel…

277
00:21:00,877 --> 00:21:04,650
I think.. / They know what they're doing.

278
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,000
If you want it to be better,

279
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,201
you need to work harder before shooting.

280
00:21:09,623 --> 00:21:12,400
Work harder and better in a limited time

281
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,001
you know?

282
00:21:16,137 --> 00:21:18,200
It's really fine. / Yeah.

283
00:21:18,463 --> 00:21:19,320
Don't dwell on it.

284
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,920
Mheng! That table, over there.

285
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,401
Take it to that table, go.

286
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,561
It's late. What're you doing? / Sleeping.

287
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,640
I'm helping out at the shop.

288
00:21:32,681 --> 00:21:35,960
Noodles to go. / Sure. Just a sec.

289
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,520
You want to come here?

290
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,840
What type of beef? / Tender one.

291
00:21:46,143 --> 00:21:47,240
Tender.

292
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,480
I just ate it. You want me to eat your noodles every day?

293
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,101
You said you like it, I want you to have it again.

294
00:21:54,683 --> 00:21:56,300
Get it to this table.

295
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,241
Can you boost me up?

296
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:00,200
Sure, it's here.

297
00:22:00,283 --> 00:22:01,400
What type of beef?

298
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,801
You get my whole support, can you think of a song?

299
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,600
Nope. Because I'm busy thinking of you.

300
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,261
Just kidding.

301
00:22:08,993 --> 00:22:09,880
The small type of noodles.

302
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,481
You're not working? You sent texts back so fast.

303
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:19,520
Eureka!

304
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,120
I can think of something.

305
00:22:25,161 --> 00:22:27,000
You do? That's so great.

306
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,000
Wait, is it your song or my song?

307
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,800
What's wrong with you? You haven't showed up here quite often.

308
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,601
Can I get your Discord account so we can play at the same time easily?

309
00:22:56,143 --> 00:22:57,400
Yo! Aloha!

310
00:22:58,863 --> 00:23:02,160
We've been playing together for such a long time, why did we just exchange our Discord accounts?

311
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,080
What is it with your username?

312
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,720
How to pronounce it? So hard.

313
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,880
kwamfhundanupha

314
00:23:13,463 --> 00:23:14,464
My name is Dream.

315
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,681
Hello?

316
00:23:20,563 --> 00:23:21,564
Hello?

317
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,080
You're a girl?

318
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,760
Why are you playing this type of game?

319
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,600
I rarely see women playing this game.

320
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,800
What's wrong with a woman playing shooting game?

321
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,920
Why can't we play it?

322
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,250
I play it better than you.

323
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,880
I don't know, it's just weird.

324
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,760
I don't fucking know.

325
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,800
We're not in Stone Age, stop judging already.

326
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,840
The world is not developing enough because of people like you.

327
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,640
You're a smarty-pants, aren't you?

328
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,520
Can you try to educate me?

329
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:53,480
Why women like you play this game?

330
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,840
Hello?

331
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,120
The world is a shitty place. I just want to blow off steam here.

332
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,160
You can do anything in a game, everyone is equal.

333
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,551
That's true.

334
00:24:15,937 --> 00:24:18,520
You can be whoever you want, do whatever you want here.

335
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,000
You can be anyone.

336
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,400
Except a good gamer, you amateur.

337
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,200
And you dare to judge people?

338
00:24:29,257 --> 00:24:30,800
Such a smart mouth.

339
00:24:31,063 --> 00:24:33,400
I want to see how someone with such a smart mouth look like.

340
00:24:33,697 --> 00:24:34,680
Show me your IG.

341
00:24:35,037 --> 00:24:37,480
I don't normally use IG. I gotta go. Bye. / I don't believe you.

342
00:25:03,537 --> 00:25:05,320
You're done with work? You're coming to the protest?

343
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,160
You go ahead, I'll go after.

344
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,161
This is a work of art!

345
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,160
Their fans must have loved you for this.

346
00:25:15,743 --> 00:25:16,744
You think?

347
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,383
I'll give you more works.

348
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,561
Okay? / Sure.

349
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,250
Pour me with more works. I can do them all.

350
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,800
I gotta go. See you.

351
00:25:24,003 --> 00:25:25,880
Be safe, bye. / Bye.

352
00:25:34,077 --> 00:25:35,078
Hello, mom.

353
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,160
Where are you?

354
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,280
Are you going to the protest?

355
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,281
I'm at home.

356
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,041
See? I'm really at home.

357
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,200
You know that I'm worried about you, right?

358
00:25:50,643 --> 00:25:54,041
I just don't want you to face what I faced.

359
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,700
Do you have enough money?

360
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,800
I can help you out.

361
00:26:03,243 --> 00:26:04,244
Dream,

362
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:07,160
I really want you to go home.

363
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,121
You know what?

364
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,200
Your dad didn't want it to end up like this.

365
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,880
He didn't have a choice.

366
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,800
You should forgive him.

367
00:26:21,241 --> 00:26:22,880
Cut him some slack.

368
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,440
What do you mean he didn't have a choice?

369
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,680
You got that ankle bracelet because of him, you forgot already?

370
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,760
I can't pretend like nothing happened.

371
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,401
I should go.

372
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,600
I need to tell you that our party concerned about this.

373
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,320
We received more complaints from younger generations

374
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,360
who wanted to revise the bills and the party concerned about it.

375
00:26:54,803 --> 00:26:56,280
We're working on it.

376
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,720
We'll submit the draft to the parliament

377
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,160
next month so it can be some changes.

378
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,760
We focus on Prisoners of Conscience

379
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,320
and they need to be released.

380
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,920
In the future….. / Liar!

381
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,720
Prisoners of Conscience can't be punished because of this.

382
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:22,531
What do you think?

383
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,720
Well, I'm not good at this.

384
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:29,560
But aren't you supposed to like each other?

385
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,040
I watched it and I don't feel like you did.

386
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,303
It's not like you're not good at acting.

387
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,080
Actually, I thought

388
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,640
this could be better than this.

389
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,440
I miss being on stage in the play.

390
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,400
I could feel

391
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,600
the taste of freedom back then.

392
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,360
I was so happy.

393
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,200
You didn't really like

394
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,440
what you're doing right now?

395
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,840
I thought you enjoy doing it.

396
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,760
Actually,

397
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,760
I really love acting.

398
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,320
When they asked me to join the series,

399
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,121
I said yes immediately.

400
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:20,440
When I tried it, I just acted as they told me to.

401
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,000
They said that

402
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,280
people are already happy when they see me with Namkhang.

403
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,480
People are happy.

404
00:28:36,517 --> 00:28:37,881
But are you happy?

405
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,560
My mom likes to say

406
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,760
if you want something, you need to give something first.

407
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,321
I need to trade it.

408
00:28:55,617 --> 00:28:56,920
To make people happy,

409
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,280
then people will make me happy in return.

410
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,520
Thank you for telling me this.

411
00:29:14,257 --> 00:29:16,760
But why did you tell me?

412
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,281
I have no idea.

413
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,360
I just feel like you would want to listen to me,

414
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,880
to understand me.

415
00:29:35,097 --> 00:29:37,480
Do you remember what you once told me?

416
00:29:38,457 --> 00:29:39,760
Do whatever you want.

417
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,560
You want to be in a play,

418
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,840
then you should ask them to be in one.

419
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,280
This could boost you up.

420
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:10,280
I'm coming all the way here to listen to your song.

421
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,680
I know. I feel really confident about it. That's why I told you to come.

422
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,640
Let's go up to my room.

423
00:30:17,601 --> 00:30:18,602
Huh?

424
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,640
If I save it, then I can't revise it later.

425
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,001
Come on, let's go to my room.

426
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:52,960
Something like this.

427
00:30:53,263 --> 00:30:54,470
That's so good.

428
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,480
Yeah? / It's cute.

429
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,920
But I think it should add something.

430
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,960
Which one do you think I should add?

431
00:31:11,843 --> 00:31:14,480
What about that one on top? / Which one?

432
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,881
This one?

433
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,520
Not that one! / Which one?

434
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,081
This one?

435
00:31:34,297 --> 00:31:35,800
Right, this one?

436
00:31:48,563 --> 00:31:49,564
Hey,

437
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,840
what perfume did you use?

438
00:32:00,917 --> 00:32:03,320
It smells so good.

439
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,440
You still can smell it?

440
00:32:07,563 --> 00:32:09,080
It should be faded already.

441
00:32:15,943 --> 00:32:16,944
Excuse me.

442
00:32:30,563 --> 00:32:31,564
Nope, I still can smell it.

443
00:32:36,563 --> 00:32:39,360
If you said so.

444
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,200
Tell me if you want more sounds.

445
00:33:09,517 --> 00:33:10,518
Right, Bambi.

446
00:33:13,597 --> 00:33:14,680
Honestly,

447
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,800
since we were apart,

448
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,801
I always wanted  to meet you.

449
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,760
I tried to say hi to you.

450
00:33:30,721 --> 00:33:32,440
But I didn't know what to say.

451
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,520
I didn't know how to start talking to you

452
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:42,160
until I met you at POPA.

453
00:33:49,357 --> 00:33:50,840
I think it's destiny.

454
00:34:05,323 --> 00:34:06,324
Bambi…

455
00:34:08,303 --> 00:34:09,304
I….

456
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:15,760
Can I kiss you?

457
00:34:24,803 --> 00:34:27,440
if you want something, you need to give something first.

458
00:34:30,097 --> 00:34:31,098
I need to trade it.

459
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,800
I really like the song you just played for me.

460
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,160
Can I have this song?

461
00:35:22,477 --> 00:35:23,478
Sure, you can.

462
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,761
Let's go recording this song.

463
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,161
Wow! So cute. Now I have enough energy to record a song.

464
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,561
It's done!

465
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,601
You're the best. I'm ready to shoot an MV.

466
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,681
Let's get something to eat at Siam.

467
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,800
I'll finish class late, rain check?

468
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,500
Yay! Thank you so much. I really like it.

469
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,760
Do you like me?

470
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,761
I'll have a sweet dream tonight. / Super cute, you little Bambi.

471
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,841
When will this song end? I've been listening to it for 9 hours.

472
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,080
I followed from TikTok, Pure and Namkhang's dance challenge is so cute.

473
00:36:17,203 --> 00:36:19,480
Hello, everyone. I'm Bambi

474
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,481
I'd like to thank everyone for

475
00:36:21,641 --> 00:36:23,800
using my song DM.

476
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,600
Please join dance challenge. See you later.

477
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,721
Are you okay? Why didn't you text me back?

478
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,880
Can I talk to you after the showcase?

479
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,961
You produced a song for a girl.

480
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,920
If you can't finish your song, forget about the show.

481
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,700
Can you serve the noodles?

482
00:37:24,603 --> 00:37:25,640
Mhong!

483
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,560
Look at this!

484
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:43,320
He asked a girl to be his girlfriend. / Look at this.

485
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,600
In the middle of party. / Super cute.

486
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,761
I want a boyfriend like this. / I know.

487
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,680
I'd do anything.

488
00:37:50,737 --> 00:37:54,560
It's hard to say no. Many people are cheering them on.

489
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,720
So cute, look at that.

490
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:04,711
What're you looking at?

491
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,800
Where's Mhong?

492
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,681
Let's go. I don't want to be late.

493
00:38:35,295 --> 00:38:37,640
What kind of song is this? I don't get it.

494
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,081
Let's go listening to the song in a car.

495
00:38:44,681 --> 00:38:45,840
Can't. No more condoms.

496
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,081
I have.

497
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,250
Sure but can you stop bringing up Name?

498
00:38:54,477 --> 00:38:55,478
Okay?

499
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,050
I don't really care about him. Let's go.

500
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,961
Alright everyone, for the next song,

501
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,760
I have a surprise for you.

502
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:14,520
His name isn't on the list, but

503
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,160
everyone knows him.

504
00:39:17,723 --> 00:39:22,960
Please give it up for Mhongmuangthai.

505
00:39:30,437 --> 00:39:33,780
Hello, everyone. I'm Mhongmuangthai.

506
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,997
I'm not here as an artist

507
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,400
but I'm here to express my feeling

508
00:39:44,454 --> 00:39:46,455
to someone.

509
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:50,840
Without further ado, I'd like to ask

510
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:55,280
the singer of a song called DM to get up.

511
00:39:59,932 --> 00:40:02,200
Get up!

512
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,680
Get up!

513
00:41:55,725 --> 00:41:59,000
Can you be my girlfriend?

514
00:42:05,983 --> 00:42:08,642
Be his girlfriend!

515
00:42:08,733 --> 00:42:11,734
Be his girlfriend!

516
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:17,080
You're my baby, my Bambi.

517
00:42:21,203 --> 00:42:23,680
Can you be my girlfriend?

518
00:42:33,933 --> 00:42:35,340
It's okay. It's alright, bro.

519
00:42:35,448 --> 00:42:36,600
It's okay.

520
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,040
Bambi, hey!

521
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,960
What's going on?

522
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,240
What's wrong with you?

523
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,960
It's my fault.

524
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,080
I should have told you sooner.

525
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,721
Hey!

526
00:43:06,721 --> 00:43:07,880
If you're not ready,

527
00:43:08,585 --> 00:43:09,960
it's really okay.

528
00:43:10,749 --> 00:43:12,250
We don't have to be official.

529
00:43:13,355 --> 00:43:15,050
It's not about that.

530
00:43:15,086 --> 00:43:18,560
Well, it's my fault to put you in a spotlight like that.

531
00:43:19,243 --> 00:43:22,960
But I really have deep feeling about you.

532
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,320
And I feel like you'd feel the same way

533
00:43:27,537 --> 00:43:29,320
with signals you gave me.

534
00:43:34,823 --> 00:43:36,400
What is it that you feel about me?

535
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,920
I don't feel that way with you.

536
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,880
I'm sorry for giving you mixed signals.

537
00:43:50,005 --> 00:43:51,040
What do you mean?

538
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,200
I don't like you like that.

539
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,041
You don't?

540
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,801
If you don't like me, then why did you did that?

541
00:44:22,881 --> 00:44:25,840
I did everything for you, I produced a song for you.

542
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,200
Say something!

543
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,400
Say something! Why did you did that?

544
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:34,250
Just tell me, what was it between us?

545
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:37,640
I'm sorry.

546
00:44:38,132 --> 00:44:39,133
Can you please tell me that you didn't do it

547
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,041
because you wanted a song?

548
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:43,360
Did you have any feeling for me?

549
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,360
Tell me! Say something!

550
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,120
Tell me that you have the same feeling.

551
00:44:49,214 --> 00:44:50,040
I'm sorry.

552
00:44:51,808 --> 00:44:52,809
I'm hurt.

553
00:45:25,938 --> 00:45:26,939
Bambi.

554
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,001
Bambi

555
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,441
Are you okay?

556
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,841
Stop crying.

557
00:46:02,047 --> 00:46:04,160
I kissed Mhong because

558
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,640
I just wanted his song.

559
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,770
If I want something, I need to give something in return, right?

560
00:46:27,405 --> 00:46:30,180
I didn't know that it'd feel shitty like this.

561
00:47:03,808 --> 00:47:04,809
It's okay.

562
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,200
Let yourself feel this way.

563
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,241
Now you know how it feels.

564
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,600
So you won't repeat it again.

565
00:47:45,161 --> 00:47:47,280
You're back?

566
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,803
How's the concert? / Let me know if you need me

567
00:47:51,949 --> 00:47:53,600
I was waiting for so long. / I'm here with you

568
00:47:58,413 --> 00:48:00,040
You got flowers?

569
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,760
Did you film your performance?

570
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,120
I want to see it.

571
00:48:04,334 --> 00:48:06,840
I want to know how your debut was.

572
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,920
Many people cheered you on?

573
00:48:15,807 --> 00:48:16,960
I didn't film anything.

574
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,520
You can go to bed, I'll wash the dishes.

575
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:26,200
Well, I was waiting to see it.

576
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,561
Close up the shop after you're done cleaning.

577
00:48:29,662 --> 00:48:30,663
Got it.

578
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,161
I still want to be your friend.

579
00:50:23,047 --> 00:50:25,348
If you want something, you need to give something first.

580
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,401
To make people happy,

581
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,601
then people will make me happy in return.

582
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,000
You're free tonight?

583
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,360
I'm taking you somewhere.

584
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:34,621
Huh?

585
00:50:34,681 --> 00:50:36,682
Do you think Tokyo act weirdly lately?

586
00:50:36,917 --> 00:50:39,360
Right, he's in love right now.

587
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:42,440
Can I ask you something? You do know that

588
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,960
I really like you, right?

589
00:50:46,463 --> 00:50:48,400
Bambi, you're too stiff.

590
00:50:48,464 --> 00:50:50,665
Can you relax your face? Can I get a smile without an actual smile?

591
00:50:50,734 --> 00:50:51,880
Where's the picture?

592
00:50:52,437 --> 00:50:54,480
Hey, Ms.Duangtawan is here.

593
00:50:55,389 --> 00:50:57,080
Who is Ms.Duangtawan?
