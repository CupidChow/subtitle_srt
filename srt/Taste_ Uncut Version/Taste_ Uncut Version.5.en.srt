1
00:00:12,017 --> 00:00:13,800
Can I go to your mom's birthday party?

2
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,680
Can you help me with that? / F--king help me?

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,720
Who do you think got me kicked out from my label?

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,724
It's because of you.

5
00:00:19,797 --> 00:00:23,000
Love shot! / She tells me every day that she doesn’t like you,

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,040
what more do you want?

7
00:00:24,477 --> 00:00:26,320
I ruined everything.

8
00:00:26,423 --> 00:00:27,480
It's alright.

9
00:00:27,797 --> 00:00:28,798
It will get better.

10
00:00:30,477 --> 00:00:32,640
Are you okay? You can tell me anything.

11
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,840
You and I are f--king nothing. I have no feeling for you, you hear me?

12
00:01:50,557 --> 00:01:51,558
Pure!

13
00:02:01,483 --> 00:02:02,484
Hey!

14
00:02:03,283 --> 00:02:06,480
You have to be on a set this morning, you know that? / What time is it?

15
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,360
It's 6.30.

16
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,160
It didn't charge! / You have to shoot a show and you woke up at 6.30?

17
00:02:11,337 --> 00:02:12,358
Where is Namkhang? / Oh my gosh!

18
00:02:12,403 --> 00:02:13,880
Is he there? / He's there.

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,480
How long? / Why did you turn off your phone last night?

20
00:02:17,563 --> 00:02:19,200
I didn't, I didn't plug the charger.

21
00:02:20,164 --> 00:02:21,165
Get these for me.

22
00:02:21,283 --> 00:02:23,120
Namkhang is there already.

23
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,000
Just perfect!

24
00:02:30,377 --> 00:02:32,560
Pure, Joe is furious I'm telling you.

25
00:02:38,317 --> 00:02:39,560
This is not good.

26
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,760
What, girl? What?!

27
00:03:11,137 --> 00:03:12,680
Sorry for keeping you late last night.

28
00:03:17,017 --> 00:03:20,120
No need to apologize. I wanted to pick you up.

29
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,561
Don't worry about it.

30
00:03:26,023 --> 00:03:28,320
Thank you. I gotta go.

31
00:03:30,917 --> 00:03:32,120
Too much.

32
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,120
Such a wife material, Japanese housewife.

33
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,040
Hot news alert! Someone reported that they saw Diesel,

34
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,400
a son of Mr.Thara, head of Thai Pen Thai Party,

35
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,103
visited a nightclub last night

36
00:03:54,203 --> 00:03:56,000
and he's not even 18 yet.

37
00:03:56,077 --> 00:03:57,320
It's not just that. There's more.

38
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,280
It was reported that he abused a woman

39
00:04:00,497 --> 00:04:02,488
in a nightclub, she's injured

40
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,800
and needed to go to the hospital.

41
00:04:04,943 --> 00:04:07,440
Mr.Thara made a statement

42
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:09,360
throught social media immediately.

43
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,000
There is a rumor about my son

44
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:14,440
and I can confirm that it is not true.

45
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,690
I have solid evidence as well as witnesses about his whereabouts last night.

46
00:04:18,797 --> 00:04:21,880
This is the latest statement from Mr.Thara.

47
00:04:21,963 --> 00:04:24,440
We need to watch this topic closely.

48
00:04:24,557 --> 00:04:26,943
It seems like Mr.Thara will hold a press conference

49
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,497
about what happened.

50
00:04:28,563 --> 00:04:32,200
Our reporters are ready to follow on this.

51
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,960
Stop causing troubles already!

52
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,680
Do you have any idea what I did all morning?

53
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,360
I needed to tell someone to erase all evidence from CCTV.

54
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,840
I needed to call the press to stop them from stirring this up.

55
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,360
I also needed to hire them to interview us,

56
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,640
just because my son

57
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:01,840
can't control his anger like an animal.

58
00:05:07,477 --> 00:05:09,000
Should you say something to me?

59
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,160
Should you say something to me?

60
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,921
I'm sorry.

61
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,000
Stop with that sad puppy face.

62
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,751
They're waiting for us.

63
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,520
You said you wouldn't turn out to be like your Dad.

64
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,720
Can you tell them the truth? I'm asking you.

65
00:07:39,131 --> 00:07:41,080
You don't have to lie, there're so many ways to choose.

66
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,400
You said that you didn't like your Dad, why did you act like him?

67
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,120
You lied to me back then?

68
00:07:50,763 --> 00:07:52,200
I know that you're better than this.

69
00:07:52,897 --> 00:07:53,898
Can you tell the truth?

70
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,201
Diesel?

71
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,611
Diesel?

72
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,720
Are you listening to me?

73
00:08:01,883 --> 00:08:02,800
Mr.Diesel,

74
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,081
your Dad wanted you out there right now.

75
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,400
Damn it! Say something!

76
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,720
Why did you fucking lie?

77
00:08:15,917 --> 00:08:18,000
You can't just stay fucking still and do nothing!

78
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,960
He's your Dad. You need to talk to him!

79
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,681
It's your life, make your own choice. / I fucking can't make my own choice!

80
00:08:32,443 --> 00:08:33,445
Listen to me,

81
00:08:34,463 --> 00:08:38,360
stop messing with my life, ever.

82
00:08:38,943 --> 00:08:40,800
And quite preaching me already.

83
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,400
You need to take care of your Dad's business.

84
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,360
Stop minding my business!

85
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,280
Mr. Thara..

86
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,760
please answer this question, where were you during the time of incident?

87
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,960
I was working for people all night

88
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,760
until the next morning.

89
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,120
Can you comment on the incident? Is it true? / Is it true?

90
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,970
I need to tell you that it's not a fair game.

91
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,400
I can confirm you myself

92
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,800
that what happened wasn't true at all.

93
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,400
It's just a smear political campaign.

94
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,120
Where were you during the time of incident?

95
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,123
Please tell us, where were you?

96
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:56,480
I'm at home, helping my Dad out.

97
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,170
It was such a big mess last night.

98
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,601
You've been through it already.

99
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,560
You're sleeping in a man's room? Whoa! / Nothing happened between us.

100
00:10:43,077 --> 00:10:44,760
Stop. It's nothing like that.

101
00:10:47,003 --> 00:10:49,364
About Ms.Duangtawan's birthday party,

102
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,480
is it about bird or something?

103
00:10:56,777 --> 00:10:57,600
To be honest,

104
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,710
you're so bold like

105
00:11:01,323 --> 00:11:03,150
if I were you and I was being told off like that,

106
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,050
I wouldn't dare to share the same air as her.

107
00:11:12,443 --> 00:11:13,443
That's true.

108
00:11:15,097 --> 00:11:18,000
But people kept telling me that

109
00:11:19,323 --> 00:11:23,280
she can change people's lives.

110
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,200
I want to give it another try.

111
00:11:29,317 --> 00:11:31,277
If I try so hard this time,

112
00:11:33,097 --> 00:11:34,098
and it doesn't work out,

113
00:11:38,423 --> 00:11:39,600
then I'll give up.

114
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,521
Okay?

115
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,440
I saw this book at Diesel's place.

116
00:11:51,517 --> 00:11:53,710
The book has the same name at the theme.

117
00:11:54,243 --> 00:11:55,640
The Conference of the Birds,

118
00:11:56,877 --> 00:11:58,840
an ancient Persian poem.

119
00:12:00,783 --> 00:12:02,760
Have you heard of a bird called Simurgh?

120
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:09,720
Hello.

121
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,440
Hello. / You're so grown up now.

122
00:12:13,397 --> 00:12:14,700
Ms.Duangtawan is waiting inside.

123
00:12:24,883 --> 00:12:27,250
Yeah? / Diesel! You have to watch what I just sent you.

124
00:12:27,737 --> 00:12:28,840
This is bad, damn it!

125
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,561
#DieselTrashMan

126
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,761
Like father like son, both are assholes.

127
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,280
He deserved to be in jail.

128
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,000
Is it alright to lie on news?

129
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,241
You're helping out your Dad at home?

130
00:13:40,037 --> 00:13:41,238
Erase the clip now.

131
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,681
Are you gonna do it or not?

132
00:13:50,757 --> 00:13:54,758
I'll track down your IP address. I don't care who you are and I'll make you pay.

133
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,801
I'm not scared of you.

134
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,151
Son of a bitch!

135
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,201
Glamorous climate criminals. 1% of the rich flying private jets

136
00:14:16,301 --> 00:14:18,423
causing more pollutions than normal people do for their entire lives.

137
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,881
Hi. / How are you?

138
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,360
Look at her.

139
00:14:48,443 --> 00:14:49,600
Didn't she care about the theme at all?

140
00:14:50,703 --> 00:14:52,800
Look! No feather?

141
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,640
You need to be more careful these days.

142
00:15:14,257 --> 00:15:17,362
Hello. / Happy Birthday.

143
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,561
Where are we going?

144
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,320
Diesel! Let me go! What the f--k is wrong with you?

145
00:15:33,203 --> 00:15:34,280
Who is Anyone?

146
00:15:39,597 --> 00:15:42,320
I have no idea, why did you ask?

147
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,920
You said that your friend asked you to share the article, Anyone wrote it.

148
00:15:50,143 --> 00:15:52,880
Bambi! Who?

149
00:15:59,143 --> 00:16:00,080
You can get in here because of me and I can make you leave.

150
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:05,000
Diesel / Bambi

151
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,481
What is it?

152
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,521
Who?

153
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,080
Isn't it the life that you want so bad?

154
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,920
Bambi? Who?

155
00:16:19,017 --> 00:16:20,360
No, I can't… / Who?

156
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:23,320
It's just…. / Nothing comes for free.

157
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:24,960
I can't tell you.

158
00:16:25,543 --> 00:16:27,840
Did you listen to the word I said?

159
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,800
I can let you get in here and I can make you leave.

160
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,881
What is it?

161
00:16:33,897 --> 00:16:34,898
Choose one!

162
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,751
Choose one!

163
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,471
You're hurting me.

164
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,901
I'm so sorry but I really can't say anything.

165
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,757
Hello, Daeng.

166
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,880
Come to the parking lot, you need to take someone home.

167
00:16:57,237 --> 00:16:58,320
Diesel?

168
00:17:09,723 --> 00:17:10,880
I'm begging you.

169
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:13,371
Get in and leave.

170
00:17:19,377 --> 00:17:20,678
Hello, Jom. Did you find it?

171
00:17:21,903 --> 00:17:23,804
Damn it! Let me know the updates.

172
00:17:27,497 --> 00:17:28,498
Leave!

173
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,250
Bambi!

174
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,251
Anyone is ….

175
00:17:50,257 --> 00:17:51,880
Dream, she's my friend

176
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,321
from school.

177
00:17:58,597 --> 00:17:59,640
Dream Danupha?

178
00:18:05,303 --> 00:18:06,360
You know her?

179
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:11,800
Move! Out of the way.

180
00:18:13,203 --> 00:18:14,204
Get out!

181
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,760
What the heck? / Damn it! Dream, fuck you!

182
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,320
Where are you going?

183
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,161
Where to?

184
00:18:21,503 --> 00:18:23,200
Diesel? Where are you going?

185
00:18:31,037 --> 00:18:33,160
Happy Birthday, Ms.Duangtawan.

186
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,840
I can't join your birthday party this year but I always think about you.

187
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,200
Thank you for everything.

188
00:18:39,497 --> 00:18:41,520
Wish you all the best. See you in New York.

189
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,680
She starred in my last film. Now she's so famous, maybe she forgets about me.

190
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,720
No, she won't. How's the sequence coming along?

191
00:18:49,877 --> 00:18:51,360
Still in auditioning process.

192
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,250
I hope you get the right cast members.

193
00:18:54,403 --> 00:18:56,560
Thank you.. / Thank you for coming.

194
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,640
Have you met Dale? / I haven't.

195
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,171
Hello.

196
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,803
I don't think your name is on the guest list.

197
00:19:23,117 --> 00:19:25,880
Diesel sent me an invitation.

198
00:19:31,983 --> 00:19:33,120
You look good today.

199
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:36,891
Thank you.

200
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,203
My friend, Tokyo, helped putting it together.

201
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:47,000
I got inspiration of the outfit from a poem called…

202
00:19:48,203 --> 00:19:49,600
The Conference of the Birds.

203
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:54,560
Simurgh is a mythological bird

204
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:59,320
that all the birds are seeking for it, hoping it to be their sovereign.

205
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,480
But before reaching its palace,

206
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,083
the birds needed to get through various tough tasks.

207
00:20:05,523 --> 00:20:06,803
When they reached the palace,

208
00:20:07,463 --> 00:20:10,440
they saw a pond located right in the middle.

209
00:20:11,506 --> 00:20:12,880
When they walked towards it,

210
00:20:13,542 --> 00:20:15,523
they saw their own reflections.

211
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:20,360
Reflection of birds in the pond. Good thinking.

212
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,320
It can be interpreted that

213
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:27,120
the birds that could get through those obstacles,

214
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:29,680
they are Simurgh.

215
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,800
Impressive.

216
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,250
I'll have an audition for my new show and I'll have Jib reach out to you.

217
00:20:49,437 --> 00:20:52,360
Ms.Duangtawan, please come in for group photo.

218
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,440
A little closer, please

219
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,941
I'll give 200 baht if you pinch a cheek of someone next to you.

220
00:22:05,363 --> 00:22:06,680
200 baht.

221
00:22:22,137 --> 00:22:25,000
Can you give us cat's ears? / Cat's ears, please.

222
00:22:29,077 --> 00:22:32,078
Pure, can you do it too?

223
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,200
Pinch Namkhang's cheeks?

224
00:22:50,663 --> 00:22:53,760
Who's the girl in the photo? You betrayed on Namkhang?

225
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,040
Who ? / Who said that?

226
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,400
Who said it. / You bitch!

227
00:23:00,777 --> 00:23:01,778
Are you delusional?

228
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,751
What woman?

229
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,921
Bambi?

230
00:23:07,663 --> 00:23:09,500
It's his personal stuff.

231
00:23:11,243 --> 00:23:12,880
Please don't go.

232
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:21,360
Actor from BL series took a drunk girl back to his place.

233
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:23,571
Woman? / Who's the bitch? Why did she hurt my little puppy like that?

234
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,001
They're doing great until the monster woman comes along.

235
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,000
If you know who she it, let us know. We'll attack her.

236
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,720
Their company should take better care of the artists.

237
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,801
Fans need to focus. This is something personal.

238
00:23:37,101 --> 00:23:38,200
It's his business, give him some privacy.

239
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:47,720
Joe, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to.

240
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,961
That's enough.

241
00:23:56,077 --> 00:23:57,360
What happened, Tang?

242
00:24:02,743 --> 00:24:04,783
Joe wanted to suspend you for a while.

243
00:24:05,997 --> 00:24:08,440
But I told him that doing that

244
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,560
would also affect Namkhang.

245
00:24:11,963 --> 00:24:14,000
So we decided to have you

246
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,243
take a break from the play.

247
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:21,200
No, it's not related… / Of course it is.

248
00:24:22,163 --> 00:24:25,163
I spoiled you and look what happened.

249
00:24:26,317 --> 00:24:28,160
If I hadn't spoiled you, you wouldn't have came to the set late the other day.

250
00:24:28,837 --> 00:24:32,120
It's an accident. / But the photo wasn't.

251
00:24:34,037 --> 00:24:36,360
Can you see this as a lesson?

252
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:38,800
After this,

253
00:24:39,657 --> 00:24:42,160
please show me that you're really trying.

254
00:24:43,037 --> 00:24:44,080
Because I see none of it.

255
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,417
I'll call the director of the play that you withdraw from it.

256
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,520
After this, you need to care more of your friend.

257
00:25:20,517 --> 00:25:21,518
Damn it,

258
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,601
I'm so sorry.

259
00:25:27,743 --> 00:25:28,744
I…..

260
00:25:30,723 --> 00:25:32,080
I caused troubles again.

261
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:42,971
I'm sorry.

262
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,011
You do know

263
00:25:47,877 --> 00:25:49,250
what your problem is, right?

264
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:54,680
Why do you need to withdraw from the play?

265
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:05,040
I know that you do realize about

266
00:26:07,183 --> 00:26:09,040
what to do to make it all better.

267
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,040
You didn't forget what

268
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,881
I've carried all along, did you?

269
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,631
I never forget.

270
00:26:53,837 --> 00:26:54,838
Thank you.

271
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:16,720
While people his age are busy with games,

272
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,250
football and being teenagers,

273
00:27:19,757 --> 00:27:21,240
Can you check the setting right here? It didn't fit.

274
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,080
Pure dedicated his life to acting.

275
00:27:24,257 --> 00:27:27,800
It's his one and only dream. / Put costumes number 2 over there.

276
00:27:31,763 --> 00:27:33,130
I want to quit.

277
00:27:36,523 --> 00:27:39,583
But the world didn't award someone just because they're trying,

278
00:27:40,803 --> 00:27:44,280
the audience didn't pay for tickets because of the actors' dedications,

279
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:48,150
but they did it because they wanted something entertaining.

280
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:57,080
Pure was wondering what could bring his audience

281
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:00,720
to pay for tickets and watch his play.

282
00:28:04,877 --> 00:28:06,840
Pixie dust!

283
00:28:08,883 --> 00:28:10,480
Hey! Namkhang!

284
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,200
You need to fly, Peter Pan, Tinker Bell is here to save you.

285
00:28:17,643 --> 00:28:19,000
I don't have enough energy to fly anymore.

286
00:28:27,137 --> 00:28:29,480
If it's not sold out by the opening day,

287
00:28:30,332 --> 00:28:31,334
I'll pay for the rest.

288
00:28:34,223 --> 00:28:36,320
You? A rich kid?

289
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,000
Come on, let's rehearse.

290
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,281
When Pure sees the reality, he starts to realize that

291
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,000
arts require more than just passion

292
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,520
and dedication isn't everything,

293
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,640
it needs the target audience,

294
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,880
then producers will have enough energy to serve them.

295
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:02,440
Everything follows demand and supply rules

296
00:29:02,497 --> 00:29:04,520
like it is in Economics 101.

297
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,211
Are you Pure? I'm Joe from Pastel Bay.

298
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,841
I saw your photos and I'd like to know if you and Namkhang are working for anyone?

299
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,550
I'd like to invite both of you to be our actors.

300
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:14,771
Lost 100M in fire, an owner of luxurious resort barely made it out alive.

301
00:29:22,503 --> 00:29:24,857
When a friend gave you his hand when you're in trouble,

302
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,680
he needed to reciprocate the favor.

303
00:29:29,097 --> 00:29:31,610
This path could lead Pure to his dream,

304
00:29:33,117 --> 00:29:35,720
but it caused him to give something in return.

305
00:29:35,818 --> 00:29:37,880
We're interested.

306
00:29:38,037 --> 00:29:42,120
The question isn't how far he can go,

307
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,000
but it is when he decides to trade this,

308
00:29:46,657 --> 00:29:49,300
will it leave something for him to be himself?

309
00:30:08,863 --> 00:30:09,864
He's hot so it's all forgiven. #DieselTrashMan.

310
00:30:10,564 --> 00:30:13,200
Men (not all) use violence to solve problems. Patriarchy society. Pathetic.

311
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,210
Like father like son, all liars.

312
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,041
Dream!

313
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,640
Are you here?

314
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,400
Come out here and talk.

315
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,201
Dream!

316
00:30:56,837 --> 00:30:57,838
Hey! / Dream!

317
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,880
You're standing right here and yelling? What's your manner?

318
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,251
Who're you?

319
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,560
I should be the one asking, who are you?

320
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,700
And there's no Dream in this house, you got the wrong one.

321
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:14,837
Dream, I saw your jacket right here. Come out here and talk.

322
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,200
This is too much!.

323
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,840
Let's talk! / I'll call the police and press charges for trespassing.

324
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,520
So what? You think I'm scare?

325
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:24,720
Keep going and you'll see what I can do.

326
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:27,650
I know that you are Anyone, Dream.

327
00:31:34,963 --> 00:31:36,440
Can you tell her that

328
00:31:38,717 --> 00:31:40,840
erase the post to end this?

329
00:31:47,543 --> 00:31:48,544
Go!

330
00:31:49,537 --> 00:31:50,538
Don't forget to tell her.

331
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,961
Is this her? They followed each other.

332
00:32:14,857 --> 00:32:16,858
Bambi from DM song? I don't think so, they're friends.

333
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,001
No one wants to pay for someone's boyfriend.

334
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,121
It's okay to date but think about your fans.

335
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,881
Please take care of your artists, we're waiting to here your excuses.

336
00:32:27,903 --> 00:32:29,000
I don't think I can support them any longer.

337
00:32:29,283 --> 00:32:30,760
I'm sorry.

338
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,520
I didn't realize it's gonna be this huge.

339
00:32:36,897 --> 00:32:38,280
It's okay. I…

340
00:32:41,183 --> 00:32:44,320
I need to apologize for dragging you into this mess.

341
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:49,920
How's the modeling job? It didn't affect anything, right?

342
00:32:54,743 --> 00:32:55,744
I don't think so.

343
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,160
Are you okay?

344
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:15,160
It should be better once we solve the problems.

345
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,081
Don't you worry.

346
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,160
If you're not okay,

347
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,120
just say it.

348
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,801
I'm worried about you.

349
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,360
Now I feel so much better.

350
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,721
Smile.

351
00:35:00,937 --> 00:35:01,938
#BringADrunkGirlBacktoHisPlace

352
00:35:12,597 --> 00:35:13,600
Woah!

353
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:15,451
So it is Bambi DM?

354
00:35:15,551 --> 00:35:17,052
Please confirm so the fans can attack her.

355
00:35:17,152 --> 00:35:19,457
Get her out of his life, such a monster.

356
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,910
We received a new clip that the politician's son tried to attack a person in their house.

357
00:36:23,663 --> 00:36:24,800
How could you let them

358
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,080
film you like that?

359
00:36:30,463 --> 00:36:34,680
You knew that if you had told me, I would have handled it in various different ways.

360
00:36:36,437 --> 00:36:37,400
Where is this place?

361
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,131
Who are they?

362
00:36:56,837 --> 00:36:58,400
I haven't found out yet.

363
00:37:01,003 --> 00:37:02,004
I went to the wrong house.

364
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:18,160
You remember the story about a huntsman and a deer?

365
00:37:20,817 --> 00:37:21,818
Yes.

366
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,840
When hunting a deer,

367
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,080
a huntsman gets only one chance to shot a deer.

368
00:37:37,557 --> 00:37:38,600
If he misses it,

369
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,600
a deer won't return to the same spot.

370
00:37:43,037 --> 00:37:44,760
The only thing he can do is

371
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:49,000
to herd it to the corner

372
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,760
until he gets another chance of shooting.

373
00:37:58,697 --> 00:38:01,000
Wait, what are you so mad about?

374
00:38:02,123 --> 00:38:03,880
About those stupid woke feminists?

375
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,080
What the fuck do they want from me?

376
00:38:08,017 --> 00:38:10,680
Didn't you just visit their place? You told me that you did.

377
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,281
Of course I did.

378
00:38:13,283 --> 00:38:15,130
Why didn't they keep posting about this?

379
00:38:18,217 --> 00:38:21,250
You went all the way to their place and you didn't fucking do anything?

380
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,281
For real?

381
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:29,880
Damn it! Such a waste of time.

382
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,800
You're so amateur.

383
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,481
Come on, I'm joking.

384
00:38:35,837 --> 00:38:36,838
Can I use your phone?

385
00:38:38,763 --> 00:38:39,764
Same password, right?

386
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,320
Pheung, you need to get the clothes inside, it's about to rain.

387
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,960
I'm doing it.

388
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,000
Pheung! / Dream!

389
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:09,200
Someone hit me in the head.

390
00:39:12,203 --> 00:39:14,680
Is it bleeding? / Who did that?

391
00:39:15,197 --> 00:39:16,850
Who? Did you see it?

392
00:39:17,463 --> 00:39:19,800
It's okay, let me see your wound.

393
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,880
It's alright. Get up, easy there.

394
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,800
Easy, easy. Let's get inside.

395
00:39:27,297 --> 00:39:28,300
Be gentle.

396
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,081
I'm gonna touch it now.

397
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:34,960
Just a little bit.

398
00:39:38,063 --> 00:39:39,800
I think it's just scratch. Not too bad.

399
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:43,440
Is it hurt so bad?

400
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,640
It's okay, don't worry.

401
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:55,320
Where is it?

402
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,040
He came to our house last time,

403
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,600
now he sent someone to throw rocks, what is his next move?

404
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,400
I'm such a bad luck. / No, don't blame yourself.

405
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,391
You hear me?

406
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,640
Is it tight enough? I'm gonna take a shower.

407
00:40:27,323 --> 00:40:29,760
Get up slowly. / I'm okay.

408
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:45,080
What're you doing?

409
00:41:47,763 --> 00:41:48,764
Did you eat?

410
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:52,944
What're you doing?

411
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,601
Nothing.

412
00:41:58,097 --> 00:42:00,080
I didn't do anything. / You're not telling me?

413
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,640
Really, I didn't do anything.

414
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:04,480
You think I don't know you?

415
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,440
It's true. I didn't do anything. / You're lying.

416
00:42:07,937 --> 00:42:10,200
You're lying. / No!

417
00:42:15,557 --> 00:42:16,650
What? You're on live?

418
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,080
Stop it now.

419
00:42:32,237 --> 00:42:34,840
You ended the live? I need to call Joe.

420
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:44,760
How is it? Are you okay?

421
00:43:04,603 --> 00:43:05,604
Thank you so much.

422
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:10,771
No problem.

423
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,231
Don't stress out, okay?

424
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,680
Sure.

425
00:43:22,763 --> 00:43:23,764
Not a problem.

426
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,920
You need to be more careful after this.

427
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,521
Let's go.

428
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:42,951
I need to get my bag.

429
00:43:58,410 --> 00:43:59,411
Pure.

430
00:44:00,806 --> 00:44:04,303
I'm cool if you want to be in a relationship.

431
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,117
But what you're doing right now

432
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:11,520
is not good for any of us.

433
00:44:16,517 --> 00:44:18,150
You've chosen this path already.

434
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,880
After this, you have to be more committed than this.

435
00:44:23,763 --> 00:44:24,764
You get it, right?

436
00:44:26,843 --> 00:44:27,844
Yeah.

437
00:44:39,457 --> 00:44:40,458
I gotta go.

438
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:42,651
Let's go.

439
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,081
See you.

440
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,320
See you. / Bye.

441
00:45:12,863 --> 00:45:14,480
I'm trapped by his charm but I'm stuck here because he's weird.

442
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:15,600
I like his energy.

443
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,220
I'm here to check our their love. I'm such a third-wheel.

444
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,801
I've followed you since you were in a play. I'm glad that both of you

445
00:45:29,001 --> 00:45:30,857
have grown up so well. It'd be nice if you're in the play again.

446
00:46:22,197 --> 00:46:23,280
Who is Anyone?

447
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,240
Anyone is ….

448
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:31,081
Her name is Dream. She's my friend from school.

449
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:00,623
How are you?

450
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,400
I'm sorry that I…

451
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:25,800
Hello? / Hey,

452
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,560
you need to watch the clip right now.

453
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,361
Thief! Stealing a song from Mhong.

454
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,720
She fooled Mhong to get a free song. / Look at the boy!

455
00:48:49,576 --> 00:48:50,700
What're you doing here?

456
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,700
If you're not okay, just say it. I'm worried about you. - Bambi.

457
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:19,680
What is your deal? You just showed up like this.

458
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,040
I'm really sorry. But can you help me out this time?

459
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:26,360
Is he an actor? / What're you doing here?

460
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:28,561
Your company is okay with that. / I'm worried about you.

461
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,080
If she didn't do it…. / I don't know what to do.

462
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,240
Can you help me?

463
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,440
How can you sleep at night being a monster like this?
