1
00:00:11,877 --> 00:00:13,440
What's going on? You can tell me frankly.

2
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,200
I don't like your father.

3
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,120
You think I'm a big fan of my Dad?

4
00:00:20,497 --> 00:00:21,840
If you don't think of me that way,

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,121
you see me as an object like this?

6
00:00:26,423 --> 00:00:27,424
Sure, I do.

7
00:00:28,063 --> 00:00:31,000
What do you think of me?

8
00:00:31,503 --> 00:00:35,120
Models with no thoughts are no better than clothes hangers, don't you think?

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,001
Oh my….

10
00:01:53,703 --> 00:01:55,000
Hello, Ms.Duangtawan.

11
00:01:55,237 --> 00:01:57,680
This is 78 Questions with Taste Magazine.

12
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,520
78 questions? / That's right.

13
00:02:00,597 --> 00:02:02,480
May I come in? / Sure, welcome.

14
00:02:06,203 --> 00:02:08,320
Mr.Thara and your kids are not home?

15
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,200
I'm not sure if my husband is at the ministry or the meeting.

16
00:02:13,617 --> 00:02:17,960
Dana is a fashion student at CSM in the UK.

17
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,960
She's the youngest of her class there.

18
00:02:21,283 --> 00:02:25,120
Education is significant in this family, isn't it?

19
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,720
Education is significant in every family.

20
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,440
I see so many art pieces in this house.

21
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,880
Can you tell me a story of this piece?

22
00:02:38,943 --> 00:02:39,944
This one?

23
00:02:41,937 --> 00:02:46,640
I got it from a gallery by the beach in Bali.

24
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,560
They showcased this piece

25
00:02:48,837 --> 00:02:51,720
and it truly touched a mother's heart like mine.

26
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,400
What about Diesel? How is he?

27
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:59,760
He's in Thailand, he will be in college soon.

28
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,080
Actually, I'm more close to my daughter.

29
00:03:03,481 --> 00:03:06,100
My son is close to his father, you know... men.

30
00:03:07,643 --> 00:03:10,000
Your birthday is next week, isn't it?

31
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,401
What is the theme of

32
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,920
your upcoming birthday?

33
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,480
When I was a kid,

34
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,880
my Dad built an aviary in our home's backyard.

35
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,920
There were so many kinds of birds inside.

36
00:03:28,628 --> 00:03:33,240
I wanted to reminisce my childhood memories so

37
00:03:33,597 --> 00:03:35,800
the theme of this year's birthday will be

38
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,280
Conference of the Birds.

39
00:03:53,897 --> 00:03:57,480
I wrote this article, can you share it for me?

40
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,311
Hey!

41
00:04:27,377 --> 00:04:30,440
I wrote an article, can you share it for me?

42
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:31,760
It's gonna be my portfolio for college.

43
00:04:35,703 --> 00:04:37,640
Glamorous climate criminals. 1% of the rich flying private jets

44
00:04:37,704 --> 00:04:38,863
causing more pollutions than normal people do for their entire lives.

45
00:04:46,877 --> 00:04:48,720
I can't.

46
00:04:52,497 --> 00:04:53,498
It's fine.

47
00:04:55,843 --> 00:04:58,200
Wow! You're growing up to be a pretty girl now.

48
00:04:58,403 --> 00:05:01,240
Hello. / You haven't come to our place for such a long time.

49
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,280
Hello / Hello.

50
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,960
You're doing well, aren't you? / I am.

51
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,440
How are you parents?

52
00:05:11,357 --> 00:05:14,400
Mom! Stop asking about her business.

53
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,920
What? I was just asking.

54
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:18,360
She's like a family. / I gotta go, Mom.

55
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,480
Yeah? Take care, honey.

56
00:05:21,983 --> 00:05:25,240
Look at your face. You're hungry?

57
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,720
I got this for you.

58
00:05:33,557 --> 00:05:35,000
Since you two had a fight,

59
00:05:35,163 --> 00:05:37,960
you still haven't talked to her? It's been years.

60
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,797
Don't you regret it?

61
00:05:42,057 --> 00:05:45,720
You two practically attached at the hip when you were younger.

62
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,040
Find a way to forgive her, will you?

63
00:06:02,643 --> 00:06:05,120
You don't know anything, you don't get to share your opinion.

64
00:06:08,783 --> 00:06:10,240
Let's go, I don’t want to be stuck in traffic.

65
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,000
Put on your seatbelt, please.

66
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,680
You whine a lot. / Well, you talk back a lot.

67
00:06:36,523 --> 00:06:37,524
You're not playing?

68
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,120
Bambi,

69
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,200
What article are you sharing?

70
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:01,440
About billionaires flying their private jets, causing pollution.

71
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,201
What the f--k!

72
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,200
You wanted them to fly commercial flights?

73
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,680
I mean like they require some privacy, you know?

74
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,511
Look Diesel!

75
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,011
What?

76
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,200
What are you mad about?

77
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,240
I posted it because my friend asked me to.

78
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,960
It didn't mean anything to me.

79
00:07:27,477 --> 00:07:29,760
Well, look who's talking?

80
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,880
You keep on sharing news about that Name BOY MARX. See?

81
00:07:34,383 --> 00:07:36,040
He's all over my feed now, look.

82
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,800
Well, I need to share my work.

83
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,800
Such a liar. I saw you chat with him.

84
00:07:43,237 --> 00:07:44,720
And you asked me to hang out with you tonight.

85
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,120
Yeah see? you're making it too obvious?

86
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,520
Okay, fine.

87
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,840
He texted me about his concert tonight, and he invited me.

88
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,080
He could just be nice, whatever.

89
00:08:01,043 --> 00:08:02,960
Now everyone knows, you want to join me?

90
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,800
What about our dinner?

91
00:08:08,523 --> 00:08:09,524
Dinner?

92
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,720
I totally forgot.

93
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,041
Next time, okay? Please?

94
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,061
I want to see Name perform.

95
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,560
Pathetic. F--king groupie thoughts.

96
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:24,360
Hey! Don't you think it's too harsh?

97
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,240
You need to understand me.

98
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,440
He will perform tonight only. We can have dinner anytime.

99
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,840
You told me that you didn't care about Name.

100
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:36,280
SERIOUSLY! WHAT THE F--K!!!

101
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,320
It's not Name. It's you!  / You don't try to understand me.

102
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,000
This is the one and only performance from him.

103
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,000
Take a look at yourself

104
00:08:43,577 --> 00:08:45,520
before saying anything.

105
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,640
No, you don't get it. Here, take it.

106
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,281
Ow!

107
00:08:52,303 --> 00:08:55,440
Well, we can all go tonight, okay?

108
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,280
Okay? It should be fun.

109
00:09:01,397 --> 00:09:02,400
What about my game?

110
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,191
F--k!!!

111
00:09:40,283 --> 00:09:41,920
For a kid who was born

112
00:09:42,003 --> 00:09:45,320
in a top-tier 1% of the most wealthiest families in society

113
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,640
it should be normal for anyone to see that

114
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,280
Diesel should gain a lot of inheritance.

115
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,880
He didn't only receive properties as his inheritance

116
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,480
but he also receive some other things.

117
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,240
Some traits are passed on from generation to generation

118
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,240
from father to son.

119
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:25,400
I'm not the only one in my class to use it, actually everyone….

120
00:10:34,763 --> 00:10:36,880
Don't make me go to your school again.

121
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,281
Do you understand me, son?

122
00:10:46,357 --> 00:10:48,920
Did I raise you to not answer me back?

123
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,801
I got it.

124
00:10:57,923 --> 00:10:58,960
You're a man

125
00:11:00,763 --> 00:11:01,960
and men don't cry.

126
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,480
This inheritance is pain on his face

127
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,270
which happens repeatedly.

128
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,680
It has become his life lesson growing up.

129
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,120
He started to question

130
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,560
if this is a way of your father to show his love

131
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,280
or this is a way of lovers to show their affections.

132
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,880
If a pain on his face indicates love,

133
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,600
then he's ready to spread it / One more time.

134
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,120
to someone that he thinks would love him

135
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,920
and to someone that he thinks he loves them.

136
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,640
This is the kind of love that he understands.

137
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,651
What're you doing?

138
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,160
This is the kind of love that he understands.

139
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,641
Let's play game. Get in here, Nainoi.

140
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,280
I'm ready to help you out.

141
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:22,491
Why're you calling?

142
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,720
What is it? You keep asking me to play, I'm so not in the mood.

143
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,320
How the hell could I know that you're not in the mood? Why did you call?

144
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,440
I don't f--king know! I'm just upset.

145
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:34,720
Stop with your bulls--t. I'm not in a happy mood either.

146
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,041
Go on, what is it?

147
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,440
F--k, I don't really know.

148
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,520
What?! How could I know?! If there's nothing, I'll hang up.

149
00:13:44,683 --> 00:13:46,120
Go ahead and do it.

150
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:02,400
What do you do when you're upset?

151
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,880
You called me for this?

152
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,440
Are you gonna help me or not?

153
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:21,280
Hold up your two hands like this.

154
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:24,640
I'm holding my phone in one hand.

155
00:14:24,857 --> 00:14:26,263
Right, then use one hand

156
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,800
and then close your eyes.

157
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,601
How could I watch it if my eyes're closed? Think!

158
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,800
Well, you're funny.

159
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,760
Fine. Start again, then inhale.

160
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:43,050
And exhale. You need to close your eyes.

161
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,300
See? Now do it.

162
00:14:53,123 --> 00:14:55,320
Slowly and focus.

163
00:15:07,786 --> 00:15:08,787
What are you laughing at?

164
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,761
Feeling better?

165
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,120
When you're stressed out, you can do this.

166
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:16,971
Feeling better?

167
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,361
Nope. More stressing out.

168
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,720
Well, suit yourself!

169
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,000
See you guys next week.

170
00:16:25,163 --> 00:16:27,920
Don't have too much fun partying tonight.

171
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,441
See you.

172
00:16:34,863 --> 00:16:36,383
I gotta go. / What the fuck?!

173
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,521
See you tonight.

174
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,711
See ya.

175
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,200
I think you should apologize to Lukjan.

176
00:16:56,523 --> 00:16:58,160
I just wanted to tell you that

177
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,120
you should be nice to her if you like her.

178
00:17:04,703 --> 00:17:07,040
Don't focus on yourself only.

179
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,640
Think about it, will you still be happy if someone talks s--t to you?

180
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,041
I don't think so…

181
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:20,360
Just to be clear, I don't like Lukjan.

182
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,000
And I don't need to apologize to her. I did nothing wrong.

183
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,280
She was the one who ditched me.

184
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,400
I can help you with that.

185
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,960
Help me with what? Now you want to help me out?

186
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,091
Come on.

187
00:17:39,877 --> 00:17:42,880
Let's start with something simple.

188
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,880
Like caring.

189
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,081
You can order her favorite cocktail for her.

190
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,271
Do you know what it is?

191
00:17:54,383 --> 00:17:58,480
What? It's Long Island iced tea.

192
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,120
Such a pro!

193
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,720
You need to come with me tonight, pro.

194
00:18:05,623 --> 00:18:06,760
I didn't bring anything to wear.

195
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,400
No big deal.

196
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:13,440
Come to my house. I'll find you something from my sister's closet. Let's go.

197
00:18:17,057 --> 00:18:19,400
Hurry up, what're you waiting for?

198
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,480
I won't do anything to you, don't be scared of me.

199
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,601
Let's go.

200
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,560
You look so horny, of course I'm scared.

201
00:18:37,661 --> 00:18:38,662
What did you say?

202
00:18:42,257 --> 00:18:44,680
Damn! I can take these?

203
00:18:45,197 --> 00:18:46,560
When will your little sister come back?

204
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,720
Take them, she won't be home soon.

205
00:18:58,283 --> 00:19:00,400
Diesel? / Yeah?

206
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,320
Can I ask you something?

207
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,881
How is your Mom like?

208
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,100
Why did you ask me?

209
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,480
You wanted to know the dirts about her?

210
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,000
Nothing like that.

211
00:19:19,177 --> 00:19:22,040
I admire her talent.

212
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,720
And I'm a big fan of DEVI.

213
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:27,840
I just wanted to know what she's like.

214
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,600
Can I ask you another question?

215
00:19:51,103 --> 00:19:52,960
What is it like to live

216
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,601
in a wealthy world?

217
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,960
Such a weird question.

218
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,400
I don't know. I'm just being me like this.

219
00:20:20,257 --> 00:20:23,040
Actually, I just discovered that

220
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,800
my life is unlike others when I started to grow up.

221
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,560
I just realized that something that I got easily

222
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,880
could cause someone's hardest work to get it.

223
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,961
Like..

224
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:36,911
Rambutans.

225
00:20:37,817 --> 00:20:39,480
I just found out later that

226
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,591
rambutans

227
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,880
are fruits with red and hairy round shape.

228
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,320
Rambutans that I've been eaten my whole life

229
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,160
are in white translucent flesh with no pits.

230
00:20:49,657 --> 00:20:51,240
You know what I mean, right? That's it.

231
00:20:51,663 --> 00:20:52,840
Right.

232
00:20:54,037 --> 00:20:55,800
Oh come on,

233
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,560
I don't think I will truly understand someone like you.

234
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,560
Bambi / What?

235
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,080
If you need anything, just say it.

236
00:21:28,823 --> 00:21:29,824
Well,

237
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,320
can I go to your mom's birthday party?

238
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,760
Can you help me with that?

239
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,960
So you planned it already, huh?

240
00:21:46,183 --> 00:21:47,440
You know what the party is gonna be like?

241
00:21:49,497 --> 00:21:50,498
I have no idea.

242
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:56,320
I just thought that if I could get in,

243
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,400
and be surrounded by someone like you

244
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,280
then people could see me differently.

245
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,720
And I could understand you.

246
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,480
Hello, Jib?

247
00:22:27,943 --> 00:22:31,160
Can you add my friend's name to the guest list?

248
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,151
It's Bambi.

249
00:22:34,377 --> 00:22:35,600
Okay, thank you.

250
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,121
Honestly, you can just make them recognize you from the party.

251
00:22:58,463 --> 00:23:00,680
A theme for my birthday

252
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,160
is Conference of the Birds.

253
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,680
Diesel? Can I borrow your book too?

254
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,400
Fine, just take whatever you want.

255
00:23:24,243 --> 00:23:25,280
Want a drink?

256
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,371
Oh my gosh!

257
00:23:37,723 --> 00:23:39,560
I have no idea what's going on.

258
00:23:40,097 --> 00:23:41,098
Lukjan.

259
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,000
Woah! Long Island iced tea, thanks.

260
00:23:47,017 --> 00:23:48,680
So impressive

261
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,720
Let's cheers.

262
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:55,480
Cheers! Come on.

263
00:24:01,126 --> 00:24:02,120
Me too

264
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:04,084
That looks so good.

265
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,880
Make some noise for us.

266
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:29,891
Lukjan?

267
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,120
Lukjan? / Yeah?

268
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,520
Name won't perform tonight?

269
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,521
Those rappers started the show first. I still don't get them.

270
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,600
Are they the ones who confessed love to you?

271
00:24:50,523 --> 00:24:51,524
A--hole!

272
00:25:28,423 --> 00:25:32,080
(Singing)

273
00:25:34,423 --> 00:25:36,520
You get it? I don't get it.

274
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,360
You didn't get it at first too.

275
00:25:52,163 --> 00:25:54,920
Can I go now?

276
00:26:00,623 --> 00:26:03,480
Don't worry, if he starts something, I'll take care of it.

277
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,121
Stay.

278
00:26:20,077 --> 00:26:22,078
Good job, guys. Nice moves.

279
00:26:39,337 --> 00:26:40,338
Hello.

280
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,560
Sorry I was rehearsing a play, I didn't have time to use my phone.

281
00:26:46,757 --> 00:26:48,320
It's fine.

282
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,440
Is everything okay?

283
00:26:56,557 --> 00:26:58,160
I saw Mhong.

284
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,360
He kept looking at me.

285
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,560
I told Diesel about it and he didn't let me go home.

286
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,400
Can't you tell him that you got a problem with it?

287
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,200
He knows it so well.

288
00:27:15,397 --> 00:27:16,920
Can you come and see me?

289
00:27:20,823 --> 00:27:22,800
It's fine if you can't.

290
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,001
I get it.

291
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,050
Okay, well.

292
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,280
I'll rush out to see you, okay? Just stay with Diesel.

293
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:38,320
Okay, sure.

294
00:28:13,977 --> 00:28:17,280
Yo! What's up! Hi.

295
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:18,920
Hello.

296
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,720
Are you Name? / Yes.

297
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:25,320
Break a leg up there.

298
00:28:25,423 --> 00:28:28,760
Someone's here to cheer you from a side of a bed. / Are you crazy?

299
00:28:28,803 --> 00:28:31,804
I mean a side of a stage. / Sorry.

300
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,603
Drink, let's drink. / You're funny.

301
00:28:33,663 --> 00:28:34,664
Are you out of your mind?

302
00:28:38,477 --> 00:28:42,560
Why're you here so early? The other rappers are still up there.

303
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,560
I'm worried that if I came here and went straight to the stage,

304
00:28:45,937 --> 00:28:47,440
someone would be so sad.

305
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,080
You mean me, right ?

306
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,160
Maybe / Aww..

307
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:54,560
Come on, let's have some fun.

308
00:28:54,803 --> 00:28:56,287
Can I take this one? / Sure.

309
00:28:56,357 --> 00:28:58,320
Sure, go ahead. / Whose is it?

310
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,520
Don't forget about us. / Fine.

311
00:29:01,677 --> 00:29:03,280
Cheers!

312
00:29:06,803 --> 00:29:07,804
Let's do a love shot.

313
00:29:09,163 --> 00:29:10,280
Yeah, why not?

314
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:13,200
Love shot! / Yeah?

315
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,360
Okay. / Love shot!

316
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:18,200
Love shot!

317
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,480
How is it? / Good.

318
00:29:26,543 --> 00:29:27,544
Lukjan?

319
00:29:31,257 --> 00:29:33,480
Ouch! / What is it?

320
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,440
How are you?

321
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,920
What've you been up to?

322
00:30:12,037 --> 00:30:13,480
Your life has been completely different.

323
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,321
Why's that?

324
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,600
You care about me?

325
00:30:22,263 --> 00:30:24,840
Of course I do, Mhong. / Mhong?

326
00:30:26,423 --> 00:30:27,960
You remember my name?

327
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,880
That's super great.

328
00:30:33,683 --> 00:30:37,000
I thought that you forgot about me when I'm useless to you.

329
00:30:43,137 --> 00:30:44,360
Can you stop? / What?

330
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,551
Can you stop it?

331
00:30:47,423 --> 00:30:49,520
Now I know how you wanted me to feel.

332
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,031
So can you please stop?

333
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,080
What're you trying to say, Diesel? I don't get it.

334
00:30:55,517 --> 00:30:57,840
You're wasting my time, okay? / Lukjan.

335
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,151
What?

336
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:03,684
I know that…

337
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,920
I know how you wanted me to feel about Name.

338
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,480
So please stop, will you?

339
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,000
What the fuck! I've never thought of it that way.

340
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,000
Are you drunk? You should go.

341
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,240
I'm not talking to you. / Lukjan!

342
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,640
Don't f--king touch me.

343
00:31:19,737 --> 00:31:23,200
So annoying. / What's happening over here? Calm down.

344
00:31:23,303 --> 00:31:26,610
What? It's none of your business. / Calm down, young man.

345
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,001
I talked to you nicely.

346
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,480
I felt really bad about it.

347
00:31:37,017 --> 00:31:38,018
But

348
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,640
if I can help you with anything, you can tell me. / Help?

349
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:44,884
How can you fucking help me?

350
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,800
Fucking help me?

351
00:31:48,603 --> 00:31:50,680
Who do you think got me kicked out from my label?

352
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,680
It's because of you.

353
00:31:53,561 --> 00:31:55,662
I was a complete fool to those stupid netizens

354
00:31:55,762 --> 00:31:58,440
who knew nothing about anything because of you.

355
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,160
I'm not the help of Gunner. You saw me working on wires?

356
00:32:02,757 --> 00:32:05,120
When you sat there and had the time of your life with your friends?

357
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,181
Are you happy now?

358
00:32:07,881 --> 00:32:09,920
You must be so thrilled, right?

359
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,520
You wanted to help me or look down on me.

360
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:14,971
Tell me?

361
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,160
I think you're drunk.

362
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,320
Let's talk later.

363
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,880
So what if I'm drunk?

364
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,720
You kept talking nonsense things.

365
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,680
In the end, you used me.

366
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,881
I'm sorry.

367
00:32:43,881 --> 00:32:45,040
I'm sorry that

368
00:32:46,897 --> 00:32:49,520
caused you this way. / Why sorry?

369
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,520
You're also a bitch.

370
00:32:53,201 --> 00:32:54,640
I admit that I'm an asshole, too.

371
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,600
Why is your life going great? Only you.

372
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:00,320
And why am I the only one who lost everything?

373
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,721
Damn it!

374
00:33:03,997 --> 00:33:06,160
I should have did what they encouraged me to do.

375
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,081
I should have just fucked you.

376
00:33:23,643 --> 00:33:25,520
You don't know anything so shut up.

377
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,881
Hey!

378
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,520
She tells me every day that she doesn’t like you, what more do you want?

379
00:33:30,563 --> 00:33:32,480
You really want a piece of me? / So what?

380
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:35,440
What? Why? / This is none of your fucking business, back off.

381
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,520
Stop it already. / What the fuck is wrong with you?

382
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:40,360
You're just jealous. / Jealous, my ass.

383
00:33:40,503 --> 00:33:43,640
Stop it already. / You punched me?

384
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,840
You think you're cool because your Dad is a politician?

385
00:33:46,897 --> 00:33:49,120
What if I punched you? I'm drunk and so what?

386
00:33:49,823 --> 00:33:52,840
Please stop! We're nothing okay?

387
00:33:59,883 --> 00:34:01,160
What the fuck is wrong with you?

388
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,541
We are nothing.

389
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,160
We're just fucking fuck buddies, okay?

390
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,840
You and I are fucking nothing. I have no feeling for you, you hear me?

391
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,250
Move out of the way.

392
00:34:47,597 --> 00:34:48,960
Are you okay? / Are you hurt?

393
00:35:01,317 --> 00:35:02,100
Diesel?

394
00:35:04,823 --> 00:35:06,146
Stop it!

395
00:35:16,683 --> 00:35:17,684
Are you okay?

396
00:35:20,483 --> 00:35:21,484
Are you alright?

397
00:35:37,103 --> 00:35:39,200
Name, you fucking asshole!

398
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,990
Stop the car, don't use your phone.

399
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,091
What the fuck is this?

400
00:36:45,957 --> 00:36:48,120
Fine I stop the car. / I don't believe you.

401
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,841
Send me some photos.

402
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:57,084
You happy now?

403
00:37:02,143 --> 00:37:04,040
You know that it's not safe to drive like that.

404
00:37:04,183 --> 00:37:07,240
If you're not worried about hitting something, think about innocent people.

405
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,600
And you broke the law, you used your phone while driving.

406
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,440
Be responsible to society.

407
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,480
What the fucking are you talking about?

408
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,320
Stop preaching me already. You got nothing to do?

409
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,160
Go take care of your business and buzz off my life.

410
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,700
You don't have to be so vulgar….

411
00:37:28,217 --> 00:37:29,720
Okay, you're here.

412
00:37:30,984 --> 00:37:31,985
Thank you.

413
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:46,411
Are you okay?

414
00:37:47,303 --> 00:37:48,304
Easy there.

415
00:38:47,657 --> 00:38:48,600
Is everything okay?

416
00:38:54,757 --> 00:38:56,760
I ruined everything.

417
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:01,291
Mhong.

418
00:39:04,363 --> 00:39:05,364
Diesel.

419
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,280
It's alright.

420
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,240
It will get better.

421
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,080
You think it will get better?

422
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,640
It will get better.

423
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,201
Just go to sleep.

424
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,041
Shooting at 7 A.M.

425
00:41:37,457 --> 00:41:38,458
Are you okay?

426
00:41:41,597 --> 00:41:43,000
You can tell me anything.

427
00:42:09,043 --> 00:42:10,044
Squeeze it.

428
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,104
More!

429
00:42:25,303 --> 00:42:26,304
More!

430
00:42:29,163 --> 00:42:31,124
We're just fucking fuck buddies, okay?

431
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:34,760
You and I are fucking nothing. I have no feeling for you, you hear me?

432
00:43:19,037 --> 00:43:20,360
What're you doing here?

433
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,021
If I'm surrounded by someone like you, people could see me differently. - Bambi

434
00:43:41,743 --> 00:43:44,880
Hot News! Someone reported that they saw

435
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,440
Diesel abused a girl.

436
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,081
Who the hell is he?

437
00:43:51,537 --> 00:43:53,040
You said that you're nothing like your Dad.

438
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,440
I think you know

439
00:43:56,063 --> 00:43:57,440
what your problem is.

440
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,240
Why do you need to quit starring in the play?

441
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,160
I don't think your name is in the guest list.

442
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,681
Who the hell is Anyone?

443
00:44:06,081 --> 00:44:08,200
Bambi? WHO!?!?
