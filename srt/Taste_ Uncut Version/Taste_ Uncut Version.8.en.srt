1
00:00:11,797 --> 00:00:13,720
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,840
I just want to be friend with you.

3
00:00:16,957 --> 00:00:19,880
From now on, you can follow your dream and do it well.

4
00:00:20,377 --> 00:00:22,960
I still want to be your friend.

5
00:00:24,317 --> 00:00:25,318
And ignore them all.

6
00:00:27,397 --> 00:00:30,280
Therefore both of us….

7
00:00:32,337 --> 00:00:34,360
will create even better memories.

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,361
Please continue to support us

9
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:52,744
Pure is here.

10
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,800
I'm at Siam already, tell me when you're done.

11
00:02:21,101 --> 00:02:22,502
I'm done. Meet me at the same spot.

12
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,920
The shopping mall will be closed in the next 30 minutes.

13
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,371
You didn't wear a mask earlier?

14
00:03:06,377 --> 00:03:09,440
I looked around and there was nobody around. Don't worry.

15
00:03:09,683 --> 00:03:13,640
It's not like that. We've talked about this. You need to wear the mask everytime we meet.

16
00:03:16,497 --> 00:03:19,960
I said I looked already. Why are you so upsetting?

17
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,601
What's going on?

18
00:03:33,757 --> 00:03:36,920
Well, you can't follow our deal.

19
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,830
Don't you forget what we had to deal with?

20
00:03:39,983 --> 00:03:42,517
It was a mess because of this, remember?

21
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,237
We discussed it and we'll continue to be like this until the contract ends.

22
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,757
You said that you understood me and you'd support me.

23
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:52,560
You called this supportive? You're asking for troubles. / Isn't it what I've been doing all along?

24
00:03:55,923 --> 00:03:59,160
You told me that you'd try to find time for us to meet.

25
00:03:59,643 --> 00:04:02,520
When I came to see you, and you yelled at me, you were mad at me.

26
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:03,658
I already explained everything

27
00:04:04,237 --> 00:04:06,320
about what I needed to carry and what decision I had to make.

28
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,310
If you're only thinking about yourself, then there's nothing I can do.

29
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,280
Me? I only think about myself?

30
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,520
It's not the other way around?

31
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,191
You!

32
00:04:19,057 --> 00:04:20,158
You only care about someone else.

33
00:04:25,943 --> 00:04:28,233
You told me to understand you about everything.

34
00:04:30,327 --> 00:04:33,730
It's me, right? I have to change everything for you?

35
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,640
Why haven't I been in your thoughts?

36
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,280
You never asked me

37
00:04:43,223 --> 00:04:47,163
if I was exhausted or how my school was.

38
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,040
You wanted me to understand you about everything.

39
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,157
I needed to change everything for you, didn't I?

40
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,160
If you feel exhausted that much,

41
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,191
I think we should call it off.

42
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,760
You want to break up with me?

43
00:05:37,383 --> 00:05:38,384
I don't know.

44
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,000
I know that you're exhausted, keep it up!

45
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:52,317
I see that you've taken your son to the events quite often.

46
00:06:52,897 --> 00:06:57,157
Do you expect him to follow your footsteps in politics?

47
00:06:58,697 --> 00:07:00,903
I think it's too soon

48
00:07:01,237 --> 00:07:03,137
because he's still a teenager.

49
00:07:03,563 --> 00:07:06,743
I don't want to force him or rush him.

50
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,477
But I can't say that I didn't expect him

51
00:07:10,577 --> 00:07:11,617
to be like me.

52
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,280
Otherwise, I wouldn't have dedicated all of this for him.

53
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:21,640
What about you? Diesel?

54
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,160
After hearing what you Dad said, what do you think?

55
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,183
Do you want to follow his path?

56
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,480
No, I don't.

57
00:07:44,843 --> 00:07:47,800
I want to find my own path.

58
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,040
I don't know what it looks like.

59
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,610
But people can choose, right?

60
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,650
He totally embarrassed his Dad by saying that.

61
00:08:03,443 --> 00:08:05,560
Thara had great education.

62
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,001
But why didn't his son

63
00:08:07,323 --> 00:08:10,010
take after him? / Puppies don't turn out to be exactly like their parents.

64
00:08:12,197 --> 00:08:13,560
Why does a son turn out to be like his father?

65
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,557
Kids these days are all the same,

66
00:08:18,577 --> 00:08:19,720
they are manipulated.

67
00:08:20,663 --> 00:08:22,280
Dream? You're done?

68
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,463
Let me help you with that. / I can clean it up.

69
00:08:24,997 --> 00:08:27,680
Why don't you have some milk?

70
00:08:30,457 --> 00:08:31,480
Come on, I'll go with you.

71
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,781
What's up Little Boss? You learned to disagree with your Dad now?

72
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,881
Yeah? You watched it?

73
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,701
I like that, did you get kicked out already?

74
00:09:10,303 --> 00:09:11,304
What do you think?

75
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,560
Aloha Hawaii. You like it?

76
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,480
Stop messing with me, I'm super mad today.

77
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:17,880
Fine, I'll stop.

78
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,240
I'll go. / What?

79
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,921
Why did you invite me then?

80
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,400
Come on, let me beat you for at least one match.

81
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,641
Let's go.

82
00:09:29,841 --> 00:09:31,160
What did your Dad say after the show?

83
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,441
I don't know. I walked out after it's done.

84
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,840
Oh my goodness! You're such a brave guy.

85
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,160
What's on your mind when you said that?

86
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,650
I thought about you.

87
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:55,640
What's wrong? Your home is not a safe zone?

88
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,040
I moved back home, but…

89
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,117
I don't think my dad can change.

90
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,920
I feel bad for Mom,

91
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,320
she must have wanted everyone to stay under the same roof.

92
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,411
I don't know what to do.

93
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,840
What defines your safe zone?

94
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,201
It's a place

95
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,997
where I feel safe and I can say anything.

96
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,363
Nobody judged me.

97
00:10:24,697 --> 00:10:26,200
You're my safe zone.

98
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:39,170
What about you? Am I your safe zone?

99
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,400
Saved me from what? Look? I'm dying in this game.

100
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,200
What the hell is wrong with you? Why did you keep calling?

101
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,601
I just wanted to see your face.

102
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:07,640
You want to have dinner? Same spot?

103
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,640
Sure, I'm craving some clams.

104
00:11:59,097 --> 00:12:02,760
Look at you and your new boobs.

105
00:12:04,677 --> 00:12:07,440
Tokyo, your boy's here.

106
00:12:14,597 --> 00:12:16,720
New hair color? / That's right.

107
00:12:16,957 --> 00:12:18,250
Nice, I like it.

108
00:12:19,537 --> 00:12:21,480
Besides the color of my hair,

109
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,040
you wanna guess the color of my bra?

110
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,721
What color?

111
00:12:48,497 --> 00:12:50,160
When you said you traveled with your family, you meant this?

112
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:56,891
I know.

113
00:12:59,997 --> 00:13:01,843
I thought you'd like it.

114
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,423
It's not that I don't like it.

115
00:13:07,697 --> 00:13:08,698
But it…

116
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,583
we didn't talk about this first.

117
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,577
Do you feel like you can't talk to me about this?

118
00:13:13,601 --> 00:13:15,143
What do you think I would feel

119
00:13:17,457 --> 00:13:18,458
when you said that

120
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:22,506
you liked to play with boobs and you looked at someone's boobs?

121
00:13:23,823 --> 00:13:25,124
What do you think?

122
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,050
Well, I like them.

123
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:34,977
But it doesn't mean that I want you to change.

124
00:13:35,483 --> 00:13:37,057
And I don't want you to…

125
00:13:49,063 --> 00:13:50,064
I'm sorry.

126
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,720
I'm so sorry.

127
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,471
I think

128
00:14:10,477 --> 00:14:12,197
we need to communicate more.

129
00:14:17,977 --> 00:14:19,600
Hey! / Yeah?

130
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,840
I love you the same,

131
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,271
you know that right?

132
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,441
You know that, right?

133
00:14:34,357 --> 00:14:35,358
Of course, I do.

134
00:16:46,763 --> 00:16:50,040
Hey, teaser of Paint Your Dream season 2 is so cute, did you watch it?

135
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,441
Here.

136
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:57,200
Teaser of Paint Your Dream season 2 reached one million views in 12 hours.

137
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,131
That's more like it.

138
00:18:38,997 --> 00:18:40,083
Yeah?

139
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,430
Hi, will you go to DEVI's party?

140
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,280
I saw you reposted it. / Sure.

141
00:18:46,843 --> 00:18:47,770
You're coming too?

142
00:18:48,817 --> 00:18:51,263
But they're also coming.

143
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:58,097
Do you have one more invitation left?

144
00:19:23,943 --> 00:19:26,400
How do you feel about the second season?

145
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:29,200
We're just done shooting and…

146
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,121
What is it?

147
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,250
You're still hurt?

148
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,200
Not anymore.

149
00:20:00,183 --> 00:20:01,640
Mint, hello.

150
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:03,400
Hello. / Hello.

151
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,400
Let me introduce you to our DEVI's girls.

152
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,631
Your mom is here.

153
00:20:13,483 --> 00:20:14,783
Is that Lukjan?

154
00:20:14,943 --> 00:20:15,944
Shit!

155
00:20:16,103 --> 00:20:18,440
I heard that they organized this party because

156
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,300
Kimia refused to renew the contract.

157
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,440
So they need to find a new brand's muse.

158
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,240
Who'd have thought that they selected four persons for this?

159
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,040
Four? They reserved a spot for Lukjan since the start.

160
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,600
She nepo-babied her way in, don't you see?

161
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,921
All of this

162
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,960
will be traded with business connection of Lukjan's family.

163
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:40,920
Lukjan?

164
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,840
I think I will stay

165
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:03,680
with a friend in the country for a while.

166
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,920
I thought that me going home

167
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,080
would make everything better.

168
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,880
I know that my Dad loves me.

169
00:21:13,777 --> 00:21:15,120
But I can only listen

170
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,800
and I can't share one f--king opinion.

171
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,840
I don't feel like a human.

172
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,840
The only place where I can say anything is

173
00:21:25,363 --> 00:21:26,364
when I am Anyone.

174
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,961
Well,

175
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,040
we're like characters in games.

176
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,160
They are players and we are avatars.

177
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,250
They'd choose our jobs and items,

178
00:21:43,801 --> 00:21:45,840
and this and that that they thought good enough.

179
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,761
But…

180
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:51,880
they never asked the characters if they wanted any of them.

181
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,800
You're talking nonsense when you're drunk.

182
00:21:56,937 --> 00:21:59,480
But I like it. It's good.

183
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,200
Just because they were born first doesn't mean that they're right about everything.

184
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,520
Why do they think that

185
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,990
their opinions are better than ours.

186
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,361
You're just an amateur.

187
00:22:16,297 --> 00:22:17,298
Amateurs.

188
00:22:19,097 --> 00:22:21,160
Ouch! / You deserved it. You're weak!

189
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,880
How can a weak guy

190
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,761
like me can get better?

191
00:22:33,463 --> 00:22:34,920
People can change.

192
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,960
You never had spicy stir-fried clams and now you have it.

193
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,600
It's not that easy, you know?

194
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,291
You can do it.

195
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:51,800
I believe in you.

196
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,921
Wanna go with me?

197
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,920
Take a train with me?

198
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,720
Are you crazy? It's late.

199
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:32,040
How can I go? I don't have any clothes, nothing.

200
00:23:32,657 --> 00:23:34,680
Why're you so obsessed with these thing? You don't need them.

201
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,150
You can wear my clothes, okay?

202
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,001
Let's go.

203
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,960
Don't think, just go.

204
00:23:42,263 --> 00:23:43,264
Come on, tough it up.

205
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,200
What are you doing?

206
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,800
Can I join you?

207
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,721
Sure.

208
00:25:21,943 --> 00:25:22,944
What are you doing?

209
00:25:33,103 --> 00:25:34,960
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

210
00:25:52,943 --> 00:25:53,944
Damn it!

211
00:26:09,043 --> 00:26:10,044
Please wait.

212
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,337
I need to talk to Ms.Duangtawan.

213
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,920
You can't get in if you're not on the guest list.

214
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,400
She knows me, please. Just a minute.

215
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,000
It will be just a minute.

216
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,440
You can't get in if you're not on the guest list.

217
00:26:28,283 --> 00:26:30,123
Please take her to see Tong.

218
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,241
Please meet Tong and I'll catch up with you.

219
00:26:34,077 --> 00:26:35,078
Sure.

220
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,391
This way.

221
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,600
I know that it's my fault for rejecting the job.

222
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,710
Please give me another chance. Please.

223
00:27:18,323 --> 00:27:19,324
A chance?

224
00:27:22,337 --> 00:27:24,560
I think I was so clear with you.

225
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,591
You can go now.

226
00:27:36,317 --> 00:27:39,423
I just heard that you're looking for a new muse to replace Kimia.

227
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,521
Are you sure of appointing

228
00:27:54,237 --> 00:27:56,157
a person to be a muse because of the business?

229
00:28:00,557 --> 00:28:03,058
Do you have a problem of my choice?

230
00:28:07,503 --> 00:28:08,560
I just think that

231
00:28:08,737 --> 00:28:12,760
being a muse means that you can inspire someone, right?

232
00:28:22,523 --> 00:28:23,524
Why?

233
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,280
You think that you should be that person?

234
00:28:29,683 --> 00:28:31,730
I'm just an ordinary girl

235
00:28:33,063 --> 00:28:35,250
who've been trying to prove myself.

236
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:39,991
I did the wrong things.

237
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:46,320
I traded everything to be where I am now.

238
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:48,320
You should see that, right?

239
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,640
Lukjan didn't even sweat a single thing.

240
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:05,041
Why did everything look so easy for her?

241
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:11,360
This is not different than devalue

242
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:13,960
your own art pieces.

243
00:29:27,263 --> 00:29:29,977
There's so much for you to learn in this world.

244
00:29:31,943 --> 00:29:32,944
What you said was right.

245
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,261
Lukjan may not reach the criteria

246
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,720
to be exactly what I needed.

247
00:29:39,003 --> 00:29:43,160
But she got connections, with so many businesses that benefit my brand.

248
00:29:45,257 --> 00:29:46,160
These things are what

249
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,960
I am willing to trade for.

250
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,131
What about you?

251
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,391
What do you have to offer?

252
00:30:51,837 --> 00:30:52,838
Bambi,

253
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:54,920
why do you look so upset?

254
00:31:02,043 --> 00:31:04,560
You're sad that I was selected to be a muse and you weren't?

255
00:31:08,737 --> 00:31:11,840
Honey, you look so desperate. It's making me sad.

256
00:31:16,403 --> 00:31:17,640
Let me ask you something,

257
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,600
why do you want to be a muse?

258
00:31:25,443 --> 00:31:27,600
You have everything.

259
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,331
Bambi,

260
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,321
I've never thought

261
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:40,360
that I needed to compete with you.

262
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,717
I didn't even want to be a muse.

263
00:31:44,437 --> 00:31:46,177
But my parents urged me to.

264
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,760
They wanted me to be recognized in the society.

265
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,880
A social climber like you should get it. / You ended up using your family's connection.

266
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,171
You should be proud of yourself.

267
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:02,971
Bambi,

268
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,320
I admire you.

269
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,760
I see that you're so good to be where you are now.

270
00:32:09,443 --> 00:32:12,280
You're so lucky to have met someone like us, you know that?

271
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,650
What did you have before this?

272
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,001
What school are you going to?

273
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:19,040
A noname school?

274
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,840
For example,

275
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,720
when you hit an old man,

276
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,641
can I ask you something?

277
00:32:28,703 --> 00:32:32,084
You think your parents could help you out? / What the hell is wrong with you?

278
00:32:41,717 --> 00:32:43,718
You think that old man died?

279
00:32:46,797 --> 00:32:49,680
If you didn't have us to save you,

280
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,640
you could end up in jail already.

281
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,280
It's okay. Today is my day.

282
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,120
I think I should go back to the party.

283
00:33:00,503 --> 00:33:02,360
Do you want to join me at my table?

284
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,520
And you should stop

285
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,650
thinking about being a muse.

286
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,080
I don't think you can be one, you know why?

287
00:33:18,223 --> 00:33:20,240
Your digital footprint is all over the place

288
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,257
and it could show up any time.

289
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,360
Unlike me, I'm super clean.

290
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:04,920
To heal my stress.

291
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,881
You could die if you take it all.

292
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,080
Take home?

293
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,001
You can't, officers are lining up on the way home.

294
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,401
Want to sniff some?

295
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,960
I can't believe it, cool!

296
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,720
Keep the pouch, okay? / Thanks.

297
00:35:47,983 --> 00:35:50,320
What did you do? Why do you look like this?

298
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,680
When you ask me,

299
00:36:03,363 --> 00:36:05,840
do you really want to know or just asking?

300
00:36:10,477 --> 00:36:12,200
Is it that important to you?

301
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,880
I think so if I had a mom.

302
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,960
There's a thin line crossing

303
00:36:26,957 --> 00:36:28,480
between our relationship.

304
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,200
If you were my product like Dana,

305
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,440
I would have so many opinions to share with you.

306
00:36:43,383 --> 00:36:46,480
But you're your Dad and your Mom's product.

307
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,310
As a human being,

308
00:36:52,703 --> 00:36:55,983
when you feel sad, I feel sad too.

309
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,960
This is so you.

310
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,300
No wonder why you can stay with Dad.

311
00:37:18,783 --> 00:37:19,960
Wanna call her?

312
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:25,400
Call your mom?

313
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,183
I think right now

314
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,600
you need someone.

315
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:40,360
Even if I feel your pain,

316
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,680
you wouldn't feel great about it.

317
00:37:46,783 --> 00:37:49,640
You better find it from someone who'd make you feel good.

318
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,121
Are you okay?

319
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,403
I saw Lukjan followed you inside, she didn't do anything, did she?

320
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,040
It's none of your business.

321
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,040
You didn't seem to care about me before.

322
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:33,678
Why?

323
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:37,797
You want to be a good guy now? / My company ordered me to stay away from you.

324
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,080
They're worried that something bad would happen.

325
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,103
I saw you like this and I'm worried about you.

326
00:38:48,963 --> 00:38:50,683
I really can help you.

327
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,200
My company is about to launch a new project of series.

328
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:57,103
I can introduce you to them easily.

329
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:59,360
It will turn out great.

330
00:39:00,903 --> 00:39:02,623
I don't want you to live like this.

331
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,560
Live like what?

332
00:39:11,203 --> 00:39:12,440
You're all talk,

333
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,560
you've never done anything.

334
00:39:18,543 --> 00:39:22,080
You said that if I needed something, I needed to trade it, right?

335
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:26,117
See? I traded it with everything.

336
00:39:27,703 --> 00:39:28,704
What about you?

337
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,800
You told me that you'd quit starring in BL series.

338
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:42,971
It's my fault.

339
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,531
I'm sorry.

340
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,650
But can you trust me just one more time?

341
00:40:06,243 --> 00:40:07,920
It's gonna turn out great this time.

342
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,440
Trust me.

343
00:40:16,877 --> 00:40:19,000
You saw how I live my life, right?

344
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,520
I talked to Joe about it.

345
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,201
I used all of my connection for you.

346
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,370
I planned this because I worried about you.

347
00:40:43,043 --> 00:40:44,950
You can't compete with Lukjan with DEVI.

348
00:40:45,863 --> 00:40:48,800
She got connections with lots of money, you know it.

349
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,760
Trust me, if you don't want to struggle like this.

350
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:56,971
Don't forget that

351
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:59,080
you're just an ordinary girl.

352
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,760
I don't want to see you live your life like this.

353
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:07,680
If it troubles you that much,

354
00:41:13,703 --> 00:41:16,000
then you can enjoy fake happiness that you choose.

355
00:41:33,183 --> 00:41:35,440
Can I sniff some? / Are you sure.

356
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:39,360
I don't think you can be the muse,

357
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:42,280
because your digital footprint is all over the place.

358
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:47,000
Unlike me, I'm super clean.

359
00:42:09,077 --> 00:42:10,360
Watch out!

360
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:12,864
Hey! You!

361
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:15,850
Can I help you?

362
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,080
Here, hold her clutch.

363
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,192
How are you heading back?

364
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,121
I drove here, I think I need to drive it back.

365
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:34,360
Hey, can you help me look

366
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,920
if there're any officers on the way back?

367
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,320
Lukjan, the car is here. Come on.

368
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,721
Come on.

369
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:54,360
Thank you.

370
00:42:56,263 --> 00:42:57,320
Easy there.

371
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:01,120
Get in, okay?

372
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,561
Oh my!

373
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,321
Bambi!

374
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,000
Any officers on the way back?

375
00:43:17,384 --> 00:43:18,457
All clear.

376
00:43:18,563 --> 00:43:20,120
You sure? Alright, I'm leaving. / You should go.

377
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:35,511
Name, hey!

378
00:43:36,913 --> 00:43:37,914
Her clutch.

379
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,241
Right, thank you. See you.

380
00:43:40,383 --> 00:43:42,120
Bye / Get home safe. See you later.

381
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,281
Drive safe.

382
00:44:43,757 --> 00:44:44,758
Can I have a look inside?

383
00:44:45,763 --> 00:44:46,520
Stay still, sir!

384
00:44:46,683 --> 00:44:50,520
Look for what? I have a lawyer, officer. This is not right.

385
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,000
To be a special someone in this day and age

386
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:50,600
comes with many privileges.

387
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,400
Many people want to be special persons by many ways,

388
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,720
either to have good taste

389
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,360
or being tasteless.

390
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,321
Hello,

391
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:17,280
you're calling me in?

392
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:28,891
Do you know

393
00:47:30,617 --> 00:47:32,470
how people

394
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,843
can inspire artists to create art pieces.

395
00:47:43,003 --> 00:47:44,120
Their individualities.

396
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:48,600
That person has something that others don't have

397
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:51,403
or they can't find it from anyone else.

398
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:53,720
Kimia is that person.

399
00:47:55,797 --> 00:47:56,880
I saw her

400
00:47:57,930 --> 00:48:00,800
and I saw so many possibilities happened with her body.

401
00:48:03,697 --> 00:48:05,310
When I selected a muse,

402
00:48:06,763 --> 00:48:08,280
it can't be just anyone.

403
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,640
What about Lukjan?

404
00:48:24,677 --> 00:48:26,837
You already know what she has to offer.

405
00:48:28,577 --> 00:48:30,240
DEVI's girls

406
00:48:31,277 --> 00:48:32,400
aren't perfect.

407
00:48:36,223 --> 00:48:37,443
But they believed me.

408
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:40,443
They believed that I would

409
00:48:41,203 --> 00:48:43,204
create a better version of themselves.

410
00:48:45,517 --> 00:48:46,560
Unlike you,

411
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:49,960
you didn't believe me,

412
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,241
you didn't accept any chance that I gave you.

413
00:48:54,943 --> 00:48:56,400
Also, you destroyed me.

414
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:05,480
To ensure that they would be a person

415
00:49:05,597 --> 00:49:06,920
that I wanted them to be,

416
00:49:08,017 --> 00:49:10,520
I followed them all the time.

417
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:12,840
Of course, I knew whose

418
00:49:14,277 --> 00:49:17,960
drug's pouch in Lukjan's purse belong to.

419
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,250
The main investors weren't

420
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:33,151
quite happy of what happened to Lukjan.

421
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:40,000
I'll dismiss Lukjan because of the scandal.

422
00:49:42,583 --> 00:49:45,200
I'm not happy to lose the deal but what can I do.

423
00:49:46,303 --> 00:49:47,600
Deep down,

424
00:49:48,477 --> 00:49:50,320
I admired your boldness

425
00:49:50,617 --> 00:49:52,400
for deciding to do something like that.

426
00:49:55,097 --> 00:49:56,280
This is how the world is.

427
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,680
People who wanted to climb to the top,

428
00:50:00,477 --> 00:50:01,800
if they don't already have great start,

429
00:50:03,823 --> 00:50:05,724
then they need to step on someone's head.

430
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,560
But pictures of Lukjan spreading around showed that

431
00:50:12,717 --> 00:50:14,160
she wore DEVI's dress.

432
00:50:15,617 --> 00:50:16,960
I won't tolerate it that

433
00:50:17,783 --> 00:50:20,160
the pictures will last forever.

434
00:50:22,683 --> 00:50:24,040
Everything that happened is all

435
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,041
because of you.

436
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:30,320
You're a person who tainted my brand.

437
00:50:46,577 --> 00:50:47,720
I'm sorry.

438
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,241
But it's fine.

439
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:15,120
I called you here because I found a solution.

440
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,240
You want to be a muse so bad

441
00:51:20,863 --> 00:51:22,650
so I will give you this position.

442
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,520
Today, you have what no one else doesn't.

443
00:51:28,637 --> 00:51:31,680
I don't think I could find any model

444
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,920
who can represent ambition

445
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,160
as better as you can.

446
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:39,640
This is exciting.

447
00:51:40,657 --> 00:51:44,360
Clothing which is inspired by someone like you

448
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,081
must be so different from Kimiya.

449
00:51:51,637 --> 00:51:52,880
But I think it must be

450
00:51:55,243 --> 00:51:56,640
a tough job for me bring back

451
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:01,960
the reputation,

452
00:52:03,377 --> 00:52:05,480
from what you have done.

453
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:13,120
Work hard.

454
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,500
This is not a request

455
00:52:17,563 --> 00:52:18,564
but it's an order.

456
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:25,680
I didn't hold any better cards in the past.

457
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,601
But this time,

458
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,201
you need to remember

459
00:52:31,297 --> 00:52:32,760
what you have done.

460
00:53:07,157 --> 00:53:09,280
Glad to be working with you.

461
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,741
People can inspire

462
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,680
artists to create art pieces

463
00:53:43,701 --> 00:53:44,903
because of their individualities. - Duangtawan
