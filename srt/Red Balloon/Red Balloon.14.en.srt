00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,689
Mom, don't get the wrong idea.

00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:41,890
Darn you.

5
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,419
How dare you two?

6
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:46,589
Aren't you afraid of your punishment?

7
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:49,499
How could you have an affair
with your friend's husband?

Call Ba Da.

My daughter, Ba Da.

Mom, open your eyes.

Mom!

20
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,459
Mom, are you all right?

21
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,799
Can you see me?

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,269
You...

23
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,609
What's wrong, Mom?

24
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,479
Mom!

25
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:48,078
Excuse me.

26
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:50,649
My mother had heart
surgery at this hospital...

27
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,749
I already told them.

28
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,350
We should move her to the ICU
and observe her for any changes.

29
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,090
Over here.

30
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,319
Oh, no.

31
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:01,030
What's going to happen to my mom?

32
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,120
Why did she faint like
that all of a sudden?

33
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,190
Was she shocked or something?

34
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:34,788
How did you know she had passed out?

35
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:36,060
Were you two together?

36
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,299
Yes. Well...

37
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,168
We met in front of the apartment complex.

38
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:43,629
I was on my way home with burgers
for Mi Poong and your mom.

39
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,845
Mi Poong and Chun are
having a sleepover today.

40
00:03:45,869 --> 00:03:47,239
I didn't know.

41
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:50,010
Cha Won had gotten off work,
so we were saying hello.

42
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:52,739
Then your mom came out all
of a sudden and fainted.

43
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,410
It would've been worse if Cha Won
hadn't checked on her right away.

44
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,650
That's a relief. And today
was especially cold too.

45
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,989
What if my mom was alone when
she passed out on the street?

46
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,058
You have part-time work, right?

47
00:04:05,059 --> 00:04:07,020
You should go. Thank you
for helping us today.

48
00:04:07,059 --> 00:04:08,589
No. I'll stay here with you.

49
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,760
It's okay.

50
00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:11,928
There's nothing we can do now.

51
00:04:11,929 --> 00:04:13,569
By now, I know what the doctors will say.

52
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,270
She's right.

53
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,970
I think you should go.

54
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,070
Okay.

55
00:04:19,499 --> 00:04:21,739
Ba Da, call me if anything happens.

56
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,400
(Cha Won)

57
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:07,048
Don't be nervous.

58
00:05:07,049 --> 00:05:08,488
We can get our story straight.

59
00:05:08,489 --> 00:05:10,020
She can't call both of us liars.

60
00:05:12,989 --> 00:05:14,160
You should go home.

61
00:05:14,489 --> 00:05:16,260
Both of us don't have to be here.

62
00:05:16,489 --> 00:05:17,600
I'll stay with you.

63
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:20,529
You might have to take my place later.

64
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,210
So you should go home and rest up for now.

65
00:05:22,369 --> 00:05:23,999
I'll call you if anything changes.

66
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:26,600
Okay.

67
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,479
Let's switch after I get some sleep.

68
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,260
What is it?

69
00:06:22,859 --> 00:06:24,539
I was worried you'd be having a hard time,

70
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,810
so I wanted to see you before I left.

71
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:29,070
I'm fine.

72
00:06:30,429 --> 00:06:32,340
I told you how I felt earlier.

73
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,669
Tell me how you feel now.

74
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,340
How I feel?

75
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,979
I don't want anything.

76
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,249
Knowing how you feel is enough for me.

77
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:52,260
I don't mind...

78
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:54,989
living in the shadow
for the rest of my life.

79
00:06:57,229 --> 00:06:59,229
I won't get married.

80
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,270
I won't date other men.

81
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:05,270
I'll just run errands for Ba
Da and take care of Mi Poong.

82
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,470
Seeing you will be the joy of my life.

83
00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:10,979
I'll always stay in my spot.

84
00:07:11,109 --> 00:07:13,479
So you can see me when you turn around.

85
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,450
I won't ask you for anything.

86
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:22,890
I can't say anything,

87
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,689
do anything,

88
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,489
or make any promises.

89
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,320
I hope you can understand my situation.

90
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,498
I can't give you a clear explanation...

91
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:38,070
of my feelings right now.

92
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:42,869
I just want to let myself...

93
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,710
flow with the river.

94
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:49,010
I can understand that.

95
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:52,850
I don't want you to be miserable.

96
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,920
Just as I've done up till now,

97
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,320
I'll love you on my own...

98
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,560
and treasure you on my own.

99
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,460
At least, you know how I feel now.

100
00:08:07,869 --> 00:08:09,300
That's enough.

101
00:09:08,489 --> 00:09:09,989
Darn you.

102
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,300
How could you have an affair
with your friend's husband?

103
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,499
- You...
- What's wrong, Mom?

104
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:50,570
What brings you here at this hour?

105
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,139
It's not morning yet.

106
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,638
Well,

107
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:55,009
I was worried about you.

108
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:56,419
You didn't get any sleep, right?

109
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,009
I got some sleep in the lobby.

110
00:09:59,109 --> 00:10:01,450
How's Mom? Is she awake?

111
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:04,649
Not yet.

112
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,450
I'll stay here.

113
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,789
You should go home and get some sleep.

114
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,888
No.

115
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:10,858
Cha Won also wanted to
come, but I told him not to.

116
00:10:10,859 --> 00:10:12,690
When Mom wakes up, she'll ask for me first.

117
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:13,920
I should be here.

118
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,229
Right.

119
00:10:16,729 --> 00:10:17,999
I'll stay with you then.

120
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,990
Give this to her and end it...

121
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,190
before Dad finds out.

122
00:11:11,249 --> 00:11:12,819
Someone will come and pick this up later.

123
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,920
You can hand off this box.

124
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:25,800
I made some bibimbap.

125
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,358
Get up and have some food.

126
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,570
I don't want any food.

127
00:11:29,499 --> 00:11:31,599
You're afraid to be on
your own after a divorce.

128
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,440
But you're furious to forgive him.

129
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,738
You must be going through a hard time now.

130
00:11:35,739 --> 00:11:37,268
You should sue that girl.

131
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:40,138
After the adultery law got repealed,
people started filing lawsuits.

132
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,408
What was that called?

133
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,710
With a lawsuit, you can get
a lot of money for alimony.

134
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,179
But then again, your
family is already rich.

135
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,149
You wouldn't want more money.

136
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,089
You must be so upset.

137
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,059
I heard that girl was 20
years younger than you.

138
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,190
Goodness. You can try all you want,
but age is one thing you can't beat.

139
00:11:56,489 --> 00:11:57,729
Aren't you going to eat?

140
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,850
I'll take it with me if
you're not going to eat.

141
00:12:01,229 --> 00:12:03,999
The sesame oil smells amazing.

142
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,680
Here.

143
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,379
Did your son-in-law end it?

144
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,389
Sometimes, men tend to lose their way.

145
00:12:22,489 --> 00:12:24,219
Be the bigger person and forgive him.

146
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,359
Then he won't do it again.

147
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,489
I heard you went skiing and camping.

148
00:12:28,989 --> 00:12:30,330
- How did you know that?
- What?

149
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:32,700
I just had a feeling.

150
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,399
You've never cheated on your wife, right?

151
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,170
- Do you want my honest answer?
- Why else would I ask?

152
00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:41,368
I have to spend money
if I want to meet women.

153
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:42,570
I didn't have any money.

154
00:12:43,109 --> 00:12:45,239
When I started making money,
I didn't have the time.

155
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,739
Now that I have some time,

156
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,049
I've gotten old physically and mentally.

157
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,079
So I have no desire.

158
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,879
I have neither the passion
nor a woman who likes me.

159
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,539
But when it comes to my inner thoughts,

160
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:57,320
I can't say I'm free from any infidelity.
What about you?

161
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,820
I've been keeping things low-key.
A few flings.

162
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,228
Since you never crossed the
line, you're not guilty?

163
00:13:02,229 --> 00:13:03,290
Right.

164
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,330
You must have been grocery shopping.

165
00:13:07,499 --> 00:13:08,869
Not even a hello from you?

166
00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:11,569
- Forget it.
- Take this inside.

167
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,470
Let me take care of the trash first.

168
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,540
See you later.

169
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,479
Call me anytime.

170
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,450
Do you need to talk?

171
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,550
Things are pretty bad at the house.

172
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:28,749
I feel bad for his daughter.

173
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,148
She can't even divorce him.

174
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:32,489
Getting a divorce isn't easy.
They have kids.

175
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,858
Rich people are more
reluctant to get a divorce.

176
00:13:34,859 --> 00:13:36,929
I heard the company couldn't
function without the husband.

177
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,629
That's why it's crazier.

178
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:40,959
Age is the biggest weapon women have.

179
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,268
And her weapon is not the
same as the girl's weapon.

180
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:45,040
That girl got the newest missile.

181
00:13:45,369 --> 00:13:47,169
And the wife got the
outdated submachine gun.

182
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,109
I wonder who she is. I would
love to see that face of hers.

183
00:13:50,609 --> 00:13:51,638
You should go.

184
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:53,609
Come home quickly. I'll be done soon.

185
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:54,879
Okay.

186
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:22,609
Is the owner not here?

187
00:14:23,909 --> 00:14:24,909
Over there.

188
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:31,320
You're older than I thought.

189
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,220
I know we never met. But
don't take it personally.

190
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,690
What you did was wrong.

191
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,495
You can't wreck someone's
marriage like that.

192
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,519
How could you come to work
as if nothing happened?

193
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,840
Yes. I'm almost there.

194
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,909
I can just take Eun
San's belongings, right?

195
00:14:56,409 --> 00:14:58,609
I put the money in the box.

196
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:00,810
Hold onto it.

197
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:03,279
Once Eun San calms down,
give it to her then.

198
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,580
Even if she calls or visits you,

199
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,500
send her back and don't give her any hope.

200
00:15:07,989 --> 00:15:09,019
Please do that.

201
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:11,729
She's too young. So she
doesn't know anything.

202
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,080
You shouldn't encourage
her as you're older.

203
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,960
Hey. I'm not here to pick this up.

204
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,100
Dad.

205
00:15:24,869 --> 00:15:25,940
What are you doing here?

206
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:27,540
What about you?

207
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,970
You see,

208
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,109
I came here to teach
the bookkeeper a lesson,

209
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:33,840
but she kept telling me to take this.

210
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,609
Trying to explain myself to
her has drained my energy.

211
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,350
And she's so strong.

212
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,779
I'm here on an errand for this.

213
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,249
Is that so?

214
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,989
By the way, I can't picture them together.

215
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,701
The bookkeeper doesn't make
a good couple with the owner.

216
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,180
Why are you so interested
in other people's business?

217
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:54,129
Right. Beauty is in the
eye of the beholder.

218
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,470
By the way, that
bookkeeper might quit soon.

219
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,739
Why don't I ask if Eun San can work here?

220
00:15:58,769 --> 00:15:59,800
Not here.

221
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,400
I'm already looking into
other positions for her.

222
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,170
- Let's go.
- Okay.

223
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,550
Please eat.

224
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,720
Eat it. The meat is burning.

225
00:16:30,369 --> 00:16:32,070
It wasn't because I hated you...

226
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,609
or wanted to divorce you.

227
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:36,909
I had no reason.

228
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,879
It wasn't your fault either.

229
00:16:40,409 --> 00:16:42,550
It wasn't because I didn't
find you attractive.

230
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,719
If I had to find a reason,

231
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:46,980
I must have been too tired.

232
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,189
I had been living with your parents...

233
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:54,320
for 18 years now.

234
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:59,399
I think something inside me snapped.

235
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,240
We never lived like other newlyweds.

236
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:05,540
I had never been at
complete ease in the house.

237
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:07,716
I could never take off
my clothes comfortably.

238
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,709
I was always nervous when I went to sleep.

239
00:17:11,379 --> 00:17:12,939
They could call me anytime they wanted.

240
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,480
I was always on standby.

241
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,350
I had never embraced you...

242
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,320
at ease.

243
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,320
It felt as if your father was watching me.

244
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:30,030
So I couldn't freely make love to you.

245
00:17:31,629 --> 00:17:32,929
Let me say this again.

246
00:17:33,129 --> 00:17:34,809
It wasn't because you weren't good enough.

247
00:17:35,129 --> 00:17:36,849
This happened because I wasn't good enough.

248
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,500
Don't blame yourself.

249
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:42,240
That breaks my heart.

250
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:48,709
Geum Ah.

251
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,149
I'm coming back to you.

252
00:17:53,449 --> 00:17:54,590
Please give me some time.

253
00:18:00,689 --> 00:18:02,730
- You want to move out?
- Yes.

254
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:04,329
For the 18 years we've been married,

255
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,358
we never had the freedom to be on our own.

256
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:08,230
What are you talking about?

257
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:09,868
We're on the 1st floor, and
you're on the 2nd floor.

258
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:10,929
You have your freedom.

259
00:18:10,969 --> 00:18:12,069
It was uncomfortable living here for me.

260
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,698
Imagine how it would've
been for my husband.

261
00:18:13,699 --> 00:18:14,839
Was it uncomfortable for you?

262
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,069
I couldn't take off my
clothes comfortably...

263
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,468
or eat the food I wanted.

264
00:18:17,469 --> 00:18:20,179
Take them off. We never
told you to do that.

265
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,449
And you got to eat
everything you wanted too.

266
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,050
Is that why he cheated on you?

267
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:27,019
He's got to be kidding me.

268
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,418
Whenever you guys called him,

269
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:30,750
he had to come down day and night.

270
00:18:30,949 --> 00:18:32,989
He lived with you guys for 18 years.
That's enough.

271
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,459
I want to move out, so
we can be on our own.

272
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,129
Dad, let us do that even
if it's for a few years.

273
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,340
Sure.

274
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,739
Really? Dad.

275
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,938
How could you say yes to that?

276
00:18:52,939 --> 00:18:54,809
I can't live without them.

277
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,050
Try it.

278
00:18:56,149 --> 00:18:57,855
How much longer will you
live with your daughter?

279
00:18:57,879 --> 00:18:59,980
I'll be bored living in
this big house alone.

280
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,960
Cha Won can move in with his family then.

281
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,320
- Will they?
- Of course, they should.

282
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:08,260
I know Ba Da will want to listen to me.

283
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:10,590
Okay. Where do you want to go?

284
00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:11,730
Don't move too far.

285
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,358
Right. You guys can move
into Cha Won's apartment.

286
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:16,629
And they can move in with us.
You guys can switch.

287
00:19:16,869 --> 00:19:18,840
They're living in your
dad's apartment anyway.

288
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,640
We should listen to what Ba Da wants too.

289
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,409
Actually, I was going to find a
unit around Cha Won's apartment.

290
00:19:23,469 --> 00:19:24,510
It's close from here.

291
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:28,408
Your burger sets are ready.

292
00:19:28,409 --> 00:19:29,449
Okay.

293
00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:32,349
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

294
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,449
Thanks.

295
00:19:36,189 --> 00:19:38,188
Gosh. They give you a lot of food.

296
00:19:38,189 --> 00:19:39,359
It's not even that expensive.

297
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,489
You know all the good
restaurants in Korea, right?

298
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,490
Not all of them. But I
know a good number of them.

299
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,659
Taxi drivers know a lot of
good and cheap restaurants.

300
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,999
People can look up restaurants
on their phones now.

301
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,329
But back in the day, they
all asked the taxi drivers.

302
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,438
For both directions and restaurants.

303
00:19:52,439 --> 00:19:53,469
Right.

304
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,480
Hey, try it. It's good.

305
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,409
It's good.

306
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:04,949
- Right?
- Yes.

307
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,419
It looked like you haven't
been getting good sleep lately.

308
00:20:10,889 --> 00:20:12,119
Is it because of your ex-wife?

309
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,359
No.

310
00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:17,760
I saw...

311
00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:20,500
her.

312
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:25,070
- Where?
- She got into my taxi.

313
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,570
What a small world.

314
00:20:27,699 --> 00:20:29,099
Could you recognize her right away?

315
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,270
What did she say? Is she happy now?

316
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,080
I didn't say anything. Neither did she.

317
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,179
- Not even a hello?
- No.

318
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,050
She didn't seem happy.

319
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,050
I thought she would be happy.

320
00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:44,418
And I hoped she would.

321
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:46,458
How do you know that? You
didn't talk to each other.

322
00:20:46,459 --> 00:20:47,789
Was she dressed poorly?

323
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,128
Did she age quickly?

324
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:50,459
She was older than you.

325
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,399
I could just tell.

326
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,629
You're not going to see her again, right?

327
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,369
We didn't even talk.

328
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,898
Whenever I think about how
her father almost killed you,

329
00:20:59,899 --> 00:21:00,968
makes my blood boil.

330
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,968
If I didn't find you passed
out in front of our gate,

331
00:21:02,969 --> 00:21:04,010
you wouldn't be here.

332
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,139
What did her father do?

333
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:07,709
You said her family was rich.

334
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,908
I think he was a taffy seller
or ran a taffy factory.

335
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:11,108
She might have told me.

336
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:12,849
But I was young back then.
So I have no idea.

337
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,580
Don't see her again. Okay?

338
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:15,689
I won't.

339
00:21:16,189 --> 00:21:17,219
But...

340
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:20,188
how come I'm in so much pain?

341
00:21:20,189 --> 00:21:21,259
It's like that for everyone.

342
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,329
People get jealous when
their exes are happy...

343
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,665
and sad when their exes are unhappy.

344
00:21:24,689 --> 00:21:26,329
If they were to live together,
it would be a headache.

345
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,868
I'd rather be jealous.
I want her to be happy.

346
00:21:28,869 --> 00:21:30,369
Why would you suffer because of her?

347
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,939
Don't be ridiculous.

348
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,639
Forget her.

349
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:36,839
Your life went downhill
after meeting that woman.

350
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,378
Her dad beat you to a pulp,

351
00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:40,040
and she married another man.

352
00:21:40,639 --> 00:21:42,579
Then you had a one-night stand
with your ex-wife out of spite.

353
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,449
You got married and divorced.
Look at you now.

354
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:47,249
Your life got complicated
after meeting that woman.

355
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,149
There are people you don't mix well with.

356
00:21:49,189 --> 00:21:51,320
A relationship ends with a tragedy.

357
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,590
That's bad luck.

358
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:57,530
Just have your burger.

359
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,219
Are you going to move out?

360
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:05,560
Yes.

361
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,490
Can you guys move in here?

362
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,159
Without me, they'll fight all the time.

363
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:12,800
Mom wants you guys to move in too.

364
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,360
Things aren't ideal for me either.

365
00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:17,530
This is only for your ears.

366
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,299
My mother-in-law is in the ICU.

367
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,669
My gosh. Why?

368
00:24:22,969 --> 00:24:24,770
Do you think it's her time?

369
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,010
I don't know.

370
00:24:26,011 --> 00:24:28,010
She's always been sick.
So it's touch and go.

371
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,750
I can't ask Ba Da to move in here then.

372
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:35,820
How are you?

373
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,090
You know...

374
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,889
Tell me the truth.

375
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,629
We're both trying our
best to heal our wounds.

376
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,800
We're trying.

377
00:24:47,699 --> 00:24:49,499
But I'm not sure if we
can recover from this.

378
00:24:51,369 --> 00:24:53,540
We were never the lovey-dovey type.

379
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,770
But I feel more distant now.

380
00:24:56,909 --> 00:24:58,879
That gap between us can't be closed.

381
00:25:00,639 --> 00:25:03,080
You know how it is to feel pathetic, right?

382
00:25:03,209 --> 00:25:04,649
I lay down beside him...

383
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,250
but couldn't help but compare
myself to the young girl.

384
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:11,119
I felt so small and worthless.

385
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:16,830
I can't believe I'm telling you this.

386
00:25:17,389 --> 00:25:18,669
You have every right to tell me.

387
00:25:19,129 --> 00:25:20,858
I'm your younger brother,
but also a doctor.

388
00:25:20,859 --> 00:25:22,169
You can tell me anything.

389
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,030
Ever since I hit menopause,

390
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:26,270
I figured I was done being a woman.

391
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:29,438
His affair put the final
nail in the coffin.

392
00:25:29,439 --> 00:25:31,209
Why am I the one suffering...

393
00:25:31,369 --> 00:25:33,378
when he's the one who had the affair?

394
00:25:33,379 --> 00:25:35,580
Geum Ah, have confidence in yourself.

395
00:25:35,649 --> 00:25:37,749
No one thinks your feminine days are gone.

396
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,550
Fifty isn't even considered old anymore.

397
00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:41,919
It's the new mid-thirties.

398
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:44,149
Nothing you say can comfort me.

399
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,618
She's 20 years my junior.

400
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:49,266
Geum Ah, get dressed.
Let's go to the hospital.

401
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,428
Let me give you some treatments.

402
00:25:50,429 --> 00:25:53,759
Get moisturizing shots, a laser
facelift, and Botox shots.

403
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,128
- Let's go right now.
- What good would that do?

404
00:25:56,129 --> 00:25:59,000
It will be comforting and
will boost your confidence.

405
00:25:59,369 --> 00:26:00,999
It's what brings many women to my clinic,

406
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,509
and they're the reason
I put food on the table.

407
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,968
Find your confidence again...

408
00:26:03,969 --> 00:26:05,279
even if it's through the hands of a doctor.

409
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,010
If only something like this never happened.

410
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,750
Will I be able to forget once time passes?

411
00:26:11,409 --> 00:26:13,050
Geum Ah.
- "Fine, you jerk."

412
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:14,280
"Let's get a divorce."

413
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:17,849
Isn't it tragic that I
can't divorce my husband?

414
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,389
Why would you think that way?

415
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,189
You're not the reason
you can't divorce him.

416
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,659
No, I'm pathetic.

417
00:26:24,629 --> 00:26:26,760
Nam Chul gave her 100,000 dollars.

418
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,570
- Wait, 100,000 dollars?
- He must love her greatly...

419
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:32,070
to have put together that kind of money.

420
00:26:32,699 --> 00:26:35,070
He paid her when I should be
the one being compensated.

421
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:37,769
It wasn't a fling or him fooling around.

422
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:41,139
He hasn't even apologized to me.

423
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,350
You know how Nam Chul is.

424
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,990
He's a sincere man who
chooses his words wisely.

425
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:53,820
I'm sure he knows what he did was wrong.

426
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,760
He's better than people who
only apologize in words.

427
00:26:57,859 --> 00:26:59,359
He says he's coming back to me.

428
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,600
But I can tell.

429
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,868
We have a long way to go.

430
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:05,269
I think it's because
they were pulled apart...

431
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,776
while the relationship was burning hot.

432
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,010
His heart aches because
they can't live together.

433
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,310
Not being able to see
her is driving him crazy.

434
00:27:11,609 --> 00:27:13,539
Maybe I should tell him
to just live with her.

435
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,350
Why would you even think that?

436
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,389
I heard you haven't even
apologized to Geum Ah.

437
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,060
Is it because apologizing...

438
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,158
will make you look guilty?

439
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,270
I can be the guilty party all day long.

440
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,439
But I can't stand the thought of...

441
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,200
people pointing the finger at her.

442
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,310
She's still too young.

443
00:27:45,379 --> 00:27:46,879
Everyone in this world...

444
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,449
can criticize me all they want,

445
00:27:50,109 --> 00:27:51,448
but I want to shield her...

446
00:27:51,449 --> 00:27:53,320
from condemnation.

447
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,719
I can't help it if you see me as a jerk.

448
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,760
That's just how I feel.

449
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:03,530
I'm Geum Ah's brother, so
I'll always put her first.

450
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:05,698
You keep talking about her even
though you said it was over.

451
00:28:05,699 --> 00:28:07,099
Aren't you concerned about Geum Ah?

452
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:08,330
Your sister...

453
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,369
will be my responsibility forever,

454
00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:12,739
and I will make it up to her.

455
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,669
You feel a sense of responsibility for her,

456
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:17,239
but the other woman is the one you love.

457
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,439
It's not like that.

458
00:28:19,139 --> 00:28:20,340
I'm doing my best.

459
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:31,020
In life, you sometimes get
swept up by an unexpected storm.

460
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:33,359
I never imagined...

461
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:35,359
that anything like this would happen to me.

462
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,659
I never thought...

463
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:40,760
I'd feel this way about someone else.

464
00:28:42,129 --> 00:28:43,969
The past few months...

465
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,600
don't even seem real to me.

466
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:51,070
It's as if I was caught
in a devilish storm.

467
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,480
You don't have to take any action.

468
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,020
I'll...

469
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,080
handle it myself.

470
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:07,659
I heard your family would be moving out.

471
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,060
Please sort things out quickly.

472
00:29:09,129 --> 00:29:10,928
The sooner, the better.

473
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:12,399
If you keep hurting Geum Ah,

474
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,600
I won't be able...

475
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:16,629
to take your side.

476
00:29:17,629 --> 00:29:18,699
I'll get going.

477
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,649
Yes, this is Han Ba Da.

478
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,020
What?

479
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:38,590
They're being returned?

480
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:41,219
Why? What could be the reason?

481
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:50,069
Hey, Ba Da.

482
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:52,398
Eun Kang, what am I going to do?

483
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,899
What's going on? Ba Da?

484
00:30:00,209 --> 00:30:02,250
- What is this all about?
- What am I going to do?

485
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:04,529
The same kind of jewelry is
being sold on the street.

486
00:30:04,609 --> 00:30:07,679
At 99.90 dollars when mine was 999 dollars.

487
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,290
This is going to ruin me.
What am I going to do?

488
00:30:10,649 --> 00:30:11,688
What about your mom?

489
00:30:11,689 --> 00:30:14,020
The hospital will call
if something happens.

490
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:16,290
Let's sort this out first.

491
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,499
Jewelry of the same design...

492
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,669
has hit the streets and online sites.

493
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,408
The rubies are low-quality imitations,

494
00:30:29,409 --> 00:30:30,809
but people don't care.

495
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,539
After hearing about the similar design,

496
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,240
they got busy asking for a refund.

497
00:30:34,439 --> 00:30:35,510
Ms. Han,

498
00:30:35,609 --> 00:30:36,708
as you know,

499
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,750
you are legally bound to
give in to this demand.

500
00:30:41,879 --> 00:30:42,990
The police.

501
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,570
Let's go to the police station first.

502
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:46,959
I must catch who did this.

503
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:49,659
Eun Kang, get Ki Han for me.

504
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:54,230
This is obviously linked to
her designs that were stolen.

505
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,405
You failed to apprehend
the culprit, am I right?

506
00:30:56,429 --> 00:31:00,139
A company's fate and one's
life are on the line.

507
00:31:00,199 --> 00:31:03,709
From what I saw regarding
the stolen designs,

508
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,909
she was targeted by a bigger operation.

509
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,810
We must root out whoever is behind this!

510
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:09,850
But that will take time.

511
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,279
Let's not get worked up.

512
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,250
How can one stay calm?

513
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,020
Why couldn't you catch that person?

514
00:31:15,389 --> 00:31:17,850
It's not easy if they
flee to places like China.

515
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,520
Please get this person.

516
00:31:20,419 --> 00:31:21,520
Please.

517
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,459
Of course.

518
00:31:30,699 --> 00:31:32,198
What is Interpol even doing?

519
00:31:32,199 --> 00:31:34,240
Crimes like this are the worst.

520
00:31:44,879 --> 00:31:47,879
I'm sure Ki Han lent her the money as well.

521
00:31:54,389 --> 00:31:55,429
(6 unread messages)

522
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:58,030
(07-1sia Ruby Stone has been sent by post.)

523
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,199
What is it?

524
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,199
I'll go.

525
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,270
They're expensive gems,

526
00:32:08,271 --> 00:32:09,816
so someone needs to be
there for the delivery.

527
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,240
I'll receive them at your office.

528
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,840
Please look after Ba Da.

529
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,139
Don't worry.

530
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:21,820
Cha Won?

531
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,419
Why didn't you come in?

532
00:32:26,659 --> 00:32:27,959
I see that Shin Ki Han is here.

533
00:32:28,689 --> 00:32:30,760
Did she call him first
since he lent her the money?

534
00:32:32,429 --> 00:32:33,730
You should head inside.

535
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,869
I have to be at the office
to receive deliveries.

536
00:32:35,929 --> 00:32:37,070
Then...

537
00:32:42,439 --> 00:32:45,939
Your report has been submitted,
so you may go home for now.

538
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,649
Please...

539
00:32:50,379 --> 00:32:52,320
find whoever did this.

540
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,429
You're here.

541
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,240
Let's go.

542
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,850
Just a second.

543
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:34,290
Thank you for coming.

544
00:33:34,489 --> 00:33:36,169
I'll repay you for all that you have done.

545
00:33:36,529 --> 00:33:37,830
There's no need to.

546
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,799
It's what friends are for.

547
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:42,345
A six-figure loan is
larger than any friendship.

548
00:33:42,369 --> 00:33:43,429
A six-figure loan?

549
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,580
How could you do something like this?

550
00:34:30,049 --> 00:34:31,610
This wasn't part of the agreement.

551
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:34,618
My friend is in the mud because
everyone wants a refund.

552
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:35,749
Quiet.

553
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,388
You started all this.

554
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:38,549
Are you threatening me?

555
00:34:39,259 --> 00:34:41,020
I told you I would take action.

556
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:45,230
Do whatever you want.

557
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:47,460
But you're the one who stole the design.

558
00:34:47,529 --> 00:34:49,130
Don't forget that you're my accomplice.

559
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,770
It'll be the end for you as well.

560
00:34:52,029 --> 00:34:53,040
I'm hanging up.

561
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:56,839
How could this happen to me?

562
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:58,810
What am I going to do?

563
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,739
This isn't chump change.

564
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,679
What is all this?

565
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,480
Rubies and sapphires.

566
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,650
She bought what was in Korea
and imported more from overseas.

567
00:35:11,389 --> 00:35:12,989
But now they're worthless.

568
00:35:13,089 --> 00:35:14,759
Why did you buy so much at once?

569
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,829
They were a hit on the
home-shopping channel,

570
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,999
so she was planning to
launch a series of them.

571
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,059
How much is the loss?

572
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,830
I can't even give you a number.

573
00:35:22,929 --> 00:35:24,028
If 100,000 dollars' worth gets returned,

574
00:35:24,029 --> 00:35:25,405
the loss will be 2 to 3 times that.

575
00:35:25,429 --> 00:35:28,170
Gems differ in price when bought and sold.

576
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:29,968
It's not the same as gold.

577
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:32,516
The cost that went into making
the jewelry will have been wasted.

578
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:36,310
And it takes a lot of
work to even make a ring.

579
00:35:36,549 --> 00:35:38,909
You should've looked into it
before expanding the business.

580
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,750
Stay out of it if you're not going to help.

581
00:35:42,489 --> 00:35:43,690
How can you say that?

582
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:46,450
You're the one who took
an unnecessary risk.

583
00:35:46,989 --> 00:35:48,388
A business should be run
with the money you have,

584
00:35:48,389 --> 00:35:49,759
not by taking out a loan.

585
00:35:49,989 --> 00:35:52,730
As if you know anything
about running a business.

586
00:35:52,799 --> 00:35:54,499
Ask anyone who is running one.

587
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,929
Taking out loans is a must.

588
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:58,229
Is that all you can say
when I'm on the verge...

589
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,669
of going bankrupt?

590
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,868
And you call yourself my husband?

591
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:02,710
I'm upset, that's all!

592
00:36:03,069 --> 00:36:05,239
You shouldn't have taken out a loan.

593
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,408
How can you be so reckless?

594
00:36:07,409 --> 00:36:08,679
Please!

595
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:12,850
Will you shut it?

596
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:21,819
Ba Da.

597
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,830
Cha Won, just go. Leave.

598
00:36:41,279 --> 00:36:42,310
Money?

599
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:44,009
Why are you in sudden need of cash?

600
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,319
This is for your ears only.

601
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,790
Something unfortunate happened to Ba Da...

602
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:51,465
while trying to expand her
home-shopping business.

603
00:36:51,489 --> 00:36:52,589
What?

604
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:55,419
Are you saying she's going bankrupt?

605
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,889
No, it's not like that.

606
00:36:58,929 --> 00:36:59,929
Consumers are asking for a refund.

607
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:01,630
It's the same thing!

608
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:02,730
My head hurts.

609
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,569
What am I going to do?

610
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:06,639
- Oh, dear.
- Don't worry.

611
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,338
Ba Da will be fine.

612
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:10,439
It's not her I'm worried about!

613
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,210
Get out. I can't even look at you.

614
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:14,879
Why did you stand idly by
and let her go bankrupt?

615
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,579
You should've gotten her to see straight!

616
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,710
Get out. Didn't you hear me?

617
00:37:19,549 --> 00:37:20,650
My gosh.

618
00:37:23,989 --> 00:37:25,049
Oh, no.

619
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,560
What's going to happen to my money?

620
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,028
Have some.

621
00:37:31,029 --> 00:37:32,429
You need to eat to stay energized.

622
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,199
I can't.

623
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:41,299
You're still young...

624
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,540
and can easily earn a few
hundred thousand dollars.

625
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,210
Have a bite at least.

626
00:37:51,179 --> 00:37:52,480
Thanks, Eun Kang.

627
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:56,049
Don't cry.

628
00:37:57,619 --> 00:37:58,750
You saw him.

629
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,429
How could my own husband act this way?

630
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,310
Even a stranger would be more sympathetic.

631
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,799
I couldn't have managed without you.

632
00:38:10,869 --> 00:38:13,500
Hang in there. I'm sure you'll find a way.

633
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,339
Let's stay calm and think.

634
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,110
I'm going to catch this person.

635
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:20,409
I'll find whoever did this.

636
00:38:21,339 --> 00:38:22,549
And I won't be forgiving.

637
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:27,080
I heard you went bankrupt.

638
00:38:27,219 --> 00:38:29,079
What about my money?

639
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,850
- Mother.
- I see nothing but doom,

640
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,318
but you are filling your belly.

641
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:36,189
You should've told me as
soon as this happened,

642
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,889
but you had me hear it from Cha Won.

Eun San, at your age,

you believe that love is beautiful.

730

You find him beautiful...

731
00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:05,750
as well as your time spent
together and even the breakup.

732
00:45:06,949 --> 00:45:09,719
But romantic relationships...

733
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:12,119
aren't that pretty.

734
00:45:12,819 --> 00:45:15,118
People fall in love to
fulfill their desires,

735
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,960
and no breakups are beautiful.

736

How can it be beautiful...

737
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:20,390
when it's the result
of falling out of love?

738
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:23,250
Movies and novels just
try to paint it that way.

739
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:24,799
It's wishful thinking by us humans.

740
00:45:26,069 --> 00:45:27,139
So here's my conclusion.

741
00:45:27,699 --> 00:45:29,170
A once-in-a-lifetime relationship...

742
00:45:29,469 --> 00:45:31,189
is also the result of hormones going crazy.

743
00:45:31,869 --> 00:45:33,009
Just accept it.

744
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:37,110
His hormones are no longer
affected at the sight of you.

745
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,320
I want to know how I can
quickly get over him.

746
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,619
There's no magical solution.

747
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:47,560
You have to let time do its work.

00:49:25,739 --> 00:49:26,779
That's enough.

806
00:49:28,679 --> 00:49:30,880
Fourth. You said you wanted to protect me.

807
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:32,179
This is how you show it?

808
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:33,980
I'm not done yet.

809
00:49:34,219 --> 00:49:35,750
You can't end it this way.

810
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:40,510
This is why people still call you immature.

811
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,230
You should know when to end a fling.

812
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,830
Move before I say something worse.

813
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,630
A fling?

814
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:53,569
Do you only care about your kids?

815
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,540
What about me?

816
00:49:58,739 --> 00:50:00,009
I'm going to tell your kids.

817
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:03,650
- What?
- I'll tell them everything.

818
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,150
Wait and see what happens next.

819
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:24,569
Don't you dare hurt the kids.

820
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,170
- Don't you dare.
- I have no other choice.

821
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:29,299
I'm going to tell them.

822
00:50:31,239 --> 00:50:32,469
Not the kids.

823
00:50:32,869 --> 00:50:34,139
Don't you dare.

824
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:36,138
I will.

825
00:50:36,139 --> 00:50:37,310
No.

826
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,080
No.

827
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,279
No!

828
00:51:04,409 --> 00:51:06,638
If Mom and Dad get divorced,

829
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:07,880
what will you do?

830
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:09,710
Are Mom and Dad getting a divorce?

831
00:51:09,909 --> 00:51:11,249
Don't you know the
meaning of the word "if?"

832
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:12,409
I don't even talk about it.

833
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:14,080
I'm disappointed in Dad.

834
00:51:14,219 --> 00:51:16,819
Even if all men were like that,
I thought Dad would be different.

835
00:51:17,219 --> 00:51:18,589
All men are the same.

836
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,119
Don't speak too soon.

837
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,089
If Dad really did that, he
must've had his reasons.

838
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:26,829
You know that he was forced to get
married because of Grandpa, right?

839
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:27,928
So what?

840
00:51:27,929 --> 00:51:30,246
Shouldn't he take responsibility
if he even had kids with Mom?

841
00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:32,169
Did Dad ever say he wouldn't
take responsibility?

842
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:35,400
I just mean that we should prepare
ourselves in case something happens.

843
00:51:36,069 --> 00:51:37,170
Who would you...

844
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:38,639
choose to live with?

845
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:40,479
I'll choose Mom. What about you?

846
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,109
- Dad.
- Traitor.

847
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:44,670
I'm sure Grandpa will kick him
out in nothing but his underwear.

848
00:51:45,409 --> 00:51:47,149
I should go with Dad, at least.

849
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:48,279
I don't like it.

850
00:51:48,549 --> 00:51:50,489
I don't want Mom and Dad to get divorced.

851
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:51,919
You should try to stop them.

852
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,759
Kids always whisper and bully
you if your parents are divorced.

853
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,560
I don't want that.

854
00:51:56,889 --> 00:51:58,860
I'll give them a piece of my mind!

855
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,830
As if you could. I'll just tell Grandpa.

856
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,940
Do you think telling Grandpa
will solve everything?

857
00:52:26,549 --> 00:52:27,589
What?

858
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:31,429
You don't even love Mr. Ji.

859
00:52:32,929 --> 00:52:34,630
Just let him come to me.

860
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,929
Mr. Ji is a coward and
won't be able to say it.

861
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,529
Please, Ms. Ko.

862
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,100
I know you are young,

863
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,908
but you really are impossible.

864
00:52:43,909 --> 00:52:46,190
Do you think that's something
you should be saying to me?

865
00:52:47,279 --> 00:52:48,439
I'm sorry.

866
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,409
I came to see you because
I had no other choice.

867
00:52:52,009 --> 00:52:53,919
I lost 3kg within a week.

868
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,678
If you lost 3kg,

869
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,389
how much weight do you think I lost?

870
00:53:00,489 --> 00:53:02,819
You can live without Mr. Ji,

871
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:06,830
but I can't live without him.

872
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:14,000
This is the first time for me.

873
00:53:15,139 --> 00:53:17,069
Mr. Ji said it was for him too.

874
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:20,339
Do you believe that?

875
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,678
A man in his 50s...

876
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:24,508
with two kids...

877
00:53:24,509 --> 00:53:26,548
just met his first love.
Does that make any sense?

878
00:53:26,549 --> 00:53:27,719
I believe him.

879
00:53:27,819 --> 00:53:30,150
Since you don't trust him at all,

880
00:53:30,619 --> 00:53:32,049
he must've been so lonely.

881
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,920
Please let him go.

882
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,159
Where do you live?

883
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:38,860
Your parents are there, right?

884
00:53:38,889 --> 00:53:40,459
Do your parents know that
you're acting like this?

885
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,529
They don't.

886
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:43,429
But I don't care if they do.

887
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,568
Please let me have Mr. Ji.

888
00:53:45,569 --> 00:53:46,969
I think I might die.

889
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:49,670
I don't care whether you live or die.

890
00:53:50,409 --> 00:53:52,110
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

891
00:53:52,369 --> 00:53:53,880
That's all I have to say.

892
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:57,380
Wait, Ms. Ko.

893
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,310
I have something to show you.

894
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:19,299
- Was it fun?
- Yes.

895
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:38,750
Our dad's name is...

896
00:54:39,219 --> 00:54:40,818
Ji Nam Chul.

897
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:42,258
You know who we are, don't you?

898
00:54:42,259 --> 00:54:43,630
You're the adulterer lady, right?

899
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:48,298
You must be Chun and Woon.

900
00:54:48,299 --> 00:54:49,860
Let's go somewhere and talk.

901
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,330
There's no need to go anywhere.

902
00:54:52,429 --> 00:54:53,670
Why did you meet our mom?

903
00:54:54,369 --> 00:54:55,939
It was just a conversation between adults.

904
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:58,509
Adult, my foot. You're not
even that much older than me.

905
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:00,008
Why did you date my dad?

906
00:55:00,009 --> 00:55:01,138
To take money from him?

907
00:55:01,139 --> 00:55:03,209
- My dad doesn't have anything.
- It's not like that.

908
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:05,350
There's no way you'd like
an old man like my dad!

909
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:07,570
Don't you dare make things hard for my mom.

910
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:09,179
I won't let it slide.

911
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:11,989
I'm sorry.

912
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,919
I didn't want to give you guys a hard time.

913
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,259
Let me just ask you one thing.

914
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,190
Can you take responsibility for our dad?

915
00:55:18,889 --> 00:55:21,060
Why are you asking her that?
She's an adulterer!

916
00:55:21,429 --> 00:55:23,229
Have you ever thought about whether
you could take care of him...

917
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:24,798
when he got old and frail?

918
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,399
Why would an adulterer take responsibility?

919
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,940
Dad has us and Mom.

920
00:55:28,739 --> 00:55:31,610
Look, adulterer lady.
Don't come near our dad.

921
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:33,778
If you come to see our mom or
give our dad a hard time again,

922
00:55:33,779 --> 00:55:34,810
I won't let it slide.

923
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:37,110
All the bullies at my
school are my friends.

924
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:39,079
You know what that means, right? Let's go.

925
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,980
Even if Dad gets divorced,
he won't be alone.

926
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:42,618
He'll be bringing us with him.

927
00:55:42,619 --> 00:55:43,649
We're a package deal.

928
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:45,520
Why are you saying that to an adulterer?

929
00:55:45,889 --> 00:55:46,989
Bye.

930
00:55:47,619 --> 00:55:48,658
Bye.

931
00:55:48,659 --> 00:55:50,230
Don't bow to her, you idiot.

932
00:56:05,339 --> 00:56:06,509
An adulterer.

933
00:56:33,869 --> 00:56:35,040
How could you do this to me?

934
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,509
Do I look like a pushover to you?

935
00:56:38,509 --> 00:56:39,568
Do you think you can stomp all over me...

936
00:56:39,569 --> 00:56:40,889
because I let you have an affair?

937
00:56:41,409 --> 00:56:43,110
I slapped you for the first time.

938
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:45,008
I held myself back so that I
might hold onto your love...

939
00:56:45,009 --> 00:56:46,179
in any way.

940
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:48,448
Did you like her so much?

941
00:56:48,449 --> 00:56:49,849
She had followed you to the camping site,

942
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:51,410
and you comforted her and clung to her.

943
00:56:51,619 --> 00:56:52,979
You even gave her 100,000 dollars.

944
00:56:53,549 --> 00:56:55,709
But you even danced in front
of her in your underwear?

945
00:56:56,190 --> 00:56:57,629
That's why she can't tell
what's right from wrong...

946
00:56:57,630 --> 00:56:59,089
and came to ask me to let you go.

947
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:00,258
You agreed to move out...

948
00:57:00,259 --> 00:57:01,658
just so you could get away
from my dad's prying eyes...

949
00:57:01,659 --> 00:57:03,330
and see her whenever you wanted, right?

950
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:08,199
A stupid wife like me would never notice.

951
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,540
I can't even eat or sleep.

952
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:12,970
When I open my eyes, all I
see is my hair turning gray.

953
00:57:13,069 --> 00:57:14,210
Your first love?

954
00:57:15,110 --> 00:57:16,670
You said that girl was your first love.

955
00:57:19,549 --> 00:57:20,880
You won't even deny it.

956
00:57:22,679 --> 00:57:24,650
How great is your love...

957
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:26,650
that you're making me feel this pathetic?

958
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:28,920
What did I do so wrong?

959
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:30,459
Do you think I'm a joke
because I'm not going crazy...

960
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:31,460
and asking for a divorce?

961
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,230
How much do you need to crush me?

962
00:57:35,529 --> 00:57:37,049
If you love her so much, then just go.

963
00:57:38,299 --> 00:57:40,000
Go and live with that wench!

964
00:58:05,589 --> 00:58:06,629
Mr. Ji.

965
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:08,000
Don't come to see my wife.

966
00:58:09,029 --> 00:58:10,699
You can do whatever you want to me,

967
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:13,000
but don't go near my wife.

968
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,600
I'll pay for my sins.

969
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:17,339
I beg you.

970
00:58:19,409 --> 00:58:20,580
Mr. Ji.

971
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,639
What brings you here?

972
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:24,440
I missed you.

973
00:59:25,739 --> 00:59:27,580
I thought I should see you at least once.

974
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,210
I'll hire your taxi for the whole day.

975
01:00:35,610 --> 01:00:37,150
If I had known you'd cry like this,

976
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,480
I would've ordered something with broth.

977
01:00:45,389 --> 01:00:47,119
I never thought you'd come to see me.

978
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,690
I don't know what to say first.

979
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:53,730
It feels like a dream to
be sitting across from you.

980
01:00:56,529 --> 01:00:57,999
How long have you been driving a taxi?

981
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,330
It's been a few years.

982
01:01:00,369 --> 01:01:01,568
Did you move?

983
01:01:01,569 --> 01:01:03,440
Your old house was in Cheongdam-dong.

984
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,009
When I got married,

985
01:01:05,639 --> 01:01:07,810
we built a new house and
moved to Bangbae-dong.

986
01:01:10,139 --> 01:01:11,549
How many years has it been for us?

987
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,560
This is the first time we've met
since you got married, right?

988
01:01:14,779 --> 01:01:15,880
No.

989
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:17,790
We met once.

990
01:01:18,449 --> 01:01:20,089
About 12 years ago.

991
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:25,690
Oh, right. I remember too.

992
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:28,330
I drank so much that day.

993
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,069
I've gotten...

994
01:01:36,969 --> 01:01:38,440
very old, haven't I?

995
01:01:42,779 --> 01:01:44,380
Don't look at me like that.

996
01:01:45,179 --> 01:01:46,779
I'm embarrassed that I've gotten so old.

997
01:01:47,179 --> 01:01:48,420
"You haven't aged a bit."

998
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:50,520
"You're still the same."

999
01:01:51,449 --> 01:01:53,150
I can't say that, in all honesty.

1000
01:01:55,159 --> 01:01:57,020
It's only natural to age as we get older.

1001
01:01:57,529 --> 01:01:58,860
I've gotten old too.

1002
01:01:58,929 --> 01:02:00,130
It's been so long.

1003
01:02:01,830 --> 01:02:03,130
You're still exactly the same.

1004
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:06,369
You too.

1005
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:26,190
Do you know...

1006
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:28,690
how much I've missed this face?

1007
01:02:30,159 --> 01:02:31,360
I missed you too.

1008
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:33,830
The days I spent with you...

1009
01:02:34,029 --> 01:02:35,600
were the highlight of my life.

1010
01:02:36,699 --> 01:02:39,270
I laughed the most and
felt the happiest then.

1011
01:02:39,429 --> 01:02:41,000
I thought I had forgotten.

1012
01:02:42,339 --> 01:02:43,900
I thought it was all in the past.

1013
01:02:45,739 --> 01:02:47,009
But now that I've met you,

1014
01:02:50,009 --> 01:02:51,279
I haven't forgotten any of it.

1015
01:02:51,679 --> 01:02:52,810
Me either.

1016
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,420
Thank you for being alive, Dae Geun.

1017
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,369
What's going on?

1018
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:18,039
I can't tell you.

1019
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:19,368
Can't you even tell your own son?

1020
01:03:19,369 --> 01:03:21,040
You're a blabbermouth.

1021
01:03:22,779 --> 01:03:24,109
I won't tell anyone.

1022
01:03:24,110 --> 01:03:26,908
If your dad finds out, I'll get kicked out.

1023
01:03:26,909 --> 01:03:28,520
I really won't tell anyone.

1024
01:03:37,259 --> 01:03:38,389
The thing is,

1025
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:41,730
I lent Ba Da some money.

1026
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:43,230
You did?

1027
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:45,868
- How much?
- She said...

1028
01:03:45,869 --> 01:03:47,569
I should invest in her business...

1029
01:03:47,869 --> 01:03:49,540
and that she'd pay me plenty of interest.

1030
01:03:49,869 --> 01:03:50,968
We weren't even close,

1031
01:03:50,969 --> 01:03:52,449
but she made an effort to get closer.

1032
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:55,040
She sweet-talked me into
lending her the money.

1033
01:03:55,110 --> 01:03:57,179
I gave her all the money I had.

1034
01:03:58,210 --> 01:03:59,949
I couldn't even tell anyone about it.

1035
01:04:00,549 --> 01:04:02,229
I feel like I might fall ill at this rate.

1036
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:04,749
My dad earned that money...

1037
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:06,590
working himself to the
bone as a taffy vendor.

1038
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:08,460
I had kept it to myself,

1039
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:11,759
so I gave her the money
without your dad's knowledge.

1040
01:04:14,029 --> 01:04:15,130
Goodness, my money.

1041
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:18,199
Goodness, my money.

1042
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:22,040
Shin Ki Han lent her the money.

1043
01:04:35,949 --> 01:04:38,309
You should eat this at least.
I bought some gimbap for you.

1044
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:39,865
I bought enough to share with everyone.

1045
01:04:39,889 --> 01:04:40,919
Thank you.

1046
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,536
I'm in the middle of a
meeting with the lawyer.

1047
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:45,080
We decided to take legal action
with the home shopping network.

1048
01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:50,900
Hello?

1049
01:04:52,469 --> 01:04:53,529
Really?

1050
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,569
Okay. I'll be right there.

1051
01:04:58,239 --> 01:04:59,270
Eun Kang.

1052
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:05,110
My mom woke up.

1053
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:11,619
She's doing much better
and is out of the ICU now.

1054
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:13,319
But what do I do?

1055
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:15,719
My meeting isn't over yet.

1056
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:18,029
I'll go see her first.

1057
01:05:56,029 --> 01:05:57,100
Mother.

1058
01:05:57,929 --> 01:05:59,000
You're here.

1059
01:05:59,469 --> 01:06:00,529
Where is Ba Da?

1060
01:06:01,339 --> 01:06:03,969
She'll be here. She had an urgent meeting.

1061
01:06:04,639 --> 01:06:05,869
Are you okay?

1062
01:06:06,969 --> 01:06:08,009
Yes.

1063
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,210
I must've fainted.

1064
01:06:11,279 --> 01:06:12,310
Yes.

1065
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:14,619
You were unconscious for a few days.

1066
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:16,119
I heard from the nurse.

1067
01:06:17,589 --> 01:06:20,860
Then do you know why you fainted?

1068
01:06:23,989 --> 01:06:25,060
That is...

1069
01:06:27,799 --> 01:06:29,029
Do you remember?

1070
01:06:29,299 --> 01:06:30,400
I...

1071
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:38,310
can't remember.

1072
01:06:40,239 --> 01:06:42,480
Do you really not remember anything?

1073
01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:44,179
No.

1074
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:46,750
Try to remember.

1075
01:06:49,719 --> 01:06:51,250
I had a stomachache,

1076
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:54,719
so I was thinking I'd go
buy some digestive medicine.

1077
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:56,419
What about after that?

1078
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:57,630
After that,

1079
01:06:59,929 --> 01:07:01,400
did I shake off the blankets?

1080
01:07:01,929 --> 01:07:03,000
What else?

1081
01:07:06,429 --> 01:07:08,940
I don't know. I can't remember.

1082
01:07:13,009 --> 01:07:15,678
The IV drip is done. Please
ask them to take it out.

1083
01:07:15,679 --> 01:07:16,739
Okay, Mother.

1084
01:07:17,139 --> 01:07:19,179
Ba Da will be here right
after her meeting is over.

1085
01:07:34,929 --> 01:07:37,299
Yes, I'll be right there.

1086
01:07:37,829 --> 01:07:39,200
Read it and take notes.

1087
01:07:39,799 --> 01:07:40,870
Okay.

1088
01:07:41,639 --> 01:07:42,770
Eun Kang, how is Mom?

1089
01:07:43,070 --> 01:07:44,509
She just fell asleep.

1090
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:47,310
She remembers that day and seems fine.

1091
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:48,910
What a relief.

1092
01:07:49,179 --> 01:07:50,508
When you watch dramas on TV,

1093
01:07:50,509 --> 01:07:52,549
people often get amnesia
and stuff like that.

1094
01:07:52,850 --> 01:07:54,320
I was so scared.

1095
01:07:54,350 --> 01:07:55,479
Did the meeting go well?

1096
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:58,048
Yes, we'll get Interpol to
help us catch the culprit.

1097
01:07:58,049 --> 01:08:00,320
This isn't the first time
that CEO committed fraud.

1098
01:08:00,850 --> 01:08:02,459
Right. I'm sure it'll go well.

1099
01:08:02,789 --> 01:08:04,229
I'll be going. I have to go to work.

1100
01:08:04,329 --> 01:08:05,429
Okay, thanks.

1101
01:08:22,139 --> 01:08:23,310
Mom, are you awake?

1102
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:25,979
Where is Eun Kang?

1103
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:27,950
Eun Kang just left. Should I call her?

1104
01:08:28,379 --> 01:08:29,450
No.

1105
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,788
I pretended to fall asleep
on purpose because of her.

1106
01:08:33,789 --> 01:08:35,689
Why? Is something wrong?

1107
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:37,959
Ba Da. You believe me, right?

1108
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:41,060
Whatever I say, you'll
believe me, won't you?

1109
01:08:41,929 --> 01:08:43,299
Of course.

1110
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:46,229
Mom, why are you shaking? What is it?
Should I get the doctor?

1111
01:08:46,230 --> 01:08:47,370
No.

1112
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:49,570
I saw it.

1113
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:52,740
I saw it with my own eyes.

1114
01:08:53,539 --> 01:08:55,579
What? What did you see?

1115
01:08:56,079 --> 01:08:57,509
They were hugging and kissing.

1116
01:08:58,650 --> 01:09:00,370
In the playground of our apartment complex.

1117
01:09:00,810 --> 01:09:01,850
Who?

1118
01:09:05,389 --> 01:09:07,120
- No way...
- It's true.

1119
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:09,690
Cha Won and Eun Kang.

1120
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:11,629
I saw them with my own eyes.

1121
01:09:11,789 --> 01:09:14,429
I was confronting them about it
when my breath caught in my chest.

1122
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,259
And after that, I can't remember.

1123
01:09:18,499 --> 01:09:21,270
Just now, I told Eun Kang that
I didn't remember anything.

1124
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:23,400
She scares me.

1125
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:25,310
I feel like she might do anything.

1126
01:09:25,539 --> 01:09:27,009
How can she be so brazen?

1127
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:30,579
I won't leave those two alone.

1128
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:33,079
You stay out of it.

1129
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:34,919
As soon as I get better,

1130
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:36,520
I'll take care of those two.

1131
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:38,690
They deserve to be punished.

1132
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,270
Please call for a caretaker.

1133
01:09:57,940 --> 01:09:59,039
Right now.

1134
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:15,889
I've been waiting for your call.

1135
01:10:16,919 --> 01:10:18,660
Let me ask you directly.

1136
01:10:19,429 --> 01:10:20,629
You told me...

1137
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:23,030
not to trust the people closest to me.

1138
01:10:23,429 --> 01:10:25,200
That Eun Kang was a scary person.

1139
01:10:26,429 --> 01:10:27,600
What did you mean by that?

1140
01:10:31,669 --> 01:10:32,810
Did something happen?

1141
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:35,110
Answer me.

1142
01:10:35,810 --> 01:10:36,839
Did that have...

1143
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:40,049
something to do with Cha Won?

1144
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:42,150
You finally caught on.

1145
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:44,180
You're usually quick with other things.

1146
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,650
Tell me everything you know.

1147
01:10:49,259 --> 01:10:50,719
It's as you already know.

1148
01:10:51,929 --> 01:10:54,609
The fact that you came to see me
must mean you found something out.

1149
01:10:57,459 --> 01:10:58,570
I can tell.

1150
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:03,570
Maybe you weren't confident
enough to face the truth.

1151
01:11:04,339 --> 01:11:07,138
You have a hunch, but you're
afraid of confirming it.

1152
01:11:07,139 --> 01:11:09,009
So you keep pushing it off.

1153
01:11:09,709 --> 01:11:11,209
I was like that too, at first.

1154
01:11:13,209 --> 01:11:15,150
I don't know about how Ko Cha Won feels,

1155
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:18,320
but I do know about how Cho
Eun Kang feels, for sure.

1156
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:21,560
I don't know how far those two have gotten,

1157
01:11:22,219 --> 01:11:24,539
but in their hearts, they
probably already did everything.

1158
01:11:24,789 --> 01:11:25,990
Cho Eun Kang is...

1159
01:11:26,329 --> 01:11:29,459
a lot more meticulous than you think...

1160
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:31,299
and skilled at telling lies.

1161
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:32,649
She could do just about anything.

1162
01:11:33,169 --> 01:11:35,270
You saw how she caused
a scene at my wedding.

1163
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,400
Who would've imagined
she'd do such a thing?

1164
01:11:43,039 --> 01:11:45,749
Before you get foolproof evidence
and confront her with it,

1165
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:47,379
she would never admit it.

1166
01:11:52,089 --> 01:11:53,120
You don't...

1167
01:11:53,950 --> 01:11:56,219
still think of her as your friend, do you?
