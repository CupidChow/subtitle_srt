Sure, Mi Poong. I'll be right there.

(Cho Eun Kang)

00:02:05,769 --> 00:02:07,078
I'm heading home.

00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,638
I'll be back early tomorrow morning.

10
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,999
After breakfast, let's take Mi
Poong to the amusement park.

11
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,019
I'm home.

12
00:02:52,649 --> 00:02:53,660
You weren't sleeping?

13
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,889
I couldn't sleep.

14
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:59,559
Did it go well with Mr. Jin?

15
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,399
Yes, he promised to be more watchful.

16
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,609
Have you perhaps...

17
00:03:11,369 --> 00:03:13,380
taken my RV out to go somewhere?

18
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,010
Sorry?

19
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,950
Gosh, of course not.

20
00:03:19,179 --> 00:03:21,649
I wouldn't dare to drive
around your favorite vehicle.

21
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,149
What is this about?

22
00:03:26,619 --> 00:03:27,920
I just asked.

23
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,859
I see.

24
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,089
Good night, Father.

25
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Sure.

26
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,030
I didn't grab much for you, sweetie.

27
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,928
Did your mother go to the restroom?

28
00:04:09,929 --> 00:04:10,970
Yes.

29
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,699
And stop calling me "sweetie."

30
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,669
What happened last night was a mistake.

31
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,809
Let's not make too much of
what happened while drunk.

32
00:04:19,369 --> 00:04:21,079
We're friends, right?

33
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,710
You always need to draw
a line to feel at ease.

34
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:26,679
I've always called you sweetie,
so what's the big deal?

35
00:04:27,549 --> 00:04:30,449
- You're adorable.
- I told you not to cross the line.

36
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,389
You only got me what I like.
How sweet of you.

37
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,389
Mother, how does this sound for today?

38
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,758
After breakfast, we'll drive up Mt.
Seorak...

39
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,329
and have mulgomtang for lunch.
What do you say?

40
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,230
Mulgomtang sounds great.

41
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:47,139
It's especially good
around this time of year.

42
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,470
We'll run Sokcho dry of all its mulgomtang.

43
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,580
Sure.

44
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,770
- Let me take a photo for you.
- Sure.

45
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:18,629
Here we go.

46
00:05:18,929 --> 00:05:20,798
Stand closer to each other. Here we go.

47
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:22,999
In 1, 2, 3.

48
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:26,710
Mi Poong, would you like a headband?

49
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:31,049
- How about this one?
- Auntie, you're the best.

50
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:34,619
There. Should I also get one?

51
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,420
- You too, Dad.
- Should I?

52
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,659
Mi Poong, why don't we have ice cream?

53
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,529
Yes! I want chocolate ice cream.

54
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,559
Chocolate?

55
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,770
- One chocolate ice cream, please.
- Sure.

56
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:15,689
You like balloons.

57
00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:37,879
Did you see the sign in the front?

58
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:40,649
We're offering instant photos for families.

59
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,720
Should I take one for you?

60
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:43,619
Sure.

61
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:48,759
All right.

62
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,530
Your daughter is pretty just like her mom.

63
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,759
Actually, I look like my mom.

64
00:06:55,429 --> 00:06:56,460
Gosh.

65
00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:00,499
- Say, "kimchi."
- Kimchi!

66
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,568
An amusement park?

67
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:09,640
Mi Poong wanted to come,
so Cha Won brought us.

68
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,519
She's loving it.

69
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,678
That's great.

70
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:16,520
It's been a while since we took her to one.

71
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,119
Maybe you should be her mom.
Thanks, Eun Kang.

72
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,359
Sure.

73
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:24,449
The three of them went
to an amusement park?

74
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,758
I thought your in-laws
were babysitting today.

75
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:30,100
Well, I didn't tell them
that we went on a trip.

76
00:07:30,369 --> 00:07:31,399
Don't worry.

77
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,729
Eun Kang's even better
than me at the mom stuff.

78
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,670
That's not the issue.

79
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:36,938
Must you be this frustrating?
Let's head back.

80
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:37,970
Listen, Mom.

81
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:39,608
I get you're a little paranoid...

82
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:41,689
because of what happened
with dad and his assistant,

83
00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:45,548
but do you think I'm one to
lose my husband to a friend?

84
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,519
You think too less of me at times.

85
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,419
How do I lack compared to Eun Kang?

86
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,048
From head to toe, I'm clearly better.

87
00:07:51,049 --> 00:07:53,449
Wives not being good enough
isn't why husbands have affairs.

88
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,688
Things happen when a man and a
woman spend a lot of time together.

89
00:07:56,689 --> 00:07:59,160
It's wiser not to give them
the opportunity to be friends.

90
00:07:59,429 --> 00:08:01,659
Eun Kang would never do that to me.

91
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,530
Not after all that I have done for her.

92
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:05,229
Let's at least enjoy the mulgomtang.

93
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,968
I just can't get through to you.

94
00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:08,938
Have it yourself. I'm heading back home.

95
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:10,309
- But...
- Mother!

96
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:14,640
A table cleared up for us.

97
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:17,348
It's packed with customers. Shall we?

98
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:20,010
I'm afraid I can't stay for it.
I'm heading back home.

99
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,849
- Why?
- You're always so stubborn.

100
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:24,890
Can you drop us off at the resort?

101
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:30,789
One might think that they're married,

102
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,490
and we're the hired help.

103
00:08:33,189 --> 00:08:35,399
Why don't you fold the laundry?
I'll clean the floor.

104
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,799
Folding things always gives me a headache.

105
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:41,000
I don't like her.

106
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,500
For some reason, she rubs me the wrong way.

107
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,740
Hurry up with that, or I'll
take your credit cards.

108
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:49,380
I'm doing it.

109
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:56,948
Chairman Ko, trust my word on this
and look into your son-in-law.

110
00:08:56,949 --> 00:08:58,619
If nothing comes up, then so be it.

111
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,559
It's like medical checkups at the hospital.

112
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,559
You're reassured when it comes back clean.

113
00:09:04,429 --> 00:09:05,790
Your daughter...

114
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,129
takes after you and not her mother...

115
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,968
and is too kind for her own good.

116
00:09:10,969 --> 00:09:14,240
You must nip the bud for
your daughter's sake.

117
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:17,838
Just remember that you can't
accuse him before you have proof.

118
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,539
Like softshell turtles, cheaters
will suck their heads in...

119
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,838
and will never stick them out again.

120
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,849
I once got ahead of myself
and lost out on my chance.

121
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:26,578
Some minx probably waggled her tail at him.

122
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:28,579
If only I could make her answer to me.

123
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:31,119
Your son-in-law seems gullible enough...

124
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,920
to have fallen for her tricks.

125
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:36,619
There's one thing I
have learned in my life.

126
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,959
People are as they seem.

127
00:09:39,189 --> 00:09:41,000
That is the hard and fast rule.

128
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,728
What are you two whispering about?

129
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:45,529
Gosh, it's nothing.

130
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,670
You're better off not knowing.

131
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:58,679
When feeling lonely, one
should snack on buns.

132
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,179
My gosh. We're out of buns.

133
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,750
Did you eat them?

134
00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:05,890
I haven't even been in that cupboard.

135
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,059
I bet Nam Chul ate all the buns.

136
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,990
He hasn't been snacking lately.

137
00:10:11,189 --> 00:10:12,659
We haven't bought buns in a while.

138
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,860
How juvenile of you to ask
for buns when you just ate.

139
00:10:17,229 --> 00:10:20,468
Ms. Yang, I bet you're not liked by people.

140
00:10:20,469 --> 00:10:23,269
Why must I be liked by people at this age?
Unbelievable.

141
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,708
You... How should I put it?

142
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:28,140
Good karma leaves you the more you talk.

143
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:30,548
There's just something about you...

144
00:10:30,549 --> 00:10:32,250
that rubs me the wrong way.

145
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:35,139
How can good karma leave me when
I've never been that fortunate?

146
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:36,650
Besides, you're one to talk.

147
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,249
Why would you be lonely
enough to crave buns...

148
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,319
when you live in a mansion?

149
00:10:41,189 --> 00:10:43,290
Ms. Yang, I can hear you.

150
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:45,959
Did you hear what I said?

151
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:48,899
You just had to have good ears.

152
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,569
I said I could hear you.

153
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,670
Right.

154
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,308
But sir, you always take the back seat.

155
00:11:05,309 --> 00:11:07,189
Why don't you sit more
comfortably in the back?

156
00:11:07,219 --> 00:11:09,520
I have my reasons. Get going, will you?

157
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,448
Where to, sir?

158
00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:13,019
I need to know what someone is up to.

159
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,419
Are you suggesting that we tail someone?

160
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,459

I have no idea how you view me,

an illegal act before.

That was me up until yesterday.

will change my ways for you.

Sure.

By the way, Eun San.

Don't get me wrong...

but don't stir up his life.

178
00:12:17,049 --> 00:12:18,390
Don't play games with him.

179
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:20,189
He's not that kind of person...

180

You need to drive properly.

Right.

185

He wouldn't even recognize me.

186

I've always felt this way about you,

187

but you're a man who never lets
anything fall through the cracks.

People are mostly tailed

Could he be your wife's boyfriend?

I guess not.

191

Do you have money to collect from him?

192

Stop asking me questions and look ahead.

Got it, sir.

He's not stopping. What should I do?

195
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:33,160
You'll stay on his tail, of course.

Gosh, I'm lonely.

Don't get too close.

My gosh. My head almost got bashed in.

I did advise you to take the back seat.

You lost him. Why didn't you step on it?

Not when there's a crosswalk.

That's just wrong.

You paid me to follow him,

not catch him doing whatever
you suspected him of.

You should go.

324
00:23:39,769 --> 00:23:42,170
Sure. Get home safely, then.

325
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,140
Is that it?

326
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:48,910
People will see us.

327
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,709
But no one's around.

328
00:23:51,749 --> 00:23:53,110
You coward.

329
00:24:04,989 --> 00:24:06,360
Watch your step!

330
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:07,999
I was messing with you.

331
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:09,360
Get going already.

332
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,670
Eun San.

333
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:26,410
I love you.

334
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,380
You're mine.

335
00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:19,660
I'm telling you I can't hear you!

336
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,719
I came home early.

337
00:26:44,219 --> 00:26:47,090
Yes. It's fine. Bye.

338
00:26:50,459 --> 00:26:51,739
Did you go to an amusement park?

339
00:26:51,989 --> 00:26:53,029
What?

340
00:26:55,499 --> 00:26:57,100
I went with my friend's daughter.

341
00:26:57,999 --> 00:27:00,429
You should go meet somebody
when it's snowing out...

342
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,745
instead of going around
with your friend's daughter.

343
00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:03,938
Like who?

344
00:27:03,939 --> 00:27:05,539
You should go on blind dates.

345
00:27:06,269 --> 00:27:08,109
I'm sure only divorced men
with kids will come out.

346
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,779
- What are you saying?
- It's the truth.

347
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:11,850
That's my reality.

348
00:27:12,509 --> 00:27:14,350
People meet their dates on apps these days.

349
00:27:14,449 --> 00:27:16,149
I don't really like that.

350
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:18,689
Right? You should meet someone in person.

351
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,459
Hey, Eun Kang.

352
00:27:21,689 --> 00:27:24,218
Even if you like someone, don't
confess your feelings first.

353
00:27:24,219 --> 00:27:27,590
Just create the atmosphere
for him to confess first.

354
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:30,198
Give him the hint you
are going to accept him.

355
00:27:30,199 --> 00:27:31,519
Are you telling me to just flirt?

356
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:36,239
You need skills and effort to love.

357
00:27:36,469 --> 00:27:40,039
Men have something called
a hunting instinct.

358
00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:42,208
They'll last long with a
woman they've invested time,

359
00:27:42,209 --> 00:27:43,879
money, and effort on.

360
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,879
If the target is handed over to them,

361
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,208
they might think they're lucky...

362
00:27:47,209 --> 00:27:48,879
for getting you without
putting in the effort.

363
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,550
But that won't last long...

364
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,590
because it's not the result
of their hard efforts.

365
00:27:54,219 --> 00:27:56,060
Strangely, it's like that for men.

366
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,958
Make him confess to you first,

367
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:01,799
then start to be nice
to him little by little.

368
00:28:02,499 --> 00:28:04,330
Then he'll go head over heels for you.

369
00:28:04,699 --> 00:28:07,829
Conclusion. Men will move
according to women's signals.

370
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:11,640
Women will move according
to men's confessions.

371
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:14,268
You should write a book.

372
00:28:14,269 --> 00:28:15,340
I'm thinking about it.

373
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:23,749
Eun Kang. In my opinion,

374
00:28:26,219 --> 00:28:28,090
you'll meet a good person...

375
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:31,320
- because you're nice.
- Am I...

376
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:34,660
- nice?
- You're good-natured.

377
00:28:35,429 --> 00:28:37,459
Guys love girls like you.

378
00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:40,029
I'm not so good-natured.

379
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:44,239
People think I am...

380
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,279
and believe I have no thoughts,
desires, or ambitions.

381
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,979
For their convenience,

382
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:55,219
to look down on me and to use me,

383
00:28:56,449 --> 00:28:59,350
they call me nice...

384
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,689
and trap me in a box.

385
00:29:03,989 --> 00:29:05,309
I don't want people to tell me...

386
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,560
I'm nice anymore.

387
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:21,509
This dish would be great.
And water parsley pancakes?

388
00:29:22,009 --> 00:29:23,080
What are you doing?

389
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,960
I'm thinking about the side
dishes to cook for them.

390
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,448
I should change up the
menu since they're wealthy.

391
00:29:29,449 --> 00:29:31,688
How did it go? It's not a
bad place to work, right?

392
00:29:31,689 --> 00:29:34,650
I went there yesterday and today.
It looks okay.

393
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:38,229
As you said, the old man is very stubborn.

394
00:29:38,289 --> 00:29:40,630
But I can easily soften him up.

395
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:43,258
It's easier to handle people like him.

396
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:44,660
He's as clear as day.

397
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,528
It's difficult when you
can't read the other person.

398
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:48,739
- Someone like you.
- Why are you bringing me up?

399
00:29:49,999 --> 00:29:52,139
Am I hard to read?

400
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,939
I gave birth to you, but I
still can't understand you.

401
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,478
Did you memorize everything right?

402
00:29:57,479 --> 00:30:00,149
I found the bucket and the
rice container right away,

403
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,249
and they were surprised.

404
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:04,580
I like the daughter too. She's nice.

405
00:30:04,749 --> 00:30:06,689
But I don't like the wife.

406
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,459
Whose house is it?

407
00:30:08,689 --> 00:30:09,959
Just someone I work for.

408
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:12,528
Right. I think their
son-in-law is having an affair.

409
00:30:12,529 --> 00:30:14,129
How do you know that? With whom?

410
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,399
It must be a woman.

411
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,468
It says on his face that
he's having an affair,

412
00:30:18,469 --> 00:30:20,198
but no one notices.

413
00:30:20,199 --> 00:30:21,199
Dae Geun!

414
00:30:22,969 --> 00:30:25,370
Let's just say I'm taking
classes at a cultural center.

415
00:30:32,779 --> 00:30:35,120
Why didn't you stay there longer?
A day is too short.

416
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,919
Where did you go?

417
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,949
We went to Mt. Seorak, the
beach, and a seafood restaurant.

418
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,370
Thank you for the trip, Cha Won.

419
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,258
What kind of fish did you have?

420
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:45,829
I heard it was wild raw fish,
but we didn't really know.

421
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,560
We just went where Ki Han took us.

422
00:30:48,189 --> 00:30:50,629
The restaurant owner
was so happy to see him.

423
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,070
It must be because he's a regular...

424
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:54,269
"Ki Han?"

425
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:58,409
Your middle school friend Shin Ki Han?
Did you go together?

426
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:00,468
No, not together.

427
00:31:00,469 --> 00:31:03,208
Didn't I tell you? We ran into
him at the resort by chance.

428
00:31:03,209 --> 00:31:04,809
"By chance?"
- Yes.

429
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:06,410
He goes to Sokcho often.

430
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:09,619
Let's go see your mother
at lunchtime tomorrow.

431
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,319
I've been feeling uncomfortable.

432
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,420
Good idea.

433
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,660
You should go to bed, Mom. It's late.

434
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,330
Right. I should go to bed.

435
00:31:23,499 --> 00:31:24,600
(Mock Test Collection)

436
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,650
Come out.

437
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,089
Are you up?

438
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,459
You should get dressed.

439
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:18,070
What is it?

440
00:34:19,939 --> 00:34:22,138
I made a mistake. I went
out in my underwear.

441
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:25,809
You should be more careful.
My mom must be shocked.

442
00:34:28,309 --> 00:34:29,749
I'm the one in shock.

443
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:34,189
You should pay more attention
when my mom is around.

444
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,530
Yesterday, two older women got in my taxi.

445
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:45,029
They said, "Sir, take
us to a nice nightclub."

446
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,998
They said it was perfect to
hook up since it was snowing.

447
00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:49,239
You should have taken them
to Watermelon Nightclub.

448
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,869
I did.

449
00:34:50,999 --> 00:34:52,868
How old were they?

450
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:54,908
- They were in their 50s.
- They're crazy.

451
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:57,339
They're not crazy. If you
go to nightclubs these days,

452
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:00,349
they're full of older
women in their 40s and 50s.

453
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,819
It's not just people in their
20s and 30s that go to clubs.

454
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,026
At non-alcoholic clubs, you see
people in their 60s and 70s.

455
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:08,248
Even the government ignores them,

456
00:35:08,249 --> 00:35:10,135
but their eyes are blazing
with the desire to hook up.

457
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:13,229
Maybe they're more aggressive
because their clocks are ticking.

458
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:15,328
Everyone's lonely, that's why.

459
00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:18,098
Stop talking nonsense. It's
not because they're lonely.

460
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:19,670
They just have an itch.

461
00:35:19,769 --> 00:35:21,729
You're so clueless.

462
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:24,069
If you're lonely at heart,
your body will be lonely.

463
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,138
And when your body is lonely,
your heart will be too.

464
00:35:26,139 --> 00:35:28,208
They go hand in hand. Right?

465
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,979
That's usually the case.

466
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,739
Don't you dare go to one.

467
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,379
I have no energy to go.

468
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,578
Right, I saw you yesterday waving
at someone leaving in a truck.

469
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:37,978
I was going to say hello but I didn't.

470
00:35:37,979 --> 00:35:39,590
That's my boss.

471
00:35:39,849 --> 00:35:41,225
He drove me home since it was snowing.

472
00:35:41,249 --> 00:35:44,459
What a nice boss. He even drove you home.

473
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,760
Ever since Eun San started working,

474
00:35:46,889 --> 00:35:49,029
she became cheerful and nicer.

475
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,658
She must be happy since
she's earning money.

476
00:35:50,659 --> 00:35:52,129
You're lasting long this time.

477
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,768
You normally quit before you hit a month.

478
00:35:53,769 --> 00:35:55,938
Be persistent and stay there.
Don't get any other ideas.

479
00:35:55,939 --> 00:35:57,869
Don't accept rides from everyone.

480
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,519
The doors are opening.

481
00:36:14,019 --> 00:36:15,189
Mom, please eat.

482
00:36:16,689 --> 00:36:18,119
Ba Da must be at her in-laws'.

483
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,430
Why did you go to an amusement park?

484
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:24,759
Because Mi Poong wanted to go.

485
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,760
Are you sure you didn't
lure her into going there?

486
00:36:26,829 --> 00:36:28,669
- Pardon?
- Even if she asked to go,

487
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,499
you can tell her to go
when her mom returns.

488
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,610
Why did you drag the kid there?

489
00:36:33,369 --> 00:36:34,689
Along with your friend's husband?

490
00:36:37,909 --> 00:36:41,680
Do you have a different
intention for Ba Da's husband?

491
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,220
How could you say that?

492
00:36:45,749 --> 00:36:47,049
I'm disappointed you would think that way.

493
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:49,558
Ba Da is too nice, so she might let it go.

494
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:50,619
But I'm not like her.

495
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,959
You'll get it if you're not careful.

496
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:56,459
People who have nothing to
lose are the least fearful.

497
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,269
This won't work.

498
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:03,300
Will you be okay without me from now on?

499
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:06,268
- What?
- You get to eat,

500
00:37:06,269 --> 00:37:08,539
bathe, and take your pills thanks to me.

501
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,380
I'm asking you if you don't need me.

502
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:13,549
- What?
- If you talk like that again,

503
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,680
I won't let it go.

504
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,340
I oversaw it since you were
sick, but I've had enough.

505
00:37:19,189 --> 00:37:21,519
I have nothing to lose anyway, right?

506
00:37:23,019 --> 00:37:24,490
Do you understand?

507
00:37:35,869 --> 00:37:38,340
Mom, Cha Won came with Ba Da.

508
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:41,169
They bought us Korean beef.
It's top-grade beef.

509
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:43,309
Tell her I won't eat it.

510
00:37:44,439 --> 00:37:46,079
Mother, I'm here.

511
00:37:46,479 --> 00:37:47,610
Father.

512
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,118
Why are you here?

513
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:51,518
How dare you?

514
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,749
Just wait.

515
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,688
I already cut my ties with them.

516
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,688
Get out right now! I don't want to see you!

517
00:37:56,689 --> 00:37:58,759
Mom, she's here to apologize.

518
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,630
I told you to leave.

519
00:38:00,729 --> 00:38:02,400
Should I call the police?

520
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:04,228
Do you think I won't do it?

521
00:38:04,229 --> 00:38:06,400
You should see exactly what it's like.

522
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:08,470
- Come on.
- What?

523
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,570
I won't talk long.

524
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,509
How could you call the police?

525
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,970
It should have never happened.

526
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:17,179
I'm sorry, Father.

527
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,680
Please forgive me, Mother.

528
00:38:19,409 --> 00:38:20,610
Starting now,

529
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:23,780
if something similar happens
again, I won't let it go.

530
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,078
Cha Won.

531
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:26,319
You need to be a good mediator.

532
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,450
It's all your fault!

533
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:31,720
I'm sorry, Father. I'll get it sorted out.

534
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:34,829
I was really shocked that day.
I was disappointed in you.

535
00:38:34,959 --> 00:38:38,030
I can't believe you called
the police to kick her out.

536
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:39,299
It's crazy enough to be on the news.

537
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,728
Not you too.

538
00:38:40,729 --> 00:38:42,339
It was more complicated than that.

539
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,799
Keep your mouth shut.

540
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,110
She treated your mother harshly.

541
00:38:46,209 --> 00:38:48,439
Do you still love her so dearly?

542
00:38:50,979 --> 00:38:53,680
Mother, I'm really sorry.

543
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,349
I apologize.

544
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:58,549
This ring will be
presented in my exhibition.

545
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,248
I made a separate one for you.

546
00:39:00,249 --> 00:39:01,348
Forget it.

547
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:03,089
It's pretty. Take a look.

548
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,288
I don't care for it.

549
00:39:04,289 --> 00:39:07,288
You reported me to the police.
Don't try to flatter me now.

550
00:39:07,289 --> 00:39:09,929
You're already done.

551
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,099
Mom.

552
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,368
You're a family of swindlers.

553
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:20,769
If it had been up to me, you
wouldn't have married her.

554
00:39:20,909 --> 00:39:22,638
How shameless can she be?

555
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:23,908
I'm the one who wanted to marry.

556
00:39:23,909 --> 00:39:25,609
That doesn't matter.

557
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:27,949
She turned the wedding into a funeral.

558
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:30,420
I hate every little thing about her.

559
00:39:30,479 --> 00:39:33,019
On top of that, she
called the police on me.

560
00:39:33,689 --> 00:39:35,388
Your mother is just like you.

561
00:39:35,389 --> 00:39:37,259
She didn't educate you properly.

562
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,658
Why didn't she stop you
from calling the police?

563
00:39:39,659 --> 00:39:42,630
She just clenched her chest and moaned.

564
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,900
You went too far.

565
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,130
You can't belittle my mom.

566
00:39:48,769 --> 00:39:50,139
I won't tolerate it.

567
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,170
Did you hear her?

568
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:56,478
Why did you make her cry?

569
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:59,248
Does it break your heart to
see your wife leave in tears?

570
00:39:59,249 --> 00:40:02,220
Don't you feel sorry for your mom
who was dragged out by the police?

571
00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:04,149
I hate you more than her.

572
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:06,349
Get out! I don't want to see you.

573
00:40:06,389 --> 00:40:08,119
She went overboard with calling the police.

574
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:11,159
She must look down on us
because she has a job.

575
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:13,729
It makes me so angry.

576
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:38,348
Did you eat?

577
00:40:38,349 --> 00:40:40,848
Eun Kang is really something.

578
00:40:40,849 --> 00:40:42,489
I scolded her a little,

579
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,158
then she glared at me and said...

580
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:46,090
she wouldn't let it go next time.

581
00:40:46,889 --> 00:40:48,058
Gosh, my heart...

582
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:49,558
Enough is enough, Mom.

583
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:51,530
I'll get angry if you do it again.

584
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,880
- Is that it?
- Don't lose him.

585
00:41:11,349 --> 00:41:13,118
- Who is he?
- Don't ask.

586
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,920
Stay right on his tail this time.

587
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:16,859
He's still going.

588
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,820
- Should I keep on following?
- Of course.

589
00:41:19,659 --> 00:41:23,499
Sometimes you ask ridiculous stuff.

590
00:41:37,439 --> 00:41:39,110
Gosh.

591
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,180
Why did you stop so suddenly?

592
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:45,478
You're lucky I'm a good driver.

593
00:41:45,479 --> 00:41:46,889
We almost got into an accident.

594
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:49,360
Why did he stop?

595
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,159
- He's buying a cake.
- A cake?

596
00:41:56,229 --> 00:41:58,400
Is it someone's birthday? No.

597
00:41:59,999 --> 00:42:01,299
Why are you bending down?

598
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,438
I don't know.

599
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:04,868
I guess it's hard to break the law.

600
00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:06,769
I can't help but hide.

601
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,920
What should I do?

602
00:42:18,921 --> 00:42:21,219
What else? Hurry up and go after him.

603
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:24,458
I'm just used to going
where my customer tells me.

604
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,288
When I'm driving a taxi, it's not up to me.

605
00:42:26,289 --> 00:42:27,430
It's up to the customer.

606
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:30,029
Also, it's not up to me to get there.

607
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,729
I need to follow the GPS.

608
00:42:33,369 --> 00:42:34,470
Over there.

609
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:54,489
This is near your home.

610
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:55,689
Stop.

611
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:01,659
Is he your son?

612
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,728
No.

613
00:43:03,729 --> 00:43:05,769
You wouldn't be following your son.

614
00:43:06,099 --> 00:43:07,670
- Is he your son-in-law?
- Gosh.

615
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:20,309
I have to drive, so I can't drink.

616
00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:22,308
Can I have a bowl of noodles?

617
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:23,679
Can I get some noodles?

618
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,419
- Beef brisket noodles.
- Okay.

619
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,789
Eat anchovy noodles. You hardly helped.

620
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:32,658
By the way, you must be worried.

621
00:43:32,659 --> 00:43:34,558
Are you sure your son-in-law
is having an affair?

622
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:36,860
I don't have anything firm,
but he looks suspicious.

623
00:43:37,659 --> 00:43:41,669
I can't accuse him without evidence.
Then it'll make him hide,

624
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,150
and I won't be able to find anything.

625
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,308
It's really tough when you doubt someone.

626
00:43:46,309 --> 00:43:48,039
Of course, it is.

627
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:50,809
Can you make it large?

628
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,309
All right.

629
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:55,820
I was so tense while
tailing him, so I'm hungry.

630
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,978
But from the way your son-in-law looks,

631
00:43:58,979 --> 00:44:01,949
I would never guess he'd do such a thing.

632
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:04,888
- Our lady thinks he's cheating.
- Your wife?

633
00:44:04,889 --> 00:44:06,828
No, our helper.

634
00:44:06,829 --> 00:44:09,399
The moment she saw him,
she said he was cheating.

635
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,999
What a funny lady.

636
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,029
On what grounds?

637
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:16,300
Women always blame the innocent.

638
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:21,109
Do you have any evidence?

639
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:23,509
I can't say that I don't,

640
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,309
but I can't say I do either.

641
00:44:25,809 --> 00:44:29,680
You picked out a woman's
hair from my car before.

642
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,320
Yes.

643
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:35,050
So you didn't go camping with a woman?

644
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,519
Are you kidding me?

645
00:44:41,189 --> 00:44:43,328
What is it? I'm consulting my customer.

646
00:44:43,329 --> 00:44:45,558
Why is a taxi driver
consulting his customer?

647
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:47,030
Hurry home. We have to go somewhere.

648
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:49,010
I'll come after I finish my noodles.

649
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:55,139
- The noodles...
- I'll eat it. You can go.

650
00:44:55,209 --> 00:44:56,340
That's mine.

651
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:06,689
Gosh. Is your business going well?

652
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:09,359
Take it easy.

653
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,659
Hey, jerk.

654
00:45:10,889 --> 00:45:12,090
Are you well?

655
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:15,490
- Hello.
- Call me your sister-in-law.

656
00:45:16,329 --> 00:45:17,729
Right, your ex-sister-in-law.

657
00:45:18,499 --> 00:45:20,329
Greet me again.

658
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:22,499
Hello, ex-sister-in-law.

659
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:23,868
Hello.

660
00:45:23,869 --> 00:45:25,269
Why are you greeting her?

661
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,808
It's nothing much. We came
to get money from you.

662
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:31,509
Return the money Dae Geun
got from a private loan.

663
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:32,779
I wouldn't still have that.

664
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,356
I couldn't give it to you even if I died.

665
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,018
Also, why are you asking me?

666
00:45:36,019 --> 00:45:37,419
It's been ages since we divorced.

667
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:39,050
What are you talking about?

668
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,559
You two might be done,
but you have Eun Byeol.

669
00:45:43,189 --> 00:45:46,529
Who would kick out their
child because of a man?

670
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:47,860
Don't you agree, everyone?

671
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:50,558
We'll call the police if
you obstruct our business.

672
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:51,999
Go ahead.

673
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,769
Go ahead and report me.

674
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:01,069
Goodbye!

675
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:02,680
Don't ever come back.

676
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:05,739
The owner here is evil, and
she abandoned her child.

677
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:07,308
Don't give her business!

678
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:09,618
What do you think you're doing?
This is my business!

679
00:46:09,619 --> 00:46:10,949
Do you want to see me die?

680
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:13,090
No, I can't watch that.

681
00:46:13,189 --> 00:46:15,320
I don't have the guts like you.

682
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:20,029
Brother-in-law... No, ex-brother-in-law.

683
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:22,260
Can you please do something?

684
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:24,259
She never listens to me.

685
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:27,530
It would be best to give
her some money to leave.

686
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,539
This is 1,200 dollars.

687
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:35,538
Dae Geun, give me 50 cents.

688
00:46:35,539 --> 00:46:37,839
You bet 50 cents she
wouldn't get the money.

689
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,880
Right.

690
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:40,909
Here it is.

691
00:46:42,979 --> 00:46:45,019
We agreed to 3 to 7.

692
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:46,650
Can we split it in half?

693
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,018
You saw the trouble I went through.

694
00:46:49,019 --> 00:46:50,320
Stop talking nonsense.

695
00:46:51,289 --> 00:46:53,459
Here, 360 dollars. Happy?

696
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,598
Why don't you just give it to him?
He needs the cash.

697
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,670
No, it's okay. You worked hard.

698
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:03,999
About that man she's living with...

699
00:47:04,269 --> 00:47:07,669
I checked from every angle, and
you're so much better than him.

700
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:09,138
What made her cheat on you with him?

701
00:47:09,139 --> 00:47:11,109
- He plays the guitar.
- The guitar?

702
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:12,538
That doesn't put food on the table.

703
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:14,978
Those two things have no connection.

704
00:47:14,979 --> 00:47:17,280
Food isn't everything in life.

705
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,449
Of course, it is. Try starving.

706
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:21,420
You'd sell the guitar and everything else.

707
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:25,158
She met him through a game, right?

708
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:27,159
That must be an area she likes.

709
00:47:27,389 --> 00:47:30,530
She fell in love with Dae
Geun after seeing him sing.

710
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:31,998
They used to work at a restaurant together.

711
00:47:31,999 --> 00:47:33,630
She must be out of her mind.

712
00:47:33,769 --> 00:47:36,070
This is why people say
you earn your own fate.

713
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:38,768
My ex-colleague from the restaurant...

714
00:47:38,769 --> 00:47:42,038
fell in love after seeing her
man park in reverse one go.

715
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:43,309
I was speechless.

716
00:47:43,539 --> 00:47:45,679
The steamed bun place owner fell in love...

717
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,848
because she liked her blind date's joke.

718
00:47:47,849 --> 00:47:50,619
She gets beat up, but
she still lives with him.

719
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,389
There's no need to risk
your life over nothing.

720
00:48:00,659 --> 00:48:02,159
What's with your looks?

721
00:48:02,959 --> 00:48:05,058
All of you need to wake up.

722
00:48:05,059 --> 00:48:06,869
Don't fall head over heels for anything.

723
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:08,300
Speak for yourself.

724
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:10,970
Why did you fall in love with
me after seeing me dance?

725
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:13,368
What are you talking about?
That never happened.

726
00:48:13,369 --> 00:48:15,438
We went on a picnic when
we were in grade five.

727
00:48:15,439 --> 00:48:18,039
You told me you fell in
love when I did the twist.

728
00:48:18,139 --> 00:48:19,509
That's nonsense.

729
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:21,610
You have no idea what I like.

730
00:48:23,019 --> 00:48:25,018
All right, let's do a test.

731
00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:26,219
Answer me at the same time.

732
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:29,288
Jjajangmyeon or jjampong?
What do you like better?

733
00:48:29,289 --> 00:48:30,420
- Jjampong.
- Jjajangmyeon.

734
00:48:30,519 --> 00:48:31,919
You like jjampong.

735
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,888
- What are you talking about?
- Again.

736
00:48:33,889 --> 00:48:36,158
Spicy or mild? In 1, 2, 3.

737
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:37,329
- Spicy.
- Mild.

738
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:38,859
You like spicy food.

739
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:40,030
Do I like spicy food?

740
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:41,469
Aren't I right?

741
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:43,569
In a situation like this, I normally go...

742
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:47,639
I can't hear you.

743
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,269
Hello?

744
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,780
"Hello?"
- You're really good at that.

745
00:48:53,249 --> 00:48:54,748
Do they fall for it?

746
00:48:54,749 --> 00:48:56,018
Of course.

747
00:48:56,019 --> 00:48:58,280
They're acting like they do.
Of course, they don't.

748
00:48:58,749 --> 00:49:02,319
Since we're on the topic,
don't cut my jjajangmyeon.

749
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,089
I like to slurp it in one go.

750
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:05,619
You don't want it short.

751
00:49:06,289 --> 00:49:08,388
Watching you two...

752
00:49:08,389 --> 00:49:10,800
makes me want to marry a
friend from elementary school.

753
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:12,430
I told you not to do that.

754
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:14,030
Why not?

755
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,200
Dad, get your taxi.

756
00:49:19,439 --> 00:49:20,509
Is it your friend?

757
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:21,769
She hasn't called in a while.

758
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:24,840
Ask for a lot of money. You
said she was rich, right?

759
00:49:25,539 --> 00:49:26,978
Wear your hat. It's cold.

760
00:49:26,979 --> 00:49:28,179
I don't want to.

761
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:30,348
I didn't wear it in the winter
even while riding sleighs.

762
00:49:30,349 --> 00:49:31,420
You know that.

763
00:49:33,889 --> 00:49:35,590
Ba Da, your taxi is here.

764
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:38,559
Hello.

765
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,688
I heard you two met by chance in Sokcho.

766
00:49:40,689 --> 00:49:42,958
Yes. I go to Sokcho often,

767
00:49:42,959 --> 00:49:44,760
and our schedules aligned.

768
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,670
You should go now.

769
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:50,999
I'm busy.

770
00:49:51,139 --> 00:49:53,039
You're so charming.

771
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,139
Let's eat together with Eun Kang next time.

772
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,010
See you later.

773
00:49:57,939 --> 00:49:59,079
Goodbye.

774
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:05,150
He's so ridiculous.

775
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:08,550
He bought a cashmere scarf for my mom.

776
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:12,220
Were you able to relieve some
stress after going to Sokcho?

777
00:50:12,789 --> 00:50:14,788
Ki Han is good at
understanding what you need.

778
00:50:14,789 --> 00:50:16,599
He's better at it than
Cha Won in some ways.

779
00:50:16,659 --> 00:50:18,658
By the way, I made a mistake.

780
00:50:18,659 --> 00:50:19,900
What mistake?

781
00:50:20,499 --> 00:50:22,599
- I kissed him.
- Really?

782
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,869
Honestly, it wasn't just a kiss.
It was a deep kiss.

783
00:50:27,939 --> 00:50:30,208
- Really deep.
- That's wild.

784
00:50:30,209 --> 00:50:32,309
It must be true that
people cheat impulsively.

785
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:34,978
I think it was partially because
Cha Won and I had trouble.

786
00:50:34,979 --> 00:50:36,549
The mood was good as well.

787
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:37,680
I don't know.

788
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:40,249
It's okay. That could happen to anyone.

789
00:50:40,789 --> 00:50:41,820
Just kiss?

790
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:44,059
Well...

791
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:48,559
Who knows what would've happened
if my mom hadn't been there?

792
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:51,930
You really almost cheated, Ba Da.

793
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:54,268
If Cha Won keeps being bad,

794
00:50:54,269 --> 00:50:55,529
I will.

795
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:58,200
Go ahead and cheat. I'm not stopping you.

796
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:09,150
Right.

797
00:51:14,519 --> 00:51:15,950
- Let's go.
- Okay.

798
00:51:20,889 --> 00:51:21,930
One moment.

799
00:51:23,659 --> 00:51:25,899
- What?
- Give this to the MD as well.

800
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,170
It's the signed contract.

801
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:28,530
Okay.

802
00:51:31,369 --> 00:51:34,438
- Hello.
- Hello. We finally get to meet.

803
00:51:34,439 --> 00:51:36,279
I was curious about you.

804
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,739
Thank you for always helping me
out when I have an emergency.

805
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:41,950
It's just my job. There's
no need to thank me.

806
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:44,250
I heard you were friends with Eun Kang...

807
00:51:44,979 --> 00:51:46,848
I mean, Ms. Cho.

808
00:51:46,849 --> 00:51:48,688
Yes. Thank you for your help.

809
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:49,759
Thank you.

810
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,359
Eun Kang. I'll call you later.

811
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,800
- Okay. I'll be going, then.
- Okay.

812
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,859
I almost made a mistake.

813
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,099
She didn't notice, right?

814
00:52:01,829 --> 00:52:02,999
I don't think she did.

815
00:52:03,099 --> 00:52:05,139
Your friend seems nice.

816
00:52:05,439 --> 00:52:07,109
Maybe it's because she's
from a wealthy family,

817
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:09,239
but she's very friendly and bright.

818
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,109
My daughters look so gloomy.

819
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:13,209
They rarely ever smile.

820
00:52:16,249 --> 00:52:17,320
But...

821
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:20,888
why would they want to smile
with a family like this?

822
00:52:20,889 --> 00:52:22,449
If you had been born
into a family like that,

823
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:25,559
you wouldn't have to run
errands for your friend.

824
00:52:26,389 --> 00:52:27,659
I'm sorry.

825
00:52:29,389 --> 00:52:30,430
Gosh.

826
00:52:33,829 --> 00:52:34,999
Hello.

827
00:52:38,539 --> 00:52:39,539
Nice to meet you.

828
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:42,609
The exhibit for the works you all
put so much effort into creating...

829
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:44,638
will finally be held tomorrow.

830
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:46,109
- That's great.
- How exciting.

831
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:47,308
- Congratulations.
- That's great.

832
00:52:47,309 --> 00:52:49,009
I'm so excited as well.

833
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:52,320
Please set up your work nicely at
your designated booths tonight.

834
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:55,449
Since all of your work are very valuable,

835
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:57,419
we'll do our best to keep them safe.

836
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:00,260
Well, then. Let's please
move to the exhibition hall.

837
00:53:00,329 --> 00:53:02,659
- This way.
- Thank you.

838
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,658
I think we'll have to stay up all night.
Are you okay?

839
00:53:05,659 --> 00:53:06,899
I already took time off
from my part-time job.

840
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,170
Ms. Han. One moment, please.

841
00:53:10,039 --> 00:53:11,069
Yes.

842
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:12,769
I'll get some snacks and coffee.

843
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:32,689
What brings you here?

844
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,800
I thought you weren't
participating in this exhibit.

845
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:37,459
What's going on? Tell me.

846
00:53:37,659 --> 00:53:40,400
Shut your mouth. We're in
the same boat now, anyway.

847
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:41,670
This isn't right.

848
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,039
- I even have evidence.
- What evidence?

849
00:53:45,539 --> 00:53:46,569
You threatened me.

850
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:48,610
You were the one who started it.

851
00:53:53,709 --> 00:53:56,820
- Hi, Ba Da.
- Eun Kang. Come here quickly.

852
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:04,159
(Exit)

853
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,400
This is mine. I designed it.

854
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,899
It's on the design registry.
Please check it.

855
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:20,868
They claimed that it was their design.

856
00:54:20,869 --> 00:54:23,109
They sent sketches that
show their design process.

857
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:25,879
They even filed for an
injunction and sent a copy.

858
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,680
They filed for an injunction? No way.

859
00:54:28,749 --> 00:54:30,819
This is basically my baby.

860
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:33,320
What kind of mother would
not recognize their own baby?

861
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:36,589
I designed this based on my work
that received the grand prize...

862
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:38,118
at the International Jewelry Awards.

863
00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:41,530
Eun Kang. This is my design, right?
You've seen it.

864
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:45,228
She's right. I'm sure this is Ms.
Han's design.

865
00:54:45,229 --> 00:54:47,368
Who was it? Who did this?

866
00:54:47,369 --> 00:54:49,400
I can't tell you that.

867
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:52,268
This is also a difficult situation for us.

868
00:54:52,269 --> 00:54:54,938
We'd like to proceed
without this ruby set...

869
00:54:54,939 --> 00:54:56,638
so that there are no legal issues...

870
00:54:56,639 --> 00:54:57,709
No.

871
00:54:58,579 --> 00:55:00,479
My pride won't let me do that.

872
00:55:01,409 --> 00:55:04,349
I've never done anything to be
ashamed of in my whole life.

873
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:06,389
I won't participate...

874
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:08,820
in this exhibit.

875
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:11,889
I'm going to head to the police
station and sue right away.

876
00:55:12,019 --> 00:55:13,688
I'm going to prove that I was right...

877
00:55:13,689 --> 00:55:15,389
and clear myself of any charges.

878
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:21,599
You're the association president.
How could you not participate?

879
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:29,390
(Complaint, Plaintiff: Han Ba
Da, Defendant: Na Bun Nyeon)

880
00:55:30,479 --> 00:55:32,079
I have a guess as to who it was.

881
00:55:32,479 --> 00:55:35,180
It's a CEO that has had a
bad relationship with me.

882
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,919
I think they're getting revenge...

883
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,960
because I won the home
shopping contract over them.

884
00:55:41,849 --> 00:55:42,920
Han Ba Da.

885
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:54,529
You said you'd only use
the design as a reference.

886
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:56,570
How could you stab me
in the back like this?

887
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:00,909
I had nothing to do with this.

888
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:02,890
So if something goes
wrong, leave me out of it.

889
00:56:03,939 --> 00:56:05,899
She came to the police
station to file a lawsuit.

890
00:56:06,479 --> 00:56:08,579
I gave you the information,
so do me this favor.

891
00:56:19,519 --> 00:56:20,530
You're home late.

892
00:56:23,229 --> 00:56:24,499
When are you free this week?

893
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,769
Let's go out for a meal with my mom.
There's no other way.

894
00:56:33,409 --> 00:56:36,039
To be honest, my mom has a
reason for acting that way.

895
00:56:38,579 --> 00:56:40,650
You agree with her, I see.

896
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:43,149
Don't take it so negatively.

897
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,149
Just try to understand my mom.

898
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:48,089
It was wrong of you to call
the police and kick her out.

899
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:49,589
I have complaints too, you know.

900
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:51,558
I can't change freely
because Mother's here.

901
00:56:51,559 --> 00:56:53,090
I have to care about so much.

902
00:56:53,229 --> 00:56:54,760
I feel anxious whenever I come home.

903
00:56:56,289 --> 00:56:57,729
We haven't done it for a while too.

904
00:56:57,930 --> 00:57:00,070
Things feel different from before,

905
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:01,399
but I'm living with it.

906
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,368
Be quiet. Are you that upset?

907
00:57:03,369 --> 00:57:05,099
How much did you have to endure?

908
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:06,768
The exhibit is a mess.

909
00:57:06,769 --> 00:57:08,670
Do you even know what
just happened to me now?

910
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:10,279
Do you know where I'm coming from?

911
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,809
How am I supposed to know that?
You didn't tell me.

912
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:16,249
Forget it. Let's stop.

913
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:43,309
I made some date and ginger tea. Have some.

914
00:57:44,479 --> 00:57:46,879
I feel bad about fighting
when my mom was there.

915
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,610
He said so many things.

916
00:57:48,809 --> 00:57:51,348
He said he was uncomfortable
because my mom was there.

917
00:57:51,349 --> 00:57:52,978
My mom also said...

918
00:57:52,979 --> 00:57:55,349
Cha Won's heart seemed to be elsewhere.

919
00:57:55,749 --> 00:57:58,959
I don't sure why, but I think
there might be someone else.

920
00:58:00,289 --> 00:58:01,689
Does it also seem like that to you?

921
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:04,260
I'm not sure.

922
00:58:04,999 --> 00:58:06,930
It does seem like that a little.

923
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:15,070
Eun Kang. Let's meet.

924
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:16,209
Your part-time job?

925
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:17,880
Yes.

926
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:20,908
I should stay here with you. Sorry.

927
00:58:20,909 --> 00:58:22,050
It's okay.

928
00:58:22,349 --> 00:58:24,380
I came to work because I
was feeling frustrated.

929
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:25,619
Go ahead.

930
00:58:46,099 --> 00:58:47,470
Did something happen to Ba Da?

931
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,470
She said the exhibit was a mess.

932
00:58:49,639 --> 00:58:51,510
Ba Da must be upset right now.

933
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,179
A competitor company claimed...

934
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:56,650
to the department store that
Ba Da's design was theirs.

935
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,680
She went to the police
station to sue that company.

936
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:02,549
- The police station?
- You don't have to worry.

937
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:04,519
Mr. Shin Ki Han came and helped out.

938
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:07,229
He knew what to do. It must
be because he's a businessman.

939
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:09,489
Ba Da and I never had anything
like that happen before,

940
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:10,999
so we were just shaking in our boots.

941
00:59:14,729 --> 00:59:17,569
Didn't he do anything other than sue
people while running his business?

942
00:59:21,939 --> 00:59:22,970
You heard...

943
00:59:23,939 --> 00:59:25,380
that they met in Sokcho, right?

944
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:28,450
They met by coincidence, apparently.

945
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:29,950
It could've been...

946
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:32,450
not a coincidence.

947
00:59:36,349 --> 00:59:38,389
They were friends since middle school.

948
00:59:38,689 --> 00:59:40,959
She could've let him know
that she was going to Sokcho.

949
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:43,998
Mr. Shin would always go...

950
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,530
wherever Ba Da was.

951
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:48,800
Wherever?

952
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,569
Welcome. How many are in your party?

953
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:55,670
- Four people.
- Right this way.

954
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,949
- What?
- Your husband...

955
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:07,150
and Eun Kang are having drinks.

956
01:00:07,289 --> 01:00:08,889
They're sitting side by side at the bar.

957
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:11,860
I'm so nervous right now. What should I do?

958
01:00:12,590 --> 01:00:15,958
Right. They met because they
had to discuss something.

959
01:00:15,959 --> 01:00:17,400
Why would someone...

960
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:20,268
have something to discuss
with their friend's husband...

961
01:00:20,269 --> 01:00:21,400
without their friend?

962
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:22,970
Do you want to come over here?

963
01:00:23,439 --> 01:00:25,915
They had to meet about something.
Just pretend you didn't see them.

964
01:00:25,939 --> 01:00:27,110
Let's talk tomorrow.

965
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:42,780
Why are you home so late? Why
didn't you answer your phone?

966
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:46,688
Who did you drink with?

967
01:00:46,689 --> 01:00:48,130
- A friend.
- A friend? Who?

968
01:00:50,459 --> 01:00:53,229
Why do you need to know?
You said we shouldn't talk.

969
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:08,579
(Calls, Cho Eun Kang)

970
01:01:16,349 --> 01:01:17,559
(Chats, Cho Eun Kang)

971
01:01:22,159 --> 01:01:25,559
Eun Kang. Did you meet
Cha Won by any chance?

972
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:34,539
Someone told me that they saw you
and Cha Won drinking together.

973
01:01:44,519 --> 01:01:47,188
With a jewelry set like this,

974
01:01:47,189 --> 01:01:51,719
women can feel especially
elegant and beautiful...

975
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:53,090
in any occasion.

976
01:01:53,389 --> 01:01:56,658
How could someone have drinks
with their friend's husband?

977
01:01:56,659 --> 01:01:58,899
This jewelry was designed
by the Grand Prize winner...

978
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,569
of the International Jewelry Awards.

979
01:02:00,570 --> 01:02:03,739
That's why we have prepared
a special set for you today.

980
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:07,539
This whole set of jewelry
I have on right now...

981
01:02:07,709 --> 01:02:09,469
I just came from the police station.

982
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:11,379
They think that CEO ran away to China.

983
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:12,478
- What?
- They said it was hard...

984
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:13,986
to catch someone in a situation like this.

985
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:16,208
Even if they do catch her, it's
seen as a different design...

986
01:02:16,209 --> 01:02:18,180
if there's a small difference,

987
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:20,220
so it might not count as
copyright infringement.

988
01:02:20,619 --> 01:02:22,150
The lawsuit will take a lot of time.

989
01:02:22,389 --> 01:02:24,820
I think we should just call it
bad luck and forget about it.

990
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:26,859
I'm worried that it'll just stress you out.

991
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:29,689
No. We have to catch people like this.

992
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:31,900
I'm going to catch her and set an example.

993
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:33,570
What a vicious person.

994
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:34,900
By the way, Ba Da.

995
01:02:36,229 --> 01:02:38,670
I met Cha Won last night.

996
01:02:40,309 --> 01:02:42,538
- What?
- I was on my way to work,

997
01:02:42,539 --> 01:02:44,638
but what you said about Cha
Won's feelings changing...

998
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:45,880
kept bugging me.

999
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:48,479
So I asked him where he was,
and he said he was at a bar.

1000
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:51,220
I went there to see what he was thinking.

1001
01:02:52,249 --> 01:02:53,720
Really?

1002
01:02:54,349 --> 01:02:56,888
What did he say? What
did it seem like to you?

1003
01:02:56,889 --> 01:02:58,189
It seemed like...

1004
01:03:00,329 --> 01:03:03,090
I don't know if I should say this.

1005
01:03:03,329 --> 01:03:04,400
Tell me.

1006
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,200
He talked a lot about your mother.

1007
01:03:06,829 --> 01:03:09,099
I think he really wants to live separately.

1008
01:03:09,999 --> 01:03:12,799
I want you to be his first
priority, but it seems like...

1009
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,869
How could he change like that?

1010
01:03:16,269 --> 01:03:17,709
He's become even worse recently.

1011
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:22,680
Ms. Han.

1012
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:24,950
We need you over here.

1013
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:29,989
Two sets. One set.

1014
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:31,919
We are officially sold out!

1015
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,058
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

1016
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,689
We're sold out.

1017
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:37,599
This is amazing.

1018
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:40,999
- We sold out?
- Yes.

1019
01:03:41,369 --> 01:03:42,530
This is crazy.

1020
01:03:42,670 --> 01:03:44,969
It's hard to sell out a jewelry set.

1021
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:46,569
It's all thanks to you.

1022
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:47,739
Not at all.

1023
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,739
Your design was great.

1024
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:51,078
It's a grand prize winner.

1025
01:03:51,079 --> 01:03:52,539
The viewer response is crazy.

1026
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:53,819
You have more inventory, right?

1027
01:03:54,349 --> 01:03:56,578
We don't have anything ready right now.

1028
01:03:56,579 --> 01:03:58,679
When can you get it ready?

1029
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,050
We should keep the ball rolling.

1030
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:08,189
We don't have any rubies in stock.

1031
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,958
We just need to buy some rubies.

1032
01:04:09,959 --> 01:04:11,059
Is there a way?

There's no one here by that name.

01:04:28,749 --> 01:04:29,909
Please wait.

1036
01:04:34,349 --> 01:04:35,820
I don't have any money.

1037
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:37,519
Did you call me to ask for money?

1038
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:41,828
You should've called me sooner.

1039
01:04:41,829 --> 01:04:44,499
My bank account was exploding
with money last month.

1040
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:45,900
You were a bit too late.

1041
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:53,080
Their facial expressions
completely changed...

1042
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:55,169
when I brought up money.

1043
01:04:55,170 --> 01:04:57,180
That's life. That's reality.

1044
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:59,509
Did they seem like they were
looking forward to something...

1045
01:04:59,510 --> 01:05:00,579
when you called them?

1046
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:02,549
What were they expecting?

1047
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:04,220
They're all old grandmas.

I'll be going, then.

1051
01:05:11,789 --> 01:05:12,959
Yes, Chairman Ko.

1052

We don't have any rubies in stock.

1053

You can't do this with another company.

1054

You signed the contract
with me, and it's my design.

One moment, please.

Thank you.

It'd be nice if I were
rich at a time like this.

1059
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:37,319
Should we see if we could
borrow money from somewhere?

1060

I don't want to do this
with someone else's money.

1061
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:40,050
It might cause issues.

There won't be any issues.

Every time you do a broadcast,
it's a great success.

We've got you now.

It's an apartment building.

What? An apartment building?

1071
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:54,990
There.

1072
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:01,369
Excuse me, sir.

You're on the same floor as me.

1074

You must be celebrating something.

Oh, yes.

1076
01:08:04,899 --> 01:08:06,060
I found out.

1077
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:07,670
You did? What unit was it?

1078
01:08:09,430 --> 01:08:11,550
Since I was young, I wasn't
interested in marriage...

1079
01:08:11,739 --> 01:08:13,199
or men.

1080
01:08:14,270 --> 01:08:17,180
I wanted to earn money so I
could travel the world in an RV.

1081
01:08:17,409 --> 01:08:20,550
Then live the rest of my
life doing volunteer work.

1082
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:22,249
That was my dream.

1083
01:08:23,449 --> 01:08:25,819
I read that a cool person does
three things in their life.

1084
01:08:26,050 --> 01:08:27,690
First, earn money.

1085
01:08:27,749 --> 01:08:29,049
Second, have a hobby.

1086
01:08:29,050 --> 01:08:30,319
Third, do volunteer work.

1087
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:32,019
I planned things exactly that way.

1088
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:33,090
You're cool, Cho Eun San.

1089
01:08:36,890 --> 01:08:39,199
But since I met you, my
plans have all been paused.

1090
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:42,270
I don't know what'll happen from now on.

1091
01:08:45,069 --> 01:08:46,300
I'm always worried...

1092
01:08:48,069 --> 01:08:50,239
that you'll suddenly leave.

1093
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:54,070
If you grant me a wish,
I'll think about it.

1094
01:08:54,949 --> 01:08:56,079
What is it?

1095
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,350
Mambo.

1096
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:04,420
The coolest scene in this movie.

1097
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:07,230
It's cool.

1098
01:09:07,659 --> 01:09:08,690
Do this for me.

1099
01:09:09,859 --> 01:09:10,959
Me?

1100
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:13,029
You want me to do this?

1101
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:17,099
I can't do that.

1102
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:18,739
I'm bad at singing and dancing.

1103

You've seen it.

1104
01:09:20,069 --> 01:09:21,840
It's homework. I'll give you a week.

1105
01:09:22,039 --> 01:09:24,555
You have to be in your undershirt
and boxers, just like this actor.

No way.
- "No way."

1107

There's no way.

1108
01:09:28,409 --> 01:09:30,779
I think your son-in-law
bought this girl a house.

1109
01:09:31,619 --> 01:09:33,249
An apartment like this...

1110
01:09:33,779 --> 01:09:35,220
must cost a lot of money.

1111
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:39,190
You have to mercilessly
crush a guy like this.

1112
01:09:39,319 --> 01:09:42,829
You need to beat those two up.
Crush them. Smash them.

1113
01:10:01,050 --> 01:10:03,510
Over there. Unit 1004.

1114
01:10:04,550 --> 01:10:05,649
That one?

1115
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:08,649
Please wait here for a moment.

1116
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:35,609
It's quiet.

1117
01:10:36,079 --> 01:10:37,379
From my experience,

1118
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:39,049
this is the climax of their night.

1119
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:41,050
If you burst in now, you'll
catch them in the act.

1120
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:43,390
If not, they'll make any excuse.

1121
01:10:43,690 --> 01:10:45,659
Even if they're naked,

1122
01:10:45,789 --> 01:10:48,529
they'll lie and say they took off
their clothes because it was hot.

1123
01:10:49,359 --> 01:10:50,858
The Korean War was nothing compared to...

1124
01:10:50,859 --> 01:10:53,399
when there was a law against adultery.

1125
01:10:53,930 --> 01:10:56,129
Should I go and ring the bell?

1126
01:10:56,130 --> 01:10:57,339
Wait.

1127
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:58,970
If they ask who it is,

1128
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:01,469
should I say it's me?

1129
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:02,910
Say you're from the security office.

1130
01:11:06,779 --> 01:11:07,949
Go ahead, then.

1131
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:39,579
What is it?

1132
01:11:42,649 --> 01:11:43,850
I don't know.

1133
01:11:45,319 --> 01:11:47,180
I keep tearing up for some reason.

1134
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,550
The time with you feels like a dream.

1135
01:11:52,819 --> 01:11:54,029
I feel guilty about you.

1136
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:57,289
Guilty for what?

1137
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:00,499
I'm trapping you...

1138
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:03,199
in a small world.

1139
01:12:04,399 --> 01:12:06,300
You're just 28 years old now.

1140
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:09,440
You must have...

1141
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:12,209
a lot of things you want to do.

1142
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:14,980
Since you're with a guy like me,

1143
01:12:16,510 --> 01:12:17,949
you can't go to nice restaurants,

1144
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:20,819
go dancing,

1145
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:23,850
or go to amusement parks.

1146
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:27,760
You always have to ride in that old truck.

1147
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:31,399
None of that matters.

1148
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:38,640
I like where I am now.

1149
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,869
This is an island for just the two of us.

1150
01:12:42,609 --> 01:12:45,180
I feel happy whenever I see
a truck on the street now.

1151
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,079
Eun San.

1152
01:12:55,149 --> 01:12:57,489
You helped me find the dream
that I had forgotten about...

1153
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:00,289
since I was 17.

1154
01:13:06,930 --> 01:13:08,829
It feels like my heart is beating again.

1155
01:14:34,489 --> 01:14:38,319
(Red Balloon)

1156
01:14:39,819 --> 01:14:41,690
What's going on between...

1157
01:14:42,090 --> 01:14:43,430
Ba Da and Mr. Shin?

1158
01:14:43,789 --> 01:14:47,459
Will you be able to live alone
if you were to divorce Nam Chul?

1159
01:14:48,069 --> 01:14:50,770
Please give me some time, sir.

1160
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,340
I said there was nothing I wanted, right?

1161
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:54,809
I take that back.

1162
01:14:54,810 --> 01:14:56,440
I want you to be mine forever.

1163
01:14:56,970 --> 01:14:58,809
Apparently, you said it
was easy to use her...

1164
01:14:58,810 --> 01:15:01,130
because she did whatever you
wanted if you gave her money.

1165
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:03,149
You're so funny.

1166
01:15:03,279 --> 01:15:05,380
Do you want Ba Da to get a divorce?

1167
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:07,279
If so, what will you do?

1168
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:08,649
Listen.

1169
01:15:08,690 --> 01:15:10,190
The evidence is right here.
