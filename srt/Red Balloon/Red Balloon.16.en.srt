I had a drink.

You had a drink and stood in the rain.

15
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,358
You could at least have a drink...

16
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:04,129
and go out to look for Ba Da.

17

There's nothing I can do.

18
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:10,439
All I can do is clean the house Ba Da moved out from...

19
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,539
and make honey water for you.

20
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,509
It had only been a few days.

21
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:19,740
But the way you look at me changed.

22
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,680
At least you of all people must remember that...

23
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:27,289
it was me...

24
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,150
who ended things before Ba Da found out.

25
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,959
I had already ended it and was on my way back,

26
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,189
but I was exposed.

27
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:38,960
I'm not saying it's not fair. I'm just clarifying what happened.

28
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:42,770
I know that.

29
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,809
We slept together once in the heat of the moment...

30
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,870
and only ended up making a mess.

31
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,839
It was a beautiful sin before we got caught.

32
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,509
But it turned into a humiliating crime afterwards.

33
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,689
I was able to endure the humiliation at the crowded café that day...

34
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:05,960
because you were next to me, Cha Won.

35
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,929
Your father, mother, and sister...

36
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,000
took turns criticizing me.

37
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:15,099
But the trust that I had someone in my corner helped me endure it.

38
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:20,710
Even when you weren't with me, I was happy as if you were mine.

39
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,779
I'm so close to you that I can even hear you breathing,

40
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,379
but you feel so far away.

41
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:28,508
I can see it in your face that...

42
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:29,979
you resent and blame me for what happened.

43
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,619
You said your thoughts about me...

44
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,989
consumed you all day since the moment you woke up,

45
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,419
and your heart was beating so fast that it drove you crazy.

46
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:39,219
But your feelings crumbled away so easily.

47
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:43,159
The inflated balloon in your hand...

48
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,400
must not be so beautiful anymore.

49
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:50,500
You must have been scared when Ba Da asked for a divorce.

50
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,439
Marriage comes with duties and loyalty.

51
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,110
But an affair is over...

52
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:00,710
when feelings fade away.

53
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:06,379
You should be responsible for your own mistakes.

54
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,620
And I, mine.

55
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,020
If they are too much to handle, push them to me.

56
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,189
Who cares what happens to me?

57
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,259
I'm an evil adulterer who seduced her friend's husband.

58
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,370
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,740
You can curse me for being a foolish and cowardly man.

60
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:29,709
My life was thrown upside down,

61
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:33,610
so I failed to be considerate of you.

62
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,519
I'm sorry.

63
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,509
Your affair has been giving me a headache.

64
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,680
So only your immediate family is here.

65
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,109
Cha Won.

66
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,649
You told your father it wasn't a mistake.

67
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,389
Then when did you two start having feelings for each other?

68
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:16,920
Our affair started recently.

69
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,790
But she had feelings for me for a long time.

70
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,689
Ever since she first met me,

71
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:22,859
she had feelings for me.

72
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,258
See?

73
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:26,299
She was the one who seduced him!

74
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,129
So how do you feel?

75
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,698
Yes. Tell us every bit of your feelings today.

76
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:32,099
No, never mind.

77
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,299
Just end it.

78
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,909
I never liked Ba Da from the beginning...

79
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,310
nor her minion.

80
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,479
How dare she?

81
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,679
It wasn't a marriage problem.

82
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,180
You cheated on your wife...

83
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:42,980
with her friend at that too.

84
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,078
What if Mi Poong finds out when she grows up?

85
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,279
Unbelievable.

86
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,588
How could you let this happen?

87
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:48,689
What did Eun Kang say?

88
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,019
She didn't say anything.

89
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:54,029
Our divorce has nothing to do with her.

90
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:55,628
Nonsense.

91
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:57,860
This all happened because of her.

92
00:05:58,029 --> 00:05:59,698
How could you say something like that?

93
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:00,970
Fix this no matter what.

94
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,269
No one is getting a divorce in my family.

95
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,000
Gosh, I'm so lonely.

96
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,739
- Darn it. - Goodness.

97
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,879
We can't come up with a solution even after this meeting.

98
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,279
I can't think of anything...

99
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,549
but finding Ba Da.

100
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,949
Don't skip meals.

101
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:18,049
This was your decision. Why are you skipping meals?

102
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,419
Exactly.

103
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,989
If you couldn't handle the consequence,

104
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,389
why did you cheat?

105
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:23,990
How uncivilized.

It's me.

I told the kids we would have dinner with them tonight.

I have plans.

Do you think I'm always available for you?

118

The kids aren't going to the academy today.

119
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:25,878
I'm busy.

120
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,888
I haven't been able to go out because of Cha Won's situation.

121
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:29,189
My friends have been begging me to meet up.

122
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:30,790
Count me out.

123
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,019
Geum Ah. Are you there?

124
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,040
She's meeting her friends?

125
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,779
Yes.

126
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,378
She hasn't been able to go out...

127
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:57,949
because your grandpa wasn't feeling well.

128
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,479
Did something happen to Grandpa?

129
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,850
What? No.

130
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,489
Uncle Cha Won hasn't been visiting lately.

131
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,818
Did they have a fight?

132
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,060
Do you think Uncle Cha Won would fight with Grandpa?

133
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,128
Only Dad would do something like that.

134
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:11,528
Father doesn't fight Grandpa.

135
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:13,229
Grandpa scolds him.

136
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,970
Grandpa doesn't scold Uncle Cha Won.

137
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,600
You know nothing.

138
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,799
No one scolded anyone.

139
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,899
Eat up.

140
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,139
It would've been nice if Mom had come too.

141
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:25,939
Let's come back with her soon.

142
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,519
- Hurry. - Okay.

143
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,919
Here I go.

144
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:36,190
Ta-Da.

145
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,720
You used to do that a long time ago too.

146
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,059
This looks so good.

147
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,258
It's been a while since we had...

148
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:45,459
jjajangmyeon at a motel, right?

149
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,859
After you and I broke up,

150
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,970
I never had jjajangmyeon.

151
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,340
Jjajangmyeon always reminded me of you.

152
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:54,470
Will you keep working as a taxi driver?

153
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:56,210
Yes.

154
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,539
Being a private taxi driver is my dream.

155
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:00,308
It means I'll be my own boss.

156
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:01,480
I can work anytime I want.

157
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:04,250
I see.

158
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,789
Let's travel together once you become a private taxi driver.

159
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,220
I'll pay you for the hours.

160
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,418
It's not that easy, though.

161
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:13,059
I can't cause any accidents.

162
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,230
I have to be a good driver.

163
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,860
What about your husband?

164
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:21,529
What does he do?

165
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,740
He took over my father's business.

166
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:27,768
Did you say he ran a Taffy factory or something?

00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:30,470
My grandfather used to operate something like that.

168
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,178
Are you interested...

169
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:36,549
in getting married again?

170
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,620
No.

171
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:47,429
Here.

172
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,429
Okay.

173
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:54,299
You fell for it.

174
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:56,970
Hey.

175
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,539
You're so mean.

176
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,268
Go easy on us.

177
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:01,909
- Dad. Why are you so good? - Gosh. It's not going in.

178
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:10,549
Gosh. You're good.

179
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,779
Wait.

180
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:18,258
Whenever we met,

181
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:20,389
I used to hold you in my arms all day long.

182
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:23,330
We did this for days and didn't even get hungry then.

183
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:26,028
You were me,

184
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:27,299
and I, you.

185
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,830
It's odd, isn't it?

186
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,870
We've been apart for so long.

187
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,200
But it's not awkward at all.

188
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:34,969
Same here.

189
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,539
Meeting you again...

190
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:39,080
feels like a dream.

191
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,490
How could I forget you?

192
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,159
I'll never forget this face.

193
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:08,230
I bought you new underwear.

194
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,970
Can I wear your old ones?

195
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,970
Boxers are more comfortable.

196
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:29,949
- Gosh. It's cold. - It's chilly, right?

197
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,120
It's cold.

198
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,590
Gosh.

199
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,389
- All good? It's okay. - Yes.

200
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,789
Give me a kiss.

201
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,699
Let's go in quickly. It's freezing out here.

202
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,600
- Gosh. Give me a second. - I wish we could do this every day.

203
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,080
Really? Are you sure?

204
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,149
Okay.

205
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:13,759
Really?

206
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:18,360
Gosh. That's so funny.

207
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:23,899
Look at the time.

208
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:26,200
How long have we been talking?

209
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:27,769
I don't know. Maybe for two hours?

210
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,469
Time flies. My phone is getting really hot.

211
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,610
Just like us, our phones are getting heated.

212
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:36,080
- Aren't you cold? - I can't even feel the cold air.

213
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,919
I'm crouching down in a corner where it's not so windy. I'm okay.

214
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,919
No. It's cold at night.

215
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,389
It's cold even in my room.

216
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,750
It's cold in your room?

217
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,620
My sister-in-law won't turn on the heater in my room.

218
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,730
A bowl of water can freeze in my room.

219
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,230
We're waiting for this house to get torn down.

220
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:52,759
Don't you have a heating pad?

221
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,230
It broke.

222
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:57,070
I'm okay. I only sleep in here.

223
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,480
Okay.

224
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,950
Hey. Why did you come out all of a sudden?

225
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,860
Then should I knock before I come out of my room?

226
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,320
Why aren't you sleeping?

227
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:23,230
Who's that on the phone? You were giggling at this late hour.

228
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:27,460
Did you get a new girl?

229
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:30,429
Wait. Is it her?

230
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,840
No. We don't even talk. I don't even have her number.

231
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,840
You cannot see her again. Never.

232
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:40,778
He hired thugs to beat you up because he didn't want...

233
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:42,679
his daughter to marry someone like you.

234
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,279
He said she was going to marry someone else.

235
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,849
He could kill you without leaving a trace.

236
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,389
Whenever your back aches, it breaks my heart.

237
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:54,059
You and I have the worst luck when it comes to women.

238
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,690
I injured my shoulder, and you hurt your back.

239
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,799
Back then, you both were single.

240
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,799
But now, she's someone else's wife.

241
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,700
Don't start something you can't face the consequence of.

242
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,200
If you take it too far, you'll be in trouble.

243
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,169
Don't worry. I won't see her.

244
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,470
Hey, me first. It's urgent.

245
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:56,820
- Geum Ah. - Did you find her?

246
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:58,090
No.

247
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,360
Had I known, I should have stopped her from leaving.

248
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:03,559
I should have made her stay no matter what.

249
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,900
She has no place to go.

250
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,900
Geum Ah.

251
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,069
- I have to go. - Why? Did you find her?

252
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,910
(Mi Poong's Kindergarten)

253
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,250
Hello, this is Mi Poong's dad.

254
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:07,089
What?

255
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:09,259
That's never happened before.

256
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,559
This is the first time.

257
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,299
We don't have a spare outfit for her, so I called.

258
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,630
Okay. I'm on my way now.

259
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,029
(Cha Won)

260
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:53,839
- It's me. - I'm sorry.

261
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,440
But can you go to Mi Poong's kindergarten now?

262
00:18:57,009 --> 00:18:58,279
Mi Poong might have wet her clothes.

263
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,680
Can you please go there with some spare clothes?

264
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,829
You're Mi Poong's mom, right?

265
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:51,559
I heard you were abroad. You must have come back.

266
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,400
Right. What about Mi Poong?

267
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,700
She won't come out of the bathroom.

268
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:01,200
Mi Poong has been acting differently lately.

269
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:03,309
It might be because she's been away from you.

270
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,079
I'm sorry.

271
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:15,319
Mi Poong, it's me. Open the door.

272
00:20:15,819 --> 00:20:16,950
Mi Poong.

273
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,289
Aunt Eun Kang.

274
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:40,809
I washed her and put her to sleep.

275
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,880
It was urgent, so I called you instead.

276
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,579
She's never done this before.

277
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,650
She cried a lot, right?

278
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,849
A bit. Things like this happen to kids.

279
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:53,390
I'll keep an eye on her whenever I can.

280
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:55,130
I'll get going.

281
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:00,900
Eun Kang.

282
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,910
Thank you. I mean it.

283
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:16,079
Are you feeling better with the piggyback ride?

284
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,250
When's Mom coming back?

285
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,880
That's funny.

286
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,220
You said you were fine about Mom leaving.

287
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,619
I miss Mom.

288
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,419
When I was sick,

289
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,459
Mom put me on her back and helped me fall asleep.

290
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,899
When? I always did that.

291
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,230
Mom did that for me too...

292
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,170
when I was little.

293
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,200
Do you remember that?

294
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,068
Yes. Mom put me on her back...

295
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:43,970
and drew a ring.

296
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,079
She worked all night while carrying me on her back.

297
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,779
Stop talking as if I'm not worthy of being a mom.

298
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,179
I might not be perfect,

299
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,949
but I did my best over the past seven years.

300
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,380
Put your hand over your heart and think about it.

301
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,588
Making Mi Poong her breakfast every morning,

302
00:21:56,589 --> 00:21:58,319
dressing her and getting her to kindergarten,

303
00:21:58,589 --> 00:22:00,460
bringing her home in the evening, washing her, and putting her to bed.

304
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
I did all that.

305
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,960
How many times have you been to Mi Poong's kindergarten?

306
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:40,058
I'm sorry,

307
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:41,500
but we have to close up.

308
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,900
I lost track of time.

309
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:46,839
I'm really sorry.

310
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,268
I'll leave once I finish this.

311
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:51,239
Lock up behind you and watch out for any sparks.

312
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,039
Right. Thank you.

313
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,640
Good night, everyone.

314
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,220
Eat some before you go.

315
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,289
I don't have an appetite.

316
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:40,259
Eating to satisfy our appetites is a luxury we don't have.

317
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,190
We eat to survive.

318
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,190
Take a seat.

319
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,869
Eat.

320
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,940
It's kimchi fried rice, your favourite.

321
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:03,150
What about you?

322
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,549
You haven't been able to eat, either.

323
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:08,789
I live in luxury and only eat to satisfy my appetite.

324
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:37,680
Don't cry.

325
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,279
Forget and move on.

326
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,589
Lucky her.

327
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,720
All her kids are doing so well.

328
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:47,789
My eldest?

329
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,589
No, she isn't married.

330
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:51,390
Do you want to set her up?

331

What does he do?

332
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,670
Does he have kids? One?

333
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,970

334
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:03,809
Forget about my eldest.

335
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,440

I would not be treated this way if you were doing well.

Because you'll soon be 40,

she can only set you up with a man...

345
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,759
who barely makes 2,000 dollars a month.

346
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,660
It's either that or single dads.

347

This is what you get for being called a thug as a kid.

How can you even stomach that?

349

It's her first meal today, so leave her be.

350

For days, she has been too sick to eat.

How could I be this unlucky?

354
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:46,319
She was given a designer purse for babysitting her grandchild.

355
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,389
Her youngest daughter is the same age as you,

356
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,450
and she's marrying a government employee next month.

I'm suspicious about how you've been lately.

Did you borrow money from loan sharks again?

359

Stop badgering her. She's sick.

360
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,329
This is what you get for quitting that bookkeeper job!

361

She isn't better than me in any way,

Her children are good to her...

Stop comparing us to your friends' children.

What haven't I done for you?

369

I raised you all these years.

370
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,650
This is why you're impossible to talk to.

371

You're supposed to raise the children you gave birth to.

Is this what I get for raising you?

Don't you get what she's saying?

376
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:31,430
Raising your children isn't done as a favour.

You are supposed to raise your children.

378

That's right, and I worked my butt off.

just mind your own business.

Why care if we get married or not?

It's your fault we turned out this way.

This wouldn't have happened had you made a different decision.

492
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:15,989
- I ate. - Did you already?

493
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,550
Money?

494
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,949
Mine is invested in stocks, and I can't liquidate them just yet.

495
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:43,519
Let's hold off on buying...

496
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:45,789
the new laser equipment.

497
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,320
I don't mind you borrowing the money,

498
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,489
but did something happen between you and Ba Da?

499
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:51,360
I heard you came by to see my wife.

500
00:34:52,059 --> 00:34:53,130
I'll tell you some other time.

501
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,469
When will you be back at work?

502
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:58,800
Our clients keep asking for you.

503
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:01,199
With spring comes lighter clothes,

504
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:03,269
and accessories get to take center stage.

505
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,809
I'm putting together a collection that will be in a lower price range.

506
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:09,349
We should have a meeting once the designs are out.

507
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,949
Thank you. Have a good day.

508
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,320
How did you know I was here?

509
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,429
We should talk.

510
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:26,559
I asked how you found out. Have you been following me?

511
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,730
Leave before I call the police.

512
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:34,340
Here.

513
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,610
Get out!

514
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,170
And I will.

515
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,909
Just accept the money and find a better place to live.

516
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:43,380
A semi-basement unit isn't good for your mother's health.

517
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:45,280
You know where we live?

518
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,050
- You've been stalking me! - Don't be angry.

519
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:50,719
Mold won't be good for your mother's weak condition.

520
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:53,190
This is my professional advice as a doctor.

521
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,690
The sooner, the better.

522
00:35:58,059 --> 00:35:59,659
I left you because you disgusted me,

523
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,260
but you think too highly of yourself.

524
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,130
Do you even know how painful it's been for me?

525
00:36:04,969 --> 00:36:06,369
I'm even staying away from my own child.

526
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,269
Don't come back here again.

527
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:10,239
Moving around is tiring enough.

528
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,909
You get what I mean, right?

529
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,658
I'll get a new check from the bank.

530
00:36:26,659 --> 00:36:28,929
Hello? Is this the police?

531
00:36:29,389 --> 00:36:30,690
Fine, I'm leaving.

532
00:36:46,309 --> 00:36:48,440
Hey, there. So this is where we meet.

533
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:51,480
We'll skip the handshake since my hands are full.

534
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:52,949
Then...

535
00:36:58,219 --> 00:36:59,519
(Learning Center)

536
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:10,570
So this is where you have been hiding.

537
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,570
How did you know I was here?

538
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,500
You can run, but you can't hide from me.

539
00:37:16,269 --> 00:37:17,340
I know a lot of people.

540
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:20,780
I see your husband stopped by.

541
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,550
Just leave. I'm busy as is.

542
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:25,619
Just lay it out on me. We're friends, aren't we?

543
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,349
I'm done living with him.

544
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,789
That's the vibe I got.

545
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:33,360
Took you long enough.

546
00:37:34,889 --> 00:37:36,389
You look terrible.

547
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,800
Anyway, I stopped by the department store.

548
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:42,929
Enjoy all you want. I'll always get you more.

549
00:37:43,269 --> 00:37:44,369
Leave it and go.

550
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:46,969
From what I know,

551
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,368
the guilty party usually gets kicked out of the house.

552
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:51,638
But I don't think you would've done anything wrong.

553
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:52,880
Enough.

554
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:54,679
I'm busy, so stop wasting my time.

555
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,849
I'll stay for just a minute.

556
00:37:57,179 --> 00:37:58,780
Let me know if you need anything.

557
00:37:59,019 --> 00:38:01,079
I'll always be at your beck and call.

558
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,420
Now's the time to fully take advantage of your male friend.

559
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,960
It would be better if I were your boyfriend.

560
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,190
Okay, I take it back.

561
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,900
At least get yourself a new office space.

562
00:38:16,929 --> 00:38:18,268
You'll lose your clients at this rate.

563
00:38:18,269 --> 00:38:19,739
Say another word,

564
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,610
- and you know what'll happen. - I do.

565
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,969
You and your pride.

566
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:37,019
Eun Byeol, what's going on?

567
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,289
I didn't expect you to call me.

568
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:43,059
This made my day. Is something up?

569
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:46,260
I'll be living with Mom again by the end of this month.

570
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,059
She's done with that guy.

571
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,099
Mom.

572
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:55,039
I told her to come.

573
00:38:56,739 --> 00:38:57,868
Eun Byeol, just a second.

574
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,039
Dad.

575
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,380
Follow me.

576
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,150
I'm only going to say one thing.

577
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,650
Don't take advantage of your daughter like this.

578
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,250
Listen to me when I ask nicely.

579
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,558
Honey, I'm done with that punk.

580
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:16,359
Eun Byeol wants us to get back together as well.

581
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,428
I'll do better.

582
00:39:17,429 --> 00:39:18,488
You can even quit your job as a taxi driver.

583
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:19,530
I'll earn enough for us all.

584
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,570
Honey.

585
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:25,739
I'd rather die than get back together with you.

586
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:27,769
Honey...

587
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,510
I know you.

588
00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:31,839
You'll find someone else to cheat on me with.

589
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,510
I'm asking you not to hurt our daughter.

590
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,780
And stop providing for those punks.

591
00:39:36,909 --> 00:39:39,049
It has become your pastime now.

592
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,919
It's why those punks keep entering your life.

593
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,419
Get a grip on yourself before it's too late.

594
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,449
Also...

595
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,389
If I see even a hint of a boyfriend,

596
00:39:46,059 --> 00:39:47,619
I'll be taking Eun Byeol away.

597
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:53,230
Eun Byeol.

598
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:56,730
I could get you a star if that's what you want.

599
00:39:56,929 --> 00:39:58,869
I could gladly give up my life for you.

600
00:40:00,769 --> 00:40:02,239
But I can't be with your mom.

601
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:05,909
- I hope you can understand that. - I'm sick of living alone.

602
00:40:06,309 --> 00:40:08,739
Why must I when both my parents are alive?

603
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:10,809
I'm sorry, Eun Byeol.

604
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,619
Be with your mom for now.

605
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,320
Even though we're not together,

606
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:18,289
I'll do my best to be a good dad to you.

607
00:40:28,329 --> 00:40:29,599
Gosh, I'm lonely.

608
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:34,268
Oh, dear. These past few days...

609
00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:35,809
- I seem gaunt, don't I? - It's not that.

610
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,269
- Old... - Old?

611
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,369
Have my wrinkles deepened?

612
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:42,078
Of course not. You're just as before.

613
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,679
How is it that you always look the same?

614
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,650
- Why did you imply that I was old? - Beats me.

615
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,880
I wonder why I did that.

616
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:54,219
My son-in-law is having trouble sleeping.

617
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,719
It must be the same with my son.

618
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,689
They're not over the women, are they?

619
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,630
I see you failed to get your word in.

620
00:41:00,059 --> 00:41:02,869
They didn't break up because they fell out of love.

621
00:41:02,929 --> 00:41:05,199
Both relationships ended because they got caught.

622
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,469
The ember at the core is still burning.

623
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:11,139
If they somehow get back together again...

624
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,679
Goodness.

625
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,940
What then?

626
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,110
The fire will burn hot once again.

627
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,349
Even hotter, actually.

628
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,348
But they'll be more careful this time around...

629
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:20,349
so that they don't get caught.

630
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:22,650
Gosh.

631
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,690
What can I do about it?

632
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:28,260
Just get them to divorce one another.

633
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,658
I know a paralegal who works at a law firm.

634
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:33,760
If both couples are from the same family,

635
00:41:33,929 --> 00:41:35,360
you'll be offered a package deal.

636
00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:37,170
One of their divorces will be processed for free?

637
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,300
Buy one get one free.

638
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,198
To save my money on lawyers,

639
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:42,199
you're suggesting that both my children get divorced.

640
00:41:42,369 --> 00:41:44,469
If that's where they're headed, why not do it for a bargain?

641
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,940
If I make the introductions,

642
00:41:47,941 --> 00:41:50,480
you might also get a five percent discount.

643
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,009
Why not save money in the process?

644
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,849
Money or whatnot, I won't allow a divorce...

645
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,150
no matter how cheap it'll be.

646
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,889
Could there be another option?

647
00:42:02,289 --> 00:42:04,659
This is more like a desperate fix,

648
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:07,500
but meeting the woman's parents will do the trick.

649
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,868
Confront them, humiliate them,

650
00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:11,000
and have them write a memorandum.

651
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,339
Make the whole family take responsibility.

The women had an affair with married men...

I don't want you to get kicked out in your underwear.

677
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:20,789
You turned one of us into an adulterer,

678

and the other into a fool who lost her husband to a friend.

You're a scumbag.

I told you to get out.

Can't you live with me until Mom comes back?

694

I want you to sleep here with me.

695

I want to do that too,

696

699

Yes, Auntie grilled meat for me.

I just need to sleep.

Did something happen?

711
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:07,119
I made some ramyeon.

712

You like a simple bowl of ramyeon without the egg in it.

- Yes, I did. - Where was she?

She lives in a semi-basement room.

716

And she moved her office to a smaller place too.

00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:59,729
Where do you live? Are your parents home?

817
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:01,199
Do they know that you live like this?

818
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:04,199
- They don't know. - They don't?

819
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,300
If they don't, I should let them know.

820
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:10,000
Lead the way. Let's go and talk to your parents.

821
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:12,409
What kind of parents raised their daughter like this?

822
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:15,679
Even if you meet my parents, you won't get the answer you want.

823
00:56:16,849 --> 00:56:18,280
Seeing how I am, you can probably imagine...

824
00:56:18,949 --> 00:56:20,750
what kind of people my parents are.

825
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:23,349
They might even demand money,

826
00:56:23,989 --> 00:56:25,489
saying that you ruined my future.

827
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:27,788
If the word gets out, things will only get bothersome for you.

828
00:56:27,789 --> 00:56:29,360
- What... - Things are already over.

829
00:56:29,889 --> 00:56:31,030
I won't contact him.

830
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:33,659
For Mr. Ji's sake.

831
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:38,570
Are you sure?

832
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:40,800
Yes.

833
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:44,469
If you ever go against your word, you know what will happen, right?

834
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:46,309
Be prepared.

835
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:31,989
- Mom. - Was it you?

836
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:35,690
The bookkeeper who had an affair with the chairman's son-in-law?

837
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:37,860
Was it you?

838
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,739
How could you... What do I do?

839
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,399
Should I let you live or not?

840
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,738
What do I do with you?

841
00:57:50,739 --> 00:57:52,868
Oh, gosh! What's going on?

842
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:54,639
Come on. Why are you doing this?

843
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:56,239
What's wrong?

844
00:57:56,579 --> 00:57:57,880
How could you?

845
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:07,960
- What is it, Uncle? - Eun Kang, this is bad.

846
00:58:08,059 --> 00:58:09,360
Eun San got into trouble.

847
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:12,360
What will you do now?

848
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:14,899
- Hey. - What will you do?

849
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,759
- What's going on? - I don't know either, Dae Bong.

850
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,030
Just come home.

851
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:19,570
Okay.

852
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,679
Ban Sook! Don't use violence.

853
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:30,210
Stay out of this! You don't know what she did.

854
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,309
How am I supposed to live with this shame?

855
00:58:33,849 --> 00:58:35,949
I raised you with such care.

856
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,518
How could you go after a married man?

857
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:40,288
I doubt it was Eun San's fault. The man must've approached her.

858
00:58:40,289 --> 00:58:41,319
I can't believe this.

859
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,460
A man who's over 50 and has two kids...

860
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:45,190
seduced a girl who's 20 years younger than him?

861
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:47,630
- I'll give them a piece of my mind. - Ban Sook!

862
00:58:47,699 --> 00:58:49,199
Don't get overworked.

863
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:50,969
You need to be calm about this.

864
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,198
How can I not get overworked right now?

865
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:54,698
They ruined my daughter's life!

866
00:58:54,699 --> 00:58:57,868
The thing is, Eun San would have to take the blame in this case.

867
00:58:57,869 --> 00:58:59,639
Eun San is the adulterer in this case.

868
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:02,079
- What did you say? - I mean,

869
00:59:02,139 --> 00:59:04,779
if that man's wife files a lawsuit, Eun San will be at fault.

870
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:07,050
She's at a disadvantage. She'll have to pay a fine too.

871
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:10,119
It'll be bad for Eun San if she gets a court case on her record!

872
00:59:10,489 --> 00:59:11,549
She has to pay them too?

873
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:12,820
Yes, that's the law... Gosh!

874
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,459
You crazy wench!

875
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:15,989
How could you be so thoughtless?

876
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:18,888
What's so great about an old guy that you ruined your own life?

877
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:21,260
What will you do now?

878
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,158
What will you do about your life?

879
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:25,099
What will you do?

880
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:26,629
- Eun Kang. - My goodness!

881
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:28,968
Mom, stop. Things have already happened.

882
00:59:28,969 --> 00:59:30,239
You can't solve anything by beating her.

883
00:59:30,269 --> 00:59:31,510
You knew about it, didn't you?

884
00:59:31,909 --> 00:59:33,110
Eun Kang did nothing wrong.

885
00:59:33,909 --> 00:59:34,980
You brats.

886
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:37,078
How could you let her work for a guy like that?

887
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:39,249
Eun Kang couldn't have known this would happen.

888
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:41,650
She just wanted to help her sister make money.

889
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:43,650
But you knew later on.

890
00:59:43,989 --> 00:59:45,619
If you did, you should've stopped her.

891
00:59:46,219 --> 00:59:47,519
How could you keep it quiet as her sister?

892
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:50,388
What will you do about your sister now?

893
00:59:50,389 --> 00:59:51,690
She didn't know!

894
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:53,329
She found out after things happened.

895
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,030
So why did you do it?

896
00:59:55,699 --> 00:59:57,130
Why did you drag me there?

897
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:00,198
What are you saying? Where did I drag you to?

898
01:00:00,199 --> 01:00:03,369
You dragged Eun San around to catch Dad cheating on you.

899
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:06,869
When Eun San was in eighth grade, you dragged her along...

900
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,340
and saw Dad with another woman.

901
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:12,780
She swore she'd never date any man in the future...

902
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:15,849
and that she'd never get married.

903
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:18,690
How could you make a little girl see something like that?

904
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:20,860
This is child abuse!

905
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:24,489
When did I do that?

906
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:25,789
Don't you remember?

907
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:28,329
I never once forgot about it.

908
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,630
You dragged me along several times after that too.

909
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:34,199
This crazy jerk! I ought to...

910
01:00:35,239 --> 01:00:37,369
- Ban Sook! - Don't talk badly about Mr. Ji!

911
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:40,980
He's different from you or Dad.

912
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,340
He's a decent man.

913
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:45,880
How could a decent man seduce a young girl like you?

914
01:00:45,949 --> 01:00:47,179
I seduced him first.

915
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:49,219
What?

916
01:00:50,789 --> 01:00:52,349
Say sorry to Eun San.

917
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,289
Dad might be your husband, but he's our dad.

918
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:57,690
You always looked through his phone and dug up his private life.

919
01:00:57,929 --> 01:00:59,559
Why did we have to know about that?

920
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:02,699
You dragged me along and did the same to Eun San too.

921
01:01:03,869 --> 01:01:05,800
Did you ever love us?

922
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:08,599
You should've taken care of it on your own!

923
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,369
You should've at least kept it from your own kids!

924
01:01:13,309 --> 01:01:15,079
Didn't you think of how hurt your kids would feel?

925
01:01:16,179 --> 01:01:18,510
Eun San was so young, and she was so hurt.

926
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,980
How could she have dated a guy her own age like a normal person?

927
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:25,019
You and Dad made her this way!

928
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:42,440
You must be celebrating something.

929
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:44,840
Yes.

930
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,309
Who are you?

931
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:26,679
- Who are you that you're... - I'm...

932
01:02:27,579 --> 01:02:31,019
Eun San's... I'm Cho Eun San's dad.

933
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:37,929
I'm sorry.

934
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:40,329
I'm sorry.

935
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,929
I'm sorry.

936
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:45,929
I'm sorry.

937
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:54,280
Sorry I didn't answer your call right away.

938
01:02:54,639 --> 01:02:56,340
What brought you all the way here?

939
01:02:56,809 --> 01:02:58,480
- Should we go somewhere to talk? - It's fine.

940
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,420
Where is your house? You live around here, don't you?

941
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:02,679
Lead the way.

942
01:03:03,619 --> 01:03:05,419
- Sir? - I'll get your parents to sign...

943
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:06,519
a written promise.

944
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:08,460
Only then will my daughter-in-law come back.

945
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:11,389
Don't you know who I am? Take me there now!

946
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:13,289
I'm sorry, Chairman Ko.

947
01:03:13,929 --> 01:03:15,360
Please forgive me.

948
01:03:16,199 --> 01:03:17,829
- I can't take you to my house. - Why not?

949
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:19,868
Your parents should know too.

950
01:03:19,869 --> 01:03:22,098
Their daughter seduced her friend's husband...

951
01:03:22,099 --> 01:03:23,440
and ruined her family.

952
01:03:23,469 --> 01:03:24,840
Let's see what they will say.

953
01:03:26,539 --> 01:03:28,239
I'm really sorry, sir.

954
01:03:31,309 --> 01:03:32,480
Isn't that...

955
01:03:33,179 --> 01:03:34,579
our housekeeper?

956
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:40,420
- Ma'am! - No.

957
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:41,960
I don't think it's her.

958
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:43,289
It's not?

959
01:03:44,389 --> 01:03:45,590
I think it is.

960
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:49,460
It's not. It was just someone who looks like her.

961
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:51,829
Well, then, let's go.

962
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,368
I'm really sorry, sir.

963
01:03:54,369 --> 01:03:55,570
Are you ignoring what I'm saying?

964
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:58,610
Even if you go to my house,

965
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:01,210
my parents aren't home.

966
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:02,579
They're not home?

967
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:04,380
They passed away.

968
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:08,449
I thought I heard both of your parents were alive.

969
01:04:09,019 --> 01:04:10,079
No, they're not.

970
01:04:11,449 --> 01:04:13,050
Both of my parents passed away.

971
01:04:17,389 --> 01:04:18,860
Just keep one thing in mind.

972
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:20,929
Don't get greedy with my son.

973
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:24,429
You're not good enough for him!

974
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:07,408
If we're to do...

975
01:05:07,409 --> 01:05:09,309
what you said here on that night...

976
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:13,449
I know that we shouldn't do this...

977
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,019
and that we can't.

978
01:05:19,789 --> 01:05:21,159
Despite all that...

979
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:27,630
Cha Won.

980
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,369
Let's not give up.

981
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,340
I'm afraid and scared,

982
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:37,610
but I want to see...

983
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:41,340
where the end of this path is.

984
01:06:25,619 --> 01:06:29,059
(Red Balloon)

985
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:31,929
What would it be like to live with a woman like that?

986
01:06:32,329 --> 01:06:33,530
Of course, I thought about that.

987
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:35,599
What will you do?

988
01:06:35,699 --> 01:06:37,730
Let's deal with adult problems among us adults.

989
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:39,570
Man to man.

990
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:40,738
Come on out!

991
01:06:40,739 --> 01:06:41,768
You think I'm vulgar, don't you?

992
01:06:41,769 --> 01:06:43,539
How dare you lay a hand on my son?

993
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:50,039
Is that you, Eun San?

994
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:51,909
Don't wait for me.

995
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:55,019
Do you know all about me, Cha Won?

996
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:57,320
You don't care about my feelings, do you?

997
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:00,489
What was I to you?
