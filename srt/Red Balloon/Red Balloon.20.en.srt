00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,940
You'll be at a disadvantage if this goes to court.

169
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,279
The plaintiffs usually prefer to mediate too.

170
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,679
Cho Eun Kang?

171
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,419
Tell me everything you know about that person.

172
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,620
Including her family.

173
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,320
- Did something happen? - No.

174
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,629
I thought you'd know since you dated for four years.

175
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,799
It seems like you came to me...

176
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,860
because you feel uncomfortable asking her.

177
00:12:41,169 --> 00:12:44,139
It's impossible to describe Cho Eun Kang in one word.

178
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,639
She's nice, diligent, and sacrificial.

179
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:49,110
She's also spiteful, lies a lot,

180
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,879
and doesn't get flustered when she gets caught.

181
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,139
She's hard to read,

182
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,750
so I don't know her despite dating her for four years.

183
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,620
There's a video...

184
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,620
of you guys getting yelled at by Ba Da after getting caught together.

185
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,919
Is it okay for me to ask what you're planning to do?

186
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:12,700
I guess it's not.

187
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:16,029
If I were to give you advice as someone who dated her first,

188
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,639
run away...

189
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,570
before the entire family comes and tries to get a piece of you.

190
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:20,769
What do you mean?

191
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:22,409
Her father is a taxi driver,

192
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,809
her mom works at a restaurant,

193
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:26,409
and her sister is a brat who works part-time jobs.

194
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:28,279
Have you been to her house?

195
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,250
I visited it once, and it was something out of a nightmare.

196
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:34,250
The front gate fell off as soon as we entered,

197
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,820
the floors squeaked,

198
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,259
and they gave their future son-in-law restaurant leftovers.

199
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,889
They asked me how much money I'd give them each month,

200
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:41,059
if I would live with them,

201
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,990
and to marry her before the house fell apart.

202
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,730
They were really ignorant.

203
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,769
Her uncle is a male escort.

204
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,669
Do you get the picture?

205
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,440
I heard she passed the exam to be a teacher.

206
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,779
Just wait.

207
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:02,809
The entire family will try to live off of Cho Eun Kang.

208
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,750
Her entire family is a lost cause.

209
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,049
Will you be able to handle it?

210
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,919
There's only one person who can save my sister.

211
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,220
I'm scared she might end up doing something stupid!

212
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:32,379
I'm praying to a deity that has never been on my side.

213
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:35,950
No, it doesn't matter if you're the devil.

214
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:40,049
Please be on my side just this once.

215
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,519
If you allow me to become a teacher,

216
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,389
I'll do anything.

217
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:45,960
I'll even...

218
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,360
give up on that man.

219
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:02,909
I was waiting for you to come.

220
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,639
If you follow the plaintiff around, it's considered stalking.

221
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:08,480
Should I call the police?

222
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:10,850
Hold on, Ba Da.

223
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:12,320
About the plagiarized design,

224
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,919
I gave the police all the records of my texts and phone calls...

225
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,450
with Na Bun Nyeon I had recorded.

226
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,019
Once the truth comes out, you'll believe me.

227
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:21,289
And...

228
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,190
as for the indemnity lawsuit...

229
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,200
That sounds complicated.

230
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:27,460
Just keep it simple and say lawsuit for adultery.

231
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,240
Why?

232
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,509
Why? Does it feel awkward to call yourself an adulterer?

233
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,779
Can we...

234
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,950
mediate the lawsuit for adultery instead of going to court?

235
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:46,049
I'll try to get more money than listed in the lawsuit.

236
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,120
If you want, I'll sign a contract.

237
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:49,820
A trial will take a long time...

238
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,850
I don't want to waste my breath.

239

Don't you understand what I'm saying?

240
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:03,269
I told you I didn't file the lawsuit to get your dirty money.

241
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:05,100
Let me tell you again.

242
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,139
What I want is the judge's sentencing.

243

Who else will you take advantage of after wiping out your past...

00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:11,539
and changing your identity?

The lawyers will take care of it.

What are you doing?

Just kill me.

You're blackmailing me.

Ba Da. I was being foolish.

255

If I had thought about the future,

There's only one thing that's important to me.

00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,910
She only did that once three years ago.

331
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,250
She had to do it because she needed money...

332
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,250
for her mom's surgery.

333
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:53,150
Can you see how desperate she must have been?

334
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,349
She was raised in a poor family. She probably had no choice.

335
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:58,259
Someone's life depends on your decision.

336
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,390
Put yourself in her shoes just this once.

337
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,660
How could she live with a criminal record...

338
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,890
and a ruling that brands her as an adulterer?

339
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,730
Please drop the lawsuit just this once for my sake.

340
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,569
For your sake?

341
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,299
I knew that you were slow, but you just crossed the line.

342
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:15,069
She did everything for you.

343
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,410
It's true that Eun Kang helped you all these years.

344
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,980
What do you know about her?

345
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,009
You just wait.

346
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,910
I'll show you who she really is.

347
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,619
Don't do anything you'll regret.

348
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:29,950
I know you'll regret it.

349
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,460
That's my burden to carry.

350
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,160
Ba Da!

351
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:58,279
I apologize for barging in early in the morning.

352
00:22:58,819 --> 00:23:00,480
I need you to come with me.

353
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,690
It's important.

354
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:35,650
Dae Geun!

355
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,589
Call Ms. Cho first.

356
00:23:38,589 --> 00:23:39,619
Right.

357
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,990
It's so true that old habits die hard.

358
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,160
Did you make up with Dae Geun?

359
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,599
When did we fight?

360
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,059
Don't underestimate our brotherhood.

361
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,940
Ms. Cho, your meal is ready.

362
00:23:57,809 --> 00:23:59,240
This isn't Korean beef, right?

363
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,549
I made that for Ms. Cho, not you.

364
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,519
What are you barking about? I'm Ms. Cho's father.

365
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,019
What are you chirping about?

366
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:09,789
I'm the one who brought her into the world.

367
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,960
Hey, we're such a good match.

368
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:16,130
I can't believe our daughter became a schoolteacher.

369
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,630
Exactly.

370
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,329
My goodness.

371
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,369
I can't believe our luck!

372
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:24,329
- My goodness. - My goodness.

373
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:38,250
Where are we?

374
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,920
You'll know when you go inside.

375
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,490
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

376
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:47,920
Goodness.

377
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,430
- Gosh. - Go inside.

378
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:52,559
Who's knocking on our door this early?

379
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,609
What?

380
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,279
What are you doing here?

381
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:09,549
Is this your house?

382
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:10,849
Why are you...

383
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:14,180
Are you two married?

384
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,289
I'm sorry.

385
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,329
Why did you bring us here?

386
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,299
Did you bring us here to see these two?

387
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:30,029
The boiler is broken again. I took a shower with cold water.

388
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:31,970
What? What are you doing here?

389
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,079
You were a family.

390
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,549
You said you were a Joo, not a Cho.

391
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:44,710
I'm sorry, sir!

392
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,480
So you are...

393
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,150
Eun Kang's mother?

394
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,750
I guess I am.

395
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,420
It's been a long time since I gave birth to her.

396
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:58,700
You said your parents died, and you were an orphan.

397
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:02,599
I'm sorry.

398
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,539
Let's go.

399
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,950
You should have woken me up.

400
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,589
Geum Ah.

401
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,829
I bought tofu.

402
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,569
- Goodness. - What?

403
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:37,829
Gosh.

404
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,640
What on earth is going on here?

405
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,009
How could the entire family work together to deceive us?

406
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:46,109
You.

407
00:26:46,109 --> 00:26:47,680
This is worse than not being good enough for him.

408
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,009
You're a defect!

409
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:02,990
Unbelievable.

410
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:05,230
I've been conned before.

411
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,059
But no one has done anything like this before.

412
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,430
Everyone in that family is a con artist.

413
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,799
What do you think? Did you know about this?

414
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:13,269
He probably didn't.

415
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,470
This is no joke.

416
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,369
I bet she approached us to ruin us.

417
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:18,440
She got her mother a job here and her sister at my company.

418
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:21,009
She got them to work for us, so they would spy on us for her.

419
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:24,980
Their daughters seduced my son and my son-in-law.

420
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,019
And the guy who rolled out of his room...

421
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:28,390
seduced my daughter.

422
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:31,220
What do you see in him? Why do you want to get a divorce?

423
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,089
Did Eun Kang introduce him to you too?

424
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,420
No, she didn't.

425
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,890
He and I have known each other for 24 years.

426
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,099
Chun's friend introduced Eun Kang to us ten years ago.

427
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,900
This was all a coincidence. It couldn't have been planned.

428
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,039
I'm sure she didn't intend any of this.

429
00:27:46,569 --> 00:27:48,410
She must have been desperate to secretly help her mom...

430
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,440
get a job here.

431
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,769
And the same goes for her sister.

432
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,579
She must have been anxious every time she was here.

433
00:27:52,579 --> 00:27:55,349
- What? - Whose side are you on right now?

434
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,650
I'll take her side for now.

435
00:27:58,049 --> 00:27:59,349
I'm the only one...

436
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:00,579
who can protect her now.

437
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:02,150
Even after everything?

438
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,119
- Break up with her. - I can't.

439
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,319
As a doctor, I'm supposed to save people.

440
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,359
How can I call myself a doctor if I turn my back on my people?

441
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,430
Gosh.

442
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,299
I raised you to be a doctor!

443
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:17,630
How could you use that against me?

444
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:20,799
- I'm so lonely. - You're so awful!

445
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,809
How could you be so cruel?

446
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:26,079
What do you gain from this?

447
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,380
Did you say I was cruel?

448
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,309
Think about what she did to me.

449
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:31,180
I'm just getting started.

450
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,180
Would her death make you happy?

451
00:28:33,819 --> 00:28:35,349
You know nothing about her.

452
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,619
She'll never die.

453
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,819
She's way too attached to her life.

454
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:41,490
I'm utterly disappointed in you.

455
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:43,859
I really didn't know you would go this far.

456
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,650
(Tents, imported awnings, banners)

457
00:29:07,819 --> 00:29:10,319
(Tents, imported awnings, banners)

458
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:13,650
Why were you born into this kind of family?

459
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:15,819
There's nothing for you to pick at here.

460
00:30:17,019 --> 00:30:18,559
If you're born again,

461
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,619
be born as the youngest daughter of a rich family.

462
00:30:48,049 --> 00:30:49,819
The front gate falls off as soon as you get there,

463
00:30:49,819 --> 00:30:51,119
and the floor creaks.

464
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,309
Is anyone home?

465
00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:21,150
Nice to meet you. My name is Ko Cha Won.

466
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:23,750
I'm the person who has promised to have a future with Eun Kang.

467
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:27,759
It's me. You've seen me before.

468
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,730
You haven't met my husband before, though.

469
00:31:29,859 --> 00:31:31,759
I'm Eun Kang's father.

470
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,130
Hello.

471
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,900
Let's go out and talk.

472
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,869
I'll stick with her no matter what happens.

473
00:31:43,339 --> 00:31:44,809
I came here to tell you that.

474
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,910
- I said, we need to go out. - Just talk here.

475
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,380
Don't get mad.

476
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,950
She takes after me, so she gets mad when she likes something.

477
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,349
I'll see you next time.

478
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:05,230
Just go home.

479
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:06,829
I know you're having a hard time, Eun Kang.

480
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,299
How would you know when you haven't experienced it?

481
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:14,299
It's so embarrassing I want to die.

482
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,009
I can't even look you in the eye.

483
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,339
We're on the same side.

484
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:20,980
- Look at me. - No.

485
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,710
Let's stop.

486
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,680
I'm tired of everything now.

487
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:27,349
I don't want to see anyone, regardless of love.

488
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,450
I'm sorry, Cha Won.

489
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,190
If I hadn't tempted you,

490
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,019
you would've been living happily right now.

491
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:34,660
I'm really sorry.

I told you I was tired of everything now.

You asked me not to give up.

518

Because I didn't know.

Is that true?

It's true.

Yes, she asked to end things during the returns incident.

This is wrong, Mom.

Even if I get revenge, I won't take it like this.

666
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,579
She has to be humiliated.

She wants to ruin you and become a teacher?

She looked after Mi Poong and took care of you, Mom.

She did every errand I asked of her.

670

For 20 years, she ran every errand for me.

671

You paid her to do that.

You think people would do that for money?

She was my hands and feet for 20 years.

I can't destroy her like this.

She worked so hard for this.

would she have done this?

00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:01,989
probably because I wanted to be easy on you.

818
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,389
I had our friendship necklace on...

819
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:07,300
right until I found out that you were working with...

820

Na Bun Nyeon.

821

For the first time in my life,

822
00:57:15,539 --> 00:57:17,340
I went to your house and got stunned.

823
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:21,480
I went there out of spite,

824
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,210
but when I actually arrived, your house...

825
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:29,679
and your family...

826
00:57:35,559 --> 00:57:37,460
I thought I could understand...

827
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:41,730
how your life had been...

828
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:43,929
and how much you struggled, wanting to escape.

829
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:45,570
I felt so bad for you like crazy.

830
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,440
But then, I hated and resented you.

831
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,309
I thought I'd regret it my whole life...

832
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:57,880
if I was harsh on you.

833

I thought...

00:58:21,099 --> 00:58:23,000
I'd never get to hold this hand again.

838

I wish all this were a dream.

Shut it, and let's hurry on.

840
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,579
Did you submit it to the principal?

841
00:58:35,019 --> 00:58:36,019
No.

842
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:38,590
Your forgiveness is enough.

843
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:41,559
I already made up my mind.

844
00:58:41,789 --> 00:58:43,019
What is wrong with you?

845
00:58:43,659 --> 00:58:45,530
You have to survive somehow.

846
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:46,929
I didn't give up.

847
00:58:48,329 --> 00:58:49,429
I'm doing this to live.

848
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:51,869
I have forgiven you.

849
00:58:51,869 --> 00:58:53,670
I can't forgive myself.

850
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:57,909
I need to punish myself for how foolish I was.

851
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:02,210
Only then, I will be able to live.

852

01:11:01,029 --> 01:11:03,460
I don't have to compare myself with others or be compared.

983

I can just be myself.

I didn't know a freshwater fish could die dreaming of the ocean.

I told you that I wanted to stay single.

991
01:11:26,689 --> 01:11:28,689
I got these for you. They're books and school supplies.

"LFW." You rock.

993
01:11:31,789 --> 01:11:33,359
I told you not to use such abbreviations.

Gosh, you sound like a boomer.

Hey, these are heavy.

When do you plan to leave?

998

I'll give the kids haircuts and bake some bread for them too.

And I'll help the medical team when they treat the ladies.

You're doing well, right? How's your health?

Gosh, my dear daughter.

When will you visit us?

1010
01:12:14,939 --> 01:12:16,369
I'll make braised short ribs for you.

1011

With premium Korean beef.

1012

I'll visit you next month.

1013

Mom, I could only send 100 dollars this month.

Money is the best remedy for her.

1016
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,220
Bye, Dad. I'll be home in a few days.

1017
01:12:29,619 --> 01:12:32,119
I'll call you, Mom. Don't fight with Dad.

We never fight.

Life's boring because we never fight.

My dear daughters, take care of yourselves.
