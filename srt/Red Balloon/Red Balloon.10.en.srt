1
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:05,018
(Red Balloon)

2
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:07,419
(All characters,
organizations, and events...)

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,850
(in this drama are fictitious.)

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,259
(Episode 10)

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,930
Who could that be?

6
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:21,799
Wait.

7
00:00:53,499 --> 00:00:54,770
No one was there.

8
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,100
It was probably a mistake.

9
00:00:57,999 --> 00:00:59,498
Why did you cover up my
mouth with your dirty hands?

10
00:00:59,499 --> 00:01:00,579
Gosh. Your hands are salty.

11
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:03,115
I thought you wanted me to end this today.

12
00:01:03,139 --> 00:01:05,008
I was supposed to put an end to it.
Why did you stop me?

13
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:06,949
You need to be careful now.

14
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,979
Barging in there and destroying
them is the right thing to do.

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,679
But I learned that there were
better ways to handle it.

16
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,040
- What do you mean?
- Let's say...

17
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,558
you open that door and see them
together with your own eyes.

18
00:01:17,559 --> 00:01:19,389
Then what do you think will happen?

19
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:21,930
It will be over. You won't
be able to take it back.

20
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,660
You can't fix it then.

21
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,629
On top of that, if you witness the scene,

22
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,598
you will never be able
to get over that shock.

23
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,240
Have you heard of traumas?

24
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,210
You will be traumatized...

25
00:01:35,339 --> 00:01:37,439
until the day you die.

26
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,980
Sir, you like to check all four corners.

27
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,079
Now that you know where they
are, you don't have to do it now.

28
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,749
You can ambush them whenever you want.

29
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:48,319
So you should take a few
days to think about it.

30
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,559
Your hands are so salty!

31
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,260
That's not important right now.

32
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:01,029
Firstly, find out how your
daughter feels about it.

33
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,368
Secondly, what will you do
with your grandchildren?

34
00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:05,700
Thirdly, what will happen to the business?

35
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,569
And so on. There are so
many things to consider.

36
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:11,710
But if you still think
you need to end this,

37
00:02:11,779 --> 00:02:14,580
you can call me. I'll
smooth things over for you.

38
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,419
We'll catch them red-handed, take
pictures, and file a lawsuit.

39
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,549
There's no way he can get away with this.

40
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,950
By the time you kick him
out, he won't have anything.

41
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,190
He'll only have his underwear.

42
00:02:22,619 --> 00:02:24,396
You might think that's
being too generous even.

43
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,760
But he needs his underwear.

44
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,089
Otherwise, he'll be charged
with public indecency.

45
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,700
My brother is an expert in this.

46
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,038
Honey, don't leave us.

47
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:44,180
- Dad.
- Dad.

48
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:45,539
Nam Chul.

49
00:02:45,779 --> 00:02:47,679
- I'm sorry.
- Dad.

50
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,849
- Dad!
- Nam Chul!

51
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,150
You can't leave like this.

52
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,080
- What about the kids?
- Dad.

53
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,049
And what about my daughter, Geum Ah?

54
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,860
What about the business?

55
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,420
Hey, Nam Chul!

56
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,528
Nam Chul!

57
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:03,830
Nam Chul, no!

58
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,418
Cha Won called.

59
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:01,465
He said he wanted to have
a meal with you this week.

60
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:02,520
Tell him I'm good.

61
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,760
And you need to stop
relaying his messages to me.

62
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,729
Watch me. He's not getting
anything from me...

63
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,029
for his inheritance.

64
00:04:13,529 --> 00:04:14,599
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,140
Thank you for the food.

66
00:04:18,969 --> 00:04:20,986
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

67
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,616
Make sure to brush your teeth
thoroughly before you go.

68
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,186
Do you want me to drive you to the school?

69
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,339
Your truck is junk, Dad.

70
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,049
It's not.

71
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,419
How could he change so much over money?
How cunning.

72
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,049
No wonder the housekeeper
said he was having an affair.

73
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:36,520
Money is the best remedy, I guess.

74
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,296
Right. He became a different person
after getting back the bankbooks.

75
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,166
Dad. You should have done
that a long time ago.

76
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,229
Unlike before,

77
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,330
he hums in the bathroom in the morning too.

78
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:45,536
And he looks great from behind too.

79
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,229
He doesn't work out, but he looks so fit.

80
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:48,969
People might think he's not even married.

81
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:52,870
Good for you for having a fit husband.

82
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,469
How dense you are.

83
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:56,909
I'm so lonely!

84
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,539
What?

85
00:04:58,739 --> 00:04:59,839
What's gotten into him?

86
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,750
I don't know what's bothering him.

87
00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:04,856
Is he jealous because I
complimented my husband's body?

88
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,049
He's fit too.

89
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:07,890
He has a bulging belly.

90
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,520
Men are useless when they get old.

91
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,020
They're useless.

92
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,559
But when Ba Da called the police,

93
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,028
the first person you asked for was Dad.

94
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:15,130
That's because...

95
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,330
You tend to remember useless stuff.

96
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,029
You still haven't decided?

97
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,899
My business principle is
not borrowing money...

98
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,010
from other people.

99
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:28,710
But if you do, you'll hit the jackpot.

100
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:31,239
Can't Cha Won help out?

101
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,239
My second business principle is...

102
00:05:33,609 --> 00:05:36,409
not talking about my
business with my husband.

103
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,549
Can't you borrow money from Ki Han?

104
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,719
Wouldn't he be happy to help you?

105
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,525
I don't want to get mixed up with Ki Han.

106
00:05:42,549 --> 00:05:45,069
It won't be a problem as long as
you keep it strictly business.

107
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,130
You just need to buy the rubies.

108
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,599
Then why don't you ask your father-in-law?

109
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,630
No.

110
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:53,476
You know that he's stingy
when it comes to money.

111
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,630
You know that.

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,870
There is someone I can ask.

113
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:01,239
There is?

114
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,839
Mother, I'm home.

115
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,650
What are you doing here?

116
00:06:08,609 --> 00:06:10,580
I wanted to take you somewhere.

117
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:12,779
We can talk there. Let's get going.

118
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,019
What are you doing? I'm not going anywhere.

119
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,548
Just come with me. I'm
sure you'll be happy there.

120
00:06:16,549 --> 00:06:18,120
Gosh. Forget it.

121
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:21,428
You're not getting out of it this easily.

122
00:06:21,429 --> 00:06:22,989
Do you think I'll have a meal with you?

123
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,658
- Mother.
- Gosh.

124
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:25,830
It's not a meal.

125
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,000
Let's just go.

126
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,129
Gosh. What are you doing,
barging into my home?

127
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,168
- I'm sure you'll be happy there.
- Gosh.

128
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:33,739
Why are you so strong? Gosh.

129
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,010
Hey, Geum Ah!

130
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,538
Your friends go to bathhouses...

131
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:42,179
with their daughters-in-law.
And you envy that.

132
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,019
You said we should be able to fart...

133
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,060
and be comfortable naked
around each other to bond.

134
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,890
Why don't we start doing that
as we get massages naked today?

135
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,960
But I won't fart in front of you.

136
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:53,089
It was so funny when you said...

137
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,639
we should be naked around each other.

138
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,390
To bond with people, they have to share...

139
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:58,509
their inner thoughts and
show each other in the raw.

140
00:06:58,929 --> 00:07:01,728
Men work out together and go
to a dry sauna for a reason.

141
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:02,830
Right.

142
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:06,039
I want to bond with you starting today.

143
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:11,678
I know that you want to
gloss over what happened...

144
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:13,950
I won't gloss over it, Mother.

145
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,380
I'll be loyal to you.

146
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,650
Please turn around.

147
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,820
You dragged me here to get on my good side.

148
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,460
This is what con artists do. Or what else?

149
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,799
Money? I don't have any money.

150
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:39,738
Your late father left
behind some assets for you.

151
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:41,810
- Who said that?
- Mother.

152
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:44,338
If you don't invest, you
won't make any money off it.

153
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,839
I'm a businesswoman.

154
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:48,210
You can read this.

155
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,319
Oddly, when I try to
read anything on paper,

156
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,720
my head hurts.

157
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,419
It's precisely what I explained.

158
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,336
I'll give you 10 percent interest
for lending it to me for 3 months.

159
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,390
Ten percent?

160
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:00,688
For example,

161
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:01,989
if you lend me 100,000 dollars, the
interest will be 10,000 dollars.

162
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,760
I know that. Do you think I'm that dumb?

163
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,299
But I don't want to get scammed...

164
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,068
by my daughter-in-law.

165
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:10,428
We'll draw up an IOU too.

166
00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:11,639
Of course.

167
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,639
I'll give you the interest in advance.

168
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,740
In advance?

169
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:18,555
If I lend you 100,000 dollars,
you'll give me 10,000 dollars...

170
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:20,439
- first, right?
- Yes.

171
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,380
And you'll pay me back after three months?

172
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:23,709
Yes, Mother.

173
00:08:25,549 --> 00:08:27,819
This has to stay between us.

174
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,590
If your father-in-law finds
out, he'll kick me out.

175
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,989
What about Cha Won?

176
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,360
You can't tell him either.
He's loose-lipped.

177
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:39,429
How much do you need?

178
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,469
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

179
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,438
- Did you get the email?
- Ms. Han wanted to check...

180
00:08:45,439 --> 00:08:47,208
- Can you sell me some rubies?
- If you could help us.

181
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:49,469
- How much can you send me?
- Yes.

182
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,438
- The faster, the better.
- How much in stock do you have?

183
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:53,240
Can you send it to me via courier now?

184
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,949
Okay.

185
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:56,850
Are you done?

186
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,350
They'll check four places
and give us a call back.

187
00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:01,789
Right. You have suppliers abroad.

188
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,265
We can process the shipment as
we handle the domestic shipment.

189
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:05,360
Okay.

190
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:09,929
How's Mom?

191
00:09:10,189 --> 00:09:12,699
She went out yesterday. And
she seemed a bit better.

192
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,946
I asked if I should make Ba Da
come and beg for forgiveness,

193
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,740
and she said, "Let her be. She's busy.
Why would I do that?"

194
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,599
She seemed less angry.

195
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,739
That's typical Mom.

196
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,208
She gets angry and gets over it on her own.

197
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:23,840
That's what tortures people around her.

198
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,278
Whenever she does that,
she drives us crazy.

199
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,610
Just accept it as your fate.

200
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,685
What choice do you have? Since
her mother already moved in,

201
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:31,448
you should try to win brownie
points with your wife.

202
00:09:31,449 --> 00:09:33,949
We're bound to like people
who are good to our parents.

203
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,720
- It's the same with me.
- Geum Ah.

204
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,288
You need to be nice to your husband.

205
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:38,719
There's no one like him.

206
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,236
I'm learning how uncomfortable
it is to live with your in-laws.

207
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,558
I can't even dress comfortably at home.

208
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,706
I almost made things awkward
when I went out in underwear.

209
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,798
Really?

210
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,328
I get it. It had always been your family.

211
00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:49,600
Ba Da will get so angry if she hears this.

212
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,669
But I don't want to go home after work now.

213
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,908
I need to act nice when
I see my mother-in-law.

214
00:09:54,909 --> 00:09:56,169
I have to be friendly.

215
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,840
"What did you eat? How
are you feeling today?"

216
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:00,708
You can't find a guy better than Nam Chul.

217
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:02,356
He moved into our house after the wedding.

218
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,740
And our parents are a handful too.

219
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,579
Treat him like a king.

220
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:07,389
What if he gets sick of our
parents and has an affair?

221
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,918
Let him. I'm not scared. Gosh.

222
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,189
You just focus on your family.

223
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,559
Hey, since I'm here, can
I get a shot of Botox?

224
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,789
Forget it.

225
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,870
I'm sorry...

226
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:23,970
that Ba Da and I fought when you were here.

227
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,140
I'm sorry.

228
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:27,669
Is that why you came here
during your lunchtime?

229
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,469
Try not to fight.

230
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,678
I'm sorry that I made things uncomfortable.

231
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:32,779
No.

232
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,650
Try it.

233
00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:37,319
It's been so long since I had it.

234
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,220
You had it a few days ago.

235
00:10:40,049 --> 00:10:41,120
You're right.

236
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,459
That's how forgetful I am when
people try hard to look after me.

237
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:51,059
This is good.

238
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,069
Ba Da must be busy these days.

239
00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:55,798
Her jewelry was well-received
on the home-shopping network.

240
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:57,739
So she's busy trying to
prepare for the second show.

241
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,839
She didn't have enough
cash to buy the stones,

242
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,080
so she thought about giving up.

243
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,970
Did she get the money?

244
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:03,640
I think she did.

245
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,740
Cha Won.

246
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,309
Can you show me how I can
make voice recordings?

247
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,160
Do you need to record something?

248
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:12,919
- Yes.
- It's simple.

249
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:17,288
Open this up and tap this.

250
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:18,289
Do you see this red button?

251
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,930
If you tap this, it will start recording.

252
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,209
Cleaning becomes a big task
when you have a big yard.

253
00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:40,640
There are some downsides to being rich.

254
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:42,309
I'll get going then.

255
00:11:42,549 --> 00:11:44,179
I finished making the side dishes.

256
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,449
- Good work.
- Sure.

257
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,230
Eun Kang.

258
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,229
You didn't mess up, right?

259
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,029
- No.
- Always be careful.

260
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,500
- Go.
- Okay.

261
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,939
The housekeeper does
make tasty side dishes.

262
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:10,270
They're perfectly seasoned.

263
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:15,179
If...

264
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,019
you were to divorce your husband,

265
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,740
do you think you could be okay on your own?

266
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,419
Divorce him?

267
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,800
Why are you suddenly asking me that?

268
00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:28,489
I was just asking.

269
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,360
Is this about Nam Chul pulling out money...

270
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:33,005
from the company bank account to pay
for his father's dental implants?

271
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:34,168
No.

272
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:36,068
Dad, remember what you said?

273
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:38,399
Our family will be a mess without him.

274
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,568
To be honest, even if we hire people,

275
00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:40,869
they'll pocket some money anyway.

276
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:44,340
Besides, I never thought
about divorcing him.

277
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:47,678
When you made me marry him, I resented you.

278
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:50,055
But now, I know that marrying
him was the right thing to do.

279
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,880
He will make any woman happy.

280
00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:54,489
Cha Won told me...

281
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,890
that living with his mother-in-law
was really uncomfortable.

282
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:58,890
And Nam Chul has been
doing it for 18 years.

283
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:01,689
Are you disappointed in Nam Chul?

284
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:03,029
No.

285
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,269
What if he has an affair?

286
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,698
He's definitely having an affair.

287

Can I help you?

478
00:25:41,449 --> 00:25:42,550
That's my room.

479
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:46,290
Where's the student who used to stay here?

480
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,518
How should I know?

481
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:49,130
I moved in a few days ago.

482
00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:01,839
- I don't know either.
- She didn't come here.

483
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,809
How can you not know
that your kid is missing?

484
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,885
Why are you yelling at me when
you only just found out yourself?

485
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:07,478
She's busy with the diner!

486
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:08,749
Why you...

487
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,449
Why does he always
choose to get in my face?

488
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:12,919
His presence sickens me.

489
00:26:12,979 --> 00:26:14,519
Can't he at least change his clothes?

490
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,748
He's always shuddering like a wet dog.

491
00:26:15,749 --> 00:26:17,518
Leave him be. Why does
he need warm clothes...

492
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:18,566
when he spends his day indoors?

493
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,958
Maybe you could get me new clothes.

494
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:21,120
Remove him, will you?

495
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,589
I'm sick and tired of his face.

496
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,728
Why did you even come here, then?

497
00:26:23,729 --> 00:26:25,259
This is all your fault!

498
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,928
Anyway, find Eun Byeol.

499
00:26:27,929 --> 00:26:29,329
If you don't, we'll both pay for it.

500
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:30,698
I can't have anything happen to her.

501
00:26:30,699 --> 00:26:31,938
How am I supposed to survive?

502
00:26:31,939 --> 00:26:32,939
Why you...

503
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:39,709
Darling, are you all right?
Do you need a doctor?

504
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,709
I can't believe you slammed your head.

505
00:26:42,249 --> 00:26:44,449
Must you be like a thug and terrorize him?

506
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,889
- Worry about your kid like that.
- Darling.

507
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,890
- Are you all right?
- Rather than someone else's.

508
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,340
Ba Da, where are you?

509
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,080
I have something to say.

510
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,890
Why don't you join me?
I'll text you the address.

511
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:26,079
Will Eun Kang be joining us?

512
00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:28,759
Yes, once she's done
with her part-time job.

513
00:27:30,229 --> 00:27:31,390
I hope she doesn't come.

514
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:33,860
I'm sick of how she's always around you.

515
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,469
Back in the day,

516
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,630
why were you against me dating her?

517
00:27:37,729 --> 00:27:39,239
She's not yours to keep.

518
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,400
I know. The one for me is you.

519
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,668
Be honest with me.

520
00:27:42,669 --> 00:27:45,349
You don't want her for yourself,
but you can't let others have her.

521
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,709
Of course.

522
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:51,880
I asked your mom why you
kept Eun Kang so close.

523
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:54,026
She said it was because you
could pay her to do anything,

524
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,620
and you couldn't find anyone like her.

525
00:27:56,019 --> 00:27:58,019
She was easy to have at your beck and call.

526
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,389
She also said she'd always join you two...

527
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,870
when she wanted to be alone with you.

528
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:02,130
Is she that dense?

529
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:08,699
Eun Kang.

530
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,229
I'm sorry it took me a while.

531
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,429
Hello.

532
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:12,900
Welcome.

533
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,669
We've been dying for you to join us.

534
00:28:17,709 --> 00:28:19,349
Maybe we should have Cha Won join us too.

535
00:28:19,479 --> 00:28:21,880
It's fine. You said you
had something to tell me.

536
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,150
What?

537
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,219
It's just...

538
00:28:30,749 --> 00:28:32,390
(Uncle Dae Geun, Missed calls)

539
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:35,159
Eun Kang, it's urgent. Please call me back.

540
00:28:35,229 --> 00:28:36,330
Excuse me for a second.

541
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,929
- Uncle, what's wrong?
- Eun Kang.

542
00:28:43,969 --> 00:28:46,370
What do I do? Eun Byeol's gone.

543
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,400
What?

544
00:28:49,409 --> 00:28:50,469
Eun Byeol...

545
00:28:50,739 --> 00:28:52,580
- My Eun Byeol...
- What happened?

546
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,880
Eun Byeol's gone, and it's been a few days.

547
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,650
Eun Kang, I can't live without her.

548
00:28:57,979 --> 00:28:59,549
Please find her for me.

549
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:02,620
Uncle, don't worry. I'm
sure nothing bad happened.

550
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:04,188
She's smart, remember?

551
00:29:04,189 --> 00:29:06,266
I posted it on social media. I'm
sure we'll be contacted soon.

552
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,635
You can even find lost dogs these days.

553
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:09,630
- Even dogs?
- Yes.

554
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:12,830
My guess is that she's at a friend's house.

555
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,999
Has she not been in contact?

556
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:18,090
I checked dry saunas, but she wasn't there.

557
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,239
I'll check local study rooms.

558
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,016
- I'll check karaoke rooms.
- Good.

559
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,269
Let's split up and search the neighborhood.

560
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,350
Sorry about that.

561
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,429
Eun Byeol!

562
00:29:54,739 --> 00:29:55,810
Eun Byeol?

563
00:29:56,439 --> 00:29:57,509
Eun Byeol.

564
00:29:58,169 --> 00:29:59,209
Sorry about that.

565
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,380
Can you get the door?

566
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:10,919
Pick it up.

567
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,020
Weren't you able to find her?

568
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:18,130
Who does this troublemaker take after?

569
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:23,070
(Han Ba Da)

570
00:30:26,439 --> 00:30:27,469
Hello?

571
00:30:28,239 --> 00:30:29,310
Ki Han, is that you?

572
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:31,409
Where's Ba Da?

573
00:30:31,469 --> 00:30:33,056
She was drunk, so I took the call instead.

574
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,140
I see.

575
00:30:34,939 --> 00:30:36,650
Can you make sure she gets home?

576
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:39,050
Thanks.

577
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:43,850
(Ko Cha Won)

578
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:48,759
- Eun Kang.
- You should know that...

579
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:51,928
we celebrated all of Ba Da's
jewelry being sold out tonight.

580
00:30:51,929 --> 00:30:53,030
With Mr. Shin.

581
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:55,498
- Is that so?
- We met since he offered...

582
00:30:55,499 --> 00:30:56,530
to pay for drinks,

583
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,169
but I had to leave early.

584
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,969
A family matter came up.

585
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:03,439
I got worried and called Ba
Da, but Mr. Shin picked up.

586
00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:06,580
I think Ba Da had a bit too much to drink.

587
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:09,449
I thought you should go to her.

588
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,650
Where is she?

589
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,620
Right.

590
00:31:15,989 --> 00:31:17,350
You know,

591
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:20,189
being with you scares me.

592
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:23,630
I like you as a friend.

593
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:27,400
But I'm worried you'll
find a way to my heart...

594
00:31:28,229 --> 00:31:31,169
once I let my guard down.

595
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,439
Don't you cross the line.

596
00:31:35,169 --> 00:31:36,509
If you do,

597
00:31:37,169 --> 00:31:38,640
you'll be scolded.

598
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,179
You're really adorable
when you get like this.

599
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,320
Am I adorable?

600
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,019
You're hilarious.

601
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,090
No one has ever called me adorable before.

602
00:31:52,259 --> 00:31:54,820
I'm more sexy than cute.

603
00:31:55,229 --> 00:31:56,390
Watch.

604
00:32:08,499 --> 00:32:10,639
It's been a while. You
remember me, don't you?

605
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,909
I'm Shin Ki Han. We met at your wedding.

606
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:19,150
Of course. You're Ba Da's
one and only male friend.

607
00:32:22,749 --> 00:32:24,319
You haven't aged at all.

608
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,688
Dermatologists must receive
a lot of skin treatments.

609
00:32:26,689 --> 00:32:27,719
Of course.

610
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,658
How can I care for my clients...

611
00:32:29,659 --> 00:32:30,958
when I don't know how
effective the treatments are?

612
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:33,900
Would receiving those treatments
give me skin like yours?

613
00:32:34,659 --> 00:32:36,419
Actually, good genetics
play a pivotal role.

614
00:32:37,169 --> 00:32:38,889
But it's also crucial to put in the effort.

615
00:32:40,739 --> 00:32:42,619
- Did she have a lot to drink?
- Only a little.

616
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:45,109
I took her out to celebrate
her jewelry being sold out.

617
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,080
Thanks for that.

618
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,449
Things haven't been easy on her.

619
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,979
- What?
- The canceled exhibition.

620
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,248
She even pressed charges,

621
00:32:56,249 --> 00:32:58,209
but the other party fled
and now can't be caught.

622
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,719
- Didn't you know?
- Yes,

623
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:02,729
- of course, I knew.
- Her pride is everything,

624
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:05,059
so it must've been humiliating
to have been called a thief.

625
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,929
I was proud to see her take it in stride,

626
00:33:07,229 --> 00:33:09,769
so I let her drink as much as she wanted.

627
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,229
I hope I'm not in trouble.

628
00:33:13,769 --> 00:33:14,840
Ba Da.

629
00:33:18,469 --> 00:33:19,880
Ba Da, your husband's here.

630
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,179
Wake up, Ba Da.

631
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,479
Ba Da, wake up.

632
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,019
- Ba Da.
- Ba Da.

633
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,889
- Ba Da.
- She's out of it.

634
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:31,990
I'll carry her.

635
00:33:33,189 --> 00:33:34,389
Forget it.

636
00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:36,139
Her husband should be the one to carry her.

637
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:47,400
Leave us be. I'll manage on my own.

638
00:33:48,769 --> 00:33:50,669
Ba Da, snap out of it.

639
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,309
What is wrong with you?

640
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,510
Where is it?

641
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,479
My right-side pocket.

642
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:36,720
No, my pants.

643
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:48,630
Unbelievable.

644
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,610
Get the back door.

645
00:35:09,189 --> 00:35:10,320
Wake up, will you?

646
00:35:10,749 --> 00:35:12,090
I can't believe you got wasted.

647
00:35:16,329 --> 00:35:18,229
Ki Han.

648
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:20,160
I'm here. Get home safely, then.

649
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,899
Ki Han, take care.

650
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,869
I had a great time today.

651
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:29,639
You're a great friend. I'll see you around.

652
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,389
I can't believe she drank this much.

653
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:55,430
Where was she tonight?

654
00:35:56,729 --> 00:35:58,430
I'm sorry she put you through this.

655
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,990
It's hard to carry someone
who's limp and barely conscious.

656
00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:02,308
Weren't you accompanying her?

657
00:36:02,309 --> 00:36:03,970
She had drinks with Shin Ki Han.

658
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:20,519
Can I fix you a snack?

659
00:36:22,229 --> 00:36:24,689
I'm fine. You should turn in as well.

660
00:36:25,229 --> 00:36:26,729
How about a fried egg?

661
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,130
It's fine.

662
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:30,400
I'm actually done.

663
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,760
How did I get home?

664
00:37:02,229 --> 00:37:03,769
Cha Won carried you in.

665
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:05,800
Why did you get wasted?

666
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,970
That's right. I remember him
picking me up at the bar.

667
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,455
He said you had drinks with Ki Han.

668
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:13,579
Was it just you two?

669
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,679
Yes, Eun Kang left early
because something came up.

670
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,349
Where is he anyway?

671
00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:20,779
I think he went to sleep
in Mi Poong's room.

672
00:37:21,249 --> 00:37:22,449
Anyone would be upset...

673
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,865
to see his wife drinking with another man.

674
00:37:23,889 --> 00:37:24,950
Apologize to him.

675
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,990
Why should I apologize
when I did nothing wrong?

676
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:36,998
Dae Geun.

677
00:37:36,999 --> 00:37:38,130
- What?
- Dae Geun.

678
00:37:40,869 --> 00:37:42,569
Where on earth did you
get wasted like this?

679
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,169
And why weren't you picking up?

680
00:37:44,369 --> 00:37:45,439
- Dae Bong.
- Yes?

681
00:37:45,809 --> 00:37:47,979
I should just go out and die.

682
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:51,150
Someone like me doesn't deserve to live.

683
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,180
Eun Byeol...

684
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,288
What if something bad
happened to Eun Byeol?

685
00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:04,829
What am I going to do?

686
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:08,558
No one lives because they deserve it.

687
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:10,475
We just carry on fooling
and tricking the world.

688
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:11,929
Don't worry too much about Eun Byeol.

689
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:14,240
We would've been notified
if anything had happened.

690
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:17,010
Hey! Don't you dare!

691
00:38:17,139 --> 00:38:18,869
- Hey!
- Hurry!

692
00:38:19,979 --> 00:38:21,208
Unbelievable.

693
00:38:21,209 --> 00:38:22,410
Watch it.

694
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:26,419
Eun Byeol!

695
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,289
Eun Byeol.

696
00:38:32,419 --> 00:38:35,459
That's the toilet, not Eun Byeol.

697
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:38,159
I can't believe you threw up on me.

698
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,499
What a waste of food.

699
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,199
Did you have pajeon?

700
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,768
The makgeolli place down the
street makes a mean pajeon.

701
00:38:43,769 --> 00:38:45,329
You've got to be kidding me.

702
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:48,269
You would've thrown a fit
had it been me throwing up.

703
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,138
Because it's your dear brother,

704
00:38:50,139 --> 00:38:51,868
you're cleaning up the
vomit without complaining.

705
00:38:51,869 --> 00:38:53,078
Why don't you just eat it instead?

706
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:54,439
What are you barking about?

707
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,709
Eun Byeol...

708
00:38:55,734 --> 00:38:57,705
Crying into the toilet will do you no good.

709
00:38:57,809 --> 00:38:59,419
That naughty girl.

710
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,470
She should know better
than to roam the streets.

711
00:39:04,189 --> 00:39:05,319
What did you just say?

712
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,840
It's not like I said what wasn't true.

713
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,529
Did you call Eun Byeol naughty?

714
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:13,810
Of course, she's a naughty girl.

715
00:39:13,999 --> 00:39:16,328
Eun Kang and Eun San never
did anything like this.

716
00:39:16,329 --> 00:39:17,469
Stop that!

717
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:19,199
You have done nothing for her...

718
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,939
which gives you no right to say that.

719
00:39:21,439 --> 00:39:24,509
My unfortunate Eun Byeol
was abandoned by her mom...

720
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,240
and also her dad.

721
00:39:26,939 --> 00:39:28,179
She's now missing,

722
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,779
and we have no way of knowing
if she's dead or alive,

723
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,779
so how can you talk about her like that?

724
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,149
- No one told you to get divorced.
- What?

725
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,618
Divorce isn't for everybody.

726
00:39:35,619 --> 00:39:37,748
It's for those who can actually afford it.

727
00:39:37,749 --> 00:39:39,860
I didn't stay married because I wanted to.

728
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,118
Those who have nothing to their names...

729
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:44,689
are left with zilch the
second we get a divorce.

730
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,630
If I had the money,
I would've left your brother.

731
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:49,999
Go ahead, then!

732
00:39:50,369 --> 00:39:53,038
No one's stopping you, so divorce him.

733
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:55,400
- What?
- Stop. You've gone too far.

734
00:39:55,709 --> 00:39:57,069
Cho Dae Bong,

735
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:59,109
your brother just told me to get a divorce.

736
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,979
- How dare he?
- Calm down.

737
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,079
What I meant...

738
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:05,478
- is that I'm hurting inside.
- Stay put.

739
00:40:05,479 --> 00:40:08,280
I don't need you adding fuel to the flame!

740
00:40:08,479 --> 00:40:10,150
Are you glaring at me?

741
00:40:10,289 --> 00:40:11,519
Cho Dae Bong,

742
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,810
are you going to let your
brother talk to me this way?

743
00:40:14,019 --> 00:40:15,459
Just let it slide for today.

744
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:17,630
Dae Geun, let's get you in bed.

745
00:40:18,229 --> 00:40:20,558
This is why you should
never take people in.

746
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:23,629
I'm probably the only one who
spent her wedding night...

747
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,630
in a house along with her brother-in-law.

748
00:40:25,869 --> 00:40:27,998
I cooked for you, did your laundry,

749
00:40:27,999 --> 00:40:29,839
and raised you until you got married.

750
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,479
After the divorce, I took you
in and did it all over again.

751
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,979
And this is how you repay me?

752
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,510
Who else can I blame though?

753
00:40:36,849 --> 00:40:38,410
Cho Dae Bong, this is all on you!

754
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,220
Eun Byeol...

755
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:47,720
I'm...

756
00:40:48,689 --> 00:40:50,059
sorry.

757
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,059
Get some sleep.

758
00:40:56,229 --> 00:40:59,869
Our sweet Dae Geun, good night.

759
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:03,709
Sleep tight.

760
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,979
Goodness.

761
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:14,450
What's the matter with you?

762
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,888
Have him leave. I can't stand him anymore.

763
00:41:16,889 --> 00:41:18,389
What are you barking about?

764
00:41:18,749 --> 00:41:21,489
Can't you be more sympathetic
since he just lost his daughter?

765
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:22,958
How patient must I be?

766
00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:24,089
From start to finish.

767
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,458
From head to toe.

768
00:41:25,459 --> 00:41:27,900
- From Mt. Baekdu to Mt. Halla.
- What?

769
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,668
Don't you feel sorry for him?

770
00:41:29,669 --> 00:41:31,300
And heat up his room a bit.

771
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:34,199
The floor's chilly
enough to keep food cold.

772
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,808
It won't be that cold for someone his age.

773
00:41:35,809 --> 00:41:37,808
Our room as newlyweds was
even colder than that.

774
00:41:37,809 --> 00:41:40,279
We had each other while he has no one.

775
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,539
He even has a sore back.

776
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,578
I'll pay you more money
to heat up his room.

777
00:41:43,579 --> 00:41:44,848
The pumpkin will rot if I turn up the heat.

778
00:41:44,849 --> 00:41:46,479
Is the pumpkin your sibling?

779
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:48,950
Choose, then. Is it me or Dae Geun?

780
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:50,888
Who will you save from drowning first?

781
00:41:50,889 --> 00:41:52,489
Of course, it's Dae...
- "Dae?"

782
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:55,860
"Doeji" as in a pig.

783
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:59,558
Remember how a pig got swept away
when our village was flooded?

784
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,259
The whole country was
in a mess last summer...

785
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,630
from the record-high rain of 110 years.

786
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:04,998
Water can be scary.

787
00:42:04,999 --> 00:42:07,269
You scare me even more than water or fire.

788
00:42:08,999 --> 00:42:10,240
Why you...

789
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,840
Eun Byeol hasn't been to
school for a few days.

790
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:15,950
Why though?

791
00:42:16,479 --> 00:42:18,010
Is she in trouble?

792
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,049
I talked to her on the phone,
and it didn't seem that way.

793
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:22,380
- So she's alive?
- Yes.

794
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,188
She's safe and sound.

795
00:42:24,189 --> 00:42:26,188
She has skipped a few school days before,

796
00:42:26,189 --> 00:42:27,660
but she's not one to cause trouble.

797
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,989
Could you tell us where she is?

798
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:33,630
She doesn't want to see her parents.

799
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:36,130
Why don't you let her
be for the time being?

800
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:38,999
I'll let you know if
anything happens to her.

801
00:42:39,499 --> 00:42:42,139
I'd at least like to hear her voice.

802
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:44,509
Could you give her a call?

803
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:45,809
Please.

804
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:47,780
My uncle's having a hard time.

805
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:58,749
Hey, Eun Byeol.

806
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:02,860
Your dad's here at the school.
Could you talk to him?

807
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:05,760
Got it.

808
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:08,660
She doesn't want to talk to you.

809
00:43:08,661 --> 00:43:10,700
Eun Byeol, it's Dad.

810
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:17,669
(Handong Girls' High School)

811
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:28,978
- What is it?
- Where are you?

812
00:43:28,979 --> 00:43:30,188
Why do you want to know?

813
00:43:30,189 --> 00:43:31,618
You should know that...

814
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:33,458
- Eun Byeol called me.
- What?

815
00:43:33,459 --> 00:43:35,459
She's not fond of you coming to see her.

816
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:36,759
It's why she moved.

817
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,059
You're only telling me that now?

818
00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:41,359
Where is she?

819
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,668
She doesn't want me to tell you.

820
00:43:42,669 --> 00:43:43,800
Hey!

821
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,800
Does she know where Eun Byeol is?

822
00:43:47,869 --> 00:43:48,939
Yes.

823
00:43:50,309 --> 00:43:51,610
Then everything's fine.

824
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:53,679
We know she's alive...

825
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,439
and that she's in contact with her mom.

826
00:44:01,479 --> 00:44:03,889
Dae Bong, Eun Byeol's alive.

827
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:06,389
She just didn't want to see me.

828
00:44:06,459 --> 00:44:08,160
She hated the fact that I came to see her.

829
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,360
It seems as though she
told her mom in advance.

830
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:11,828
Even her teacher knows.

831
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:13,430
I was the only one left out!

832
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:17,930
That's a relief.

833
00:44:18,169 --> 00:44:20,368
She'll one day learn how
much you care about her.

834
00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:21,639
She's still just a kid.

835
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:24,869
There's no need to thank me.

836
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:28,539
I'm jealous that she has a dad
who actually worries about her.

837
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,749
Sure, Uncle. I'll see you later at home.

838
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,050
(CEO, Ji Nam Chul)

839
00:45:25,229 --> 00:45:26,499
I'll get to it later.

840
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:35,240
What are you asking?

841
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:36,880
I'd like an honest answer.

842
00:45:37,709 --> 00:45:39,820
Ba Da and Shin Ki Han.

843
00:45:40,749 --> 00:45:41,950
Who are they to each other?

844
00:45:42,919 --> 00:45:44,489
You know who he is to her.

845
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:46,660
He's her closest male friend.

846
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:47,959
That's not what I'm asking.

847
00:45:48,189 --> 00:45:50,328
You said that men and women
could never be friends...

848
00:45:50,329 --> 00:45:52,630
and that their relationship
was more than that.

849
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:56,228
Actually,

850
00:45:56,229 --> 00:45:58,130
I think that came out wrong.

851
00:45:58,269 --> 00:46:00,799
What you saw yesterday could be misleading,

852
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,669
but I know those two.

853
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,570
Their relationship isn't what you think.

854
00:46:05,939 --> 00:46:07,939
Ba Da's going through a
rough patch right now.

855
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:17,050
I think our marriage could be in danger.

856
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:21,710
I've been married to Ba Da for seven years,

857
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:24,959
but I'm wondering if I am totally aware...

858
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:26,459
of who she really is.

859
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:29,159
She called the police to
remove my mom from our home...

860
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,130
and went to Sokcho with her male friend.

861
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,970
Every time I see a new side of her,

862
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,900
I'm left wondering...

863
00:46:37,539 --> 00:46:38,979
if she's the woman I thought I knew.

864
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:41,209
When she pressed charges
regarding her designs,

865
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:44,610
she called Shin Ki Han rather than me.

866
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:47,280
He knew every detail.

867
00:46:47,419 --> 00:46:49,319
She said she didn't have the
money for the home shopping show.

868
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,490
But it seems as though...

869
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:53,820
she got it from Shin Ki Han.

870
00:46:58,030 --> 00:46:59,189
I'm right, aren't I?

871
00:47:00,329 --> 00:47:01,659
You can't tell anyone this,

872
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,540
but I borrowed the money
from my mother-in-law.

873
00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:06,470
I don't know for sure,

874
00:47:06,939 --> 00:47:08,268
but she probably accepted it reluctantly...

875
00:47:08,269 --> 00:47:09,610
just to keep her business going.

876
00:47:10,209 --> 00:47:11,839
You know how she is.

877
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,910
She never mixes business with pleasure.

878
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:17,848
Mr. Shin did have a crush
on her at one point,

879
00:47:17,849 --> 00:47:19,979
but Ba Da always drew the line.

880
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:22,780
Why else would she have married you?

881
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:29,220
I'm afraid I have to
get to my part-time job.

882
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,289
Sure. Thank you, Eun Kang.

883
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,050
Ba Da.

884
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:52,570
I think it's best for you
to stop contacting Mr. Shin.

885
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,249
What if Cha Won finds out?

886
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,649
You said you kissed him in Sokcho,

887
00:47:57,650 --> 00:48:00,010
and it could've gone further
if your mom hadn't been there.

888
00:48:01,019 --> 00:48:02,458
You can't lead him on...

889
00:48:02,459 --> 00:48:03,939
while knowing how he feels about you.

890
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,429
You're a married woman.

891
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:07,159
Even feelings could be
considered infidelity.

892
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,860
End this before Cha Won finds out...

893
00:48:09,229 --> 00:48:10,970
and don't keep him close as a friend.

895
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,050
Hold on.

896
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,348
Just tell me where Eun Byeol is.

897
00:48:30,349 --> 00:48:31,989
- I won't go there.
- She told me not to tell you.

898
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:33,219
I won't go looking for her.

899
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,689
Just tell me where she is!

900
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:36,940
What's wrong with your face?

901
00:48:45,999 --> 00:48:48,070
Was it that punk?

902
00:48:48,169 --> 00:48:49,769
Why did he hit you? What was the reason?

903
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,209
For not giving him money.

904
00:48:53,939 --> 00:48:56,709
He wanted money to place bets online.

905
00:49:00,019 --> 00:49:01,180
Why you little...

906
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:10,529
You should've lived a better life...

907
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,130
since that's the reason you divorced me.

908
00:49:12,289 --> 00:49:14,998
Was a boy-toy gambler
the best you could do?

909
00:49:14,999 --> 00:49:16,529
You made Eun Byeol suffer while doing so!

910
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:17,970
I'm unlucky with men,

911
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:19,669
so what do you expect?

912
00:49:19,869 --> 00:49:21,039
This is just my fate.

913
00:49:26,439 --> 00:49:28,439
Couldn't you have
forgiven me that one time?

914
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:30,578
Why couldn't you let it slide?

915
00:49:30,579 --> 00:49:31,609
What?

916
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:33,478
If you had held onto me,

917
00:49:33,479 --> 00:49:35,180
I would've eventually come back.

918
00:49:35,249 --> 00:49:37,220
I wasn't in my right mind at the time.

919
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:39,519
You were busy with work all the time,

920
00:49:39,889 --> 00:49:43,289
and Eun Byeol rarely spoke to
me after starting middle school.

921
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:45,689
Life was too lonely.

922
00:49:47,229 --> 00:49:48,749
So you decided to cheat on me instead?

923
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,768
It's not my fault...

924
00:49:50,769 --> 00:49:52,849
you fell for a scumbag while
playing an online game.

925
00:49:59,139 --> 00:50:00,240
You little...

926
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:07,860
I know you can carry your own weight,

927
00:50:07,919 --> 00:50:09,349
and he's like a fly you can swat.

928
00:50:09,619 --> 00:50:11,090
Don't let a man beat you at least.

929
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:47,389
I'll get going, Father.

930
00:50:47,559 --> 00:50:49,388
The family is getting
together at my father's place.

931
00:50:49,389 --> 00:50:51,659
You already told me. Get going.

932
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:52,760
Sure.

933
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:08,479
Hello.

934
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:10,509
Are you coming to work on a Sunday?

935
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:12,349
People still have to eat on Sundays too.

936
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:15,180
They said the side dishes were
so good that they ran out.

937
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,049
I got the call and rushed over.

938
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:19,320
I see. Then have a good day.

939
00:51:22,459 --> 00:51:24,029
Don't let it show too much.

940
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:25,160
You'll get caught.

941
00:51:28,229 --> 00:51:29,300
Excuse me, ma'am.

942
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:33,799
I'm sorry, but I'd appreciate
it if you didn't say that.

943
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,169
I'm just worried.

944
00:51:38,939 --> 00:51:40,578
Whether it's my man or someone else's,

945
00:51:40,579 --> 00:51:42,499
whether he's young or
old, they're all the same.

946
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:49,479
Hello.

947
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:51,720
I ran into your son-in-law
in the front yard.

948
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:52,888
He was dressed nicely...

949
00:51:52,889 --> 00:51:55,220
and smelled of cologne on his way out.

950
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,329
He asked me to keep my mouth shut.

951
00:51:59,289 --> 00:52:01,430
His daughter must have no clue.

952
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:04,400
If it's that bad, the wife
should be the first to know.

953
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:13,439
It's best...

954
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:15,639
not to take medicine if possible.

955
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:22,380
How did you know?

956
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:23,820
On my first day of work,

957
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:26,995
you were on your way back from
bringing in a load of stuff.

958
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:28,660
There was some noise from the truck bed.

959
00:52:29,389 --> 00:52:31,149
When you went to organize
things back there,

960
00:52:31,389 --> 00:52:33,498
I noticed the glove
compartment was partly open.

961
00:52:33,499 --> 00:52:34,939
So I opened it without much thought.

962
00:52:35,729 --> 00:52:37,969
I know what that medicine is
since I've taken it before.

963
00:52:37,999 --> 00:52:39,470
Nobody in my family knows.

964
00:52:43,099 --> 00:52:45,240
Don't worry. I'm not taking them anymore.

965
00:52:49,639 --> 00:52:50,880
You're making them so nicely.

966
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:53,710
Are dumplings what you
want to eat the most?

967
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:56,889
Yes.

968
00:53:02,019 --> 00:53:03,189
Actually, my mom...

969
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,630
didn't pass away.

970
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,200
Within a few months of
having my youngest sibling,

971
00:53:12,369 --> 00:53:13,539
she ran away from home.

972
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,680
I could go on about the hardships
my siblings and I faced without her,

973
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:25,809
probably for days on end.

974
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:28,690
After I graduated from elementary school,

975
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:32,320
I couldn't afford to go to middle school.

976
00:53:34,059 --> 00:53:35,860
So I went to see my mom...

977
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,530
who had gotten remarried.

978
00:53:38,789 --> 00:53:40,200
She lived over the mountains,

979
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:42,930
about 8km away.

980
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:46,400
But on the day I visited her,

981
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:51,539
their family was sitting around
and making dumplings together.

982
00:53:54,979 --> 00:53:56,180
My mom had...

983
00:53:58,309 --> 00:54:00,789
given birth to another baby there
and carrying it on her back.

984
00:54:04,889 --> 00:54:06,889
When she saw me looking
in through the front gate,

985
00:54:09,459 --> 00:54:10,930
my mom ran out after me.

986
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,999
She asked why I was there.

987
00:54:21,539 --> 00:54:22,669
That I should just go...

988
00:54:23,939 --> 00:54:25,639
and never come to see her again.

989
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,450
I couldn't even mention...

990
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,280
wanting to go to middle
school and had to leave.

991
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:40,619
I had starved all day, so
my stomach was rumbling.

992
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,329
The snow was piled up to my knees.

993
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:48,099
As I cried my eyes out,

994
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:52,829
I walked back 8km through the snow.

995
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,639
My tattered shoes were all wet,

996
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:00,340
so my feet were frozen cold.

997
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:04,209
My ears felt like they would fall off.

998
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,840
But all I could think
about were those dumplings.

999
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:13,810
If only she had given me just one dumpling.

1000
00:55:15,689 --> 00:55:17,860
Just one sip of the broth.

1001
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,440
I didn't know if I was more
upset about what she said...

1002
00:55:24,369 --> 00:55:26,369
or the fact that she didn't
give me any dumplings.

1003
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:31,869
I was just sad and hurt...

1004
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:35,110
for a long time.

1005
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:41,050
Why are you making me cry?

1006
00:55:45,749 --> 00:55:46,789
I shouldn't have told you.

1007
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,260
But when I was in 10th grade,

1008
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:52,360
when my father-in-law chose to support me,

1009
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:54,760
he asked me what I wanted to eat.

1010
00:55:57,570 --> 00:55:59,570
Maybe he felt bad for me
because I was so scrawny.

1011
00:56:01,869 --> 00:56:04,369
So I said, "Dumplings."

1012
00:56:07,939 --> 00:56:10,139
He took me to a dumpling
store in front of my school...

1013
00:56:10,309 --> 00:56:11,989
and told me to eat as much as I wanted to.

1014
00:56:14,479 --> 00:56:16,639
I think I ate all the dumplings
they had at the store.

1015
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:20,720
I probably...

1016
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,059
ate about 100 of them.

1017
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:28,290
You can eat all of these too.

1018
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,960
Do you want me to steam some?

1019
00:56:29,999 --> 00:56:31,430
We'll have the dumpling soup later.

1020
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,939
Okay. I'll do it.

1021
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:49,050
I said I didn't want anything, didn't I?

1022
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:52,590
I take that back.

1023
00:56:54,889 --> 00:56:56,019
I'm a greedy person.

1024
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:59,660
I want to have everything.

1025
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:04,900
I thought I wouldn't be like that.

1026
00:57:07,939 --> 00:57:09,999
But when I saw you with your wife,

1027
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:14,380
I realized I had a raging fire within me...

1028
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:17,180
for the first time.

1029
00:57:23,079 --> 00:57:24,639
I don't think I can let you go anymore.

1030
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:27,590
I want you to be mine forever.

1031
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,920
We said we'd only live
together for a month,

1032
00:57:31,289 --> 00:57:32,430
but I don't think...

1033
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:35,430
I can keep that promise.

1034
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,240
Let's...

1035
00:57:46,209 --> 00:57:47,539
just get caught.

1036
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:14,970
Mother, come and eat.

1037
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,869
Okay.

1038
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:19,970
So, to record...

1039
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:21,880
I need to push the red button.

1040
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:25,650
That's it. It's working now.

1041
00:58:34,889 --> 00:58:37,229
I bought the side dishes
from a store nearby.

1042
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:38,590
Try some.

1043
00:58:39,389 --> 00:58:41,229
Why did you have Ba Da and Ki Han...

1044
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:43,530
drink by themselves and call Cha Won?

1045
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:45,199
Something had come up at home.

1046
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,900
Whether that was the case or not,

1047
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,498
why would you tattle to Cha Won?

1048
00:58:49,499 --> 00:58:50,709
I didn't tattle.

1049
00:58:50,769 --> 00:58:53,339
I just thought Ba Da was too drunk,
so I told him to come and get her.

1050
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:54,656
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

1051
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,208
To show Cha Won...

1052
00:58:56,209 --> 00:58:57,809
that Ki Han and Ba Da were on their own.

1053
00:59:01,019 --> 00:59:02,680
It wasn't like that, Mom.

1054
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:06,210
Do you think I don't
know what you're up to?

1055
00:59:06,389 --> 00:59:07,389
Tell me the truth.

1056
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:09,860
Do you want Ba Da to get
a divorce or something?

1057
00:59:10,459 --> 00:59:12,659
Because then you'd be able
to have Cha Won to yourself?

1058
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:15,030
You're living off of Ba Da at the moment.

1059
00:59:15,059 --> 00:59:17,329
You're not making a
fortune from teaching kids.

1060
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:20,030
Ba Da pays you to run
errands for this and that.

1061
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:22,816
You get paid as much as an employee.
Do you think I don't know that?

1062
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,939
Who else is as nice to you as Ba Da?

1063
00:59:25,369 --> 00:59:28,039
Sure. She's nice to me...

1064
00:59:28,709 --> 00:59:29,809
while hurting me too.

1065
00:59:30,849 --> 00:59:32,050
What did you just say?

1066
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:34,550
Ba Da hurts you?

1067
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:35,919
In what way?

1068
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:37,789
Look how wicked you are.

1069
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:40,095
If Ba Da finds out about
your wicked thoughts,

1070
00:59:40,119 --> 00:59:41,519
do you think she will let it slide?

1071
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:43,829
You will be cut off like
a kite without a string.

1072
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:45,888
You're not even that young.
You'll be turning 40 soon.

1073
00:59:45,889 --> 00:59:47,300
Please just stop!

1074
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:50,469
Just because I wasn't born
into a rich family like Ba Da,

1075
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:52,230
I acted as her minion
for the past 20 years.

1076
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:54,069
I've already been hurt enough...

1077
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:55,830
without you trampling
all over me like this.

1078
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,808
I tried to go easy on
you since you were sick,

1079
00:59:57,809 --> 01:00:00,090
but I told you that I would
no longer sit back and watch.

1080
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:01,340
You...

1081
01:00:01,979 --> 01:00:03,138
What do you think you're doing?

1082
01:00:03,139 --> 01:00:04,950
Do I want Ba Da to get divorced?

1083
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:07,380
What if I said yes?

1084
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:10,410
I'll remember how nice you were
to me when I was younger...

1085
01:00:11,019 --> 01:00:12,050
and stop here.

1086
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,769
We'll start the broadcast
right away next week.

1087
01:00:23,869 --> 01:00:25,499
Are the products coming along well?

1088
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,438
We're bringing in gemstones from abroad.

1089
01:00:27,439 --> 01:00:28,499
It's totally doable.

1090
01:00:28,669 --> 01:00:30,769
What about going with sapphires next?

1091
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:32,110
Sounds great.

1092
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:33,910
Just a moment.

1093
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:38,410
What is it, Mom?

1094
01:00:39,979 --> 01:00:42,450
Right now? What's going on?

1095
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,430
Eun Kang, you take a seat too.

1096
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,599
You didn't believe me when I told you...

1097
01:01:03,439 --> 01:01:05,119
what Eun Kang said to me last time, right?

1098
01:01:05,809 --> 01:01:07,880
Listen to it now. I have
the proof right here.

1099
01:01:08,439 --> 01:01:10,349
Cha Won. Play it now.

1100
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:15,050
What does she mean?

1101
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,320
Go on.

1102
01:01:26,229 --> 01:01:28,130
(List: Recording 1)

1103
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,570
That's it. It's working now.

1104
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:54,159
What's this?

1105
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,220
Just wait.

1106
01:01:55,990 --> 01:01:57,160
Play the other ones.

1107
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:07,269
There's nothing else
that has been recorded.

1108
01:02:08,039 --> 01:02:09,099
There isn't?

1109
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:12,410
What's wrong with this?
I was sure I recorded it.

1110
01:02:12,539 --> 01:02:15,139
You told me that I had to
see the red button on here.

1111
01:02:15,539 --> 01:02:17,509
You have to press the red button
and see the two black bars...

1112
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:18,680
in order to start recording.

1113
01:02:20,209 --> 01:02:21,820
I was sure I did that.

1114
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:25,619
I'm sure there's a recording
of what Eun Kang said.

1115
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:27,220
Look again.

1116
01:02:29,689 --> 01:02:30,760
Mom.

1117
01:02:32,889 --> 01:02:33,930
Eun Kang.

1118
01:02:35,099 --> 01:02:36,229
Cha Won, sit.

1119
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:39,169
What kind of husband goes
after his wife's friend?

1120
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:41,570
Just stop it, Mom. Why
are you being like this?

1121
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:42,939
You're driving me crazy!

1122
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:48,880
Hello?

1123
01:02:49,209 --> 01:02:50,340
To the office?

1124
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:53,820
I'm aware. Yes, I'll see you at the office.

1125
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,050
I have to get to the office.

1126
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:57,566
I forgot about a meeting with a buyer.

1127
01:02:57,590 --> 01:02:58,720
Let's talk later, Mom.

1128
01:03:03,689 --> 01:03:05,289
Mother, why are you being like this?

1129
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:07,990
Was this why you asked me to
teach you how to record things?

1130
01:03:08,599 --> 01:03:10,130
Ba Da is getting stressed out.

1131
01:03:10,769 --> 01:03:13,070
You can't be like this
to someone like Eun Kang!

1132
01:03:40,499 --> 01:03:41,530
Father.

1133
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:43,499
- Sit.
- Yes, sir.

1134
01:03:48,869 --> 01:03:50,200
Why did you want to meet me here?

1135
01:03:50,269 --> 01:03:51,369
Should I order some tea?

1136
01:03:54,110 --> 01:03:55,110
End it.

1137
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:00,180
I said to end it.

1138
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:03,150
What do you mean?

1139
01:04:05,189 --> 01:04:08,720
At 123-1 Seocho-dong.

1140
01:04:09,490 --> 01:04:11,490
Higher Apartment, Unit 1004.

1141
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:14,030
I almost rang the doorbell,
but I held myself back.

1142
01:04:19,099 --> 01:04:20,300
Who is that woman?

1143
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:30,209
She...

1144
01:04:31,309 --> 01:04:32,510
She is...

1145
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:34,519
a college friend.

1146
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:35,820
How long has it been?

1147
01:04:38,619 --> 01:04:41,490
It's been a month.

1148
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:46,160
Pull out your phone.

1149
01:05:01,939 --> 01:05:03,079
Call her.

1150
01:05:03,139 --> 01:05:04,679
End it over the phone
while I'm watching you.

1151
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:06,285
There's no reason for
you to meet her anymore.

1152
01:05:06,309 --> 01:05:07,650
End it right here, right now.

1153
01:05:11,249 --> 01:05:12,969
It won't be hard if it's only been a month.

1154
01:05:13,090 --> 01:05:14,558
If you end it now,

1155
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:16,660
I won't ask you or nag you about it.

1156
01:05:17,019 --> 01:05:20,229
Until the day I die, it'll
remain a secret between us.

1157
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:22,860
Call her.

1158
01:05:27,099 --> 01:05:28,240
Quick.

1159
01:05:28,869 --> 01:05:30,109
Are you saying you can't do it?

1160
01:05:32,539 --> 01:05:33,740
I told you to end it!

1161
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:36,380
How dare you cheat on my daughter?

1162
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:39,039
Do you want to get kicked
out in your underpants?

1163
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:40,879
You will never see your kids again.

1164
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,720
Your father and siblings
will be done for too!

1165
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:46,919
How could you not even apologize?

1166
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:48,419
Do you call yourself human?

1167
01:05:48,789 --> 01:05:50,566
You're so shameless when
you've been cheating.

1168
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:53,860
If it weren't for my
daughter and my grandkids,

1169
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,959
I would kill you with my own hands!

1170
01:06:10,849 --> 01:06:12,110
Please...

1171
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:15,049
give me some time.

1172
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:16,320
Time?

1173
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:25,389
How long?

1174
01:06:30,999 --> 01:06:32,868
Thank you for your explanation.
I had a good time.

1175
01:06:32,869 --> 01:06:36,469
I hope we can become good
partners in the future.

1176
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:41,079
Of course. Let's exchange
the contract via email.

1177
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:43,578
I won't see you out.

1178
01:06:43,579 --> 01:06:45,879
Thank you for coming. See you again.

1179
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,200
- See you again.
- See you again.

1180
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:09,439
(Cho Eun Kang)

1181
01:07:11,669 --> 01:07:12,709
You're here.

1182
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:15,438
I figured you'd be here on a weekend.

1183
01:07:15,439 --> 01:07:18,280
I was passing by and saw your
car, so I decided to come in.

1184
01:07:18,479 --> 01:07:20,209
I was just on my way out.

1185
01:07:21,019 --> 01:07:23,479
I have something to say too.
Let's go grab a drink somewhere.

1186
01:07:24,019 --> 01:07:25,466
It seems like you already had a drink.

1187
01:07:25,490 --> 01:07:27,019
And I don't feel up for it today.

1188
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:29,820
I wish you wouldn't stop by unannounced.

1189
01:07:30,519 --> 01:07:31,729
Let's go.

1190
01:07:48,809 --> 01:07:50,379
Then what was that we did in Sokcho?

1191
01:07:50,439 --> 01:07:52,178
I told you I was drunk.

1192
01:07:52,179 --> 01:07:53,308
Don't use alcohol as an excuse.

1193
01:07:53,309 --> 01:07:54,580
Why are you doing this?

1194
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:56,378
I'm already married,

1195
01:07:56,379 --> 01:07:58,539
and I've never had other
thoughts since I got married.

1196
01:07:59,019 --> 01:08:00,389
The kiss that night...

1197
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,620
was purely a mistake.

1198
01:08:02,759 --> 01:08:05,188
Why are you being like this over a kiss?
You're being childish.

1199
01:08:05,189 --> 01:08:06,660
But you're not happy.

1200
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:09,999
Ba Da.

1201
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,370
Since we met in middle school,

1202
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:15,000
I have never once erased you from my heart.

1203
01:08:16,139 --> 01:08:18,268
You might already be another man's wife...

1204
01:08:18,269 --> 01:08:19,969
and the mother of a child,

1205
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:21,540
but you are...

1206
01:08:21,879 --> 01:08:23,540
still just Han Ba Da to me.

1207
01:08:25,549 --> 01:08:27,150
- When we were in Italy...
- Stop it.

1208
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:30,019
If you do this, I will delete your number.

1209
01:08:31,490 --> 01:08:33,050
And I will delete you from my life too.

1210
01:08:38,059 --> 01:08:39,129
Seriously.

1211
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:16,099
She had to pay back her father's debt.

1212
01:09:16,429 --> 01:09:18,670
That's also why she isn't
having another child.

1213
01:09:32,150 --> 01:09:33,179
Seriously.

1214
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:40,420
I'm sure Ki Han lent her the money as well.

1215
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:42,019
Be careful.

1216
01:09:42,219 --> 01:09:44,160
What if you get caught by Cha Won?

1217
01:10:17,929 --> 01:10:20,089
I thought my mother-in-law
was acting weird.

1218
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:24,370
So I went to Ba Da's office to talk to her.

1219
01:10:24,599 --> 01:10:26,299
I saw them in front of the office.

1220
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,339
Shin Ki Han and Ba Da.

1221
01:10:28,670 --> 01:10:30,500
They're not just friends.

1222
01:10:32,639 --> 01:10:35,199
I don't know who I've been living
with for the past seven years.

1223
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:43,379
I thought, "Am I petty enough not
to approve of her male friend?"

1224
01:10:44,650 --> 01:10:45,889
It was hard for me.

1225
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:49,980
I didn't even know they were like that.

1226
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:57,099
I'm such a fool, right?

1227
01:11:01,570 --> 01:11:03,670
I'm showing you so many sides of myself.

1228
01:11:05,339 --> 01:11:06,839
I had a bit to drink today.

1229
01:11:09,379 --> 01:11:10,610
You did well.

1230
01:11:13,509 --> 01:11:15,420
I'm really sorry about my mother-in-law.

1231
01:11:17,519 --> 01:11:19,919
She asked me to teach her how
to record something, so I did.

1232
01:11:20,049 --> 01:11:21,809
I didn't realize that
was what she would do.

1233
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,259
As you left the room crying,

1234
01:11:24,729 --> 01:11:26,229
it broke my heart.

1235
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:31,769
Ba Da must be feeling really sorry too.

1236
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:34,030
She called you, didn't she?

1237
01:11:34,839 --> 01:11:35,969
No.

1238
01:11:38,269 --> 01:11:40,809
I'm not even a friend to Ba Da.

1239
01:11:42,339 --> 01:11:44,110
I'm just her minion and her maid.

1240
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:48,650
I'm the perfect person to boss around.

1241
01:11:50,019 --> 01:11:52,849
I'm an errand girl who does
anything as long as I get paid.

1242
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:54,420
Don't say that.

1243
01:11:55,089 --> 01:11:56,460
I know.

1244
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:59,429
Someone like me who was
never loved as a child...

1245
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:04,629
is treated like a speck
of dirt by others too.

1246
01:12:05,229 --> 01:12:08,439
They think I can be looked
down upon and trampled.

1247
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:13,939
So Ba Da's mom must
think the same thing too.

1248
01:12:22,549 --> 01:12:23,679
No.

1249
01:12:23,849 --> 01:12:26,420
You are a pure and good person.

1250
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:30,089
More than anyone else in the world,

1251
01:12:32,530 --> 01:12:34,059
you are the most precious person.

1252
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,200
Is that true?

1253
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:45,769
Am I...

1254
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,839
really a precious person?

1255
01:13:28,219 --> 01:13:29,450
I'm nervous.

1256
01:13:33,049 --> 01:13:34,490
I'm shaking all over.

This looks like Eun Kang's handkerchief.

1260
01:15:30,439 --> 01:15:32,009
Why is this in your pocket?

1261
01:15:32,870 --> 01:15:34,338
Should I tell the kids?

1262
01:15:34,339 --> 01:15:35,739
That their dad is having an affair?

1263
01:15:37,639 --> 01:15:38,780
I'm sorry.

1264
01:15:40,309 --> 01:15:42,580
She told me straight to my face.

1265
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:45,170
That she's only waiting
for you to get divorced.

1266

My father-in-law...

1267
01:15:48,759 --> 01:15:49,889
knows everything.
