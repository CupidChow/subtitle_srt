I just got a bite in.

I know you're on a business trip,

27
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,590
but I'm worried.

28
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,800
I had a nightmare last night.

29
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,159
Stay safe, okay?

30
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:43,939
Don't worry, Mom. I'll look after myself.

31
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:32,580
- What was that? - What do you mean?

32
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,449
It seemed as though you were putting something in.

33
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,020
Did you see that?

34
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,229
It's good for your health.

35
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:44,400
It looked like some sort of powder.

36
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,599
What on earth do you think I put in there?

37
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,270
It was collagen.

38
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:51,699
Collagen?

39
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,240
You should take care of your skin too.

40
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:54,710
It looks delicious. Let's eat.

41
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,580
The noodles are nice and chewy.

42
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,479
What's wrong?

43
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,689
I don't think my stomach is up for it.

44

But you're the one who wanted cold raw fish soup.

45
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:15,128
Do you think I spiked the soup?

46
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,188
Of course not.

47
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,199
I'll be the prime suspect if anything happens to you.

48

I may have let my friend steal my husband away,

50

See? It's collagen.

51
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,339

58

59
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,860
Are you all right?

60
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,060
The floor was slippery.

61
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:36,430
I spilled some oil earlier,

62
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,560
and I forgot to tell you.

63
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,100
I hope you weren't injured.

64
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:42,569
I'm fine.

66
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,120
and why are you lurking around my house?

67
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,090
Apart from the hair loss, you look pretty much the same.

68
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,689
Living the good life must have done wonders for you.

69
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,059
Do you know me?

70
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,590
You must not remember me.

71

Before your daughter got married,

72
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,899
she was involved with a Chinese restaurant delivery man.

73
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,470
I was the one who told you that.

74
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:52,299
So what brings you by?

75
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,879
I showed this to your son-in-law, but he won't take action.

76
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,820
Please stop your daughter.

77
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:10,789
Why can't the two stay away from each other?

78
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,399
Goodness.

79
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,399
My gosh.

80
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,100
Mr. Ko, I ran over as soon as I got your call.

81
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,100
Actually, I drove my cab here.

82
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,139
- You needed 10,000 dollars. - Right.

83
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:35,179
What I want in return is your service.

84
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,519
My service?

85
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,389
There's someone who got on my nerves...

86
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:44,360
about 20 years ago.

87
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,960
He's back at it again.

88
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:49,329
Who dares to get on your nerves?

89
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,859
Is he someone you met while running your business?

90
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,258
That's not something you need to know.

91
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,259
For now,

92
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,399
just rough him up.

93
00:09:57,539 --> 00:09:59,668
Don't lay him out flat, though. Just teach him a lesson.

94
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:00,669
Sorry?

95
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,679
Get this done for me, and I'll pay 10,000 dollars.

96
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:07,879
It won't be a loan. I'll pay you.

97
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:11,350
Goodness.

98
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:14,990
Mr. Ko, I'm not as gutsy as you think,

99
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,789
and I haven't indulged in any illegal acts.

100
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:18,960
You won't get caught.

101
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,029
He couldn't report you to the cops.

102
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,360
Trust me and get it done.

103
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:25,159
It's 10,000 dollars.

104
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,169
Mr. Ko,

105
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:32,069
can't you just lend me the money? I don't think I can...

106
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,109
You'll be getting the money for free.

107
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,809
Actually, I'm not getting that money for free.

108
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,379
I'll be committing a crime.

109
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,419
Sir, I desperately need the money. But I can't hurt someone.

110
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:47,319
I'm sorry. I'll get going first.

111
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,418
Hey, come on.

112
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:50,149
Hey, Joo Dae Bong.

113
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,289
Joo?

114
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,889
I think it was Cho Dae Bong.

115
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:00,769
Was I that popular?

116
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,398
I was so sick of it.

117
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:05,570
I ran the errands for all the boys too.

118
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,638
They awkwardly approached me.

119
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:09,409
"Can you give this to Ba Da?"

120
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:10,809
Seriously.

121
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:12,538
I was so jealous.

122
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,649
- Were you? - Of course.

123
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:16,980
You grew up in a nice family, so you didn't have a dark side.

124
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,850
But I was dark and twisted. Like the twisted donut.

125
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,320
You gave them my number and got free twisted donuts.

126
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,620
A few times.

127
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:30,330
I had the most fun in high school in my entire life.

128
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,860
We used to secretly exchange notes during class.

129
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,570
We found everything so funny back then.

130
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,538
We got caught, and our teacher punished us side by side.

131
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:41,469
When we were getting punished, we cracked up and got punished more.

132
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,440
Seriously. We used to laugh whenever we had the chance.

133
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:47,879
I skipped going to my cram school and went to your house to hang out.

134
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,409
But after high school,

135
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,950
I can't remember any fun moments.

136
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:02,830
I don't know why I miss the past.

137
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,659
Right.

138
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,769
Why did you do it?

139
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,250
I'm 37 years old.

140
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,379
And I was with you for more than half my lifetime.

141
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:31,919
You had been with me every single moment of my life.

142
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:34,460
Even now,

143
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,730
losing you was the most painful thing I went through.

144
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:41,129
More painful than losing my husband.

145
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,200
Even now, when I wake up,

146
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,970
you're the first person I think of.

147
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:52,610
I do too.

148
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,850
Whenever I wake up, you're the first person I think of.

149
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:00,820
"Will she text? Or call?"

150
00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:04,490
"Does she need me to run an errand? Is there anything I can do to help?"

151
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,589
I was drunk the last time we talked.

152
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,389
Forget all the bad things I said to you.

153
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,798
I really wanted to be more like you.

154
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,070
And I envied you.

155
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,970
Then at one point, this idea was planted in me.

156
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,669
Once it was planted, I couldn't go back.

157
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,809
At that moment, I felt as if...

158
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,580
I had been under some kind of spell.

159
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:30,309
That day,

160
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,850
if the lipstick didn't roll under your feet...

161
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,220
and if we didn't become friends...

162
00:13:40,289 --> 00:13:41,690
I'm sorry, Ba Da.

163
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,490
I ruined everything.

164
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,129
To be honest, this whole trip made me feel anxious and nervous.

165
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,099
"What will she say?"

166
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,539
"Will she scold me?"

167
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,470
"If she hits me, I'll let her."

168
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:57,139
All kinds of thoughts crossed my mind.

169
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,679
You weren't scared that I might kill you?

170
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,580
If that was what you wanted, I couldn't have stopped you.

171
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,019
There's no knife.

172
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,190
What?

173
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:15,960
It's gone?

174
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,029
Did you drop it in the car?

175
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,730
Why do you want a knife?

176
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,700
You said you couldn't stop me if I wanted to kill you.

177
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,139
Why would you say something you didn't mean then?

178
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,279
I was going to eat an apple.

179
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,350
Then let's go with plan B.

180
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,049
Plan B?

181
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:40,449
Let's go out.

182
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,990
Let's get some fresh air by the beach.

183
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,519
We should see the sunrise too.

184
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,289
It'll be cold.

185
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,889
How cold could it be?

186
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:50,059
We can't go back without seeing the sunrise.

187
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,859
Get dressed.

188
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,100
Okay.

189
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,609
The suspect even gave the victim alcohol.

190
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,340
The suspect then led the intoxicated victim to the beach...

191
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,210
What are you doing?

192
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,378
What?

193
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:09,909
Are you scared that I might push you into the water and drown you?

194
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,750
If you were to fall into the water and drown,

195
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,519
what would they say on the news?

196
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,119
"A 37-year-old woman, Cho,"

197
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,028
"coveted the husband of her friend of 20 years."

198
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:22,389
"She was found drowned to death."

199
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,700
Would that be it?

200
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,239
Don't be scared.

201
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,570
You're good at swimming anyway.

202
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,370
Don't worry. I won't kill you.

203
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:37,679
Let's go out.

204
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:43,950
Okay.

205
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:01,070
You brought the necklace, right?

206
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,729
Yes.

207
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,940
You should throw it too.

208
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:06,399
I'll throw mine.

209
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:24,490
This is the end of our friendship.

210
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:27,730
Let's put an end to our 20 years together.

211
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:30,029
Thank you for coming on this trip.

212
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:39,299
Take care.

213
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,840
You too.

214
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:44,309
I know you'll save your business.

215
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,009
I know you'll be successful again.

216
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:48,649
I must.

217
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,309
Let's go back separately.

218
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,250
I'll go back to the hotel first, pack my stuff, and leave.

219
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,419
Can I...

220
00:16:58,519 --> 00:16:59,789
hug you one last time?

221
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,230
Ba Da.

222
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:11,670
You were...

223
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:16,039
the best friend I had.

224
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,579
I'm sorry for hurting you.

225
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,440
Thank you for everything.

226
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:24,619

228
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:20,240
Can you reduce the settlement money?

229
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,069
I have never made that much money in my life.

230
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,539
Well,

231
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,180
can you lower it to 3,000 dollars?

232
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:28,509
Please.

233
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:32,079
I don't have any money.

234
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,380
Why don't you just sell me off then?

235
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,150
No one wants to buy you. Why do you keep saying that?

236
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,318
You know how hard he worked to be a private taxi driver.

237
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,389
Whatever.

238
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,288
Will you take your money to the coffin?

239
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,088
I'd be happy if I had money to take to my coffin.

240
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,599
Ban Sook, if you keep this up...

241
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,798
What?

242
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:50,630
I bet you wouldn't give me money even if I get a terminal illness.

243
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,139
How can I trust you to have my back?

244
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,539
I'm so sick of you!

245
00:18:57,609 --> 00:18:58,879
What took you so long?

246
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,339
I had been sick of you ages ago.

247
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:02,579
Dae Geun is all he cares about.

248
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:08,119
I'll give you 5,000 dollars for now.

249
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,349
I'll give you the rest once the deed is done.

250
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,220
Understood?

251
00:19:14,259 --> 00:19:16,859
Can you write a contract for me?

252
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:18,929
You can't leave a paper trail.

253
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,059
Sometimes, you can be so dense.

254
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,599
Don't you trust me?

255
00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:24,640
I don't trust the world.

256
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,068
But...

257
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:28,039
I'll trust you.

258
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,209
By the way,

259
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,108
who is this man? I have to know who he is...

260
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:33,480
You can't know who he is.

261
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,849
Seriously. I'm so lonely.

262
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:42,190
Then how many times should I punch him?

263
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:10,179
Hello?

264
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,420
It's been a while.

265
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:14,750
I need to talk to you about Geum Ah.

266
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:17,119
Meet me without telling anyone.

267
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,759
Not even Geum Ah.

268
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,960
Okay.

269
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,230
I'll be there.

272
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:11,779
Dae Geun!

273
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:14,380
Dae Geun, what happened?

274
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,650
Dae Geun, wake up.

275
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:18,518
Dae Geun, it's me.

276
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:19,519

277

Dae Geun...

280
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:41,609
Stay still. I'll call an ambulance.

281
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,740
Dae Geun...

282
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,549
Don't.

283
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:50,650
You could get arrested.

284
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,278
Don't die.

285
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,150
Dae Geun, please stay with me.

286

Are you sure you got into a car accident?

Well, let's go inside. You should lie down.

00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,479
And it's about to come true.

330
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,349
I think you and my brother make a great couple.

331
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,960
Like my father says, get married next year.

332
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,829
Thank you.

333
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,670
Are you in touch with Mi Poong's mom?

334
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,469
- I am. - Really?

335
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,869
She suggested a trip, so we went on it yesterday.

336
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:28,740
We had a long conversation...

337
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:30,768
and buried the hatchet.

338
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,308
Really? I didn't think she'd be that cool.

339
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:34,779
I mean, it wouldn't have been easy.

340
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,179
You better be good to her.

341
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:39,180
I'm planning to give her a gift when I get my first paycheck.

342
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,250
Do that.

343
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,950
No wonder why you seemed bright.

344
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,099
I don't want to lose a good man like you.

345
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,339
(Cho Eun Kang)

346
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:10,049
Ta-Da. I finally found Ddolbang.

347
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,819
Where are you? Are you at the hospital?

348
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,190
Yes, I'm a little busy.

349
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,500
Mom!

350
00:25:33,769 --> 00:25:34,869
Mi Poong!

351
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,950
Mom, I can't breathe.

352
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,180
Wait.

353
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,549
Just a little longer.

354
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:19,980
Have you been well? Did you miss me?

355
00:26:20,349 --> 00:26:22,048
Yes, isn't Grandma coming?

356
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:23,989
She's being treated at a hospital.

357
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,289
I wish she wouldn't come.

358
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,920
I hate it when she hits Auntie.

359
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,559
Don't say that.

360
00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:31,930
She's been like that ever since she saw your mother hit Eun Kang.

361
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,029
Mom, are you back for good?

362
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,098
I'm back from Italy,

363
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:40,400
but I have to stay at school.

364
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:42,538
I'll come and see you once every few days...

365
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:43,809
until I finish my studies.

366
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,440
Is that okay?

367
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,809
You can focus on studying.

368
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:49,809
I have Auntie, so it's okay.

369
00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:58,250
This is a gift for you.

370
00:26:59,089 --> 00:27:00,220
How exciting!

371
00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:03,589
I want to stop by home for a bit.

372
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:06,630
Okay.

373
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,240
Where's the plunger?

374
00:27:52,579 --> 00:27:53,609
What did you do?

375
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:57,278
I played on a trampoline and played house with Ji Eun.

376
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,920
Do that with me next time.

377
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,720
I'd love to!

378
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,828
You're so excited.

379
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:18,969
Are you happy to see me?

380
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,500
Yes, I'm really happy.

381
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:39,789
Oh, my.

382
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,429
Is it pretty? Do you like it?

383
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,490
You're the best, Mom!

384
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,500
You can wear it by yourself, right? Go get changed.

385
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,799
She's still the same.

386
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,440
Were you cleaning?

387
00:28:59,609 --> 00:29:00,609
Yes.

388
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:02,980
I seem like I'm back from Italy, right?

389
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:05,480
Don't let Mi Poong notice.

390
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,950
And stop frowning.

391
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,230
It's so clean.

392
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,430
It's almost spotless.

393
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:20,960
I guess you clean the house every day.

394
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,440
Did you change the sheets?

395
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,839
Yes, this morning.

396
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,509
I see.

397
00:29:31,339 --> 00:29:32,410
Even a linen spray?

398
00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:34,309
Don't tell me...

399
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:37,079
you did it for me.

400
00:29:41,349 --> 00:29:43,489
Don't get too serious. I was joking.

401
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,390
Others might think we are strangers.

402
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,359
Oh, my.

403
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,960
Is this Ddolbang?

404
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,329
I bought it just in case.

405
00:29:56,829 --> 00:29:58,230
Don't give her all at once.

406
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,940
It should be one by one.

407
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:04,339
I'll do it.

408
00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:08,809
It's been a long time...

409
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:11,410
feeling this way.

410
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,049
What did this happen to us?

411
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,660
Everyone was jealous of how dear we were to each other.

412
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,430
Should I sleep over here today?

413
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,609
I signed the divorce papers, but you're still my man.

414
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:41,509
A new bed sheet. A linen mist.

415
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,250
This vibe somewhat makes me flutter.

416
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:48,349
Just like when we first met.

417
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,359
Tell me. Should I sleep over?

418
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:57,359
I have...

419
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,599
dinner plans today.

420
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:03,230
I can wait.

421
00:31:05,569 --> 00:31:07,739
I might be late. I'll be drinking.

422
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,369
I don't care. I can wait.

423
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,480
Mom!

424
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:24,619
Okay.

425
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:28,289
Mi Poong's just like you.

426
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,589
She's a bigmouth and dense.

427
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,619
Mi Poong, you're so pretty!

428
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,058
Mi Poong, you're the best.

429
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:01,689
Mi Poong, your mom's busy.

430
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:02,930
Let's say goodbye for today.

431
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,558
I can stay longer.

432
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,829
I need to get going.

433
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,460
I was going to leave her with my parents.

434
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:10,899
I'll come and visit sometime.

435
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,940
Let's go eat something good next time.

436
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,940
Okay. Let's go.

437
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:17,369
Come on.

438
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:22,209
Say goodbye. "Bye-bye."

439
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:24,680
Come again. Goodbye.

440
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:26,119
Okay.

441
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,950
I'll get going. Leave my luggage in your trunk.

442
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,630
Mi Poong, you should go and get changed.

443
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:43,930
You can wear this to kindergarten.

444
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,349
Come out.

445
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,149
I told you to call me before you came over.

446
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:07,559
I came to return Ddolbang and decided to clean up a bit.

447
00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:09,429
Do you know how nervous I was?

448
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,359
May I ask what happened?

449
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,829
She said she wanted to come and see Mi Poong.

450
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,630
I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to take it the wrong way.

451
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:19,839
You already made that happen.

452
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:23,740
I'd like you to be honest and tell me things in advance.

453
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,440
I'm sorry.

454
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:29,079
You should leave before Mi Poong sees you.

455
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:31,380
You never know what she'll tell her mom.

456
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,150
Okay.

457
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,489
Ms. Cho Eun Kang?

458
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,189
- Is Ms. Cho Eun Kang here? - Who is it?

459
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,460
I have registered mail.

460
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,059
Gosh, I have a cramp.

461
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:45,900
The door's open.

462
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,768
Cho Eun Kang isn't here, but I'm her mom.

463
00:33:49,769 --> 00:33:50,799
I'm Yang Ban Sook.

464
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,269
- Can you sign here? - Sure.

465
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:55,169
Your front gate falls off the hinge.

466
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:57,210
It always does that. Just leave it and go.

467
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,809
Goodbye!

468
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,209
(From Han Ba Da, To Cho Eun Kang)

469
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,509
My gosh. This is driving me crazy.

470
00:34:04,849 --> 00:34:06,680
- Come out! - Be careful.

471
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:09,090
Is there a ringing in your head?

472
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:10,549
No, there isn't.

473
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,948
Be careful.

474
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:12,959
Do you want me to bring it to your room?

475
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,189
It's not that bad.

476
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:17,459
People would think you had a kid or something.

477
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,000
When it comes to your brother...

478
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:20,359
He almost died because of me.

479
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,369
It's my fault for not having a younger brother.

480
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,768
You almost killed your brother while trying to save him.

481
00:34:24,769 --> 00:34:25,868
Have some rice.

482
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:28,598
- Oh, it's not rice. It's porridge. - I'm not hungry.

483
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,209
You don't eat because you're hungry.

484
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,939
You eat to survive.

485
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,809
You should have a bite, so you can take your medicine.

486
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,678
I bought beef to make your porridge.

487
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,078
I didn't just buy beef porridge from the store.

488
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:38,779
If you say that, it sounds like you bought it.

489
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,320
What nonsense is that?

490
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,719
Do the dishes after you eat.

491
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:43,090
I'm going to the supermarket.

492
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:45,519
Go ahead.

493
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,320
I'm so sorry.

494
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:49,760
I'm glad you didn't die.

495
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:51,690
Why would I die?

496
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,429
I still have so much to live for.

497
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:57,369
What kind of twist of fate is this?

498
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,369
I never imagined you'd be connected to that old man's daughter.

499
00:35:01,969 --> 00:35:03,869
Why would you go and meet him because he asked you to?

500
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:05,679
This happened 18 years ago too.

501
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:08,639
I went out knowing I'd get beaten up.

502
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,980
I thought that would be the only way to resolve this.

503
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,280
You should've shouted for help.

504
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,819
You didn't make a sound.

505
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,190
What's the point?

506
00:35:16,389 --> 00:35:17,920
It'll only make the person hitting me feel worse.

507
00:35:18,989 --> 00:35:20,719
Your hits were quite strong.

508
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,359
I know how to take hits,

509
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,730
but I could barely handle yours.

510
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,960
I regretted playing baseball for the first time.

511
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:28,059
This wretched life.

512
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,630
Uncle. You have a guest.

513
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:37,509
Honey. What's wrong?

514
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,610
- Gosh! - My gosh!

515
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,880
What happened to him? Did he get into an accident?

516
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:42,509
I told you not to drive a taxi.

517
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,079
I told you I'd make enough for both of us.

518
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:45,779
Was it you?

519
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,980
Did you rat me out?

520
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:49,719
- What? - You ratted me out 18 years ago!

521
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:51,320
You told them where I lived!

522
00:35:51,989 --> 00:35:53,488
Dae Bong, tell her to leave.

523
00:35:53,489 --> 00:35:54,960
Imagine how I felt to have done that.

524
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:56,529
Listen here.

525
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,029
He ended up like this because of you,

526
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,500
so how dare you show your face around here?

527
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,098
Get out. I'll take care of my brother,

528
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:03,230
so get out!

529
00:36:03,469 --> 00:36:04,928
What nonsense is that?

530
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,340
Why would you take care of him when he has his wife?

531
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,510
His ex-wife.

532
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:12,808
She follows him around like this because she likes him so much.

533
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:14,610
- Dae Geun... - That will never happen.

534
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:17,178
I told you we'd never get together again.

535
00:36:17,179 --> 00:36:18,449
Don't make me mad and just leave.

536
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:20,448
I've decided to spend the rest of my life with her.

537
00:36:20,449 --> 00:36:21,449
What?

538
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:22,949
Do you want to die?

539
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,690
Once you get involved with that family, you're dead meat.

540
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,259
Do you think that old man will be okay with it?

541
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,360
I'm not scared.

542
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:30,860
You never know when you're going to die,

543
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:32,500
so I want to live with that woman.

544
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:33,759
I don't care if he kills me or not!

545
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,328
What's wrong with you, Honey?

546
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:36,999
I won't allow it.

547
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,899
Even if the world ends tomorrow,

548
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,138
I refuse to let you die.

549
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:41,399
You can't die before me.

550
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,710
Don't you know why I got beat up?

551
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,710
I wanted to call it even by getting beaten up!

552
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,908
You don't know how I feel!

553
00:36:45,909 --> 00:36:47,779
Cho Dae Geun. Come to your senses!

554
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,709
If you lived a pitiful life since you were young,

555
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,479
you should at least live properly now!

556
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,178
I'm doing this because I want to live properly!

557
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:54,749
Don't count your chickens before they hatch!

558
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,089
Did she say she'd get a divorce and come to you?

559
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,288
I met her husband,

560
00:36:57,289 --> 00:36:58,749
and he will never get divorced.

561
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,388
It's my life. Stay out of it.

562
00:37:00,389 --> 00:37:01,920
Both of you stay out of it!

563
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,460
Your life?

564
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:06,960
You want me to stay out of it?

565
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,159
Why did you hit him?

566
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,969
How dare you hit my husband?

567
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,428
You little brat.

568
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,170
How dare you push my husband?

569
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,808
You shouldn't say that to your brother.

570
00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:18,110
You know he cares more about you than his own kids.

571
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,010
My gosh. There's nothing you can do when someone goes crazy over a girl.

572
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,550
Honey!

573
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,590
Gosh.

574
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:49,739
I think I should go home early today.

575
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:50,939
Go ahead.

576
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,480
You were fine for a while, but I guess it's flaring up again.

577
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:55,380
I'll finish up here and report it to you.

578
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,289
Hold on.

579
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:08,788
Who are you?

580
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:10,090
Do you know Cho Dae Geun?

581
00:38:10,429 --> 00:38:12,059
I'm his older brother.

582
00:38:15,429 --> 00:38:16,929
Come here for a second.

583
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:26,780
Don't see...

584
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,079
Dae Geun anymore.

585
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:30,809
I'm sorry,

586
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:33,178
but we're getting together after I get divorced.

587
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:35,578
As long as I'm alive, I won't allow it.

588
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:37,849
I can't see my poor brother die.

589
00:38:39,659 --> 00:38:41,618
Die? What do you mean?

590
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,130
When did you see Dae Geun last?

591
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:46,558
We were supposed to meet today, but he said he had a cold...

592
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:47,730
and that we should meet another time.

593
00:38:56,969 --> 00:38:59,038
What's wrong with him? What happened?

594
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:00,078
How hurt is he?

595
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,709
Your father...

596
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,449
hired people to beat him up.

597
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,750
My father?

598
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:09,050
My father doesn't know we're seeing each other.

599
00:39:12,989 --> 00:39:14,158
Of course, he knows.

600
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:15,489
This isn't the first time either.

601
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:16,988
What do you mean?

602
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:18,189
On the day of your marriage,

603
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,599
didn't you and Dae Geun...

604
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:22,360
plan to run away after the wedding?

605
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,698
That night, your father hired some thugs...

606
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:28,599
to beat Dae Geun to a pulp.

607
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:32,209
He was half dead and passed out in front of my house.

608
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,940
If I didn't see him at dawn on my way out,

609
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,449
Dae Geun...

610
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,480
wouldn't be alive today.

611
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,820
Because he hurt his back that day,

612
00:39:40,949 --> 00:39:43,420
he hasn't been able to do any work that requires labour.

613
00:39:43,789 --> 00:39:44,920
I can't allow it anymore.

614
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:48,789
I got hurt working in construction.

615
00:39:50,059 --> 00:39:52,559
If you care about my brother, let him go.

616
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,159
His only sin is being poor...

617
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,929
and being uneducated.

618
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,529
If he cherishes his own child,

619
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:59,239
he should know to cherish other children too.

620
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,039
How much better are you than him...

621
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,110
to ruin his life like this?

622
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:13,519
Father!

623
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:16,820
Come here!

624
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,250
What's wrong with her?

625
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:24,289
- What's wrong? - What did you do Cho Dae Geun?

626
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,859
You hired thugs to beat him up 18 years ago,

627
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,359
and he hurt his back.

628
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,130
This time, he split his head open.

629
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,730
Wait... What are you talking about?

630
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,768
- I don't understand. - Stay out of this, Mom.

631
00:40:33,769 --> 00:40:35,170
- I'm home... - Why did you do it?

632
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:37,670
Why did you do something so scary?

633
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:40,609
What is it that you wanted to protect? Money?

634
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:42,479
Did you do something like that...

635
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,710
to protect the money you saved up?

636
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:46,519
You didn't marry me off to Nam Chul for my sake.

637
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,449
When you stopped me from divorcing him after his affair,

638
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:51,219
it wasn't for my sake.

639
00:40:51,489 --> 00:40:53,389
It was to protect your assets.

640
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,589
I won't live according to your will anymore.

641
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,730
I lived according to your wishes up until now,

642
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:00,598
but I won't be your doll anymore.

643
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:03,029
Wait... What are you talking about?

644
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,598
Can you help me understand?

645
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:06,269
I was forced to break up with him because of you,

646
00:41:06,869 --> 00:41:08,439
and I married the wrong person.

647
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,468
I had two kids with him,

648
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:11,269
but I lived as an empty shell with him.

649
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:12,980
I want to divorce him.

650
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,948
I want to live the rest of my life with that man.

651
00:41:15,949 --> 00:41:17,909
I don't need your inheritance!

652
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,650
I don't want to be your daughter anymore.

653
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,780
Give up on me,

654
00:41:20,781 --> 00:41:22,989
and let this man live with that young wench.

655
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:24,889
I'm going to pack my things and move out!

656
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:33,299
Based on what I just heard,

657
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,098
this is all your fault.

658
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:37,999
My daughter changed because you cheated on her.

659
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,269
It seems like she started seeing someone else because you cheated,

660
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,768
so you should take responsibility for it.

661
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:45,110
Does it feel good to divide a daughter from her dad?

662
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,710
Get on your knees and beg for her forgiveness upstairs.

663
00:41:49,949 --> 00:41:51,280
Why are you just standing there?

664
00:41:51,449 --> 00:41:53,519
Go up and comfort her!

665
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:55,549
I'll leave.

666
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,690
What?

667
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,589
Don't pour gasoline on a fire and just stay quiet!

668
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:00,760
I'll leave.

669
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,119
You don't have anywhere to go.

670
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:03,689
Do you have money?

671
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,429
I don't have anywhere to go nor do I have any money.

672
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,030
I already knew...

673
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:09,530
she was seeing someone.

674
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:13,699
I even made the effort to make her come back to me.

675
00:42:13,869 --> 00:42:15,139
I pleaded with her,

676
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,440
and I even asked her boyfriend to let her go.

677
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,409
But I'm at my limit.

678
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,940
Since this is how we are,

679
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,808
we will go our separate ways.

680
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:27,280
- What has gotten into you? - I can't take it anymore!

681
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,989
The humiliation and shame I felt as a man?

682
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,389
I only tolerated it...

683
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,190
for our children.

684
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:39,800
I put up with it year after year,

685
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:43,099
and I made it this far by letting you walk all over my pride.

686
00:42:45,369 --> 00:42:46,869
But I can't do it anymore.

687
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:49,510
We will handle the legal matter gradually.

688
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,639
When I first came here,

689
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,909
I didn't even have a single new pair of underpants,

690
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:59,210
and that is how I'll leave this house.

691
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,920
You're not kicking me out.

692
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:04,519
I'm leaving on my own accord.

693
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:08,590
Goodbye.

694
00:43:10,429 --> 00:43:12,530
But... Hey!

695
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,860
Nam Chul, wait!

696
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:17,530
My gosh. Mul Sang!

697
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:19,969
Mul Sang.

698
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:23,340
- Goodness. - Gosh.

699
00:44:11,489 --> 00:44:14,519
Hurrah!

700
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,369
I'm going to have to ask you to delete the video.

701
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:33,409
Please know that I can press charges.

702
00:44:49,889 --> 00:44:51,760
- Hello. - Welcome.

703
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:26,599
As if you have anywhere to go. You're broke, aren't you?

704
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,789
You might die inside at this rate.

705
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:59,329
You've lived your life putting on a façade,

706
00:45:59,699 --> 00:46:02,159
but this is what came of your hard-working life.

707
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:04,170
Did you devote your life to a Taffy vendor...

708
00:46:04,269 --> 00:46:06,639
just to end up in this state?

709
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:09,440
Your daughter stabbed you in the back,

710
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:11,210
and your son-in-law exploded in your face.

711
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:13,710
Life was for nothing, and you must be lonely.

712
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:15,909
Gosh, I'm lonely.

713
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:18,750
Where's Geum Ah?

714
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:21,578
She packed her bag but then the other one left,

715
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:24,090
so she went back upstairs to unpack.

716
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:26,388
I don't get her, though.

717
00:46:26,389 --> 00:46:28,019
Why is she back with her ex-boyfriend?

718
00:46:28,659 --> 00:46:30,659
And I was the only one who was in the dark.

719
00:46:31,429 --> 00:46:32,629
I also can't believe Nam Chul.

720
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:34,460
As if leaving this house will do him any good.

721
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,829
He's brazen for someone who's broke.

722
00:46:39,769 --> 00:46:40,869
Just you wait and see.

723
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:42,539
He'll come back begging for forgiveness.

724
00:46:57,219 --> 00:46:58,219
Hey.

725
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:06,089
Why did you sleep out here instead of coming in?

726
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:10,099
Right. I got here too late and couldn't wake you up.

727
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:11,469
Why did you come here late at night?

728
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:15,369
Well, I took time off from work.

729
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:18,170
I couldn't even call in advance though.

730
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:21,380
Good for you. You should get a break too.

731
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,510
Clear your head and rest all you want.

732
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:25,710
Thanks, Nam Soon.

733
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:28,650
Dad will be delighted. Let's go inside.

734
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:31,119
I bought a few snacks for Dad.

735
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:42,030
Why did you buy so much when you're broke?

736
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:43,369
I have money.

737
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:52,469
Dad, it's Nam Chul.

738
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,809
You didn't eat, though. Will you be all right?

739
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,750
Food isn't the issue right now.

740
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,349
The company needs a boss present.

741
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:03,420
How else will I know who's tanking my business?

742
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:10,730
What is it, Mr. Lee?

743
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:14,199
What?

744
00:48:18,269 --> 00:48:19,768
(Authorized personnel only. Enter at your own risk.)

745
00:48:19,769 --> 00:48:22,069
(This building is planned for demolition.)

746
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:23,739
(Three Brothers Resources Corp.)

747
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:30,110
We got here only to see this.

748
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:31,280
What happened?

749
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:34,150
Why is it not us that's in charge of the demolition?

750
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:36,050
I think we've been duped.

751
00:48:36,449 --> 00:48:39,319
Mr. Ji was against the bid, but you insisted...

752
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,159
How much did you wire in advance?

753
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:43,359
- Four... - What?

754
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,960
We wired four million dollars.

755
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,800
You've got to be kidding me.

756
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,869
Mr. Ko!

757
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:03,510
Hurry.

758
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:13,659
What do we do?

759
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:15,860
What if he doesn't recover from this?

760
00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:28,369
Even if we report it,

761
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:29,639
it'll take a while to make an arrest.

762
00:49:30,809 --> 00:49:33,110
They immediately leave the country, making it hard to catch them.

763
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:37,250
I'm afraid we'll need Mr. Ji.

764
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:40,150
He was against us bidding on this project,

765
00:49:40,679 --> 00:49:42,050
but Mr. Ko insisted.

766
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:53,460
Ms. Cho.

767
00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:55,259
That's new.

768
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:56,469
Why aren't you calling Dae Geun first?

769
00:49:56,829 --> 00:49:59,030
Don't give him anything to eat. He won't even listen to his brother.

770
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,699
He has been dealt a rough life, hasn't he?

771
00:50:01,969 --> 00:50:03,610
What does he see in an older woman?

772
00:50:03,969 --> 00:50:05,069
Things would be great...

773
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:06,308
if he got back together with Eun Byeol.

774
00:50:06,309 --> 00:50:08,309
That's nonsense. She's out of the question.

775
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,649
Others work hard wanting to live,

776
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:14,179
but you're actively trying to ruin your life.

777
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:16,519
Do as you wish if you want to sever ties with me.

778
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:28,099
- Where's Uncle Dae Geun? - Leave him alone.

779
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:29,360
Something happened.

780
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,639
Ms. Cho, here's a gift for you.

781
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,840
What's this?

782
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:41,379
It's pretty.

783
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,150
I was thinking about getting a purse like this.

784
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:45,949
I read your mind, didn't I?

785
00:50:46,519 --> 00:50:47,550
Do you like it?

786
00:50:47,949 --> 00:50:49,989
- It's pretty. - It's genuine cowhide leather.

787
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:51,190
How much was it?

788
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,589
It was 200 dollars, but I got it for 180.

789
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:54,719
That was ballsy of you.

790
00:50:54,789 --> 00:50:57,190
It was the least I could do for my daughter's first day at work.

791
00:50:58,159 --> 00:50:59,159
See how it looks on you.

792
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,769
You really look like a teacher.

793
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:06,799
But she is a real teacher.

794
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,969
You'd look amazing going to work like that.

795
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:12,469
Thanks, Dad.

796
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,138
I may not be good at choosing women,

797
00:51:15,139 --> 00:51:16,780
but I'm an expert at picking out purses.

798
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,650
What nonsense is that?

799
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:21,419
As if you could've married someone better. Goodness.

800
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:24,219
Eun Kang, here's my gift. A pencil case and stamps.

801
00:51:25,489 --> 00:51:26,489
What's that?

802
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:29,090
She can stamp them on her students' assignments.

803
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:31,659
"Good job," "You're the best," and "Thumbs up."

804
00:51:32,059 --> 00:51:33,130
The last one is a red balloon.

805
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,960
It's for the student who did the best job.

806
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,699
You love red balloons, right?

807
00:51:37,429 --> 00:51:38,429
Nicely done.

808
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,500
Don't you have anything for her?

809
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,239
Isn't cooking for her enough?

810
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:46,170
Cook her breakfast early in the morning.

811
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:49,380
We will now have breakfast when it's appropriate for Ms. Cho.

812
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,579
Raise your hand if you agree.

813
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:54,118

Didn't you say that his younger sister was a doctor?

829

He lied. Not everyone can be a doctor.

It'll cost me at least 100 dollars.

Go ahead. Treat them to a meal.

We should now be able to hold our heads high.

I didn't steal it.

You received money from her three years ago.

How much did you receive?

I'm just cross-checking the fact.

870

It was 500 dollars.

871

It was only that one time three years ago.

872

I had no idea this was what she'd do.

She asked me to get her a discarded design at least.

874
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:22,259
A few months ago, you even gave her a design...

for her department store exhibition.

- That's... - Tell her to be honest.

877
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:29,428
I gave her a discarded sketch.

Who says I discarded it?

879
00:55:30,699 --> 00:55:33,130
You crumpled it, so I thought you threw it out.

880

Ms. Na threatened me,

881
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,469
and I just gave her what you didn't need.

882
00:55:38,309 --> 00:55:40,980
She kept threatening me with the 500 dollars I got.

883
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,178
She said she'd tell you.

884
00:55:43,179 --> 00:55:44,579
I gave it to her out of fear.

885
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:47,650
I had no idea she'd make knock-offs with it.

Ba Da, I'm sorry.

888
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:54,158
you knew it all and still cooperated.

889
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:55,619
This means you are an accomplice.

890
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:57,929
No, I didn't.

She could unlock my computer, my safe, and everything.

00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,630
caused my business to go down.

The 500 dollars was...

913
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:07,260
to pay for my mom's appendectomy.

914

My family was too poor...

915

to afford anything.

916
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:14,238
I was so rushed...

917
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:16,439
that I handed her a design you didn't use.

918
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:17,669
That dragonfly wing design.

919
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:19,969
You decided not to manage it because it was a waste of money.

920

I took the money for my mom,

but I was anxious you might find out.

922

And Na Bun Nyeon dragged me around over it.

923
00:57:27,219 --> 00:57:28,550
I was a fool.

The sketch you threw out before the exhibition.

925

I thought you threw it out. I swear.

926
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:37,460
I meant to cut her off after that last time.

927
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:39,689

bad blood between you and the department store...

929
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:43,869
and even make counterfeits to cause that refund incident.

01:00:33,869 --> 01:00:37,639
First off, you must be punished for making me go down.

978
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:40,380
You ruined my well-built career.

979
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,038
You caused me to go out of business and end up with this shabby office.

980
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:44,578
You made me debt-saddled.

981
01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:46,308
You stole my design and sold it.

982
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:47,519
You'll be punished...

983
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,150
for everything you did.

984
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:51,690
You saw that the lawsuit said...

985
01:00:52,090 --> 01:00:54,159
I was demanding 30,009.90 dollars, right?

986
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:57,860
No matter how much you pay, it won't be enough to soothe me.

987
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,959
If it's less than 30,000 dollars, there won't be a written judgement.

988
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,929
I'm demanding 30,000 dollars so it leaves a written judgement.

989
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,670
I'll only get 15,000 to 20,000 dollars anyway.

990
01:01:07,139 --> 01:01:08,440
I'll leave your crime...

991
01:01:08,769 --> 01:01:10,299
on a written judgement...

992
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,039
to make it your life-long scarlet letter.

993
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:15,909
I doubt you have any sort of fame to your name,

994
01:01:16,309 --> 01:01:17,980
but I'll defame you all I can.

995
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:19,610
Oh, right.

996
01:01:19,849 --> 01:01:21,779
The 9 dollars and 90 cents is...

997
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:23,550
for a home-shopping cheap product.

998
01:01:24,190 --> 01:01:25,489
In short,

999
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:27,788
the 9 dollars and 90 cents is your worth.

1000
01:01:27,789 --> 01:01:29,059
Very cheap.

1001
01:01:29,659 --> 01:01:31,090
Even if it hurts your pride, put up with it.

1002
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:34,000
You better write a defence paper as soon as possible.

1003
01:01:34,329 --> 01:01:36,198
It bears interest from the day you receive the lawsuit.

1004
01:01:36,199 --> 01:01:38,469
It's quite high. Was it 12 percent?

1005
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,130
Write it within a month.

1006
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:43,638
Be honest and truthful so that the clueless judge...

1007
01:01:43,639 --> 01:01:45,440
can see the situation through.

1008
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:47,739
That's what you should do.

1009
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:52,179
One more thing. Cha Won and I are putting off our divorce.

1010
01:01:53,849 --> 01:01:55,820
I'll think about it after punishing you first.

1011
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:00,489
Didn't he...

1012
01:02:01,059 --> 01:02:02,519
tell you anything about this?

1013
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:09,429
Why would you trust someone else's man and get cheeky?

1014
01:02:10,469 --> 01:02:13,429
He is still my man.

1015
01:02:14,469 --> 01:02:16,139
I'll take any kind of punishment.

1016
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:18,570
But please...

1017
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:23,980
I can finally put the pieces together.

1018
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:27,449
Your plan moved with every chess piece you played.

1019
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,550
Your whole family was the pieces.

1020
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:35,190
My in-laws' housekeeper.

1021
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,260
She was your mom.

1022
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,759
The taxi driver we called for errands.

1023
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,099
It was your dad.

1024
01:02:43,929 --> 01:02:45,429
What's more surprising is...

1025
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:47,469
your sister.

1026
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,639
What and how much did you gain by introducing them one by one?

1027
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:55,409
This is like the movie, "Parasite."

1028
01:02:58,579 --> 01:02:59,980
It was for money.

1029
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:02,920
You can't imagine what it's like to be poor, can you?

1030
01:03:03,889 --> 01:03:06,019
We don't get even a single penny for free.

1031
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:08,618
We make ends meet without anything left.

1032
01:03:08,619 --> 01:03:10,460
You won't know...

1033
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:12,690
just how tough that is.

1034
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:17,329
I simply wanted them to make more money.

1035
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:19,269
I regret it too.

1036
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,968
I never thought things would end up like this.

1037
01:03:21,969 --> 01:03:23,839
Look at yourself floundering about after getting caught...

1038
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,139
in the trap you set for yourself.

1039
01:03:26,309 --> 01:03:27,579
You didn't know this would happen?

1040
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:30,710
I never should've become friends with someone...

1041
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:34,849
who hid the lipstick when everyone gave theirs to the teacher.

1042
01:03:36,619 --> 01:03:39,949
Cho Eun Kang. You ruined my life in one go,

1043
01:03:41,159 --> 01:03:42,320
but I won't end yours all at once.

1044
01:03:44,059 --> 01:03:45,159
I'll kill you...

1045
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,559
little by little...

1046
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:49,960
and drain every ounce of blood left in your body.

1047
01:03:50,969 --> 01:03:52,730
If you let a cockroach go,

1048
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:54,800
you'll be too nervous to sleep.

1049
01:03:56,039 --> 01:03:58,139
You need to kill them completely in a gruesome manner.

1050
01:04:05,179 --> 01:04:06,250
Oh, right.

1051

Aren't you embarrassed hiding there?

1053
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:14,618
I was going to prove that he was my man,

1054
01:04:14,619 --> 01:04:15,619
but I held myself back.

1055
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:20,489
I'm sorry. Ba Da.

1056

Please forgive me just once.

What do you want me to do?

1059
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:28,039
I'm going to start working soon.

1060
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,769

This is just the beginning.

You adulterer. I'll see you in court.

1064
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,578
I was forced to break up with him because of you,

1065
01:05:15,579 --> 01:05:17,289
and I married the wrong person.

1066
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:18,420
I had two kids with him,

1067
01:05:18,421 --> 01:05:20,050
but I lived as an empty shell with him.

1068

I want to divorce him.
