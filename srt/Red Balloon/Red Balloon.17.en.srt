A woman, of course. Must you even ask?

He seemed head over heels for her.

Dae Geun and I are so alike.

45

We always get hooked by older women.

She must've done a number on him...

I came here because I couldn't contain my anger.

98
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:23,589
My daughter backing off nicely doesn't make her a pushover.

99
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:25,519
- Your son hurt her. - What?

100
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,329
As his parents, you should've begged for her forgiveness.

What do you think you're doing?

102

What happened to your collar? Did you do this to him?

103
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,670
That's right. It was me.

104
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,600
Unbelievable. I never raised a hand at your daughter,

105
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,370
but you had the audacity to grab him by his clothes.

You sure have a lot of strength for a sick woman.

Is that what bothers you?

108

You might just hit me.

110
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,220
Both daughter and mother are just as primitive.

111
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,149
What? Did you call us primitive?

112
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:55,420
That's exactly how you are.

113
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,990
How dare you grab my son by his collar?

114
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,420
I did it because he deserved it.

115
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,029
Don't look down on Ba Da because she has no one to lean on.

I'm not dead yet.

117
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:08,569
But after I die, I'll come back as a ghost...

118
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,699
to get revenge for her.

119
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:12,069
Take that!

120
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:13,600
Take that?

121
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:16,870
All this time you pretended to be refined and classy.

122
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,410
Let's be honest here. Had your daughter been better,

123
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,680
my son wouldn't have stepped out on her.

124
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,750
Quiet!

125
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,220
Ms. Yeo, I'm sorry.

126
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,949
I have been waiting for the right moment...

127
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,920
since there wasn't a way to appease her right now.

128
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,560
What are you waiting for...

129
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,730
when he's already living with his mistress?

130
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,290
When the son is in the wrong,

131
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,629
the parents should teach him otherwise.

132
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,069
What is she talking about? Are you living with her?

133
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:46,170
- No. - I saw them myself.

134
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,509
Is it true?

135
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,170
How would I know?

136
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,370
I'm sure it's not true.

137
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,079
The divorce hasn't been finalized yet.

138
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:54,649
Eun Kang must've gone by the place to look after Mi Poong.

139
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,879
She has been doing that for a long time.

140
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,079
See? Ba Da has her friend caring for her own child,

141
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,019
but you had the audacity to yell at us.

142
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:03,089
What?

143
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:09,060
I blame you for all of this!

144
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:12,759
My son's mother-in-law just dragged him in by the collar.

145
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,870
She came all the way to our house...

146
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,600
to lay one on us.

147
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:18,199
We're in this mess just because of you.

148
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,769
I heard you were even at his house.

149
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,870
Did you waltz in there now that Ba Da is gone?

150
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,240
Of course not, Ms. Na. That isn't the case.

151
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,709
Don't you get any weird ideas.

152
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,050
How dare you?

153
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,220
You and Cha Won are in a different league.

You get what I mean, right?

155
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,289
Eun Kang, can we talk?

156
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,330
Sure.

157
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:47,129
Really?

158
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:50,970
Your mom went to him and demanded 100,000 dollars.

159
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,970
Eun San isn't some bargaining chip. I can't believe her.

160
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,210
Don't get mad at your mom though.

161
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,210
There's a reason people receive compensation.

162
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,779
Anyway, I thought you should know.

163
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:03,710
Don't tell Eun San, though.

You know she'll throw a fit.

165
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,960
It's the money you gave me.

166
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:13,289
Give it to my mom.

167
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:14,789
You probably realized it by now,

168
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:16,289
but she won't back off until you pay her.

169
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,629
Thank you, Eun Kang.

170
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:20,600
I didn't give it back to hear you thank me.

171
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:24,269
It was to help my sister be at ease.

172
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:26,070
- Then... - How's Eun San...

173
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:28,340
How is she doing?

174
00:09:29,909 --> 00:09:31,740
Don't ask things like that.

175
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,740
Don't be curious in any way.

176
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:37,350
Just assume that she's doing fine.

177
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,350
It must be hard for you too.

178
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,159
Don't get your hopes up, though.

179
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,389
I don't know how Cha Won really feels,

180
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:49,230
but most men including myself...

181
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:51,629
are selfish cowards.

182
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,470
Not many men will break up their families for another woman.

183
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:56,399
Times may have changed,

184
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,039
and being divorced isn't a flaw anymore,

185
00:09:58,669 --> 00:09:59,840
but that's how men are.

186
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,669
There are multiple reasons for that,

187
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:03,440
but mainly, it's for their kids.

188
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:06,279
Don't be upset with what I said, though.

189
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:09,080
That's just reality.

190
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,919
I've decided to take the path...

191
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,850
to see where it ends.

192
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,090
I don't want to crumble to those...

193
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:22,690
who belittles and dismisses me.

194
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,399
The pain makes it hard for me to get up in the morning.

195
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,870
But since I've come this far,

196
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,070
I'm going to go all the way.

197
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,610
Darn it.

198
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:44,980
What's with this knife? Gosh, I'm lonely.

199
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:47,820
Hey!

200
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,519
Why are you yelling for me?

201
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,690
My gosh. Why are you sharpening your knife?

202
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,190
It's scaring me.

203
00:10:57,429 --> 00:10:59,629
Why is that? Are you guilty of something?

204
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:01,299
I've been scared of knives as a child...

205
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:03,000
which is why I don't work in the kitchen.

206
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:05,570
I should watch my words in front of someone with a knife.

207
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,039
You don't cook because you're scared of knives?

208
00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:08,409
You have an excuse for everything.

209
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,110
I'm stepping out for a bit.

210
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,279
You went out yesterday as well. What has gotten into you lately?

211
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,779
My friends have been asking me out...

212
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,309
since I'd be busy once the school year begins.

213
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,720
That outfit looks new. When did you buy it?

214
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:23,419
You have no loyalty. How could you go shopping alone?

215
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,090
I didn't buy it.

216
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,559
I used to wear it when I was little in elementary school.

217
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:28,659
In elementary school?

218
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,360
Let's move on.

219
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:31,730
- Oh, my! - Oh, gosh.

220
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:34,769
You should do some cleaning with me today.

221
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:36,500
Dad is sharpening his knives.

222
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,070
Tomorrow, Mom. I'll be back soon.

223
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,440
Dad, I'll do it when I get back.

224
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,700
Leave this just as it is.

225
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:43,210
Hey. What's up with her?

226
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,409
What is she wearing? She's over 50 years old.

227
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:46,480
Leave her be.

228
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,409
She said she wore it back in elementary school.

229
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:49,610
In which grade?

230
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,620
Sixth grade? Fifth grade?

231
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,149
Fourth grade.

232
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,720
Let's just turn a blind eye.

233
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:58,990
You should ask your age before you decide to wear something.

234
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,460
Someone might think she's having an affair.

235
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:04,799
Women who are having an affair might not realize it themselves,

236
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,360
but others notice it first.

237
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,070
They say the apartment's security guard is the first to know.

238
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,769
We don't even have a security guard. Who'd even think such a thing?

239
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,370
Oh, right.

240
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,639
This isn't the time to be sharpening your knives.

241
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,379
If those guys end up pregnant, it'll be a huge problem.

242
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,850
Right now?

243
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,250
Well, I was going to go to Mount Seorak.

244
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,450
It's something urgent?

245
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,559
I can't.

246
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:34,259
I have to get going now to see the sunrise at Daecheongbong Peak.

247
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,860
I understand, Chairman Ko.

248
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,240
Why are you going to Daecheongbong Peak?

249
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,169
I hike up there now and then when my heart feels heavy.

250
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,080
The girl your son-in-law was involved with...

251
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,250
has all been sorted out, right?

252
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,950
She's a rude brat.

253
00:12:56,549 --> 00:12:57,919
I told her to sign a memorandum, but she wouldn't.

254
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,279
I tried dragging her by the collar...

255
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,580
to go see her parents, but she wouldn't budge.

256
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,919
- She's not your average girl. - You grabbed her by the collar?

257
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:04,490
It's a figure of speech.

258
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,059
But what has that young lady done wrong?

259
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:07,389
It's your son-in-law who's rotten.

260
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:10,529
You once said I should teach the adulterers a lesson.

261
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,600
Some might think you were her father.

262
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,470
Besides,

263
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,200
it's the girl who's stuck to my son that's the problem.

264
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,399
I tried to go see her parents,

265
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,840
- but she said she didn't have any. - She said she was an orphan?

266
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,740
I thought I heard her parents were alive,

267
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,009
but she suddenly said she didn't have any parents.

268
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:28,080
She was asking for forgiveness,

269
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,779
but I don't think she'll let my son go.

270
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:32,879
She seems to come and go from his place too.

271
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,090

It's nice to meet you. My name is Cho Eun Kang.

It's good to meet you.

00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:05,580
You know,

281
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:08,509
I can't sleep because I'm too frustrated.

282
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:09,879
That's why I'm saying this.

283
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:17,220
Wait. The two of you...

284
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:25,700
Your last name is Cho too, isn't it?

285
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:28,529
It's not Cho. My last name is Joo.

286
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:31,769
I've told you that my name was Joo Dae Bong.

287
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,039
Was your last name Joo?

288
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:35,009
I thought your last name was Cho all this time.

289
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,980
The two of you...

290
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:40,179
look oddly similar.

291
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:41,549
I doubt that's true.

292

I'll be sure to get the message across.

295

You should head home first, sir.

296

All right.

297
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,529
Listen and do as he says.

298
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,059
I hope we never meet again!

00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:27,490
One, two, three, four, five...

326
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:28,960
That's 100,000.

327
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:32,130
Wait. Let me count that again.

328
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,829
One, two, three, four, five zeros.

329
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,140
What's so great about this little piece of paper?

330
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:42,910
We live with our lives on the line for this thing.

331
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:45,940
Even a dog wouldn't take this money.

332
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,450
It's your fault we turned out this way.

333
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,750
You should've taken care of it on your own!

334
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:55,349
You should've at least kept it from your own kids!

335
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,519
You and Dad made her this way!

336
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:59,289
If you can't do anything for us because of money,

337
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:01,059
at least love us since it doesn't cost anything.

338
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:03,490
Why else do you think I don't talk about things at home?

339
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:18,539
Is...

340
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,880
Is that true?

341
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,579
We didn't know...

342
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:25,180
our own kids.

343
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,890
I thought I knew my kids best.

344
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:32,390
But I didn't know them at all.

345
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,160
How could both of them...

346
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:39,160
What is this rotten situation?

347
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:42,069
What will they do with their lives now?

348
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:45,039
Do you know what shocked me most?

349
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:46,740
People like us...

350
00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:49,440
catch on quickly and can think on our feet.

351
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,640
Signs of poverty that our bodies remember.

352
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,779
People from wealthy families who were raised with love...

353
00:22:56,779 --> 00:22:59,480
don't worry or think much about other people.

354
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,279
That's because they didn't have to.

355
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,059
When she saw me at the tea house,

356
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,029
others would have been so shocked,

357
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:13,259
but she pretended as if she didn't know me.

358
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,170
She's gotten so used to living that way.

359
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,569
It was like muscle memory.

360
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,940
I can see how Eun Kang lived until now.

361
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,049
I can see how our daughters survived.

362
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:30,750
It's because we were poor.

363
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,119
They needed to catch on quickly so they wouldn't starve.

364
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:35,690
I didn't have anything to say...

365
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:37,619
or anywhere to go.

366
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,690
So I walked over to the river.

367
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,490
She just followed me silently.

368
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:46,160
As I was looking at the river,

369
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:49,829
I realized I had shoved...

370
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,039
my kids into that cold river.

371
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:55,809
I told that old man...

372
00:23:57,109 --> 00:23:59,240
that he had to teach the mistresses a lesson.

373
00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:01,710
We went to catch Eun San together.

374
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,509
I told him to punish Eun Kang.

375
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:09,019
Thinking of Eun San in that apartment...

376
00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:10,390
still scares me.

377
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:12,420
How can a father and daughter...

378
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,359
meet in that way?

379
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,259
I ended up...

380
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:21,569
meeting Eun Kang like that today.

381
00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:26,839
I cried while looking at the river.

382
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:31,740
She didn't blame me for anything...

383
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,049
and quietly patted me on the back.

384
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,349
She must be having a hard time, but she was consoling me.

385
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,230
How can I pay for my sins?

386
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:52,059
What am I supposed to do?

387
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,400
I'm really going to lose it.

388
00:24:56,069 --> 00:24:57,630
It's not your fault.

389
00:24:58,299 --> 00:24:59,539
It's my fault.

390
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,640
I ran my mouth while working at that house.

391
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,910
I pushed them into that misery.

392
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:07,910
I ruined my own daughters.

393
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,150
I shouldn't even call myself a mom.

394
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:15,920
We didn't know things would turn out this way.

395
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,619
Let's not cry.

396
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,890
We need to cheer up for them to keep going.

397
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,329
Okay.

398
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:31,329
Eun Kang...

399
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,140
Eun San...

400
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,039
Right now?

401
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,869
You two aren't fighting, are you?

402
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,480
Okay, Mom. I'll come home with Eun San.

403
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,430
Welcome, our daughters.

404
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,069
You promised not to cry.

405
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,539
What is all of this?

406
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:12,680
Your mom wanted to have a bonding day with the family.

407
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,950
Without Uncle. Just us.

408
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,150
Your father and I blew so many balloons.

409
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,450
What are you talking about?

410
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,049
Do you even lie to your family?

411
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:24,349
We got tired of blowing them, so we bought a pump.

412
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:28,490
They're pretty. Eun Kang likes balloons.

413
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,460
Oh, no.

414
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,029
Eun Kang doesn't like it when I wear this.

415
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,700
Why do you keep wearing that?

416
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,769
She paid a lot of money for it. She wants to get her money's worth.

417
00:26:38,069 --> 00:26:40,799
I thought it was spandex. That rotten woman.

418
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,839
The woman who owns the clothing store.

419
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:43,970
Sit down. It won't break.

420
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,680
It'll be fine for another ten years.

421
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:47,309
Sit.

422
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:55,450
Your mom made all of this.

423
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:56,920
She made your favourites.

424
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,589
I paid for it, okay?

425
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,460
Why did you make so much?

426
00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:04,059
- You must've spent a lot of money. - A bit.

427
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:05,960
For our daughters.

428
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:08,869
I even bought champagne.

429
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,940
Oh, right. Champagne glasses.

430
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,910
- We can drink it in anything. - Okay.

431
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:23,880
Goodness.

432
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:29,019
Okay. Let's have a party with our precious daughters.

433
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,990
Eun Kang. Eun San.

434
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:06,589
I'm sorry.

435
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:10,329
Also, thank you.

436
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:15,630
Nothing happened.

437
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,269
Let's forget everything and start fresh.

438
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,740
Don't worry.

439
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,410
I'll block you from the stones people throw at you.

440
00:28:27,309 --> 00:28:31,150
No matter what others say, you two are my precious daughters.

441
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,619
Sorry, Father,

442
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,720
for not being any better.

443
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:41,829
Don't say such a thing.

444
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:45,700
I trust you two.

445
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,730
I'm sorry.

446
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,670
I wasn't a good mom.

447
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:54,140
I didn't even act like an adult.

448
00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:56,970
I didn't do you any favours.

449
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,009
It was my responsibility to raise you,

450
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:02,279
but I didn't understand that and hurt you.

451
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,750
It's because I'm stupid. Please forgive me.

452
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,990
(Cashier's Check, 100,000 dollars)

453
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:20,430
I've never seen 100,000 dollars...

454
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,130
in my whole life.

455
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:25,740
I've never touched that kind of money.

456
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,809
I was happy when I got it.

457
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:32,410
I thought this would solve everything.

458
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,950
I thought Eun San's life would turn around.

459
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:40,079
I used to get so excited...

460
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,720
whenever I saw...

461
00:29:43,819 --> 00:29:45,119
any amount of money,

462
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:50,529
but I've never seen money that made me so sad.

463
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,140
Keep this and look into opening a store.

464
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:07,210
You need to take care of yourself.

465
00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:09,049
Be tough.

466
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:12,980
People like us don't die over things like this.

467
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,420
I've never seen you give away money like that.

468
00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:21,859
It's not good for people to change so quickly.

469
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,490
Take it slow.

470
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:26,730
What are you talking about? It's better to change in one go.

471
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,299
Like with smoking. You need to quit in one go.

472
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:31,069
Why would you quit gradually?

473
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:34,069
That's why you can't quit. Aren't I right?

474
00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:35,410
You're right.

475
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,910
Okay. Why not!

476
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,740
Thanks for cooking today, Mom.

477
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:44,009
I'll buy you some new clothes too.

478
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:46,880
Why are you suddenly giving me money?

479
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,480
Look at your hand shoot forward.

480
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,420
You should quit money.

481
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,660
Let her enjoy some financial healing.

482
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:54,660
Do that thing, Mom.

483
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,630
"My goodness."

484
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:59,630
My goodness.

485
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:01,859
You're good.

486
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,500
You should do it too.

487
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,539
My goodness.

488
00:31:07,339 --> 00:31:11,140
Gosh. You two really are Yang Ban Sook's daughters.

489
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:13,809
Of course. They're my daughters.

490
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,410
Don't you have anything?

491
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,150
I haven't gotten paid yet.

492
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,920
That's right. Mom, here.

493
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,490
You put it on your face like this.

494
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:30,730
I've used it all up.

495
00:31:36,069 --> 00:31:37,569
- Here. - Give it to me.

496
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:41,640
I'm feeling great today.

497
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:43,940
Here, Cho Dae Bong. A tip.

498
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,750
I got this beauty product and a tip.

499
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:51,650
You two. Tell me your wish.

500
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,819
We only have one wish.

501
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,819
For you two to stop fighting.

502
00:31:56,819 --> 00:31:59,359
We won't fight anymore. Do you want proof?

503
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,960
The kids are watching.

504
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,940
Geum Ah. Let's drive around one more time.

505
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,440
We've done that three times already.

506
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:20,809
How did we live without seeing each other until now?

507
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,809
Should we do what we used to do before?

508
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,079
- You didn't forget, right? - Of course not.

509
00:32:32,089 --> 00:32:35,589
A nice big sweet potato

510
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,690
A watery sweet potato

511
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,660
A chestnut sweet potato

512
00:32:39,859 --> 00:32:43,230
A pumpkin sweet potato

513
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I'm going to eat until I get sick

514
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,640
Cho Dae Geun.

515
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,269
Since you're not here, the sweet potatoes are rotting.

516
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,579
Oh, my chin.

517
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,509
Oh, that hurts.

518
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:59,579
You should head home.

519
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,950
- Okay. - Okay. Head on in.

520
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:28,950
Let's talk.

521
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:45,829
Stop seeing him.

522
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,000
Why not? Am I not allowed to?

523
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:51,029
What?

524
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,609
I'm doing what you did. Am I not allowed to?

525
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,069
Geum Ah.

526
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:58,640
I didn't say anything when you were having an affair.

527
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,910
I just told myself that it was all my fault.

528
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,079
I was a mess when I found out about your affair,

529
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,849
but now it's your turn.

530
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:07,980
We're even now, so I'm not sorry at all.

531
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:10,789
So mind your own business and turn a blind eye to it.

532
00:34:17,329 --> 00:34:19,760
The 18 years we've been together...

533
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:22,929
No, even since I met your father at the age of 17,

534
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:26,340
my emotions have been controlled and suppressed.

535
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,900
The bottled-up anger led me to being sick.

536
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,340
I have lost my pride as a man...

537
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:32,340
and the humiliation is too much to bear,

538
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,010
but I don't have the right to say anything.

539
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,309
Just like you said, we're even now.

540
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:40,920
So I'll consider this humiliation as my share.

541
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,150
- But... - Cut the nonsense.

542
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,789
Do you know how lonely I've been?

543
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,889
You made me this way.

544
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:51,389
You started all this.

545
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,059
Menopause had me stressing out,

546
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,099
but you had to go and trample...

547
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:56,800
all over your wife who is a mother of two.

548
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,630
She's 23 years my junior.

549
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:00,269
How could I be a match for her?

550
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,340
I now know why people say that age can be a weapon.

551
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:06,010
But here you are telling me to end it.

552
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,179
Take a look at yourself.

553
00:35:07,179 --> 00:35:08,739
What do you mean? What about me?

554
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,280
Do I seem desperate to you?

555
00:35:10,449 --> 00:35:12,420
Mind your own business no matter what it may seem to you.

556
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,719
I can date a man 20 years my junior too.

557
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:16,119
I just chose not to do it.

558
00:35:16,889 --> 00:35:18,289
And you call yourself a mother?

559
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,320
Tell me.

560
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,389
Can you say you behaved like a good father?

561
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,400
I understand how you feel,

562
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:28,800
and I know why you're doing this.

563
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,570
I'm sorry, Geum Ah.

564
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,699
I was wrong.

565
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:35,769
Finally.

566
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:38,440
You never apologized for your actions,

567
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,539
but now you're sorry.

568
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,340
Mr. Ji,

569
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,909
why did you marry me...

570
00:35:42,909 --> 00:35:44,179
when you didn't love me?

571
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,449
Was it to provide for your family?

572
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,380
Because you got greedy for my family's money?

573
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,289
I bet you want to punch me.

574
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:51,519
You won't be able to though...

575
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,090
because you're afraid of my father.

576
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,760
You're afraid of getting kicked out.

577
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,960
Taunt me all you want.

578
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,800
Be sarcastic all you want.

579
00:36:01,929 --> 00:36:03,829
Do whatever you want until you feel better.

580
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:04,929
That's odd.

581
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:08,199
You weren't scared at all to fool around with that skank.

582
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:10,309
Did you not see this coming...

583
00:36:10,309 --> 00:36:11,940
when you danced in front of her in your underpants?

584
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,539
You must be scared since a divorce would leave you broke.

585
00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:16,710
That's right.

586
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,750
I'm afraid of being broke.

587
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,019
So I will take whatever you say to me.

588
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:24,550
Trample on me,

589
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,820
crush me,

590
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:28,289
rip my pride to pieces,

591
00:36:28,289 --> 00:36:29,829
and spit at my face.

592
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:32,829
Just don't hurt Chun and Woon.

593
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:35,570
Our children are smart and quick to notice things.

594
00:36:36,469 --> 00:36:38,000
They know we have issues.

595
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,199
That's good to know.

596
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:41,670
They'll find out when we get divorced anyway.

597
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,909
Don't put it like that.

598
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,940
I will repent forever,

599
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,579
so end it before the children find out.

600
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:51,179
The shock and heartache...

601
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:56,920
from finding out about their mother's affair?

602
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,550
You don't know how badly it hurts.

603
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:00,420
I speak from experience.

604
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:02,889
I can't allow that.

605
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:04,590
Also,

606
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,099
a divorce will never happen to me.

607
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:09,630
If that was what I wanted,

608
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,000
I wouldn't have made it this far.

609
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,000
I devoted my life to your father...

610
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,769
by being his dog and licking his feet.

611
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:19,840
I won't give up on that.

612
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,579
I have been a businessman for over 20 years now.

613
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,409
I don't strike deals that result in a loss.

614
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:34,219
(Dae Geun)

615
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:35,219
I'm home.

616
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,130
Are you home?

617
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:41,730
That was fast.

618
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,800
It's late, so I guess there wasn't any traffic.

619
00:37:47,269 --> 00:37:48,369
Me too.

620
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,449
We'll talk tomorrow. Good night.

621
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,190
What did she say?

622
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,820
I was able to reason with her,

623
00:38:40,989 --> 00:38:42,260
and she was polite.

624
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,929
She seemed like a nice young lady.

625
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,099
What's nice about seducing a friend's husband?

626
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:48,800
I'm sure she had her reasons.

627
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,769
It takes two to tango, you know.

628
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,300
I mean...

629
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:55,539
That's just how life is.

630
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,539
Don't go looking for her...

631
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:00,210
and stay put.

632
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:01,940
I'll hang up then, sir.

633
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,289
From now on,

634
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,090
let's not cry in front of our children.

635
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:17,630
I won't.

636
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:20,199
We must stay strong for them to follow suit.

637
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:37,750
Thanks, Eun Kang.

638
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,280
Thanks for giving Mr. Ji the money.

639
00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:46,489
Anyway, I'll accept this money...

640
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,360
since accepting it will put him at ease.

641
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:53,659
I've never seen our dad cry like that before.

642
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,530
Getting caught by him...

643
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:01,539
was more humiliating than sneaking out of the café.

644
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,139
Same here.

645
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,610
Our family finding out scared me the most.

646
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:13,150
I'm not setting a good example as the older sister,

647
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:16,090
and it's embarrassing.

648
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:17,619
How pathetic of me.

649
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,590
What do you think will happen?

650
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:21,360

I'm sorry.

661
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:16,210
Couldn't you have cheated on someone more decent?

662
00:41:16,449 --> 00:41:18,380
Not many men will break up their families for another woman.

She called her bad names,

Ba Da's mom was cruel to you.

Let me apologize on her behalf.

679
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:56,210
Getting smacked around has put me more at ease.

680
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:59,849
I heard from your mother that she came by your house...

681
00:42:59,849 --> 00:43:01,150
and threw a fit.

682

My mom yelled at you, didn't she?

Yes, a little.

684

I put you through what you shouldn't have gone through.

He's the doctor who aided you in med school.

He might not make it,

which is why they want to visit him at the hospital tomorrow.

The spouses are invited too,

I don't know if she'll agree to it.

The professor officiated our wedding,

so I'm at least going to ask.

704

820
00:55:42,679 --> 00:55:45,679
No, it's fine. Let me look it up myself. Thank you.

821
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:47,880
- Should we order this one? - Yes, let's do that.

822
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:54,889
One second.

823
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,510
Eun Kang.

824
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:21,880
Did you come to meet someone?

825
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:22,920
What's with the wig?

826
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:27,190
I tried it on to see what it would look like if I cut it.

827
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:29,260
Does it look bad?

828
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,730
Yes. I saw the picture of your friend on your phone.

829
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:33,599
She looked just like this.

830
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:35,130
Why are you doing this?

831
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,829
What do you mean?

832
00:56:37,429 --> 00:56:39,199
Is she the only one who can wear her hair like this?

833
00:56:39,699 --> 00:56:41,239
I could wear something like this too.

834
00:56:42,539 --> 00:56:44,670
Right. I have somewhere to be.

835
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:36,690
Isn't it inconvenient not having a car?

836
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:43,730
It must feel inconvenient since you used to have one.

837
00:58:12,389 --> 00:58:14,260
(Fifty dollars)

838
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:17,929
(Seoul Chun Hospital)

839
00:59:20,429 --> 00:59:21,460
Thanks for today.

840
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:24,000
- I'll be going, then. - Let me drive you.

841
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,300
You don't need to pretend.

842
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,639
Everyone's gone. No one will see.

843
00:59:27,639 --> 00:59:29,769
- Let's go somewhere and talk... - I'm busy. I need to work.

844
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,710
I only came here today...

845
00:59:32,469 --> 00:59:35,210
because he helped when my mom was sick.

846
00:59:36,179 --> 00:59:38,210
I didn't come here to be your partner.

847
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:13,010
I'll come out after I get changed.

848
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:14,880
It's...

849
01:00:15,719 --> 01:00:16,880
really tough.

850
01:00:18,219 --> 01:00:20,619
I think I'm going crazy from imagining things.

851
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:23,659
You're using me, just as Ba Da did.

852
01:00:25,659 --> 01:00:27,000
You must see me as a helper...

853
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,570
you can call anytime as long as you give me some money.

854
01:00:39,539 --> 01:00:40,980
I didn't think it would upset you.

855
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:44,110
I was just grateful that you spent a lot of money.

856
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:46,550
You won't...

857
01:00:47,349 --> 01:00:48,550
get divorced, right?

858
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:52,650
As if you're denying your relationship with me.

859
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:55,690
As if you regret spending a night with me.

860
01:00:57,260 --> 01:01:01,059
When Ba Da found out and left, you chased after her.

861
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:05,230
You got divorce papers but went to a couple's meeting together.

862
01:01:05,699 --> 01:01:08,340
You dressed up really nicely today.

863
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:10,840
You must've had someone you wanted to impress.

864
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:18,380
Even when I didn't say anything, you used to know how I felt.

865
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:20,420
I don't know how to react right now.

866
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:22,480
You seem like a different person.

867
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,489
Do you know everything about me?

868
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:28,059
Drinking here alone,

869
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:30,090
I felt so worthless.

870
01:01:31,289 --> 01:01:32,860
I felt so insignificant and pitiful.

871
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:37,429
It's hard seeing you go back and forth like that.

872
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:01,960
You're still...

873
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:04,929
wearing the ring.

874
01:02:18,039 --> 01:02:19,909
I know I may seem indecisive.

875
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,079
Please understand that it's hard for me to be decisive right now.

876
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:27,619
I just want to solve things that haven't been solved.

877
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,079
I realized there were steps needed for splitting up with someone.

878
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:34,559
We should've taken more time...

879
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:37,230
to talk about Mi Poong as well,

880
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,460
but she just left without any of those steps.

881
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:42,300
I feel dumbfounded and lost.

882
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:45,630
I should do at least that.

883
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:48,139
At least that.

884
01:02:49,239 --> 01:02:51,269
I thought my life was going to be terrible forever,

885
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:52,340
but when I met you,

886
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:55,110
it felt like a million balloons were flying up into the sky.

887
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:58,179
It made me want to try again.

888
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:00,820
But what I want doesn't matter, right?

889
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:02,949
How I feel doesn't matter, right?

890
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:06,289
What was I to you?

891
01:03:07,219 --> 01:03:08,590
An emotional trash can?

892
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:09,889
A way to fulfill your desires?

893
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,489
Or a toy to play with while you were bored with marriage?

894
01:03:12,489 --> 01:03:14,329
- Eun Kang. - It doesn't matter.

895
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:16,500
It doesn't matter what I was.

896
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:20,769
Fulfill your obligations...

897
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:22,840
to me too.

898
01:03:23,539 --> 01:03:25,070
I told you what I was thinking.

899
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:27,039
It's your turn.

900
01:03:42,789 --> 01:03:45,190
It hurts even more to see you forcing yourself to try.

901
01:03:45,659 --> 01:03:47,159
Why are you doing this, Eun Kang?

902
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,860
Don't you think I imagined a future with you?

903
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:52,630
Ever since our night together,

904
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:55,940
no, I'll be honest.

905
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:57,510
Since before then.

906
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:58,769
Since way before then.

907
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:01,579
Maybe even way before you showed me how you felt,

908
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,710
I was struggling.

909
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:09,380
"How would it be to hug her?"

910
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:11,190
"What would it be like to live with a woman like that?"

911
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,190
Of course, I thought about that.

912
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:14,289
So what?

913
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:16,059
That's all.

914
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:19,829
I'm not good enough.

915
01:04:19,829 --> 01:04:21,059
How could you say that?

916
01:04:21,059 --> 01:04:23,329
People usually talk behind someone's back,

917
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:26,230
but people said things right in front of me for me to hear.

918
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:28,469
They're not even treating me like a person.

919
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:34,780
- You should stop drinking. - Do you think I'm drunk?

920
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:38,710
I've never gotten drunk before since I had to take care of others.

921
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:40,250
I've acted like I was drunk before.

922
01:04:40,679 --> 01:04:43,420
I drank because I couldn't handle this sober.

923
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:45,690
I kept wondering what you two were doing...

924
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:48,320
on your couple's trip.

925
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:51,960
I couldn't stand imagining those things. That's why I drank.

926
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,230
Eun Kang. Please.

927
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:56,030
Do you know how it feels when a balloon pops as you're blowing it?

928
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:58,400
How it feels when it pops even before you get to fly it...

929
01:04:58,869 --> 01:05:02,440
and gets stepped on by everyone after it falls to the ground.

930
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,210
I've gotten humiliated.

931
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:07,510
There's nothing I can do.

932
01:05:08,139 --> 01:05:10,750
I'm just washing away in the river,

933
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,409
and I'm about to drown.

934
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:15,980
I feel like I'm going to die.

935
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:18,820
I feel like I'm going to suffocate to death.

936
01:05:20,989 --> 01:05:22,059
Couldn't you...

937
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:25,489
grab my hand...

938
01:05:27,429 --> 01:05:30,260
and lift my pride out of the water?

939
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:35,500
I don't care if you throw me away again.

940
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:42,579
I've made my decision.

941
01:05:44,309 --> 01:05:46,210
It's your turn to make yours.

942
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:10,269
I asked Ki Han where your office was.

943
01:06:11,269 --> 01:06:12,510
I'm leaving.

944
01:06:13,969 --> 01:06:15,110
I have something to say.

945
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:18,079
Did you drink?

946
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:19,579
Enough to work up the courage.

947
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:22,679
Give me some water.

948
01:06:41,269 --> 01:06:42,469
This is the first time...

949
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,210
for you to bring me water.

950
01:06:53,579 --> 01:06:55,650
What's with this office?

951
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:57,550
And your nails?

952
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:00,989
I don't want your pity.

953
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:03,219
I turned off the heater. It's cold.

954
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:05,329
Let's go.

955
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:10,599
We're closed.

956
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:13,469
Well...Take a seat.

957
01:07:13,699 --> 01:07:14,869
I'll leave a bit later.

958
01:07:16,369 --> 01:07:17,610
Thank you.

959
01:07:31,949 --> 01:07:33,949
You said you drank because you had something to say.

960
01:07:35,059 --> 01:07:36,219
Go ahead.

961
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:41,829
No one's around today.

962
01:07:43,429 --> 01:07:45,199
The reason I took it all without saying a word...

963
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:48,670
while everyone was watching that day, right at this spot,

964
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:51,170
was because I had wronged you.

965
01:07:52,139 --> 01:07:53,340
So, you know what you did was wrong?

966
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:54,880
But it's partly your fault.

967
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,809
If I did something wrong,

968
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:00,579
it was that I trusted you.

969
01:08:00,579 --> 01:08:02,250
- More like underestimated me. - What?

970
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:04,019
Trust wasn't the issue. You thought I was insignificant.

971
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:07,420
"Do you think I'll lose my husband to someone like her?"

972
01:08:07,789 --> 01:08:09,219
"Nonsense."

973
01:08:09,619 --> 01:08:11,829
You said that to your friend. Remember?

974
01:08:11,829 --> 01:08:14,090
Was it fun laughing at me?

975
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:19,069
It was a joke anyone could've said,

976
01:08:19,069 --> 01:08:20,270
even if it wasn't about you.

977
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:21,800
When she said I was clumsy...

978
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:24,069
and for you not to be good to me,

979
01:08:24,069 --> 01:08:25,369
why didn't you say I was your friend at that time?

980
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,579
You never said I was your friend.

981
01:08:28,779 --> 01:08:30,210
I never said you were my friend...

982
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,250
because it would only prolong the conversation.

983
01:08:33,079 --> 01:08:35,420
An errand girl who you can conveniently call...

984
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:38,189
for a variety of tasks with a bit of payment.

985
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:42,590
That was the most I was ever for you.

986
01:08:44,529 --> 01:08:46,229
Was that why you introduced such a guy to me?

987
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:48,800
A divorced man with two children?

988
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,829
To your friend with decent parents,

989
01:08:52,529 --> 01:08:53,869
you introduced a doctor.

990
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,939
You never even apologized. Why?

991
01:08:57,939 --> 01:08:59,010
Because you could.

992
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:00,909
I didn't know that.

993
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:02,779
You didn't meet him anyway.

994
01:09:03,079 --> 01:09:05,149
You gave me engagement rings when I said I was getting married.

995
01:09:05,149 --> 01:09:06,149
It was very kind of you.

996
01:09:06,149 --> 01:09:08,079
Although, they weren't made for me...

997
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:10,579
but for someone else's marriage, which got called off.

998
01:09:12,050 --> 01:09:15,420
I'm not even worth a ten-dollar promotional product on TV.

999
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:16,560
Are you drunk?

1000
01:09:17,090 --> 01:09:19,689
I made those rings with blood and sweat.

1001
01:09:19,689 --> 01:09:21,699
They're mine before I sell them.

1002
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,060
I gave you my rings.

1003
01:09:23,529 --> 01:09:26,170
Why did you leave out the 10,000 dollars I gave you?

1004
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:28,569
It was payment for being your errand girl for 20 years.

1005
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:30,869
I was quite underpaid.

1006
01:09:34,279 --> 01:09:37,180
You started helping me in the first place.

1007
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:39,310
I always paid you for every errand you ran.

1008
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:41,050
That would amount to a full-time salary.

1009
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:42,050
That's...

1010
01:09:42,649 --> 01:09:44,520
the price of protecting your arrogance.

1011
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:48,060
Wasn't money what you needed?

1012
01:09:49,289 --> 01:09:51,189
I gave you what you needed.

1013
01:09:52,029 --> 01:09:53,560
Is this what I deserve for doing that?

1014
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:54,960
I'll admit it.

1015
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:59,029
I stayed by you because of the things I would gain from you.

1016
01:10:00,869 --> 01:10:03,500
And you exploited me after knowing that weakness of mine.

1017
01:10:04,439 --> 01:10:05,670
You called me whenever you wanted,

1018
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:07,779
even to take care of your mother and your child.

1019
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:10,079
You took me with you on your business trips too.

1020
01:10:11,409 --> 01:10:13,350
You flew business class, and I sat in economy.

1021
01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:17,050
You told me to think of it as a trip.

1022
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:19,250
But I was the one who took care of the luggage.

1023
01:10:19,319 --> 01:10:20,619
I was the one who carried your stuff around,

1024
01:10:20,619 --> 01:10:21,859
so it was never a trip.

1025
01:10:22,359 --> 01:10:24,630
I was the alarm that woke you up every morning,

1026
01:10:24,689 --> 01:10:27,130
the masseuse taking care of your arms, legs, and feet,

1027
01:10:27,130 --> 01:10:28,399
and also the food taster.

1028
01:10:28,399 --> 01:10:31,229
I knelt under your feet and took your long boots off for you,

1029
01:10:31,229 --> 01:10:32,800
carried sanitary pads for you,

1030
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,340
and picked up the chopsticks you dropped.

1031
01:10:36,069 --> 01:10:37,939
Whenever you said "kimchi," I would say,

1032
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:41,539
"Excuse me. Can we get some more kimchi?"

1033
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:43,380
"Could we get new chopsticks too?"

1034
01:10:43,609 --> 01:10:45,750
I always thanked you whenever you helped me.

1035
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:46,850
Only with words.

1036
01:10:47,449 --> 01:10:48,619
But your eyes said,

1037
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:52,250
"This is what you're here for." That's exactly what they said.

1038
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:55,119
I was also your marriage counsellor.

1039
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:58,829
From problems with your in-laws to problems in bed.

1040
01:11:00,659 --> 01:11:02,500
Since when did I covet your place?

1041
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:06,600
When I was trampled by you...

1042
01:11:07,329 --> 01:11:08,670
and treated less than a friend.

1043
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,439
You walked on me, and I wriggled.

1044
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:15,010
This conversation is going nowhere.

1045
01:11:15,279 --> 01:11:16,479
I'm not finished.

1046
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:20,180
You asked how I endured being next to you...

1047
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:22,180
and whether you were a stimulant.

1048
01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:23,180
No.

1049
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:25,789
I was the stimulant.

1050
01:11:27,989 --> 01:11:29,689
When you went on family trips,

1051
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:33,630
you took me along as a babysitter so that you could have a nice time.

1052
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:36,260
I followed you all day, carrying Mi Poong on my back.

1053
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:37,630
I would sleep...

1054
01:11:39,399 --> 01:11:40,899
with Mi Poong there.

1055
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:43,270
And you...

1056
01:11:44,869 --> 01:11:47,039
- The sounds from your room... - You're crazy.

1057
01:11:47,609 --> 01:11:48,640
What's wrong? Do you feel guilty?

1058
01:11:48,939 --> 01:11:51,079
Didn't you feel anything when you saw me in the morning?

1059
01:11:54,819 --> 01:11:55,850
You're crazy.

1060
01:11:57,050 --> 01:11:58,319
You want to take this all the way?

1061
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:00,550
I'm not blind or deaf.

1062
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:03,489
You didn't even treat me like a person.

1063
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:06,659
Normally, friends aren't comfortable in that situation.

1064
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:10,560
A friend would've been concerned and would've slept with her,

1065
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:12,130
leaving the child to sleep with the husband.

1066
01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:15,239
Are you a pervert? You're the one who said it was okay.

1067
01:12:15,399 --> 01:12:18,369
How many times did you send me and your husband alone on errands?

1068
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:21,180
You never even got worried.

1069
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:24,210
Your arrogance has brought you to this.

1070
01:12:24,979 --> 01:12:26,609
- Isn't that true? - Cho Eun Kang.

1071
01:12:27,550 --> 01:12:29,319
No matter what you say,

1072
01:12:30,449 --> 01:12:32,850
you're an adulterer who seduced the husband of your friend of 20 years.

1073
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:35,659
I seduced him, but he acted on it.

1074
01:12:36,689 --> 01:12:38,090
That's what hurts your pride.

1075
01:12:43,229 --> 01:12:44,430
How dare you?

1076
01:12:49,399 --> 01:12:51,869
You knew there was something between Cha Won and me.

1077
01:12:51,869 --> 01:12:53,170
- I didn't know that. - You knew.

1078
01:12:53,170 --> 01:12:55,109
- Hey. - Cha Won is your type.

1079
01:12:55,109 --> 01:12:57,409
You got his number the first time you saw him, started dating him,

1080
01:12:57,579 --> 01:12:59,380
and married him too.

1081
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:02,619
You were on a different speed compared to mine.

1082
01:13:02,979 --> 01:13:05,020
You should have asked at least once if you were my friend.

1083
01:13:06,289 --> 01:13:07,989
"Is he someone you like?"

1084
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:11,560
I had to just stand there...

1085
01:13:12,289 --> 01:13:15,029
and watch the person I liked become yours.

1086
01:13:15,029 --> 01:13:16,600
You're the only one who had feelings.

1087
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,869
Mi Poong's dad didn't even remember.

1088
01:13:18,869 --> 01:13:20,470
He's pretending not to know.

1089
01:13:21,170 --> 01:13:22,470
Do you still not know how men are?

1090
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,079
Let me tell you the truth.

1091
01:13:28,210 --> 01:13:29,579
Even if he hadn't come to me,

1092
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:32,079
he wouldn't have gone to you.

1093
01:13:34,579 --> 01:13:37,420
- You're probably right. - Also, what I did wasn't wrong.

1094
01:13:38,189 --> 01:13:39,489
But what you did was.

1095
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:41,760
Point that finger at yourself.

1096
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:43,359
I'm not here to blame anyone.

1097
01:13:50,029 --> 01:13:51,670
I wanted to say the things I could never say...

1098
01:13:52,569 --> 01:13:54,600
even if I had to be drunk.

1099
01:13:56,369 --> 01:13:57,600
We're friends,

1100
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:01,380
but you can say anything sober when I need alcohol.

1101
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:05,079
Ba Da.

1102
01:14:05,350 --> 01:14:06,949
When I visited your house when we were young,

1103
01:14:07,449 --> 01:14:09,720
you even had your own bowl and spoon.

1104
01:14:11,449 --> 01:14:14,119
Your mother would keep saying "my daughter."

1105
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:17,960
I was never cared for like that.

1106
01:14:18,789 --> 01:14:20,260
So that was very fascinating.

1107
01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:22,960
You have everything.

1108
01:14:23,729 --> 01:14:25,670
Your shoes and bags are all luxury brands.

1109
01:14:25,970 --> 01:14:28,869
Your house is luxurious. Your parents are prestigious.

1110
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:30,369
Your husband too.

1111
01:14:30,869 --> 01:14:32,239
I wanted to be you.

1112
01:14:32,810 --> 01:14:35,039
So I put on your perfume and wore your robe.

1113
01:14:36,539 --> 01:14:38,779
I didn't seduce your husband because I ran out of air...

1114
01:14:38,779 --> 01:14:40,180
after blowing all those balloons.

1115
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:43,220
I think I wanted him not because he was Cha Won,

1116
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:46,619
but because he was your husband.

1117
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:50,960
You fuelled my desire.

1118
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:55,029
I was jealous of you throughout the 20 years.

1119
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:57,829
I struggled to become like you.

1120
01:14:58,529 --> 01:15:00,770
I desperately wanted to be you.

1121
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,170
So I wore high heels and mini-skirts like you.

1122
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:06,239
I wore wigs and also ordered coffee like you.

1123
01:15:11,649 --> 01:15:12,710
So...

1124
01:15:13,649 --> 01:15:16,579
you wanted to climb up in status by seducing your friend's husband?

1125
01:15:18,189 --> 01:15:19,189
Wake up.

1126
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:24,189
You can never become me no matter how you try.

1127
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:25,260
Don't be arrogant.

1128
01:15:26,159 --> 01:15:27,590
You have nothing to be proud of.

1129
01:15:28,430 --> 01:15:29,430
You got it all from your parents.

1130
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:30,960
You know how I've lived.

1131
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:33,500
I tried my best to get to where I am now.

1132
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,000
I know you tried.

1133
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,770
But I know the difference between you and me.

1134
01:15:40,409 --> 01:15:41,539
I take the stairs...

1135
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:43,640
while you take the escalator.

1136
01:15:44,109 --> 01:15:45,649
We start from different points.

1137
01:15:45,649 --> 01:15:46,949
Run up the stairs.

1138
01:15:47,550 --> 01:15:49,420
And blame your parents if you want someone to blame.

1139
01:15:50,949 --> 01:15:52,050
I'm not going to blame anyone.

1140
01:15:53,149 --> 01:15:54,149
It's just...

1141
01:15:55,619 --> 01:15:58,789
You and I were born into different families.

1142
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:00,829
I never hated you.

1143
01:16:01,159 --> 01:16:02,199
I just envied you.

1144
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:04,399
I don't blame my parents.

1145
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:06,500
I feel bad for them now.

1146
01:16:07,329 --> 01:16:09,899
I got to experience bits of your world thanks to you.

1147
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,210
It was really sweet.

1148
01:16:12,939 --> 01:16:16,579
I heard the most painful place to be...

1149
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:19,510
wasn't where the fire was burning.

1150
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:22,279
It's the place with the best view of paradise.

1151
01:16:24,119 --> 01:16:26,289
They call this relative deprivation.

1152
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:31,859
I wish I had never met you.

1153
01:16:34,529 --> 01:16:35,560
If only...

1154
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:40,369
I hadn't picked up the lipstick that rolled under my desk,

1155
01:16:48,039 --> 01:16:51,010
then I wouldn't have felt deprived since we wouldn't have met.

1156
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:57,250
I learned how to give up soon after I was born.

1157
01:16:57,479 --> 01:16:59,819
I learned how to hold back my desires.

1158
01:17:01,119 --> 01:17:02,460
I don't want to hold them back anymore.

1159
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:05,390
I'm tired.

1160
01:17:06,729 --> 01:17:08,329
Stop with the ranting.

1161
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:11,060
I think I've listened to you enough.

1162
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:19,539
You told me to keep the adulterer mark...

1163
01:17:20,609 --> 01:17:22,380
that wouldn't wash off no matter what detergent I used.

1164
01:17:24,279 --> 01:17:26,609
I don't have the power to even if I wanted to.

1165
01:17:29,079 --> 01:17:31,390
Cut me...

1166
01:17:31,390 --> 01:17:33,550
or chew me into pieces.

1167
01:17:35,289 --> 01:17:36,590
Do whatever you want.

1168
01:17:38,359 --> 01:17:40,029
But since it's come to this already,

1169
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:42,699
can't I be you and live like you?

1170
01:17:49,399 --> 01:17:50,569
What do you mean?

1171
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:54,670
You know what I mean.

1172
01:18:42,119 --> 01:18:46,130
(Red Balloon)

1173
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:49,560
My sister is enduring everything your family is doing to her.

1174
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:52,329
Let's end this. Let go of my sister.

1175
01:18:54,029 --> 01:18:56,500
We're different from you. Our love is genuine.

1176
01:18:58,439 --> 01:18:59,609
Is Cho Eun Kang doing well?

1177
01:18:59,939 --> 01:19:01,840
Think of it as your fault for having the wrong friend.

1178
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,609
Are you pregnant?

1179
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:07,380
Let's go together.

1180
01:19:08,579 --> 01:19:10,479
- Your school. - I can't leave my child...

1181
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:12,149
with a home wrecker. Get out of here!

1182
01:19:12,149 --> 01:19:14,520
It kept struggling as it ran away,

1183
01:19:15,090 --> 01:19:16,289
It wouldn't die easily.
