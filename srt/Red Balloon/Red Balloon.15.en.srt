Is something up?

15
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,129
- No way. - She just slapped the other woman.

16
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:33,400
- Did you see that? - That's brutal.

17
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:37,340
Get up.

18
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,280
Must I explain why I slapped you?

19
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,650
Sit.

20
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,740
I apologize for the commotion.

21
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:19,680
Can you get us another cup? Someone else will be joining us.

22
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,389
What's up? You said it was urgent.

23
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,590
Hey, Eun Kang.

24
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:32,389
Sit over there.

25
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:34,629
Sit next to that tramp.

26
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:01,050
Is this the picture you painted?

27
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,590
Side by side, you make quite the trashy couple.

28
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,889
How long has this been going on?

29
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,229
Did all the balloons you inflated...

30
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:12,960
suck the oxygen from your brain?

31
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,530
Did you see him as a balloon?

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,169
Is that why you had your mouth all over him?

33
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,240
It's hilarious.

34
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:32,319
You called him your dear first balloon.

35
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,349
How dare you?

36
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,360
How dare you call another's husband your balloon?

37
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,490
When it's worth only 20 cents?

38
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,860
My gosh. She slapped him as well.

39
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,669
Was it satisfying?

40
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:53,909
Did being called a balloon...

41
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,969
make you feel like you were on cloud nine?

42
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,439
A passionate night together...

43
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,449
suddenly made you a poet.

44
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:05,219
"You became my first balloon."

45
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:06,680
Is that why you dedicated those words to him?

46
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,860
And you kept the letter rather than ripping it apart.

47
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,990
You fool.

48
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:17,430
Even your flirting tactics are tacky.

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,100
Your first love?

50
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,699
So tell me.

51
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,500
Is that why you told me about him by the sea...

52
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,310
while shedding tears just so that he could hear you?

53
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,009
It still wasn't enough,

54
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:30,980
so you made a scene by jumping in the water.

55
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,480
How did you keep it together all this time...

56
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,149
when all you wanted to do was get handsy with each other?

57
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,949
Being terrified of me finding out...

58
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:42,720
must've made it more intense.

59
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,259
Technically, I spiced up your relationship.

60
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:49,389
Was it good?

61
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,829
How was it to finally get what you desired?

62
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,370
Was it all that you dreamed of?

63
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,439
But I told you numerous times...

64
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,639
that he's not that good in bed.

65
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,810
Don't think about walking away to save face.

66
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:08,079
As if you two rats have any dignity left.

67
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:09,980
Don't even move a step.

68
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:11,720
Would I have called you here...

69
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,819
if I hadn't been ready to breathe fire?

70
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:15,319
Not even I know how far I'll go.

71
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,189
You must've seen me as someone so gullible.

72
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:23,589
Allow me to warm up my mouth.

73
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:29,300
Using foul words...

74
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,769
have always seemed too vulgar for my taste,

75
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:36,670
but they're easily used by women who have been cheated on.

76
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:38,579
They call the husband and his mistress "skanks."

77
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:40,209
I didn't think I'd be able to say, either.

78
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,550
But now that I was cheated on, it comes naturally to me.

79
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:47,850
From this moment on, I will call you skanks.

80
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,250
Consider that your new name.

81
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,459
When I asked nicely the other day,

82
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:54,959
you lied to my face.

83
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,029
You played dumb and even showed tears.

84
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,329
You're also good at putting on shows.

85
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,170
The handkerchief...

86
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,000
You used it to clean off the melted ice cream?

87
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,540
You spilled coffee in Sokcho?

88
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,839
You should've at least gotten your stories straight!

89
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,040
Did you know...

90
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:13,410
she was carrying around the photo you two took with Mi Poong?

91
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,279
What did you two do that night...

92
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,519
after sending me away to Sokcho?

93
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,620
According to Mi Poong,

94
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,560
you even wore my robe.

95
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:27,759
"Aunt Eun Kang smelled like you."

96
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,490
I bet you even wore my perfume.

97
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,730
You really are a piece of work.

98
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:34,399
How long have you been wanting my life?

99
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:36,970
Ever since we were teenagers, I shared my food,

100
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,269
my clothes, and my purses.

101
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,310
Did you think the offer was extended to my husband?

102
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,740
Is someone else's apple more appealing?

103
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,040
Does it taste better when it's stolen?

104
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:49,149
Oh, dear. But now you got caught.

105
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,819
Why are you crying? Does it hurt?

106
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:55,720
Where, exactly?

107
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:57,589
Where I slapped you?

108
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,829
I only slapped you once. Or was it twice?

109
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:04,060
Are you embarrassed?

110
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,800
I'm sorry I made you this way.

111
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:10,569
Stop her from putting on a show.

112
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,170
Do you want to be a good girl in his presence?

113
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,069
That'll only get him slapped more.

114
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,180
- Ba Da... - Shut it.

115
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:19,509
They say every woman has a gut feeling.

116
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,310
Did you think I didn't have one myself?

117
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,550
The signs that were presented before me?

118
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,019
It's not like I didn't see them.

119
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,319
I just chose to look past them.

120
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,490
Maybe it was because...

121
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,920
I was scared.

122
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,360
Because everything would shatter once I confirm it.

123
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:38,060
I had to keep on trusting you for our marriage to stay intact.

124
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,170
That was why I chose to sit on your crap.

125
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,300
I was too scared to see what was going on.

126
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:49,170
I didn't want to lose you.

127
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:02,689
I yielded to our friendship...

128
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:05,060
while you...

129
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,329
gave in to the temptation.

130
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,490
This tramp...

131
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,629
managed to wipe the floor with us.

132
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:16,670
I give you that.

133
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:21,139
The other instances I get,

134
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:23,410
but you went to see this tramp...

135
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,709
the night my mom went to the ICU.

136
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,610
Are you that into her?

137
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,079
To the point that it clouds your judgement?

138
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,279
So where do I go from here?

139
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:33,179
You must've had an idea.

140
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,149
Should I serve you on a platter...

141
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:36,690
after skinning you and chopping your bones?

142
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,620
Or should I chew you up like I would a squid?

143
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,460
That question wasn't for you, so don't bother answering me.

144
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,730
Those two should be socially buried.

145
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,570
They should be sued for adultery.

146
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,629
Exactly.

147
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,539
Ba Da, let's head out for now.

148
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:54,139
- We'll talk outside. - Talk?

149
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:56,409
You've lost the right, so shut it and listen.

150
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,179
I went to see a friend...

151
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:04,919
who was also hurt by her cheating husband.

152
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:07,889
She told me not to get divorced since it'd only benefit you two.

153
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:10,389
- Exactly! - Good for you.

154
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,690
Suing Eun Kang for adultery will have you breathing down...

155
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,889
each other's necks.

156
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:19,029
After I'm compensated physically and mentally,

157
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:21,970
I can choose when to divorce you...

158
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:23,669
since the ball's in my court.

159
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,200
- That's it! - You tell them.

160
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:28,539
I don't have to divorce you if I don't want to.

161
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,840
The guilty spouse who cheated...

162
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,250
has no right to file for a divorce.

163
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:36,649
It's how the law works in Korea.

164
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:38,980
Too bad, Eun Kang.

165
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,419
Wait all you want. He'll never be yours.

166
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:44,620
- Good for you. - Exactly.

167
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,190
That's what she should do. Nicely done.

168
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,960
Once I sue you for adultery,

169
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:52,159
you'll have to answer to the court.

170
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,370
The trial will then finalize your sentence.

171
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,700
You'll forever be an adulterer...

172
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,710
and will be branded with a scarlet letter.

173
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,169
It'll be a stain that no soap, shampoo, or detergent...

174
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,740
will wash away.

175
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,679
Or maybe you'll see it as a medal of honour.

176
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,110
He is who you desired, after all.

177
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,379
Congratulations on receiving the medal, then.

178
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,120
The same goes for you.

179
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,159
You'll forever be known as the pathetic excuse of a man...

180
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,590
who fooled around with his wife's friend.

181
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,529
But truthfully, I'm most curious about...

182
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:28,500
what you'll write in the refutation.

183
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,970
You teach students how to write essays.

184
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,399
In what way and with what fancy words...

185
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,139
will you elaborate on your current state?

186
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:37,539
The curiosity is killing me.

187
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,639
Are you going to write about balloons again?

188
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,409
She should be sued and humiliated.

189
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:43,450
Absolutely.

190
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,149
Do you even have any money to pay as compensation?

191
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,590
That's right.

192
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,289
I'm sure you saved up the money you got...

193
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:50,889
from running my errands.

194
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,159
The money one pays as compensation...

195
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,929
doesn't bring you much comfort though.

196
00:10:56,929 --> 00:10:58,259
It's not even a large sum.

197
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,960
I hear it's mostly symbolic.

198
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,899
I may be broke and in need of 10,000 dollars,

199
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,600
but I wouldn't take your dirty money.

200
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:07,269
And you. What should I do with you?

201
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:09,110
I could hang up a sign in front of your clinic...

202
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,440
and humiliate you.

203
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,909
It could read, "The one who cheated on his wife with her friend."

204
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,750
I know all your friends, remember?

205
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,820
Maybe I should text them all.

206
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:23,289
If you sue me for defamation, I'll happily pay the fine.

207
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:26,820
I bet this is killing you.

208
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:30,029
It must be humiliating to be publicly shamed.

209
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,360
But do adulterers have any dignity left anyway?

210
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,129
- Ba Da... - Don't say my name.

211
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,700
Hearing you say my name disgusts me.

212
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,370
It's all my fault, so yell at me instead.

213
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,570
Cha Won did nothing wrong.

214
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,980
It's cruel to treat him this way. Let him go at least.

215
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,919
The anger must've built up in my fingernails.

216
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,389
I said you'd get slapped every time she put on a show.

217
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:58,059
What do you think about her saying it's her fault?

218
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,360
Did she seduce you when you weren't interested?

219
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,830
- Honey, please. - Who do you mean by "honey?"

220
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,330
Who should answer you?

221
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,899
Ba Da, what I did was wrong.

222
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,470
- Let's get out of here for now. - If you don't want to see blood,

223
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:15,340
you'll sit down.

224
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,379
If you don't want to see blood,

225
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:23,450
you'll sit down!

226
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,799
I intend on resolving this...

227
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,470
in a democratic and reasonable way.

228
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,139
We've been friends for 20 years.

229
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:49,169
Gosh.

230
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,679
They were friends for 20 years. My goodness.

231
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,480
Because I care about the friendship we had,

232
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:01,490
I thought long and hard about how all three of us could be happy.

233
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,350
And this is my conclusion.

234
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,129
They're here right on time.

235
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,389
It's a bonus.

236
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,029
It'd be a pity if we were the only ones watching the show.

237
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,840
You're here.

238
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,039
What happened?

239
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:20,769
What's so urgent?

240
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:22,769
It doesn't look like a nice restaurant either.

241
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,940
Why did you want to meet us here?

242
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,740
What?

243
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:28,710
What happened to your face?

244
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,179
How did this happen?

245
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,350
Did you hurt yourself?

246
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,950
I hit him.

247
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,090
What?

248
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,350
You hit him?

249
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,860
I asked you to come because I thought you should know.

250
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,129
Your son cheated on me.

251
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:43,960
I'm guilty of not looking after my husband and my friend,

252
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:46,629
so I didn't treat him too harshly.

253
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:49,529
What? What is she talking about?

254
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:52,340
She's talking in Korean, but I can't understand.

255
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:54,309
Cha Won must have cheated on her.

256
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:55,409
What?

257
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,039
With whom?

258
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:59,379
With her. They're standing side by side.

259
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:00,379
What?

260
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,080
Is it true?

261
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:08,690
You jerk.

262
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,889
Father, please calm down.

263
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:12,460
You're a disgrace.

264
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,730
Why did you hit him?

265
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:15,929
Don't be so old-fashioned.

266
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:18,360
Hey. Are you out of your mind?

267
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,269
Something like this should be dealt with quietly at home.

268
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,600
Why are you doing this in a crowded place?

269
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,799
Be quiet!

270
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:27,370
Would you like us to call the police?

271
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,110
You're outnumbered.

272
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,669
That's okay.

273
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:32,279
Thank you anyway.

274
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,179
I regret having to do this.

275
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,950
However,

276
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,580
I had no other choice.

277
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,820
I can't forgive them.

278
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:46,590
I didn't know how I'd act, so I chose a public space.

279
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,490
I want to return...

280
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:51,330
your son.

281
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,129
Take him back.

282
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,169
- Good job! - Good for you.

283
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,139
Will you hear her talk?

284
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:00,070
You want to return him after living this long with him?

285
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,110
Are you acting ignorant just because he cheated on you?

286
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,240
How ridiculous.

287
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,809
She's taking his side because he's her son.

288
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:07,850
- What did you say? - Mom.

289
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,509
Return him?

290
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,120
My son is not an object.

291
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,549
Well, he's not human.

292
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,889
You should feel lucky I'm returning him in one piece.

293
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,559
You should take him back.

294
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,460
Let's go home to talk.

295
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,659
I'll tell you...

296
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,259
the conclusion I reached.

297
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:27,769
As for dividing our assets and the alimony,

298
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:30,730
I wanted to play hard to get and give him a difficult time.

299
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,970
But I came to the conclusion that it wasn't worth my time,

300
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,269
rolling around in the garbage with these two.

301
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:38,879
Since they want each other so desperately,

302
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,750
I won't be the third wheel.

303
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,419
Just because it flies doesn't mean it's a bird,

304
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,289
and just because you can walk doesn't mean you're human.

305
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,590
You're just a horny couple of cockroaches.

306
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,429
(Save)

307
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:00,500
I'll use this evidence...

308
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,570
whenever I need it.

309
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,769
Don't get on my nerves.

310
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,110
I'm done talking,

311
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:12,980
so I'll get going.

312
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,980
- Gosh. - We applaud you.

313
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,580
We support you.

314
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,649
We'll be cheering you on.

315
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:22,850
Best of luck.

316
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,519
Don't ever go easy on them.

317
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:25,690
Be quiet!

318
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:26,919
Do you think this is a show?

319
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,429
- Mom. - Not again.

320
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:57,519
I'm sorry.

321
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,389
It only happened once.

322
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,629
Only once?

323
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,400
What do you mean by that?

324
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,339
Do you need to do it ten times in order to be guilty?

325
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,609
Or how about until you got sick of it?

326
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,869
You must be thirsty for more since you only did it once.

327
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,480
You were thinking about her while lying next to me.

328
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,450
You were probably anxious and agitated...

329
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,480
while you waited for me to go somewhere on a business trip.

330
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,720
I bet it drove you crazy.

331
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,289
Did you not sleep with me because of her?

332
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,119
I was so clueless.

333
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,920
I thought it was because of my mom.

334
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:35,160
I even looked into medical help because I thought you had issues.

335
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,559
But it was because of her.

336
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,690
You have it wrong.

337
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,700
She said you were her first love.

338
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:42,430
Did you two date before meeting me?

339
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,670
Never.

340
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,470
Before I met you,

341
00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:47,940
I went for dinners and movies with women,

342
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,839
but they didn't mean anything.

343
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:51,779
They weren't anything special.

344
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,339
You're so pathetic. Stop it.

345
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:58,180
Why do you think I called you out to a crowded café?

346
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,289
I didn't have the courage to fight the two of you by myself.

347
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,789
Even if they were strangers, I wanted to rely on them.

348
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:10,589
My husband is no longer on my side.

349
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,099
Only those who experience it will understand what it feels like.

350
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:16,500
If it was with someone else,

351
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,740
I might have forgiven you once.

352
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,740
But...

353
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,480
she was my friend.

354
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,549
It was Eun Kang.

355
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,319
Are you happy turning friends into family?

356
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,920
Do we have to be family now?

357
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:37,990
You turned one of us into an adulterer,

358
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:41,230
and the other into a fool who lost her husband to a friend.

359
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,460
You destroyed the two of us.

360
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:50,400
I filled out my section.

361
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,140
My writing was a mess because my hand was shaking.

362
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,769
Fill out your half and meet me in court.

363
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,069
I'll be the one getting the custody and parental rights.

364
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,309
You were proven disqualified due to what you did.

365
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,980
No objections, right?

366
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,660
Do as you wish.

367
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:18,559
But we can't end it like this.

368
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,099
What about Mi Poong?

369
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,170
Don't you dare...

370
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,640
bring her up.

371
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,339
If you can't stand me,

372
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,440
let's stay apart for a little while.

373
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,180
Let's be rational and calm.

374
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,480
"Rational?"

375
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:36,880
You might be missing your rationality,

376
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:38,980
but I'm more rational than ever.

377
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:41,819
I'll take legal action if you don't consent.

378
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,690
I have more than enough evidence.

379
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,599
Where are you going? You don't have anywhere to go.

380
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,269
Did you know I don't have anywhere to go?

381
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:57,329
You don't have any savings...

382
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,740
since you're paying off your father's debt.

383
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,970
And work is a mess because of all the returns.

384
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,769
You can't afford to get a new place.

385
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,740
Don't do this. Let's talk...

386
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,440
Don't touch me with your nasty hands!

387
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:10,410
You ripped my heart to pieces! What is there to talk about?

388
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,349
The moment I saw the letter from her...

389
00:20:12,349 --> 00:20:15,089
you decided to cherish instead of ripping apart,

390
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:19,220
I had to take countless calming drinks to calm down.

391
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:27,160
I'm trying to hang on because I can't die.

392
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,700
If I don't let you go,

393
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,039
you two will play the lead roles...

394
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:35,440
of a tragic love story.

395
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:37,410
That's why I'm throwing you away.

396
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,579
You ripped me apart and made a fool out of me.

397
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,779
You'll have to pay for it.

398
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,079
You'll see.

399
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,319
I'll leave instead.

400
00:20:48,819 --> 00:20:50,619
Your mother isn't well. It's best you stay here.

401
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:51,759
Shut your mouth.

402
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,390
I'll take Mi Poong later.

403
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,430
I'll come back for the rest of my stuff when you're not here.

404
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,799
See you in court.

405
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:07,799
The only reason I'm not killing you is...

406
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,240
because you're Mi Poong's dad.

407
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,210
Take off your ring.

408
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,539
Gosh, why did you come? You'll be beaten to death.

409
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,609
Your father was here just a moment ago.

410
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:45,539
How dare you come in here?

411
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,839
I don't want to see you.

412
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,279
Get out right now!

413
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,509
- Please stop! - Father!

414
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,119
Run away.

415
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,849
Nam Chul!

416
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,890
- Nam Chul! - Father.

417
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:58,019
Please, Father. Let it go.

418
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,390
That's enough.

419
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:07,099
He's going on his knees because he regrets it.

420
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:09,599
I bet his wife ill-treated him until now.

421
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:11,839
Let's hear him out first.

422
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:13,440
Hear what out?

423
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,569
There can't be an excuse for having an affair!

424
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:16,740
He's a cockroach.

425
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:18,779
I'm sorry, Father.

426
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,339
I won't allow any divorces...

427
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:22,809
or affairs in this family!

428
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,509
No exceptions!

429
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,380
Get out right now!

430
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,380
Father.

431
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:32,319
Hurry up and go.

432
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,319
I'm at fault.

433
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,180
I'm sorry.

434
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:03,250
I'm sorry for hurting you.

435
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:05,059
My husband cheated on me,

436
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,890
but I don't have anyone to talk to.

437
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,529
I used to share everything with you.

438
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:11,960
I'm sorry.

439
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:16,529
What did I do so wrong to you?

440
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:19,470
Nothing, Ba Da.

441
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,809
- I'm sorry. - I've known him for eight years,

442
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:24,140
but I've known you for 20.

443
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:27,309
What did you covet so much?

444
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,150
Did it feel like you could become his wife...

445
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,049
and act as Mi Poong's mom?

446
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,789
Did you only see flaws between us?

447
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:37,519
Maybe you thought it'd be okay to get in between.

448
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:39,559
But we have a child and years between us.

449
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:42,630
There's something you can't break between us even if you meddle.

450
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,430
Go ahead and try living with him.

451
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:48,599
You were watching all along,

452
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:50,900
so I'm sure you'll do well.

453
00:23:51,569 --> 00:23:53,170
You'll be able to humour him.

454
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,269
I'm letting him go because he's disgusting.

455
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,509
Go ahead and pick him out from the garbage...

456
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,740
and make him yours forever.

457
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:54,400
They say you can never fully understand someone.

458
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,900
It's not like you're a stranger.

459
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,200
You're Ba Da's friend.

460
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:58,440
How could you do that?

461
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,700
You two were closer than siblings.

462
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,210
Why didn't you think about the damage it could bring?

463
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,809
This will end your life.

464
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:05,380
You've lost a good friend.

465
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,779
A different woman...

466
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:08,579
wouldn't be satisfied with just disgracing you in the café.

467
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:12,549
You're not thinking of staying with Cha Won, are you?

468
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,549
Don't even dream of it.

469
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:16,089
The family would never allow it.

470
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,589
Quit teaching Chun and Woon.

471
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,190
All right.

472
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,730
Why are you here?

473
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:25,960
What do you have left to say after making this mess?

474
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,529
I'm sorry.

475
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:29,769
It won't end with an apology.

476
00:25:29,869 --> 00:25:32,869
Be honest, you seduced him first, didn't you?

477
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:35,009
I know my own son.

478
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,670
Cha Won can't do that himself.

479
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,539
That's not important now.

480
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,380
I thought they were too close.

481
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,549
People need distance.

482
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:44,779
She just trusted her because they were friends.

483
00:25:45,349 --> 00:25:47,950
I'll give you your tutoring fees later, so just leave us for today.

484
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:51,119
Let me say goodbye to the children.

485
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,960
They're still at their academy. Just go.

486
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:55,789
Then I'll see you next time.

487
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,299
She's a funny one.

488
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:07,200
Does she have a loose screw?

489
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,970
Who does she think she is, coming here?

490
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,710
You should be clear that she's not welcome here.

491
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,740
Seeing her gives me the chills.

492
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,579
She's deceptive and greedy.

493
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:18,819
I just told her to stop tutoring the kids.

494
00:26:18,819 --> 00:26:22,150
How dare she come on to Cha Won? Who does she think she is?

495
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,390
Maybe she took what we said seriously?

496
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:26,690
- What did we say? - That we want her in our family.

497
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:29,960
Those were empty words so we could order her around.

498
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:31,430
She took that seriously?

499
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:33,900
She's like Ba Da's errand girl.

500
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:37,029
Running around doing errands.

501
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,240
He could've picked a better woman to have an affair with.

502
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,539
Cha Won doesn't know what's what.

503
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:44,940
She's got no class.

504
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:34,559
I really need to get a new car.

505
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,390
I parked the truck in an alley...

506
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,500
by your academy and waited so you wouldn't be embarrassed.

507
00:27:42,769 --> 00:27:45,769
Father, don't leave us.

508
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,910
I asked you to come and get me so I could talk to you privately.

509
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,410
I heard the conversation between you and Mom when we were camping.

510
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,009
I even met the other woman.

511
00:27:58,819 --> 00:28:00,519
I'll study hard...

512
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:02,150
and won't fight with my sister.

513
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:06,019
Even if Mom lets you down, please just be patient.

514
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,490
She's our mother.

515
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,589
I'm scared that grandfather will find out.

516
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,099
You'll get thrown out of the house if he does.

517
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,480
I'm sorry, son.

518
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,779
I'll never let that happen.

519
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,549
My son.

520
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,609
It might be good to postpone moving out.

521
00:28:58,339 --> 00:28:59,609
With the mood as it is,

522
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,079
we can't ask our in-laws to move in.

523
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:05,319
It would also be weird to leave your parents alone.

524
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,720
All right.

525
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:14,660
We never got to date properly.

526
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,259
When your father introduced us,

527
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,460
we started cracking up at each other's names.

528
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,529
I thought your name was actually Sweet Potato.

529
00:29:22,569 --> 00:29:24,730
It's not Potato. It's Geum Ah.

530
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:26,700
Ko Geum Ah.

531
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:29,109
You laughed at my name too.

532
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,980
"What kind of name is Ji Nam Chul? Is he a magnet?"

533
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,180
If you're a sweet potato, I should be soda.

534
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,160
I didn't dislike you.

535
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,829
If I had,

536
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,400
I wouldn't have married you just because your father told me to.

537
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:01,640
We got married without dating properly,

538
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,809
had children, and got old.

539
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:08,650
From now on, let's court and go on dates.

540
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,710
Let's start doing things, one at a time.

541
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,420
I'll try my best.

542
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:15,420
I'll make you as happy as I've pained you.

543
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,390
Before the kids find out, let's fix our relationship.

544
00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:21,190
Today's day one.

545
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,430
My nose is cold from sleeping in the living room.

546
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,960
There's a draft.

547
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:29,329
Then you can sleep here.

548
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,430
I don't like hearing that you'll try your best.

549
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,490
Geum Ah!

550
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,470
My goodness.

551
00:31:06,069 --> 00:31:07,099
This is so nice.

552
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,349
Father, don't leave us.

553
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,049
This reminds me of the old days.

554
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:00,690
We used to meet every night, like this.

555
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,890
I used to sneak into your house when you lived in Cheongdam-dong.

556
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,460
Those are all old memories now.

557
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,400
It must've been hard for you after you got divorced.

558
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,529
What was your ex-wife like?

559
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,799
I think you know her too.

560
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,769
She used to work with me at the pub.

561
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,569
The girl who liked you and followed you around.

562
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,279
I see.

563
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:26,180
Let me ask you one question.

564
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:28,849
I was with you at your studio...

565
00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:31,519
and got dragged off by my father to get married.

566
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,019
That night, I ran away and came back to the studio,

567
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,089
but you weren't there.

568
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,430
We'd agreed to run away together.

569
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,259
What happened?

570
00:32:43,769 --> 00:32:44,799
(18 years ago)

571
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:45,970
Who are you?

572
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:49,039
- What's going on? - You punk, come with me!

573
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,539
Let go of me!

574
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:53,980
Let go, you punk!

575
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,390
Please, let me live.

576
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,690
Tell me honestly. Why did you run away?

577
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:13,130
I'll tell you later.

578
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,430
Geum Ah, I don't want to think about anything now.

579
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:17,869
I'm not afraid of anything.

580
00:33:18,369 --> 00:33:19,500
I'll just live, being by your side.

581
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,240
The only thing that hasn't changed in my life...

582
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,509
is how I feel about you.

583
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:48,130
Goodness.

584
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,369
Where were you?

585
00:33:51,369 --> 00:33:54,470
I felt a little queasy, so I went out for an "affair."

586
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:57,339
I mean, I went out for some air.

587
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,180
I couldn't sleep because the mood here is so bad.

588
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,410
Who knew Cha Won would cheat?

589
00:34:02,849 --> 00:34:04,079
Who knew?

590
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,219
It's hard for you, right?

591
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:23,269
The hardest thing is causing trouble for so many around me.

592
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:24,969
I feel sorry for my parents,

593
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:27,199
and I feel embarrassed.

594
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:30,110
I can't bear to lift my head...

595
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,380
because of what I've done.

596
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,349
The minute you're exposed,

597
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,320
it ends up being the most disgraceful thing ever.

598
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,119
How did we end up in the same position?

599
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,260
No.

600
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,159
It could be different. I don't know your situation.

601
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,659
Let me just talk about mine.

602
00:34:55,869 --> 00:34:57,469
Honestly, I thought I'd never get caught.

603
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,269
And I hoped never to get caught.

604
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,340
That was so arrogant of me.

605
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,139
But once I did get caught,

606
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:07,739
I became trash who only cared about his sex drive.

607
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,550
Someone who can't even win against serotonin.

608
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:14,650
That's the kind of person I became.

609
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,449
As soon as I got caught and reality hit,

610
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:18,519
it was like being dropped into another world.

611
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:21,489
It didn't even feel real.

612
00:35:23,059 --> 00:35:24,090
I feel the same way.

613
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:27,300
What do you want to do?

614
00:35:34,739 --> 00:35:35,869
I don't know.

615
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:38,739
I just want to close my eyes and disappear.

616
00:35:39,409 --> 00:35:40,679
I never knew...

617
00:35:41,909 --> 00:35:43,579
I was such a coward.

618
00:35:45,949 --> 00:35:47,320
I'm sure your mind has gone blank...

619
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,690
since you were exposed before you even made a decision.

620
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:52,489
If you hadn't gotten caught and made a decision,

621
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,690
what do you think you would've decided?

622
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:59,760
I'm asking if you could've asked Ba Da for a divorce.

623
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:05,000
In other words, was the thing with Eun Kang a light affair,

624
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,369
or did you have real feelings?

625
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:14,840
I'm sure your situation will be different from mine.

626
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:18,110
I never had a choice.

627
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,550
My kids decided my life.

628
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,019
Throughout my married life,

629
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,349
my children were my lighthouse.

630
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,820
All I could think about was that I needed to protect her...

631
00:36:29,929 --> 00:36:31,429
if I got caught.

632
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:40,769
Since all this has happened,

633
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,769
you should think about it rationally.

634
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,340
You have a family and a child.

635
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,550
Is this worth turning your life upside down?

636
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,610
For men, marriage is connected to their work and social lives.

637
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,980
You need to be sure you have the courage...

638
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,219
to change all of that.

639
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:59,420
I have a friend who married the woman he had an affair with.

640
00:37:00,889 --> 00:37:02,489
Whenever he drinks, it's clear he's having a tough time.

641
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,159
His ex-wife got remarried too.

642
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,730
He can't turn anything back.

643
00:37:06,329 --> 00:37:07,630
It seemed to me that he regretted it.

644
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,130
A moment of bliss,

645
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,730
for a lifetime of misery.

646
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:14,369
According to him, that's the fate of someone...

647
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:16,139
who's had an affair.

648
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:24,309
I want you to be clear about what you decide.

649
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,619
The milk's already been spilled.

650
00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:31,489
Now everything rides on how you resolve things.

651
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:34,559
What about you?

652
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:38,260
Have you wrapped up your feelings for her?

653
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:39,400
Me?

654
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,929
What if I haven't?

655
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,300
Is there another option for me?

656
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,159
(Court)

657
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:19,440
Mi Poong,

658
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,039
I have something to tell you.

659
00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:28,210
You know how your mom used to study in Italy?

660
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,349
She wants to study more...

661
00:38:30,449 --> 00:38:31,880
so that's where she'll be going.

662
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,480
When will she come back?

663
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:37,750
In a month.

664
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:39,719
No, three.

665
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:44,960
You can wait for me, right?

666
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:47,329
Be a good girl for your dad...

667
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,960
and listen to your grandfather.

668
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,030
Is Aunt Eun Kang going with you?

669
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,840
No.

670
00:38:55,969 --> 00:38:58,010
Then she can look after me.

671
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:01,280
Don't worry about me and go.

672
00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:05,349
When I miss you too much,

673
00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:07,449
I'll come and see you.

674
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,920
You can wait even if you want to see me, right?

675
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,559
I can,

676
00:39:13,989 --> 00:39:15,659
but I want to cry.

677
00:39:27,369 --> 00:39:28,800
Tell her you can't do without her.

678
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:33,079
You should cry and stop her from leaving.

679
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,880
You're so childish, Dad.

680
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,750
I should hold it together and let her study.

681
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,980
I can be all right without her.

682
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,170
Gosh, I'm lonely.

683
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,280
My children won't live the way I want them to.

684
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:08,809
Someone famous said...

685
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,610
that golfing and your children were the two things...

686
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,679
that you had no control over.

687
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,519
This must be giving you a headache.

688
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:18,920
Your son-in-law had an affair...

689
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,059
and so did your son.

690
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:22,019
Maybe your house emits that sort of energy.

691
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,329
It didn't seem like...

692
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,800
he was crazy for her.

693
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,099
It was a mistake,

694
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:31,829
and one can make up for it.

695
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:35,199
The son-in-law had an affair with the bookkeeper at his company.

696
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,670
What about your son?

697
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:37,909
It was with his wife's friend.

698
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,210
My goodness.

699
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,750
Even among adulterers, he's the worst kind.

700
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,480
Are adulterers split into classes?

701
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,449
Almost everyone is.

702
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:49,489
They say life is fair, but that's nonsense.

703
00:40:50,349 --> 00:40:52,119
He'll be seen as vermin.

704
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,460
At some times,

705
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,489
you can be so annoying.

706
00:40:57,489 --> 00:40:58,630
Gosh, I'm lonely.

707
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:01,960
Women these days don't forgive cheating husbands.

708
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,269
They divorce them immediately.

709
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,530
In this case,

710
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,300
the punk fooled around with her friend.

711
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,340
Sorry I called him that.

712
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:10,769
Then,

713
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:12,039
how can this be resolved?

714
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:16,550
Give some of your assets to your daughter-in-law.

715
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,610
My assets?

716
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:20,320
Nothing appeases people more than money.

717
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,449
Then, you must go after the other woman.

718
00:41:23,449 --> 00:41:24,849
Make her leave your son alone.

719
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:26,460
She should be sued as an adulterer...

720
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:29,559
so that she loses her appetite and sleep...

721
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:30,960
from all the trips to court.

722
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,699
Getting payback...

723
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,500
might appease your daughter-in-law.

724
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,800
I'd love to meet this other woman that's causing all this trouble.

725
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,969
I wonder what she looks like.

726
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,059
This reminds me...

727
00:42:09,699 --> 00:42:11,469
of Ba Da.

728
00:42:11,869 --> 00:42:15,070
She took me to get a facial...

729
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:16,769
and a body massage.

730
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:18,710
That reminds me! My money.

731
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:21,340
Will I get it back if they divorce?

732
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,909
I'm sure Cha Won will take care of it.

733
00:42:23,179 --> 00:42:25,150
But weren't you happy secretly earning interest from her?

734
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,880
- That's... - It's me.

735
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:28,280
What are you doing here?

736
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:30,949
- Did you call her over? - What is it?

737
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:33,119
I received the money you wired.

738
00:42:33,219 --> 00:42:34,489
Thanks, Geum Ah.

739
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:36,929
I only came by to thank you.

740
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:39,900
You're probably out of the rags I got you last time.

741
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:42,869
And these...

742
00:42:42,869 --> 00:42:44,869
are the hotel cookies that you love, Ms. Na.

743
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,639
These are gifts for Chun and Woon.

744
00:42:47,269 --> 00:42:50,010
As if you have the money to afford all of this.

745
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,510
Besides, no one here welcomes you.

746
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:53,440
Seeing you makes us both uncomfortable.

747
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,909
You have been good to us,

748
00:42:54,909 --> 00:42:56,710
and we have grown attached to you.

749
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:59,719
- But this isn't right. - Aren't you uncomfortable...

750
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:00,750
seeing us?

751
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,820
It's not like we can laugh or cry along with you.

752
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,389
It's just best not to see you.

753
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:08,690
Even though I want to say my piece,

754
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:10,230
I'm holding back...

755
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,559
since you've been good to us.

756
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,400
If you hadn't,

757
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,659
I would've crushed you.

758
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,139
It's too bad if this upsets you.

759
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:53,639
It's the money I borrowed.

760
00:43:53,869 --> 00:43:56,710
I already paid the interest, so it's just the principal.

761
00:43:58,369 --> 00:43:59,639
I thought about wiring you the money,

762
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:02,949
but I figured it was my duty as a debtor to thank you.

763
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:05,050
Thank you for lending me the money.

764
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,079
I didn't think I'd get it back,

765
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,119
but it feels nice to have it in my hands.

766
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,989
You should change your ways a bit.

767
00:44:12,989 --> 00:44:15,190
You're too precise and shrewd for your own good.

768
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,059
If only you could change that about yourself.

769
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:20,599
No one goes through a long life without making a mistake.

770
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:23,300
He's been the best husband who made his first mistake,

771
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,269
but you caused a scene...

772
00:44:25,269 --> 00:44:27,500
and humiliated him in front of a crowd.

773
00:44:27,739 --> 00:44:28,869
Was it cathartic for you?

774
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:29,869
I'm sorry...

775
00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:32,369
for not being generous enough to look past a petty mistake.

776
00:44:33,309 --> 00:44:34,440
Was that sarcasm?

777
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,440
Yes.

778
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:37,750
- Did you hear that? - Mom,

779
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,880
no one changes their way overnight.

780
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:42,550
There's Mi Poong to consider.

781
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:44,289
I'm afraid my brain is at its limit.

782
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:47,059
My daughter's father and that tramp of a friend fooling around...

783
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,260
is making it hard for me to see straight.

784
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,289
I bet you haven't experienced this before.

785
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:54,860
Nam Chul's affair was probably hurtful enough,

786
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:57,170
but what if the woman was your friend?

787
00:44:57,429 --> 00:44:59,070
She was a friend...

788
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:01,670
who has been a sister to me for 20 years.

789
00:45:02,139 --> 00:45:05,170
Is letting her come in here as if she's your daughter-in-law...

790
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:07,409
the right course of action?

791
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:08,739
Ba Da, there must be a misunderstanding.

792
00:45:08,809 --> 00:45:10,110
We told her not to come,

793
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:11,980
but she came by because she felt guilty.

794
00:45:12,349 --> 00:45:14,380
She won't be back. We told her not to come back.

795
00:45:14,519 --> 00:45:16,690
Why do you think I called those skanks out...

796
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,489
and caused a scene in a public setting?

797
00:45:20,489 --> 00:45:22,789
You let your temper get the best of you.

798
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,860
I felt like they taunted me,

799
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:26,929
and the betrayal...

800
00:45:26,929 --> 00:45:29,670
had every organ inside my body trembling.

801
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:31,900
The anger was driving me crazy.

802
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:33,769
I couldn't sue Cha Won for cheating on me,

803
00:45:33,769 --> 00:45:35,900
so there was nothing I could do.

804
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,840
That was why I wanted...

805
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,179
to make a mockery out of them in the worst way.

806
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,449
Only that would help me breathe.

807
00:45:44,949 --> 00:45:47,420
Not having dignity isn't why I went that far.

808
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:49,519
I'm more of a public figure than those two, aren't I?

809
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:51,519
That was my way of wanting to live.

810
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:55,059
If you find me at fault for trying to breathe again,

811
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:58,289
sue me for slander...

812
00:45:59,329 --> 00:46:00,460
or defamation.

813
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:03,500
Take care, then.

814
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,650
It's been a while.

815
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,710
Was it you who had them not call me in?

816
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:20,880
I was told not to come to work for a few days.

817
00:46:21,219 --> 00:46:22,420
It wasn't me.

818
00:46:23,349 --> 00:46:24,420
Hold on.

819
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:27,460
You have a shadow cast over your face, girl.

820
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:31,989
Your mother-in-law must've given you an earful.

821
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:35,730
It's hard to like people who are as prickly as you.

822
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:37,530
That's how you are.

823
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:38,699
Ma'am,

824
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:40,469
I'm sorry for my previous actions.

825
00:46:40,469 --> 00:46:41,570
Take care.

826
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:47,340
What was that about?

827
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,510
The last thing I expected was an apology from her.

828
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,789
Yes, the car is in pristine condition.

829
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:01,389
It hasn't been in an accident.

830
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:04,659
If the price is right, I'll sell it right away.

831
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:06,400
Sure.

832
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,199
Ba Da.

833
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:13,800
Right. I'll meet you there.

834
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:14,900
Sure.

835
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,650
I came by to return something of Mother's.

836
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:25,750
Then...

837
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:28,079
It won't take long.

838
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:29,349
This is important.

839
00:47:29,449 --> 00:47:30,989
I have nothing to say to you, though.

840
00:47:31,389 --> 00:47:32,489
Ba Da,

841
00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:33,960
I understand how you feel.

842
00:47:34,389 --> 00:47:35,960
Cha Won is to blame for everything.

843
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:40,630
But can't you at least reconsider the divorce?

844
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,230
It was a mistake.

845
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:44,099
I doubt he truly cared for her.

846
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:47,500
Ba Da, I promise you this.

847
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,940
I won't pressure you to have a son,

848
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:52,340
and the apartment unit will be handed to you.

849
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:54,179
I don't know how much Cha Won has,

850
00:47:54,179 --> 00:47:56,510
but I'll have him give you every penny.

851
00:47:57,849 --> 00:47:58,980
He'll even write a memorandum.

852
00:47:59,179 --> 00:48:00,380
Will that not be enough?

853
00:48:01,219 --> 00:48:02,420
I'm sorry,

854
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,590
but we have already submitted the divorce papers.

855
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:07,289
Already?

856
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:09,730
Did Cha Won agree to it?

857
00:48:10,289 --> 00:48:12,590
Yes, we went to court together.

858
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,300
It's like this.

859
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,869
The divorce isn't finalized as soon as you submit the papers.

860
00:48:23,309 --> 00:48:26,210
I heard that it took about three months, sir.

861
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:28,710
You have that time to change your daughter-in-law's mind.

862
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:29,949
Make the other woman go crazy.

863
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:31,679
You should rectify...

864
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:34,079
the damage your son caused.

865
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:35,949
Of course, sir.

866
00:48:37,989 --> 00:48:39,519
Gosh, that smells good.

867
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:41,659
Is that kimchi fried rice?

868
00:48:41,659 --> 00:48:42,719
Is there some for me too?

869
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:44,559
Can you stop interfering with other people's businesses?

870
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:46,300
It's not like you can take responsibility for it.

871
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,760
Why would I need to when I repeated what the law says?

872
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:49,800
I picked up on things as a taxi driver,

873
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,800
and now, I'm as good as a doctor or lawyer.

874
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:07,849
Have some before you go.

875
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,250
You haven't eaten anything for days.

876
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:10,420
Leave me be.

877
00:49:11,889 --> 00:49:13,159
Have your meal at least.

878
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,489
I'll then get off your case.

879
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:18,130
How long will this continue?

880
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:19,960
What can I do when I still have feelings for him?

881
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,659
Lower your voice. Dad will hear you.

882
00:49:23,769 --> 00:49:25,030
Stop whatever you're feeling.

883
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:26,440
You should've taken your own advice.

884
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,239
At least I didn't fool around with my friend's husband.

885
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:33,710
Give the money back to Mr. Ji.

886
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:36,349
This is considered stalking.

887
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,380
What?

888
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,849
Even when it's platonic, it's still categorized as stalking.

889
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,659
Harbouring feelings for someone you can't have.

890
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,230
I know how it can drive one crazy.

891
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:55,030
But Mr. Ji chose his family in a heartbeat,

892
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:56,769
and he left you without turning back.

893
00:49:56,969 --> 00:49:58,400
It's time you moved on too.

894
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:01,139
That's how you honour the person you loved.

895
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:06,940
I'm home.

896
00:50:09,909 --> 00:50:11,110
Welcome home.

897
00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:14,050
Everyone went to bed. At least I should welcome you.

898
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:16,280
- You stayed late today. - I had to clean the kitchen.

899
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,590
Thank you for your hard work.

900
00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:20,519
Right. My brother-in-law was going to give it to you,

901
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:22,090
but he was busy lately.

902
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:23,190
Here you go.

903
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,590
He must be busy with his affair.

904
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,260
My goodness.

905
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:32,469
My mom gets super happy...

906
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:34,369
whenever she gets money.

907
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:36,099
My goodness.

908
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:41,780
This is our new helper. Eun Kang introduced her to us.

909
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,250
What are you talking about?

910
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,650
You better quit working for them.

911
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,989
Why? It's the perfect job for me.

912
00:50:52,989 --> 00:50:54,860
The work is easy, and they pay me a lot.

913
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,289
I have my reasons.

914
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:57,860
If you keep working for them,

915
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:59,829
we might get into an awkward situation later.

916
00:50:59,829 --> 00:51:01,300
"An awkward situation?"

917
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:03,329
You never know.

918
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,369
It's a good thing. Just wait.

919
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,400
Where should I work now?

920
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:08,670
I'll look into it for you.

921
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:18,409
Dad. Here is some water.

922
00:51:21,619 --> 00:51:23,349
There's a choir in here.

923
00:51:24,019 --> 00:51:25,650
It gets so loud at night.

924
00:51:28,659 --> 00:51:31,190
- What is this? - Mom, don't eat while you sleep.

925
00:51:33,059 --> 00:51:35,460
This is why she doesn't have any real teeth left.

926
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:37,329
Her teeth cost us a fortune.

927
00:51:38,699 --> 00:51:40,369
Ba Da came by earlier.

928
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,969
- I know. - What should we do?

929
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:51,449
I heard you filed for divorce.

930
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,320
Yes.

931
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:57,820
Why didn't you stop her? Why did you go with her?

932
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:01,489
Are you really planning to get divorced?

933
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,159
I want to do what she wants.

934
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:09,059
I'll do everything she asks of me.

935
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:12,070
Why play the good husband now?

936
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:14,139
Gosh, I'm so lonely.

937
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:16,909
Sit down.

938
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,539
Filing those documents doesn't mean you're divorced right away.

939
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:25,210
Change her mind in the meantime.

940
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,679
If you don't, I'll disown you.

941
00:52:28,849 --> 00:52:32,349
I promised to put this house under Ba Da's name.

942
00:52:32,889 --> 00:52:34,960
- This place? - How much money do you have?

943
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,960
Give it all to Ba Da.

944
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,690
You should make up for your mistake.

945
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:41,599
You also wronged Ms. Cho.

946
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,070
You should compensate her as you see fit.

947
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:45,230
Let's settle it that way.

948
00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:51,940
I'm very disappointed in you.

949
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:55,210
You were always so handsome and smart.

950
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,510
Aside from getting married against our will,

951
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:00,119
you never caused problems for us. What happened?

952
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,179
I heard they rated affairs by severity.

953
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,150
Cheating with your wife's friend makes you an animal.

954
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,289
How could you make such a mistake?

955
00:53:07,489 --> 00:53:08,659
It wasn't a mistake.

956
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:10,190
What?

957
00:53:10,429 --> 00:53:12,260
What do you mean? Do you mean you chose to do it?

958
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:16,530
Do you mean you two really love each other?

959
00:53:22,469 --> 00:53:24,210
But you're the one who founded the company...

960
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:25,670
and brought it up.

961
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:28,980
The person taking over is also a nice person.

962
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,610
Please be good to them.

963
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:33,679
I'm sorry I couldn't look after the factory until the end.

964
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:37,619
I'll become successful and come back to buy it back.

965
00:53:38,619 --> 00:53:40,460
Thank you for everything.

966
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:42,960
Good luck, Ba Da.

967
00:53:43,289 --> 00:53:44,690
- Good luck, Ba Da. - Good luck, Ba Da.

968
00:54:01,179 --> 00:54:02,210
Please take a look around.

969
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:18,230
Hello?

970
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,329
The police are investigating, so I'll wait for now.

971
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:25,969
I'll catch the culprit who made the imitation no matter what.

972
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,210
Let's meet at the office sometime soon. Bye.

973
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:45,619
Let's go, Mom.

974
00:55:22,219 --> 00:55:23,860
It's not so nice since I found it in a rush.

975
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,030
It's not so bad considering it's a basement unit.

976
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:28,400
I'm worried about the mold, though.

977
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,030
I bought new bedding and pots.

978
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:33,440
I turned the heater on in advance.

979
00:55:33,769 --> 00:55:34,840
Take a seat.

980
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:37,440
How dare they...

981
00:55:39,739 --> 00:55:41,980
No, Mom. I already did it all.

982
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,079
If you get involved, it'll really hurt my pride.

983
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:46,610
Just stay put.

984
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:49,119
Honey...

985
00:55:55,159 --> 00:55:57,659
Mom. I'm okay.

986
00:55:58,130 --> 00:55:59,329
It was my decision.

987
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,500
Go and cancel the divorce.

988
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:04,070
Don't let them go free.

989
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:06,769
We must torture them.

990
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:08,969
They'll be happy to get together.

991
00:56:08,969 --> 00:56:10,269
Why would you let him go?

992
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:12,670
I don't want to waste my time on them.

993
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:14,309
I'm more precious than that.

994
00:56:14,809 --> 00:56:17,380
Don't cry. I won't cry, either.

995
00:56:17,909 --> 00:56:19,849
It will be true revenge when I succeed.

996
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:21,280
You trust me, don't you?

997
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:55,880
Father.

998
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:00,090
It's your daughter, Ba Da.

999
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:03,260
Something painful...

1000
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,530
has happened.

1001
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,230
Whenever I'm going through a rough patch,

1002
00:57:10,929 --> 00:57:13,170
I think about what you told me.

1003
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:21,110
"If you live on,"

1004
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,880
"you'll be able to get through it."

1005
00:57:28,519 --> 00:57:29,780
"Keep on pushing forward..."

1006
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:34,219
"no matter what."

1007
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:39,530
If I endure it,

1008
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:42,059
good days will come. Right?

1009
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:46,130
Please watch over me.

1010
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,449
Mi Poong just had lunch,

1011
00:58:00,449 --> 00:58:01,920
and she fell asleep in Chun's room.

1012
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,989
You can't even come in because you feel guilty.

1013
00:58:03,989 --> 00:58:05,349
Why did you do that?

1014
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:09,019
Ba Da visited.

1015
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:12,429
- When? - A few days ago.

1016
00:58:12,429 --> 00:58:13,599
She came to pay Mom back.

1017
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:15,260
I thought her business wasn't going well.

1018
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:16,929
I wonder where she found the money.

1019
00:58:16,929 --> 00:58:19,869
She went on about how she felt, and it really broke my heart.

1020
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:23,539
You're my brother, but I can't take your side.

1021
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:24,969
Ba Da doesn't have anyone.

1022
00:58:25,269 --> 00:58:26,710
All she has is her mother.

1023
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:28,280
Her brother in the US is less than a stranger.

1024
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:29,980
She's almost like an orphan.

1025
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:31,909
This will scar her for life.

1026
00:58:32,349 --> 00:58:34,420
It's up to you two whether you get divorced or not,

1027
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:36,619
but you should ask for her forgiveness no matter what.

1028
00:58:37,849 --> 00:58:40,019
Please let Mi Poong sleep here tonight.

No. Let's talk another time.

I haven't seen her lately, and I can't reach her either.

Okay.

Did something happen to Ba Da? Please tell me.

I must know.

Good night, Mr. Ji.

I happened to be in the neighbourhood.

You can't even lie.

1055

You have no reason to be in this neighbourhood.

You've gotten so thin.

You've gotten thinner than I have.

This is the only place where we shared memories.

Make sure you eat properly.

Don't starve because of a guy like me.

1062

Wait.

Can I hold your hand just once?

1066
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,949
I can tell by holding your hand.

Can you hold me, just once?

Just once.

Stay healthy.

1087
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,489
I'll do what you told me.

1088
01:08:12,090 --> 01:08:13,929
I'll eat properly...

1089

don't forget about me.

Promise me.

I told you I'd come to your office with my daughter-in-law.

1096
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,470
You didn't have to come.

1097
01:09:24,699 --> 01:09:26,670
Of course, I did.

1098

I'll make sure there's a difference for your daughters-in-law.

- Yes, I did. - Good.

Why keep her around on a salary?
