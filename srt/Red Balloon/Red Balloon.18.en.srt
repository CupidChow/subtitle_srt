I get slapped over there.

I've become a punching bag.

where everyone is happy?

20
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,079
People who like talking about others can say,

21
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:50,250
"That man cheated" or "That woman cheated."

22
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,620
They can gossip and insult others, and nothing comes of it.

23
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,120
But the people involved get affected somehow.

24
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,489
You try to smooth things over on both sides by being the good guy,

25
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:02,590
but you end up getting pegged as the bad guy.

Eun Kang seemed like...

27
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,770
she had her trust in you.

28
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:13,740
How do you know that?

29
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,310
I met her on the streets coincidentally.

30
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:19,780
I know it's not my place to say this,

31
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,650
but you won't be able to...

32
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:25,280
turn things back to how they were with Ba Da.

33
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,819
If that's the case...

34
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:34,860
I don't know what to do.

35
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,759
I just wish...

36
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:38,900
I...

37
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:43,300
could disappear...

38
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:46,400
into thin air.

39
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,050
Mi Poong.

40
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,280
You left Mi Poong with your parents.

41
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:03,050
Goodness.

42
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,218
Another round.

43
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,688
We've already had three rounds.

44
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:10,359
Ma'am. Ramyeon, please!

45
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,530
You ate ramyeon already.

48
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:50,539
I struggled to become like you.

I'm sorry.

I don't have any cards up my sleeve.

56

I don't have anything solid...

What a pathetic loser.

- Hello. - Mr. Ko?

63
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,310
I'm Cho Eun San, Cho Eun Kang's sister.

64
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:36,938
I'm heading to your house.

65
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:38,180
Please come out.

66
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,459
I'm Cho Eun San.

67
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,430
Eun Kang didn't give me your number.

68
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,768
I can check her phone without her knowing,

69
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:10,800
so don't take it the wrong way.

70
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,239
I saw your pictures too.

71
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,138
I was going to curse at you but didn't want to feel dirty,

72
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:15,610
so I decided to stop at one slap.

73
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,180
I'll get to the point.

74
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,579
They say people speak the truth when they're drunk.

75
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,750
You're sorry?

76
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,449
Why did you do something you'd be sorry for?

77
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:24,719
I saw my sister on her phone without saying anything...

78
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,479
listening to that crap in the middle of the night.

79
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,920
I came here because I got mad.

80
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:30,688
You had fun with your wife's friend for one night,

81
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:32,620
and when you get caught, you're not going to be responsible?

82
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:36,259
My sister is enduring everything your family is doing to her.

83
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,459
Do you know how damaging your indecisiveness is?

84
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:41,169
Are you scared of getting cursed at?

85
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,399
It won't kill you.

86
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,970
Let's end this.

87
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,410
Let go of my sister.

88
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,939
Don't torture her with false hope.

89
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,379
I didn't even know I called.

90
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,720
I was drunk and made a mistake.

91
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,319
Do you even know...

92
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,529
what's happening to my sister?

93
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,800
I've never seen her like this before.

94
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:13,259
I'm scared she might do something.

95
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:16,600
What's really annoying is...

96
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,370
that the only person who might be able to save her...

97
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,970
is you.

98
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,839
You should take her side...

99
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:28,410
so that she can get through the world pointing fingers at her.

100
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,879
But you're running away like a coward.

101
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,750
You shouldn't say sorry...

102
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,690
if you love her.

103
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:40,320
And you call this love?

104
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:42,330
You really leave me speechless.

105
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,158
What brings you here at this time?

106
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,419
Where have you been?

107
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,860
I suppose Mi Poong is at your parents' house.

108
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,289
Yes.

109
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,158
I came because I thought you wouldn't be eating proper meals.

110
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,370
I made bean sprout soup with kimchi.

111
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:22,570
Sit down.

112
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,379
I microwaved instant rice.

113
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,750
I should've come earlier and cooked some rice for you.

114
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,620
You're not even well. It's not good to walk in the cold wind.

115
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,090
Who cares whatever happens to me?

116
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,288
Cha Won,

117
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:48,289
I was too harsh on you last time.

118
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,889
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:55,829
I'm sorry.

120
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,370
You're at no fault.

121
00:09:57,669 --> 00:09:59,340
It's all because of that girl.

122
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,169
About the divorce...

123
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,509
Please reconsider.

124
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,778
Ba Da only wanted a divorce because her pride was hurt...

125
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:09,249
and didn't want to deal with it anymore.

126
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,878
But I don't think she really meant it.

127
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,648
She couldn't sleep at all last night.

128
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:15,190
I bet you don't want to get a divorce too.

129
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,360
I'll talk to Ba Da.

130
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,190
Please just endure...

131
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,860
through whatever she says,

132
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,860
just this time.

133
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,669
Please, Cha Won.

134
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,909
Ten...

135
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,808
Ten thousand dollars?

136
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:37,939
That's gross!

137
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,340
They said they would settle at 10,000 dollars.

138
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:42,109
It's a small dent in the bumper.

139
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,409
They want 10,000 dollars?

140
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,980
Why did you bring up becoming a private taxi driver?

141
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:48,349
He knew your record had to be clean...

142
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,519
and wanted to extort money out of you.

143
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:51,819
I thought he would be more understanding.

144
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,729
You know what? I believe that all people are born evil,

145
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,888
not good.

146
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:58,258
I was naive when I was young, so I thought everyone was born good.

147
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:00,928
But life has taught me that people are the nastiest.

148
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:01,999
You must be to survive in the world.

149
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,798
Being dense won't get you anywhere.

150
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,500
I can't have an accident on my record.

151
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:08,069
- Honey. - I don't have it.

152
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,709
- You don't have what? - Whatever it is, I don't have it.

153
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,610
I know that you do. You always say you don't have any money.

154
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,539
I'll pay you interest.

155
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:16,008
Helping him out must be our priority.

156
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,279
Why don't you just sell me instead?

157
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,320
I knew it wasn't going to last. I thought you wanted to change.

158
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,089
You still haven't changed. You're clinging on to your money.

159
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,319
I can change my last name or my husband.

160
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,919
But when it comes to money, I won't change a thing.

161
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:30,389
Hey, Eun San.

162
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:33,230
I'm sorry. But can you help him out?

163
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,929
How dare you ask her for that money? No way.

164
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,840
Keep it safe with you, and set up a store or something.

165
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,610
I'm sorry.

166
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,710
I already spent it.

167
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,710
On what?

168
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:49,309
I donated it to a volunteer organization.

169
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:50,609
- What? - What?

170
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,750
The entire 100,000 dollars?

171
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,620
Yes.

172
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,519
It was never my money. Nor did I earn it myself.

173
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:00,419
Don't you know what that money means?

174
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:02,090
It was the price of ruining your youth!

175
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:05,029
How could you give it to people you don't even know?

176
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,399
They never helped you or looked out for you!

177
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:10,169
You donated all of it?

178
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,000
You didn't even think about it? You just did it?

179
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:14,740
Could you leave after making that donation?

180
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,769
Get up now. We must go and get it back.

181
00:12:16,909 --> 00:12:18,639
I can't take it back. It's already done.

182
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:21,750
I don't want to start a business and make a living that way.

183
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,019
Hey! Rich people are supposed to think like that!

184
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:29,490
Poor people like us don't have that luxury!

185
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:31,490
- Get up. Let's go and check. - Okay.

186
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,620
Let her be.

187
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:34,729
Like she said, the money was hers.

188
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,388
It was only fair that she decided what to do with the money.

189
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,629
She might seem fine, but I'm sure this must've been tough on her.

190
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,830
Let that comfort her a bit.

191
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:43,299
But still. That's a lot of money.

192
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:46,070
You can donate 1,000 dollars.

193
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:47,769
Can't you get the rest back?

194
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,370
Dae Bong, stop it.

195
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,110
I didn't want to cause trouble.

196
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,120
What?

197
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,779
That's a huge decision. Why didn't you discuss it first?

198
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,120
I had already decided to go. So I'll just go next week.

199
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,158
I was waiting after I applied for it.

200
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,990
A spot opened up at the last minute, so I said yes.

201
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:10,690
I got the baking and hairstyling certificates before.

202
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:13,298
I'm a certified nurse's aide and have a driver's license.

203
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:14,700
So I'm sure I'll be helpful to someone.

204
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,200
I want to be helpful.

205
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:20,070
But still. That was sudden.

206
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,370
I told you.

207
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,070
Travelling the world on the RV and volunteering...

208
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,710
had always been my dream.

209
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,480
But I'll put off travelling the world on the RV for now.

210
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:38,289
I'm okay with everything,

211
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,690
but I'm worried about you.

212
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:45,059
I want to see you happy before I go.

213
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:52,340
Don't tell our parents yet.

214
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,269
I'll tell them when it's time.

215
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:00,950
Eun Kang.

216
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,679
I have a favour to ask.

217
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,649
Give up on him.

218
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,720
Even if he decides to choose you,

219
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:13,490
this won't work out.

220
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,590
He'll find out everything. What are you going to do?

221
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,100
Mom worked for his parents as a housekeeper.

222
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,840
Dad was the taxi driver who sold used goods to his father.

223
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,940
I should do my best to make it work.

224
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,940
Don't say anything until we decide on anything.

225
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:34,509
Let's say our parents don't become an issue.

226
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:37,049
But what about me?

227
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,789
Tell him you don't have any sisters.

228
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,049
Pretend that I'm dead.

229
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,970
How much?

230
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:56,629
Is he hurt badly?

231
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,570
It was a minor fender bender.

232
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,039
He probably didn't come to work to clear things up.

233
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,769
I see.

234
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:44,179
I apologize for my behaviour that day.

235
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,090
I bought some Korean beef.

236
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,960
I'm sorry, Ms. Na.

237
00:15:57,059 --> 00:15:58,459
They already filed the divorce papers.

238
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,799
What's the point of coming here?

239
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:02,299
They will withdraw the divorce papers soon.

240
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,840
It's my daughter's fault for keeping a bad friend.

241
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,940
It's not Cha Won's fault.

242
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,470
She was determined to seduce him.

243
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,080
How could he not fall for it?

244
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,210
Seriously? You're changing your words.

245
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:16,350
You lied about being sick, didn't you?

246
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,480
You said you were sick. Why are you wearing makeup?

247
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,250
Wearing makeup has been an old habit.

248
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:25,120
I made sure to wear makeup ever since I got sick...

249
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,820
because I didn't want people to treat me like a patient.

250
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:32,259
I'm not sure if it is indeed Korean beef.

251
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:35,970
I bought the most expensive set at a department store.

252
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,840
If my husband were alive,

253
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:41,240
this wouldn't have happened.

254
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:44,610
My daughter has no one to rely on other than me.

255
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,240
Please find it in your heart to be understanding.

256
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,279
She had your son's child. She's your daughter-in-law.

257
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,580
In name only.

258
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,250
She didn't do much.

259
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:58,460
Why do you keep slapping me? That hurts.

260
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:01,090
- That's so lame. - I'm so sorry.

261
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:02,960
Mr. Ko. Ms. Na.

262
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:05,299
If you can overlook what happened,

263
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,329
she'll come back.

264
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,009
What do you mean?

265
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,509
My mother went to see them?

266
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,380
Yes. My father wanted to know if you felt the same way.

267
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,950
No. That will never happen.

268
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:30,450
Never.

269
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,730
She said it would never happen.

270
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,390
She sounded firm too.

271
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,630
No?

272
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,758
I told you this marriage was over.

273
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,269
I can't believe her mother either.

274
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:45,369
She got ahead of herself. Look what she did.

275
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,470
My father used to be like that.

276
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:50,170
That reminds me of Taffy. And I'm craving some now.

277
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,309
I should go and buy some Taffy.

278
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,910
How could you be so immature?

279
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:57,009
It's not because I'm immature.

280
00:17:57,049 --> 00:17:58,920
I'm just telling you to stop worrying.

281
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,650
Given Cha Won's conditions,

282
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,190
women from good families would line up to marry him.

283
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,420
Gosh.

284
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:09,289
It's me.

285
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:11,059
Change the passcode of the house.

286
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,759
Don't let my mom visit you again.

287
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,930
Don't open the door for her either.

288
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:17,599
Ba Da.

289
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:28,309
When you get caught, you're not going to be responsible?

290
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:31,279
I'm scared she might do something.

291
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,990
Eun Kang seemed like she had her trust in you.

292
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:43,259
Let's not give up.

293
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:45,259
I want to see where the end of this path is.

294
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,500
I've made my decision.

295
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,500
Are you sleeping?

296
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,440
No.

297
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:31,839
Come out.

298
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,140
I rushed here because you're the person I missed the most.

299
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,240
You've never...

300
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,609
made me feel uncomfortable.

301
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,279
You must have been so miserable to say all those things to me.

302
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,750
My answer is...

303
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:23,829
I won't give up on us.

304
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,069
We should see...

305
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,000
where this leads.

306
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,230
Let's see my parents this weekend.

307
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,769
Let me handle the rest.

308
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:17,910
- Where's Nam Chul? - Hello, sir.

309
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,518
He had a meeting with a business partner.

310
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:20,619
Call him.

311
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:22,490
Goodness.

312
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:24,960
I didn't bid for it.

313
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:27,419
I've been hearing some weird things, so I'm looking into it.

314
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,229
What's there to look into?

315
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,960
I taught you how to fish. Then bring me fish.

316
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:33,829
This is a ten-million-dollar deal.

317
00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:36,399
Let me look into this more and...

318
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,739
There's no need. I already put in the bid.

319
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,900
What?

320
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,940
Father. You can't do that.

321
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,309
I'm on my way to the office now.

322
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:46,839
Please wait.

323
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,250
Father!

324
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:50,980
Sir!

325
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,059
Father.

326
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,930
Father, the demolition project...

327
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:04,160
Forget it.

328
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:07,230
This is why I can't retire.

329
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,969
Must I be looking into this too?

330
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,599
Can't you do your job?

331
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,869
Gosh. I'm so lonely.

332
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:15,140
But...

333
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,210
He won the bid with 8 million dollars, not 10.

334
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,180
They wanted the down payment, so I just wired the money.

335
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,579
How much?

336
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:28,848
It was supposed to be ten percent.

337
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:31,759
But since they lowered the price, they wanted 50 percent.

338
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:32,960
What?

339
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:34,730
Then...

340
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,230
You wired them four million dollars?

341
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:39,399
The chairman said he knew them.

342
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,429
How could you wire the money? You should have stopped him.

343
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,098
You know that he doesn't listen to me.

344
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:44,469
What do we do?

345
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:48,210
I also heard that con artists were involved in the bidding process.

(Under surveillance)

347
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,289
Geum Ah.

348
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,419
Why couldn't I get hold of you?

349
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,819
You didn't answer your phone.

350
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,018
I heard you were trying to resolve an accident.

351
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:09,828
How did it go? Did it not go well?

352
00:23:09,829 --> 00:23:10,989
Well,

353
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,328
it went well.

354
00:23:12,329 --> 00:23:14,159
I had to get a lot of documents...

355
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,930
and go to the auto shop. So I was busy.

356
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,899
I have to head back to the auto shop again.

357
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,140
I'll call you later.

358
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:21,940
Dae Geun, I know you.

359
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:24,069
You can't look me in the eye now.

360
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,210
Be honest.

361
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:26,539
What happened?

362
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,940
Tell me.

363
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,579
Your husband came to me.

364
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:36,849
My husband did?

365
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:40,119
What did he say? Did he curse at you or hit you?

366
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,220
No.

367
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,630
He never said anything bad to me.

368
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,730
He only talked like a gentleman.

369
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,900
He begged me not to see you.

370
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:51,029
I don't care.

371
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,670
I care.

372
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,269
Geum Ah.

373
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,509
Let's be more patient.

374
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:00,779
That breaks my heart.

375
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,049
That's what you said to me before.

376
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,480
Then you left me after a few days and disappeared.

377
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,750
Are you having second thoughts after seeing my husband?

378
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:13,858
My ex-wife cheated on me with another guy too.

379
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:15,759
So I can understand how he must feel now.

380
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,400
Dealing with this must've been difficult as a man.

381
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,859
But he didn't even curse at me.

382
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:22,599
I beat up the guy my ex-wife cheated on me with.

383
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,670
I want to give him...

384
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,769
what he wants even if it's for a while.

385
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:31,068
I at least want to pretend I'm trying.

386
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,309
There's no need to do that.

387
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,779
I'm thinking about divorcing him.

388
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,750
I'll get what I want now.

389
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,690
My father forced me to marry him. I had never wanted him.

390
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:43,549
Even when I had children,

391
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:46,819
I felt empty inside as if I had been shot in the heart.

392
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:49,429
I want to spend...

393
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,789
the rest of my life with you.

394
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:53,200
I'm not scared of my dad anymore.

395
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:10,479
Your wife still hasn't come to her senses.

396
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,680
She even went to my husband's work.

397
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,989
Do you know how dangerous an affair can be to a woman?

398
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,149
She'll throw away her children and leave home.

399
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,220
Are you sure...

400
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,558
you're okay with your children finding out about her affair?

401
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,329
Your son seemed like a smart boy.

402
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,829
If you approach my children,

403
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,960
I won't be so nice.

404
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,930
You'd better handle this by today. Or I don't know what I'll do.

405
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,469
No wonder why she's cheating on you. Look at you.

406
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,538
- What? - You're not scary.

407
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:38,409
You ought to teach her a lesson even if you have to hit her.

408
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,880
You'd better handle this by today.

409
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,359
I'm home.

410
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,140
Why did you go to him?

411
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:07,470
You've already talked to me. Why did you go to him?

412
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:08,769
Stop seeing him.

413
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,970
How could you show up at his work?

414
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,609
Did you have me followed now?

415
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,410
I can't believe you went that far.

416
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:15,879
You're so awful.

417
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,079
Yes, I am.

418
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,680
That's why I'm in this marriage.

419
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,779
No more of this. You've done enough.

420
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,119
Think about our children.

421
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:24,249
Don't get back at me like this.

422
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,490
This has nothing to do with you.

423
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:28,220
Did you think I was seeing him to get back at you?

424
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:30,230
Why would I do that when I have zero feelings for you?

425
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:31,629
We're not like you and that tramp.

426
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:34,160
You must have fallen for her because you liked her young body.

427
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,599
Our relationship isn't like your worthless affair.

428
00:26:37,369 --> 00:26:39,969
What we share is real. It's real love.

429
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,269
I don't care if it's real or not.

430
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:42,940
That doesn't matter. Listen to me.

431
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:45,279
If you see him again tomorrow, it's over.

432
00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:48,078
Don't you know we live here too?

433
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:49,548
Why are you yelling?

434
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:50,608
I'm sorry.

435
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,578
Is it because Geum Ah went out?

436
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:55,150
She had to meet her friends to get comforted.

437
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,049
You cheated on her.

438
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,220
That's so lame!

439
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,670
Do you want to have a meal?

440
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:10,829
I'm not hungry.

441
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:16,369
You're the first person I wanted to put on my family registry.

442
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,508
What?

443
00:27:19,509 --> 00:27:21,640
Why don't you ask me to share the trash bags?

444
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,710
Or the mileage points.

445
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:27,779
Don't waste your energy.

446
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:30,119
I'm going abroad next week for a volunteer abroad program.

447
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,460
Next week? To where?

448
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,589
Will you follow me?

449
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:37,759
I'm ready to leave at any moment.

450
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:41,099
Look. I always carry my passport with me.

451
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,369
This is the new version too. Did you know?

452
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,470
(Republic of Korea, Passport)

453
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,579
I'll buy you a roll of gimbap. You can eat that.

454
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,309
Thank you for processing the severance pay.

455
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,480
I met with Ms. Cho Eun San during lunch.

456
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,390
She said she was leaving next week abroad for a volunteer program.

457
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,019
Don't tell me about her.

458
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:07,660
Okay.

459
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:31,950
I ordered the expensive black herb tea on purpose.

460
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:35,319
I asked them to add the egg yolk. Like the traditional recipe.

461
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:36,950
I'm buying, sir.

462
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:39,220
What's this about? You've been quiet for a while.

463
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:40,960
Today,

464
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,529
I've been thinking about my relationship with you...

465
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:52,200
What is it?

466
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,599
Nam Chul did?

467
00:28:54,269 --> 00:28:56,009
Why would he raise his voice?

468
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,640
Let's talk at home. Bye.

469
00:28:58,579 --> 00:28:59,740
Gosh, I'm so lonely.

470
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,279
I had all sorts of mixed feelings, and it made me feel surreal.

471
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,649
I remember the first time we met.

472
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:11,689
Your RV ran out of gas in the countryside.

473
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,359
So you were on the road, not knowing what to do.

474
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:16,028
I was passing by at that moment and spotted you.

475
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:18,500
I went to the gas station and brought you gas.

476
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,930
It was a very cold day in winter. Imagine if I wasn't there to help.

477
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:25,169
You remember that, right?

478
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,569
Of course.

479
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:29,008
I also remember paying you handsomely.

480
00:29:29,009 --> 00:29:30,609
"Handsomely" would be going too far.

481
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:35,109
Afterwards, I hooked you up with cheap camping items.

482
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,649
The bond between you and I...

483
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,409
must be quite strong.

484
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,279
You're bragging a lot today. Is this about money?

485
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:43,319
I knew it.

486
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:44,819
You're so cool.

487
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,490
I wouldn't lend money even to the deity of the black herbal tea.

488
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,490
Lending or borrowing money.

489
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,029
I had never done that in my life.

490
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,170
I'm buying you this...

491
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,930
even if you don't lend me money.

492
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,099
Please drink it.

493
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:03,069
This is such an urgent matter.

494
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:06,039
Chairman Ko, please help me.

495
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,549
I'll make sure to pay for the interest too.

496
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:09,849
How about 10,000 dollars?

497
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:10,880
That's it.

498
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,549
Gosh, I'm so lonely.

499
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:16,088
Everyone is making me feel lonely.

500
00:30:16,089 --> 00:30:17,150
Chairman Ko!

501
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:21,990
I'm on my way.

502
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,500
I was meeting up with a taxi driver I knew.

503
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,930
He suddenly brought up money.

504
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,329
How could he ask for 10,000 dollars? We're not even close.

505
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,268
When you befriend poor people,

506
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:35,569
they always end up asking for money.

507
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:37,869
This is why I don't meet people.

508
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:39,609
Gosh, I'm so lonely.

509
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,759
Sir, can you stop over there?

510
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,899
It's 18 dollars.

511
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,059
Get out.

512
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,529
Darn it.

513
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,569
Hey, you punks! Stop right there!

514
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,069
Let's run.

515
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:28,420
You jerks!

516
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:32,259
Don't look down on people.

517
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:36,069
I'm not letting you go because I can't catch you.

518
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,869
You should pay for your ride!

519
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:42,869
How could you dash without paying for it, you punks?

520
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,880
You shouldn't do that.

521
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:27,250
(2023 Teacher Certification Exam, Cho Eun Kang, congratulations.)

522
00:32:30,089 --> 00:32:32,059
My gosh. No way!

523
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:51,710
Ba Da...

524
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,519
My gosh.

525
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:05,519
Is this for real?

526
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:09,359
What is it? Did she win the lottery?

527
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,160
Our daughter is now a teacher.

528
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,170
What? Let me see.

529
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,700
Goodness.

530
00:33:22,339 --> 00:33:25,910
Eun Kang, no way! Congratulations.

531
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,778
Eun Kang, you're the best!

532
00:33:28,779 --> 00:33:32,349
I knew it. I knew you'd become a teacher.

533
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:36,190
Ban Sook, you're lying through your teeth.

534
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,119
Didn't you tell her to learn how to drive a taxi?

535
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,788
That was my way of getting her to study harder.

536
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:42,019
You're just clueless.

537
00:33:42,329 --> 00:33:45,230
For the first time, I chuckled at what wasn't money.

538
00:33:46,329 --> 00:33:48,099
Have you been secretly studying?

539
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,869
None of us knew.

540
00:33:50,569 --> 00:33:52,098
I was going to tell you after I passed.

541
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:53,239
She can be so sneaky.

542
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,409
She's considerate, not sneaky.

543
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,170
- She's tight-lipped as well. - Well,

544
00:33:57,309 --> 00:33:58,409
I know what it's like to be tight.

545
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:00,480
I'm tight here and there, aren't I?

546
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:05,420
This is the best day of my life!

547
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,720
Who dares to belittle me?

548
00:34:06,819 --> 00:34:09,519
I may not seem like it, but I'm a teacher's father.

549
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,690
Don't think less of me!

550
00:34:11,789 --> 00:34:12,820
And I'm...

551
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,219
her uncle.

552
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:17,729
And I'm her mother.

553
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,460
And I'm her younger sister.

554
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,199
Things are finally looking up for our family.

555
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,940
Let's now buy a house of our own and go on trips abroad.

556
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,638
Darn you, ladies!

557
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,309
My daughter is now a certified teacher.

558
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,550
Are you that happy?

559
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,409
- Must you ask? - Must you ask?

560
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,779
All our troubles have been washed away.

561
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,389
Now that you're a teacher,

562
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,049
decent men will want your hand in marriage.

563
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,590
Choose the best of the best,

564
00:34:46,789 --> 00:34:48,489
date him, and then marry him.

565
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,659
This is where your happiness begins.

566
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:52,760
Aren't I right, Ms. Cho?

567
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,030
Even at home, we'll address her as a teacher.

568
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,599
- Of course. - Of course.

569
00:34:57,869 --> 00:35:00,268
Ms. Cho, I'll prepare the party.

570
00:35:00,269 --> 00:35:02,909
Ms. Cho, do you want galbijim?

571
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,610
Dae Bong, this calls for a performance.

572
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,809
Of course.

573
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:12,980
There's nothing I won't do for Ms. Cho.

574
00:35:13,449 --> 00:35:16,989
We are back from our tour in South-East Asia.

575
00:35:17,019 --> 00:35:19,389
I am Cho Dae Bong.

576
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,690
And I am Cho Dae Geun.

577
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,689
The brothers will put on...

578
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:27,229
a congratulatory performance for you.

579
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:29,369
Cue, music.

580
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,409
Eun Kang.

581
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,730
Ms. Na Bun Nyeon.

582
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:04,570
We're the police.

583
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,940
You have the wrong person.

584
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:08,099
Get her!

585
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,109
Move.

586
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,539
- Get her. - Got it.

587
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,179
- Go! - Right.

588
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,780
Ma'am.

589
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,849
All right, fine. I'll come with you.

590
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,980
I couldn't sleep at all.

591
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,719
- How do I look? - You look pretty.

592
00:36:58,789 --> 00:37:00,159
Look at it fly away.

593
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,690
You're pretty and so is the balloon.

594
00:37:04,929 --> 00:37:06,030
I have something to tell you.

595
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,500
I...

596
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,469
passed.

597
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:12,030
I'll be appointed to a school before the new semester begins.

598
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:13,739
Really?

599
00:37:18,309 --> 00:37:19,380
You worked hard.

600
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:23,380
One of your dreams has finally come true.

601
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,449
You're admirable.

602
00:37:33,019 --> 00:37:34,019
Come on in.

603
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:49,639
- Mom. - What?

604
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:52,510
- What brings you by during the day? - Hey.

605
00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:53,880
I had something to tell you.

606
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,349
- Dad's home, right? - He probably is.

607
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,849
Why are you there and not coming in?

608
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,360
Come on in.

609
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,980
- Mul Sang, get out here! - Dad!

610
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:35,019
What's all this fuss? Why are you all calling for me?

611
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:56,440
Dad, Mom. I apologize for my behaviour.

612
00:38:56,909 --> 00:38:57,969
From now on,

613
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:00,510
she is who I'll be with.

614
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:03,980
It has been a bumpy ride,

615
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:07,079
but I believe that we were meant to end up together.

616
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,589
I will cleanly end my relationship with Ba Da.

617
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,589
What do we do? Should we kick them out?

618
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,690
Have a seat for now.

619
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:34,579
Before you say anything, we have good news to share.

620
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:37,408
She is...

621
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:39,920
See? I knew it.

622
00:39:41,019 --> 00:39:43,349
Hey! Are you pregnant?

623
00:39:45,389 --> 00:39:47,360
Mom, I mean she passed the exam.

624
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:48,820
She's now a certified teacher.

625
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,489
Really?

626
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:05,039
This is why one shouldn't be mean to youngsters.

627
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,908
Go and get us some tea.

628
00:40:06,909 --> 00:40:08,010
Got it, Mom.

629
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:14,750
Congratulations.

630
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,619
Thanks, Geum Ah.

631
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,789
Get over there. My dad must have something to say.

632
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,969
Cha Won, I read the letter you wrote.

633
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,268
No wonder. I knew it was weird...

634
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:37,669
that your father didn't yell.

635
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,010
If that's what you want,

636
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:42,550
and if you're sincere about her, I won't object.

637
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:46,079
But your divorce is yet to be finalized.

638
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,449
We'll revisit this in a year's time.

639
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:52,590
I'm not saying I want to marry her right away.

640
00:40:53,289 --> 00:40:54,960
I'm just telling you where I stand.

641
00:40:55,659 --> 00:40:56,960
Mi Poong is who I'm worried about.

642
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:59,760
Make sure that she isn't hurt in the process.

643
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:02,300
I'll keep that in mind.

644
00:41:02,869 --> 00:41:05,300
This is great. You can get married next year.

645
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,170
One should live with the one they love.

646
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,409
Ba Da threw away her own fortune.

647
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:12,269
What if she doesn't agree to the divorce...

648
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:14,210
because she's annoyed by their relationship?

649
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:25,388
You said no one was allowed to divorce...

650
00:41:25,389 --> 00:41:26,590
and kept Nam Chul in the family.

651
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,320
Are you really going to allow this?

652
00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:30,960
Who knows what'll happen in a year?

653
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,530
Being on bad terms with my son will only make me lonely.

654
00:41:33,929 --> 00:41:36,500
I'm putting a lid on it and letting it pass for now.

655
00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:38,369
- No wonder. - Besides,

656
00:41:38,469 --> 00:41:40,170
Nam Chul and Cha Won aren't the same.

657
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:42,769
Cha Won can live his life the way he wants,

658
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:45,570
but our family can't function without Nam Chul.

659
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:48,039
My dad was correct.

660
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:51,050
He told me to be aware of those who were different on the inside.

661
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:54,579
Being that way is how our marriage lasted.

662
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,788
You just don't know what's important.

663
00:41:56,789 --> 00:41:59,190
You stole my saying. "Gosh, I'm lonely."

664
00:41:59,289 --> 00:42:00,690
You're so lame.

665
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,860
My heart was pounding in there.

666
00:42:06,659 --> 00:42:07,860
You didn't seem nervous at all.

667
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,500
I thought they'd yell at me and kick me out.

668
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:13,500
I didn't know you had sent your father a letter.

669
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,139
I told you to trust me.

670
00:42:16,769 --> 00:42:18,139
When should I meet your parents?

671
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,538
Maybe sometime later.

672
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,349
We'll soon be moving to a new house anyway.

673
00:42:23,809 --> 00:42:25,949
He said we should marry next year, so you can meet them then.

674
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,349
I'm curious, and I can't wait to meet them.

675
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,389
Get in. We have somewhere to go.

676
00:42:53,539 --> 00:42:54,739
My gosh.

677
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:58,280
I don't think this suits me.

678
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:00,819
I haven't worn a suit this expensive before.

679
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,079
It looks perfect on you.

680
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,449
It's my gift to Cho Eun Kang, the teacher.

681
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,019
That's not how a teacher should be.

682
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,190
One shouldn't be like this in front of her students.

683
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,030
Stand up straight, Ko Cha Won.

684
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,969
How dare you look at a teacher with lust in your eyes?

685
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,969
Follow me to the teacher's lounge.

686
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:24,070
Thanks, Cha Won.

687
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:27,209
I'll wear it on my first day. I'm super excited.

688
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:29,039
And I love to see you excited.

689
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:30,809
Let's go buy some shoes.

690
00:43:31,449 --> 00:43:32,609
You should get ones in a matching colour.

691
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,849
Oh, dear.

692
00:43:34,449 --> 00:43:36,690
In return, I'll take you out for a meal.

693
00:43:36,889 --> 00:43:39,150
Not meat in boiling water but grilled Korean beef.

694
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,519
I already made reservations for a full-course meal,

695
00:43:41,789 --> 00:43:42,960
Ms. Cho.

696
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:49,329
Mom, let's replenish our energy today.

697
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:52,529
I came here before, and the food was nice.

698
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:53,800
I can see why.

699
00:43:54,469 --> 00:43:56,539
You should be the one eating more, though.

700
00:43:56,739 --> 00:43:57,809
You've lost weight.

701
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:06,719
It's our first time dining out together.

702
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:08,219
You're right.

703
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,889
I feel like I'm dreaming.

704
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:11,690
Boo!

705
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:13,389
It's not a dream, right?

706
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,789
That was so mean of you.

707
00:44:16,829 --> 00:44:19,259
I'll go buy some wet wipes at the convenience store.

708
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,599
I have a call to make.

709
00:44:20,829 --> 00:44:22,260
Head inside first and order for us.

710
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,699
The beef looks incredible.

711
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:30,109
Before, we used to eat at restaurants...

712
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:32,170
where the servers grilled our meat for us.

713
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:34,739
I'll do the grilling for you instead.

714
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,380
I'm off to the restroom.

715
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:42,380
- We booked a room, right? - Yes.

716
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:47,059
My gosh. Ba Da!

717
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:49,789
Goodness.

718
00:44:50,389 --> 00:44:52,530
Why couldn't I get a hold of you?

719
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,300
Hey, Il Sook. It's been a while.

720
00:44:55,429 --> 00:44:57,199
What on earth is going on?

721
00:44:59,769 --> 00:45:01,039
We'll talk some other time.

722
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:02,598
It's best not to keep your friends waiting.

723
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,339
I can't believe what's happening.

724
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,939
My husband told me...

725
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,539
they were getting married.

726
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:09,449
His family already approved,

727
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:11,150
and that tramp even passed the Teacher Certification Exam.

728
00:45:14,219 --> 00:45:15,279
We'll talk some other time.

729
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,618
How can fate be so cruel?

730
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:19,489
Someone who stole a friend's husband shouldn't be living the good life.

731
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:20,759
I can't believe you either.

732
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,959
How could you let someone like her steal your husband?

733
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,429
I told you before to watch out for her.

734
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:28,899
You said you'd never let someone like her steal your husband,

735
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,229
but look at what happened.

736
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:31,368
Il Sook, please.

737
00:45:31,369 --> 00:45:33,170
I'm furious, that's all.

738
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,539
Your in-laws have gone insane.

739
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,408
How could they accept that tramp?

740
00:45:37,409 --> 00:45:38,469
They approved...

741
00:45:38,909 --> 00:45:40,039
of that tramp?

742
00:45:40,139 --> 00:45:41,139
That's right.

743
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:44,179
Mother, how could I not be furious right now?

744
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:46,979
Our friends kept saying bad things about you too,

745
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,280
so I gave them a piece of my mind.

746
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,319
They were making fun of you...

747
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,518
for being a loser who lost her husband to that tramp.

748
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:53,820
Just stop.

749
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:56,328
- Mom, let's go. - Once she finishes.

750
00:45:56,329 --> 00:45:57,559
There's nothing to hear.

751
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:59,828
But the meat...

752
00:45:59,829 --> 00:46:02,199
Ba Da, call me, all right?

753
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:08,670
There you go. Thank you.

754
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:12,980
I sure am glad to see you.

755
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:14,939
Did you think you'd live happily ever after?

756
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,109
- Mom. - You!

757
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:18,510
You'll get what you deserve, you tramp!

758
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,820
You won't live happily ever after.

759
00:46:21,019 --> 00:46:23,619
Got it, Director Shin. I'll take care of it.

760
00:46:26,289 --> 00:46:27,689
- I said I got it. - That tramp.

761
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:29,389
She'll get what's coming.

762
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,159
How dare she?

763
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:34,000
Let's hang up. I'll be right there.

764
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,869
That's her, right?

765
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:46,309
It's her.

766
00:46:46,539 --> 00:46:48,210
Remember the video on the online café for moms?

767
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,448
The wife slapped her husband and his mistress who was her friend.

768
00:46:51,449 --> 00:46:52,808
You're right.

769
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:55,780
The one who left is the wife, and she's the friend.

770
00:46:56,389 --> 00:46:58,389
My gosh. I can't believe it.

771
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:01,219
You there.

772
00:47:01,659 --> 00:47:03,929
Did you come for a barbecue after betraying your friend?

773
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:05,760
How can you even eat?

774
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,459
How dare you seduce your friend's husband?

775
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,829
Tell me about it.

776
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:11,899
You look like the type to be good at it too.

777
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,799
She should be publicly humiliated...

778
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,598
so that she can't dare to go anywhere.

779
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,269
- Let's go. - That's him.

780
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:19,739
Look at them both taking off.

781
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:23,078
Hey! You won't be able to live your life in Korea.

782
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:24,650
The video of you is all over the Internet.

783
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:57,549
This is bad.

784
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:59,409
Clients have been cancelling their appointments.

785
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:01,449
Are we supposed to post an apology on our website?

786
00:48:01,849 --> 00:48:03,320
What on earth is going on?

787
00:48:06,389 --> 00:48:09,159
Someone as smart as you should've seen this coming.

788
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,888
Why did you stay at the café?

789
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:12,860
You should've left or told them not to film.

790
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,199
Both weren't an option.

791
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,530
I had to sit there and take it.

792
00:48:17,969 --> 00:48:20,199
Videos like this can't be taken down after they spread.

793
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:23,969
We reported it to the police, so let's be patient.

794
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:26,710
That reminds me.

795
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:28,739
Your school.

796
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:32,250
The parents won't let this slide.

797
00:48:40,389 --> 00:48:41,960
(Cho Eun Kang)

798
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,559
Hello,

799
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,499
I'm Cho Eun Kang who will teach Korean.

800
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,860
I hope we get along.

801
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:53,799
Hey.

802
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,968
You call yourself a teacher?

803
00:48:54,969 --> 00:48:56,908
I won't let a home wrecker teach my child.

804
00:48:56,909 --> 00:48:57,940
Get out here.

805
00:48:58,070 --> 00:48:59,539
Get out here!

806
00:49:00,909 --> 00:49:03,579
- I'm sorry. - How dare you teach our children?

807
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:04,908
How dare you?

808
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:06,380
I'm so sorry.

809
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:08,280
I'm sorry.

810
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:32,469
Your father must be heartbroken...

811
00:49:32,739 --> 00:49:34,309
to see the way we're living.

812
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,779
He won't be.

813
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:37,610
I'm sure Dad will come to us with a smile.

814
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,050
Please don't cry during the ancestral rite.

815
00:49:49,659 --> 00:49:50,760
(We're celebrating our first anniversary!)

816
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,089
- Hurry. - What?

817
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:54,098
Why are you calling me here when I'm busy?

818
00:49:54,099 --> 00:49:56,058
It's one gift per person.

819
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:57,468
We shouldn't pass up on freebies.

820
00:49:57,469 --> 00:49:59,670
Right. Thank you.

821
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:03,638
Hello.

822
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:05,639
Gosh, we meet for the first time.

823
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:08,909
Mom.

824
00:50:09,309 --> 00:50:11,050
- You should take one too. - Gosh.

825
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:14,349
- Unbelievable. - Let's go.

826
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,349
- I can't believe you. - Thank you.

827
00:50:19,489 --> 00:50:21,420
- She's the company bookkeeper. - I see.

828
00:50:26,829 --> 00:50:28,599
Mom, can you go home without me?

829
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:03,599
What is this about?

830
00:51:04,369 --> 00:51:06,269
I'm sorry to ask you this,

831
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:09,500
but I will, despite being rude.

832
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:11,139
The bookkeeper at the company.

833
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:13,610
Is she Cho Eun Kang's little sister?

834
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,610
What?

835
00:51:16,809 --> 00:51:18,610
No.

836
00:51:18,949 --> 00:51:19,979
She's not.

837
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,679
Be honest with me.

838
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,320
It's important to me.

839
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:25,920
The relationship is over anyway,

840
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,760
so there's no reason for you to hide it.

841
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:30,789
She has nothing...

842
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,300
to do with Ms. Cho.

843
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,630
I only came by to confirm what I know.

844
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:38,599
The helper at the house.

845
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:41,039
She's Eun Kang's mother.

846
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:58,489
Mom, the home shopping channel called me in urgently.

847
00:51:58,690 --> 00:51:59,960
I'll head home once I'm done.

848
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:02,219
Don't cook the food without me, okay?

849
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:03,859
- I won't be long. - Really?

850
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:04,960
Han Ba Da?

851
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,130
That's right. She stole someone else's design.

852
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,499
That's why the exhibition...

853
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,769
at the department store got cancelled.

854
00:52:10,969 --> 00:52:13,169
The original designer released knockoffs...

855
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:14,570
to teach her a lesson.

856
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:16,510
So she was running a business by stealing others' designs?

857
00:52:17,869 --> 00:52:19,269
That fraud.

858
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:21,879
Winning the Grand Award at the International Jewellery Awards...

859
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,150
- must also be a lie, then. - Probably.

860
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:43,769
Ma'am.

861
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:47,939
I was going to go by your residence next week.

862
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:49,198
What brings you by?

863
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:52,908
No wonder you stopped me from coming to your office.

864
00:52:52,909 --> 00:52:54,780
- I can't believe it. - Gosh.

865
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:56,510
Please have a seat.

866
00:52:56,679 --> 00:52:57,848
There's no need for that.

867
00:52:57,849 --> 00:52:59,079
I heard your business tanked.

868
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:00,880
Are the rumours true?

869
00:53:02,119 --> 00:53:03,449
Those are groundless rumours.

870
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:05,690
Business is as usual.

871
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,558
I just moved to a new office, that's all.

872
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,420
I'll soon be moving to a bigger one.

873
00:53:09,789 --> 00:53:11,388
The wedding gift for your younger daughter-in-law...

874
00:53:11,389 --> 00:53:12,729
Forget about it.

875
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:13,929
I don't trust you enough.

876
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,400
Return the deposit...

877
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,699
and terminate our contract.

878
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,239
Ma'am. I'm Han Ba Da.

879
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:23,269
Don't you trust me? You know me.

880
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:26,440
People don't lie. Money does.

881
00:53:26,909 --> 00:53:29,409
How would I know if your jewellery is real or fake?

882
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:31,809
Don't think my words are too harsh.

883
00:53:31,849 --> 00:53:33,280
Think about it from my perspective.

884
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,980
What could you do in a place like this?

885
00:53:36,849 --> 00:53:39,349
I'll send my secretary, so take care of this.

886
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,519
Wait a second.

887
00:53:48,699 --> 00:53:50,329
I already sent it to the factory,

888
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,130
so it'll be ready next week.

889
00:53:52,699 --> 00:53:55,300
- If you cancel your order now... - That's not my concern.

890
00:53:57,039 --> 00:53:58,869
If your company went under,

891
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:00,840
you should've told me honestly!

892
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:04,979
Ma'am...

893
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,250
Ma'am!

(Ba Da's Father's Death Anniversary)

895
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:02,340
Who is it?

896
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:11,909
Why are you here?

897
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:14,119
Did you enjoy the meat that day?

898
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,449
Did the meat taste good...

899
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:18,719
after you drove your friend into a corner?

900
00:55:19,889 --> 00:55:20,889
I'm sorry.

901
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,789
I know it's Father's memorial today.

902
00:55:24,329 --> 00:55:25,590
I brought some Jeon.

903
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,360
I always got it for you for his memorial.

904
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:28,530
You're so brazen.

905
00:55:28,699 --> 00:55:30,299
How dare you show your face here?

906
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,768
Ba Da's father would roll over in his grave.

907
00:55:32,769 --> 00:55:34,900
Looking at you makes me sick, so get out!

908
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:43,849
This brat brought Jeon.

909
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:45,449
She's so thick-skinned.

910
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:48,249
That's why she could seduce her friend's husband!

911
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:50,150
My father wouldn't want to see you, either.

912
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,489
Leave and take this with you.

913
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:55,920
Let me go!

914
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:57,459
- Let's go inside. - I should teach her a lesson.

915
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:58,659
Let go of me!

916
00:55:59,159 --> 00:56:01,300
We should tear her apart! How could you just let her go?

917
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:03,698
Ever since she was young, she was conniving...

918
00:56:03,699 --> 00:56:04,899
and then she'd stab you in the back!

919
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,269
That's enough, Mom.

920
00:56:06,369 --> 00:56:08,869
I can't just let her go. Let go of me!

921
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:11,110
Let go of me!

922
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:13,239
Leave!

923
00:56:18,449 --> 00:56:22,179
Did you know that today was your wedding anniversary with Ba Da?

924
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:28,889
How could you make someone so pitiful?

925
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,889
Why didn't you get what we were trying to tell you?

926
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,460
I heard you guys were getting married.

927
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:33,800
Is that true?

928
00:56:36,099 --> 00:56:38,929
Today's my father's memorial. I want to spend it quietly.

929
00:56:39,269 --> 00:56:40,340
I will sign the divorce papers...

930
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:43,710
when the time comes, so leave.

931
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:45,409
Why would you sign it?

932
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:47,079
Who will it benefit?

933
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:48,710
Don't you dare sign them!

934
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,449
You should torture them!

935
00:56:50,909 --> 00:56:52,610
Do you think you'll be happy?

936
00:56:52,849 --> 00:56:54,519
Do you think you'll be happy...

937
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:56,420
after ruining my daughter's life?

938
00:56:57,849 --> 00:57:00,590
Ba Da's father's watching you!

939
00:57:01,059 --> 00:57:02,659
You evil jerks!

940
00:57:02,789 --> 00:57:06,289
I can't let them go like this. Let go of me!

941
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:11,429
Let go. This is so unfair, Ba Da.

942
00:57:12,469 --> 00:57:15,269
This is so unfair, Ba Da!

943
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,269
Let go of me.

944
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:26,579
Let's start, Mom.

945
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:35,920
Yes?

946
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:38,159
Yes.

947
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,630
You caught Na Bun Nyeon?

948
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:44,530
Okay. I'll be right there!

949
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:50,769
Mom. I'll be right back.

950
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:53,110
Where are you going?

951
00:58:01,449 --> 00:58:03,219
Na Bun Nyeon ran off to China...

952
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:04,789
and got caught at the airport two days ago.

953
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:06,349
How could you do this to me?

954
00:58:06,619 --> 00:58:08,289
What kind of grudge do you have against me?

955
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:10,159
I can't forgive you.

956
00:58:10,289 --> 00:58:11,460
Hey.

957
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:14,198
You did this to yourself.

958
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:17,230
You ended up like this because you're a know-it-all who meddles.

959
00:58:17,469 --> 00:58:19,169
Is this because you got pushed out of the association...

960
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:20,199
and the home shopping network?

961
00:58:20,469 --> 00:58:21,800
This is theft and fraud.

962
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,138
She was already wanted for fraud...

963
00:58:23,139 --> 00:58:25,639
for cases other than yours.

964
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:27,510
Make sure she gets punished.

965
00:58:29,809 --> 00:58:30,980
Is Cho Eun Kang doing well?

966
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:35,320
Think of it as punishment for making bad friends.

967
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:39,289
What are you saying?

968
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,420
I stole what was yours?

969
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:45,829
Do you think I went to your office?

970
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:49,829
Or that I went through your safe or your computer?

971
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:53,199
I'm not afraid of anything, so I'll tell you everything.

972
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,039
This is all Cho Eun Kang's doing.

973
00:59:00,309 --> 00:59:01,440
There's no way.

974
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:04,210
You want evidence?

975
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,210
This is the original.

976
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:35,840
What was submitted to the department store was a copy.

977
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:38,579
This is yours. Isn't it?

978
00:59:40,679 --> 00:59:42,920
These are the texts I exchanged with her.

979
00:59:43,219 --> 00:59:44,788
(Should I tell your friend that I paid you to help me?)

980
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:46,449
(I understand. I'll send it to you.)

981
00:59:46,489 --> 00:59:48,190
(I told you not to contact me, so why do you keep calling?)

982
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:55,960
These are the phone records.

983
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:57,199
(Cho Eun Kang)

984
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:59,900
Why else would I call her?

985
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:01,899
If I wanted to punish you,

986
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:04,639
all I had to was release something that looked exactly like yours.

987
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:07,380
That's why I paid her.

988
01:00:08,909 --> 01:00:10,880
I can't believe you called her a friend.

989
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:24,389
The video was leaked. What should I do about your school?

990
01:00:27,429 --> 01:00:28,960
Eun Kang. Hey.

991
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:17,780
Honey.

992
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:21,880
Please watch over Ba Da.

993
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:25,449
I have no other wish.

994
01:01:27,289 --> 01:01:30,260
Please resolve Ba Da's sorrow.

995
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:32,989
Our poor Ba Da...

996
01:01:33,829 --> 01:01:36,260
She's living in complete misery right now.

997
01:01:40,469 --> 01:01:41,539
Mom.

998
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:46,340
When I was young, whenever I saw a cockroach,

999
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:50,179
I used to scream and run away. Remember?

1000
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:55,179
You were particularly afraid of cockroaches.

1001
01:01:55,579 --> 01:01:57,519
One day, I was home alone,

1002
01:01:58,789 --> 01:02:00,320
and a cockroach came out.

1003
01:02:02,059 --> 01:02:03,929
It was so gross and scary,

1004
01:02:05,789 --> 01:02:08,059
but I thought it'd be scarier if I didn't kill it.

1005
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:10,800
So...

1006
01:02:14,469 --> 01:02:15,969
I got the roach spray...

1007
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,739
and started spraying it at the cockroach.

1008
01:02:20,809 --> 01:02:23,280
It kept struggling as it ran away,

1009
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:25,980
and it'd start struggling and then run away.

1010
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:28,079
It wouldn't die easily.

1011
01:02:29,449 --> 01:02:30,550
I...

1012
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:33,519
kept following it around and spraying it.

1013
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:38,289
I kept spraying until it was covered in the spray and knocked out.

1014
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:44,000
Once the cockroach died and its wings and feet stopped moving,

1015
01:02:45,869 --> 01:02:47,340
it was smaller than I thought it was.

1016
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:51,639
I grabbed a bunch of tissues...

1017
01:02:52,809 --> 01:02:54,440
and picked up the cockroach.

1018
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:59,949
I squeezed it into pieces with my hands...

1019
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:02,750
and threw it in the toilet and flushed.

1020
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:09,559
I finally felt relief and was proud of myself.

1021
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:14,329
I guess I forgot how to catch cockroaches.

1022
01:03:16,429 --> 01:03:17,570
I remember now.

1023
01:03:25,809 --> 01:03:27,039
You shouldn't...

1024
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:29,340
let go of cockroaches.

1025
01:03:33,179 --> 01:03:34,349
You have to make sure...

1026
01:03:35,179 --> 01:03:36,780
you kill them in the most gruesome way.

1027
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:47,659
Was Mi Poong all right last night?

1028
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:49,900
There was so much thunder and lightning.

1029
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:52,800
I slept with her.

1030
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:55,139
Good job.

1031
01:03:55,739 --> 01:03:58,309
The reason why I asked you to meet me so early in the morning...

1032
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:01,440
was because I wanted to apologize.

1033
01:04:04,679 --> 01:04:06,010
When everything happened,

1034
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:08,179
I felt like I'd go crazy over the anger I felt toward you guys.

1035
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,218
But after some time passed,

1036
01:04:11,219 --> 01:04:12,349
I began to wonder if it was my fault.

1037
01:04:12,889 --> 01:04:15,690
I thought, "What if I had done this? or what if I had done that?"

1038
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:17,730
I thought about every moment,

1039
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:19,960
and it was so painful.

1040
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:23,829
I thought I ended up like this because I was immature and foolish.

1041
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:27,130
I didn't want to admit that it was my mistake,

1042
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,869
so I kept trying to blame other people.

1043
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:33,440
I said all sorts of terrible things out of anger that day.

1044
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:35,539
I take back calling you a cockroach.

1045
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:41,719
I'm sorry for saying you were the worst.

1046
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:43,380
You're not.

1047
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:45,690
Honey.

1048
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:48,059
Thank you for putting up with me for the past seven years.

1049
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:51,389
I made you suffer every time I had trouble with your mother.

1050
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:53,959
And paying off my father's debt...

1051
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,299
and pushing off having a second child...

1052
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:57,300
weren't things I should've decided on my own.

1053
01:04:57,469 --> 01:04:58,699
I'm sorry.

1054
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:00,500
I understand why you were mistaken about Shin Ki Han.

1055
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:02,769
Ki Han's feelings crossed the line a little,

1056
01:05:02,869 --> 01:05:04,139
but he's really just a friend.

1057
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:06,539
It's my fault you were mistaken.

1058
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:09,710
The biggest mistake I made...

1059
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:14,150
was keeping Eun Kang by my side.

1060
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:17,619
I would've been shaken too.

1061
01:05:18,989 --> 01:05:20,420
I understand it.

1062
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:21,659
It's my fault.

1063
01:05:21,719 --> 01:05:23,090
I ignored you,

1064
01:05:23,559 --> 01:05:24,960
and I looked down on Eun Kang.

1065
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:32,630
More than anything, our dear Mi Poong...

1066
01:05:34,199 --> 01:05:37,710
I was so invested in my feelings that I didn't prioritize her.

1067
01:05:38,469 --> 01:05:40,239
I really don't deserve to call myself her mom.

1068
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,710
After living apart from you,

1069
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:46,079
I reflected on myself.

1070
01:05:46,809 --> 01:05:48,919
After my father's business failed,

1071
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,820
and your family was against our marriage,

1072
01:05:51,389 --> 01:05:54,119
you grabbed my hand and said you'd die without me.

1073
01:05:55,289 --> 01:05:58,690
I thought that I should put you on a pedestal for the rest of my life.

1074
01:05:59,659 --> 01:06:01,230
My feelings are so fickle.

1075
01:06:08,269 --> 01:06:11,070
Once something I never imagined happened to me,

1076
01:06:12,369 --> 01:06:14,409
I packed my things and left.

1077
01:06:15,079 --> 01:06:16,539
It wasn't like me.

1078
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:19,178
I should've stopped myself.

1079
01:06:19,179 --> 01:06:20,280
I'm sorry.

1080
01:06:22,519 --> 01:06:24,489
I had so much to say, but I'm all over the place.

1081
01:06:25,019 --> 01:06:26,519
I'll just be honest.

1082
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:30,019
I don't want to lose...

1083
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:32,360
a good man like you.

1084
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:36,059
But it's not like I can pretend it never happened.

1085
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:38,769
I want to be neutral and think about it.

1086
01:06:39,769 --> 01:06:42,339
We need to heal from the wounds we gave each other.

1087
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:43,539
Let's do that.

1088
01:06:43,639 --> 01:06:45,538
Let's not tell the adults,

1089
01:06:45,539 --> 01:06:48,038
and let's keep it between us until we make a decision.

1090
01:06:48,039 --> 01:06:49,210
Do you have any objections?

1091
01:06:51,909 --> 01:06:53,849
Let's meet over the weekend with Mi Poong.

1092
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,219
I'm coming back home from Italy.

1093
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:57,989
Tell Mi Poong that.

1094
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:00,989
I'll call you.

1095
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:38,929
(Text messages, Han Ba Da)

1096
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:43,500
Do you want to go on a trip?

1097
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:48,769
I want to resolve our issues.

1098
01:07:56,039 --> 01:07:58,409
What do you think about going to the beach in Sokcho,

1099
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:00,710
the place we took our first trip together during winter break...

1100
01:08:00,849 --> 01:08:02,449
our freshman year of high school?

1101
01:08:11,389 --> 01:08:13,489
Sounds good. When?

1102
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:17,060
Right now.

1103
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,220
Okay. Let's go.

1104
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:02,739
I rented it.

1105
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:05,649
Let's have fun during our overnight trip.

1106
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:06,949
Seatbelt.

1107
01:09:07,079 --> 01:09:08,220
Right.

1108
01:09:21,329 --> 01:09:23,829
It's too quiet. Let's talk.

1109
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:26,469
What should we talk about?

1110
01:09:26,470 --> 01:09:27,640
Anything.

1111
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:29,569
Can you liven the mood?

1112
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:32,109
How should I liven the mood?

1113
01:09:34,279 --> 01:09:35,380
Ba Da.

1114
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:37,340
I passed.

1115
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:39,349
I heard. Congratulations.

1116
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:42,319
After I found out, I ran to the old office.

1117
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:44,720
I went there inadvertently when I heard the good news.

1118
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,399
Everything is starting to feel like spring.

1119
01:09:59,630 --> 01:10:01,369
The sunshine and wind are different too.

1120
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,170
I think the flowers will start blooming soon.

1121
01:10:06,409 --> 01:10:08,979
Time flies by so fast. Right?

1122
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:11,279
Is it fast for you?

1123
01:10:12,810 --> 01:10:13,850
What?

1124
01:10:14,949 --> 01:10:16,119
What do you want to eat?

1125
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:19,449
Should we get sashimi since we're going to the beach?

1126
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,720
What about cold raw fish soup? I know it's your favourite.

1127
01:10:22,119 --> 01:10:23,489
I'll look up a good restaurant.

1128
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:25,590
When we went on trips together,

1129
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:29,630
we used to laugh and talk as soon as we left.

1130
01:10:32,170 --> 01:10:33,369
I know.

1131
01:10:34,369 --> 01:10:36,000
Do you want me to look up some fun Memes for you?

1132
01:10:36,539 --> 01:10:37,970
Or do you want to listen to music?

1133
01:10:38,109 --> 01:10:39,239
It's fine.

1134
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:40,709
According to the police investigation,

1135
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:42,908
the suspect threw the victim into the ocean...

1136
01:10:42,909 --> 01:10:45,279
and strangled them to death.

1137
01:10:45,649 --> 01:10:47,278
It was revealed that the suspect and victim...

1138
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:50,119
were friends for 30 years.

1139
01:10:50,619 --> 01:10:52,318
The suspect, who was in debt,

1140
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:54,959
lured the victim out by suggesting they go on a trip.

1141
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,629
The suspect put sleeping pills in a drink and drugged the victim...

1142
01:10:58,630 --> 01:10:59,759
and even gave them alcohol.

1143
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,460
The suspect then led the intoxicated victim to the beach...

1144
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:04,329
That's terrible.

1145
01:11:08,369 --> 01:11:10,439
I'm glad we didn't get involved financially.

1146
01:11:10,939 --> 01:11:11,970
Right?

1147
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:13,539
Yes.

1148
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:15,340
Do you want coffee?

1149
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:17,810
Sure.

1150
01:11:17,949 --> 01:11:19,049
The closest rest stop...

1151
01:11:19,050 --> 01:11:20,479
No, check the bag in the back.

1152
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:29,890
I bought us some coffee.

1153
01:11:30,189 --> 01:11:32,789
I asked them to put it in a tumbler, so we can drink it until tomorrow.

1154
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,289
I also bought some snacks.

1155
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:40,399
Why did you bring a knife?

1156
01:11:41,699 --> 01:11:43,600
They don't give you knives at hotels.

1157
01:11:43,699 --> 01:11:44,970
I wanted to eat some apples.

1158
01:11:46,069 --> 01:11:48,180
But you don't eat peeled apples.

1159
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:50,880
We have to cut them.

1160
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:53,350
What are you going to do if you chip a tooth biting into an apple?

1161
01:12:09,229 --> 01:12:11,069
I'm fine. You can have it.

1162
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:16,100
It's good.

1163
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:17,939
They have good coffee.

1164
01:12:19,609 --> 01:12:23,310
The suspect put sleeping pills in a drink and drugged the victim...

1165
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:28,920
Aren't you going to drink it?

1166
01:12:29,949 --> 01:12:31,188
Oh, right.

1167
01:12:31,189 --> 01:12:32,988
I had some coffee before I came out.

1168
01:12:32,989 --> 01:12:34,119
I'll drink some later.

1169
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:37,390
Why? Do you think I drugged it?

1170
01:12:37,829 --> 01:12:39,460
We shouldn't have listened to the news.

1171
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:42,229
- It's nothing like that. - Don't you trust me?

1172
01:12:44,670 --> 01:12:45,829
I do.

1173
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:48,739
Then drink it.

1174
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:50,939
- What? - That coffee...

1175
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:55,479
If you don't trust me, don't drink it.

1176
01:12:57,979 --> 01:12:59,449
If you do, drink it.

1177
01:13:57,100 --> 01:14:01,140
(Red Balloon)

1178
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:03,738
I never meant to make you go under.

1179
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:04,979
Please forgive me just this once.

1180
01:14:05,050 --> 01:14:06,379
We're friends.

1181
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:07,778
- Friends? - Ba Da!

1182
01:14:07,779 --> 01:14:09,350
Go beg the presiding judge.

1183
01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:10,549
I want to divorce him!

1184
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:11,649
Since it ended up like this,

1185
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:13,520
let's go our separate ways.

1186
01:14:15,789 --> 01:14:17,829
Don't tell anyone and come out.

1187
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:24,328
We may have submitted our divorce papers,

1188
01:14:24,329 --> 01:14:25,528
but he's still my man.

1189
01:14:25,529 --> 01:14:27,000
I feel excited for some reason.

1190
01:14:27,899 --> 01:14:29,500
Just like when we first met.
