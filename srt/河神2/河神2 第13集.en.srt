
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,420
Let's come back to our story and continue.



00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,260
[Previously on Tientsin Mystic 2]



00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,660
Previously, we talked about



00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,100
Fu Laiyong solved the crystal palace case.



00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,030
When Xiao Lanlan knew Ding Mao was safe,



00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,700
she left in low spirit.



00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,830
Guo Deyou showed extra care for Gu Ying in his visit.



00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,160
Miss Xiao went to visit Rong Aoshuang to cure her psychological illness.



00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,490
In the governor's mansion,



00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,670
Wu Zuonan gunned down Wang Ziren



00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,650
to deter Ding Mao.



00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,240
Xiao Lanlan and Ding Mao resumed their relationship,



00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,770
more affectionate than ever before.



00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,390
Guo Deyou found out that the toxin in Gu Weiliang's case



00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,020
came from the red leech.



00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,150
The corpse-salvage team organized Guo Deyou's wedding,



00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,550
and made a boisterous scene.



00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,080
In Wang Meiren's visit,



00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,580
Guo Deyou found that Gu Weiliang once visited the Dragon King Temple.



00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,050
Guo Deyou spotted that



00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,570
Master Guo Chun must have been involved in Gu Weiliang's case.



00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,910
Following that there came:



00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,190
Romantic relationships can't overweigh parental love.



00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,950
The Cycle of Six Reincarnation Paths is inevitable to all living things.



00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:05,540
There's no place for the father's soul to rest.



00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,500
Previously, we talked about



00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,060
Jianghu.



00:01:59,220 --> 00:01:59,900
Science.



00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,420
Kung fu.



00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,699
Truth.



00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,020
Nine statues of ox.



00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,420
Two statues of tiger.



00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,100
Father.



00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,060
Uncle Hu.



00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,780
Mom.



00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,660
Master Guo Chun.



00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,380
Diplomat Gu



00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,020
Mr. Zheng…



00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,260
Is always a deputy.



00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,300
Having a birthday party.



00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,340
Don't mess things up.



00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,060
Electrician.



00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,579
Sour fish of Xihu Lake.



00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,060
Marriage.



00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,700
Gift.



00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,420
Master.



00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,900
River God.



00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,900
Tiensin Mystic 2



00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,780
Episode 13



00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,070
A daughter can help, as always.



00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,540
As soon as Miss Xiao came,



00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,660
Secretary General Xiao stopped caring to mind this.



00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,820
You've made up your mind?



00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,579
Yes.



00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,530
Do you still remember that when I was young,



00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,260
I always had the same dream?



00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,990
A sparrow



00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,980
was trapped in an hourglass



00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,860
and about to be buried. Right?



00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,150
Do you still have the same dream now?



00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,320
Sometimes.



00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,160
But now, I've started to believe that



00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,720
the hourglass can be broken.



00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,980
Lanlan,



00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,930
I was so busy that I had so little time for anything else.



00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,590
Now, I finally have some free time.



00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,580
So, I have only one wish.



00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,050
I want to hold



00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,840
a decent birthday party for you.



00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,130
What's the rush?



00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,540
We'll have



00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,350
so many birthdays in the long future,



00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,740
mine, yours, and your grandson-in-law's.



00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,300
It'll cost you a lot.



00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,250
What's the fun chat about?



00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,770
It's just some father-daughter secret chat.



00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,050
Why do you bother to ask?



00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,460
OK.



00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,570
I'll stay there for a little longer.



00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,910
We haven't gotten the fish yet anyway.



00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,000
Ding Mao,



00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,580
we elders can't always be there for you two.



00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,060
So, in the future,



00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,100
take care of each other.



00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,200
Don't worry.



00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,120
Miss Xiao,



00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,720
can you tell me how to use your camera?



00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:25,870
It's such a good day.



00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,150
What a pity it'd be if you don't take a photo!



00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,080
Come on.



00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,810
Closer. Closer. More intimately.



00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,790
Come on. Come on.



00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,570
Three, two, one.



00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,770
Look at the craftsmanship of this phoenix crown.



00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,030
I can't find a better tailor



00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,500
even in Beijing.



00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,580
What's it for wearing such a solemn dress?



00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,940
It's just for the marriage with a corpse-salvager.



00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,220
Whenever I think about



00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,520
your marriage into that seedy temple,



00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,820
I feel frustrated.



00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,000
The Dragon King Temple was just decorated.



00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,600
It looks good now.



00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,159
They just wrapped the crap with gold.



00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,890
It's just a fake appearance.



00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,060
That jerk Guo Deyou…



00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,980
It's said that a mother-in-law always has



00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,580
a growing affection for her son-in-law.



00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,320
But you keep saying



00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,659
corpse-salvager and jerk.



00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,220
Is that the way you show your affection?



00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:03,950
Why would I have affection for him?



00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,140
You think I'm silly?



00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,190
If you don't have affection for him, you have none for me either.



00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,280
Yes, I do!



00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,990
I think it was silly for me to raise you.



00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,390
Well…



00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,920
Let me remind you.



00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,420
Tomorrow, um…



00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,150
Don't alight from the sedan after getting in it.



00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,000
Don't get dust beneath the treads.



00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,560
If his year of birth is of the Chicken or the Pig,



00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,030
do not enter the new matrimonial home.



00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,340
Don't scatter pedals at the end of the bed.



00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:39,090
Stay around the heatable brick bed for three days, and come home on the fourth day.



00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,800
Compared with that silly guy,



00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,170
you're a little smarter.



00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,220
You kept saying that about seven times a day.



00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,430
It's deeply rooted in my ears.



00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,480
What's wrong?



00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,570
My back is itching. Scratch it for me.



00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,360
Just a moment. Just a moment. Let me see.



00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,310
Your hands are so cold!



00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,590
OK! OK!



00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,380
Alright, I'll do it behind your clothes.



00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,940
Up. Move up. Move up a bit.



00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,370
Left. Left. Move left. It's on the left.



00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,360
Yes. It's right there.



00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,630
Look, you just don't want to stay with me.



00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,920
Is your mind all about the marriage now?



00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,250
You little heartless gal.



00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,940
Don't come back here again.



00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,100
No, mom.



00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:34,760
If I don't have enough food in every meal,



00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,490
I still need to come back.



00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,240
When we adopted you,



00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,700
you were even smaller than a pillow.



00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,630
In the blink of an eye, you're getting married.



00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,500
It took me a lot of persuasion to



00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,740
get him up



00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,660
and make you the Sour Fish of Xihu Lake.



00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,580
Secretary General Ding,



00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,360
it's not a decent dinner with only fish.



00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,850
Maybe I should wake up all the cooks to



00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,650
make you a perfect set of three cold dishes and five hot dishes?



00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,400
No need. Fish will do.



00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,490
Thank you.



00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,850
Don't mention that.



00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,390
People in Tianjin all know that



00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,830
you care about the people as if you're their father.



00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,350
The entire commercial chamber is depending on you.



00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,690
From now on, whatever you do,



00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,100
be modest.



00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,450
That's it!



00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,980
You've been repeating this



00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,130
again and again.



00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,800
For how long will you keep saying this?



00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,590
Until I die.



00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:28,890
Why did you come here?



00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,240
You came to hear me nag, didn't you?



00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,520
If you want a quiet place,



00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,870
try to stay here a little longer.



00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,580
OK.



00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,010
I'll stop talking now



00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,100
and leave. OK?



00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,270
What do you want to eat next time? I'll get it for you.



00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,500
Sour Fish of Xihu Lake.



00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,330
Good!



00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:42,930
From Hefeng Restaurant.



00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,430
You're pretty picky.



00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,520
See you.



00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,460
Don't let it get cold.



00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,440
Fine.



00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:56,580
Mr. Guo.



00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,240
Things are all back in place.



00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,520
We're going home now.



00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,190
It's been a busy day. Get some rest.



00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:02,680
-OK.
-Bye, Mr. Guo.



00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,380
Bye, man.



00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,210
-Get some rest.
-Bye.



00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,490
Bye, Mr. Guo.



00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,320
Bye.



00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,690
Master Guo, get some rest.



00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,500
Master…



00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,550
Later, you clear the water,



00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,040
have a shower, and go to bed early.



00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,140
How did Diplomat Gu die?



00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,960
A stable life is better



00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,170
than anything.



00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,960
Are you involved in it?



00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,740
The truth can't be turned fake.



00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,750
And the fake can't be turned true.



00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:11,760
General Director Hu.



00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,120
You two are on duty today?



00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,810
Yes. We exchanged shifts.



00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,560
Here, General Director Hu. Have a cigarette.



00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,030
No, thanks.



00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,820
I'll smoke after the dinner.



00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,110
You're so late…



00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,120
Come on!



00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:52,740
[Cell 110]



00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,470
Come on. Let's get out of here. Come on!



00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:45,760
Master!



00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,480
Master!

Master!



00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:15,450
Recently, in North China, the draught keeps going worse,



00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,050
especially in Tianjin,



00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,290
where the water level of the Haihe River keeps dropping.



00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,100
The bend cut-off project is becoming less effective.



00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:25,050
The fishing and grain transportation industries have been deeply impacted.



00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,710
According to news stories in the city,



00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,760
after the accidental deaths of



00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,190
Master of Yishengmen Gang Cui Fengzhi, and Diplomat Gu Weiliang,

and Former Secretary General of Tianjin Xiao Yan,



00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,060
who avoided a crisis he created by faking death before,



00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,600
also died in an uncanny accident.



00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,930
Cited from the announcement of Tianjin Police Bureau,



00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,220
the rumors that



00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,590
the guardianship of nine statues of ox, two statues of tiger, and one statue of rooster has been breached, that the town is invaded,



00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:52,040
and that the draught demon is going to wreak havoc in Tianjin



00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,240
are only ungrounded gossips, and they are not necessarily related to recent incidents.



00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,760
Anyone who spreads these rumors will be punished.



00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,510
Family descendants,



00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:59,320

00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,870
Bow down.

Stand up.

Come on.



00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,150
Come on. Stand up.

[In memory of Guo Chun]



00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,370
Now, even this place is not safe.



00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,690
Let's leave.



00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,460
He said he liked this place pretty much.



00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,540
I'd like to spend some more time with him.



00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,260
OK.



00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,460
Is our captain going to



00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,060
attend General Director Hu's funeral?



00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,610
General Director Hu died in our prison area.



00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,100
He's going.



00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,450
In a time like this,



00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,240
isn't the grain transport team going to rip him apart?



00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:57,930
Then he shouldn't go.



00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,020
No?



00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,000
Do you know how to be a good friend at all?



00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,140
Then he should go.



00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,860
He can't decide whether to go or not .



00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,680
He's in a dilemma.



00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,570
You guys are having fun chatting.



00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,520
It's been two days. What have you found?



00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,420
You found no clue at all.



00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,890
No one cares about the cases!



00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,430
Laiyong!



00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,690
It's cool at night, and hot at noon.



00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,450
So, first, don't get mad at noon.



00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,880
And, second, timing is important for funerals.



00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,220
If you don't go now, you'll be late.



00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,120
I won't be late.



00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,490
You came at the right time.



00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,280
I was thinking that



00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,200
I can't be going alone.



00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,090
Well,



00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,670
more people, more sincerity,



00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,210
but we should learn to prioritize tasks.



00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,500
If the grain transporters think that



00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,370
we the police are not going all out to investigate the case,



00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,650
won't they get mad?



00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,130
Your subordinates don't need to go.



00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:48,110
But you should go.



00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,870
I'd love to.



00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,400
But in terms of ranks,



00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,190
I'm just a deputy.



00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,110
So, I can't exceed my authority,



00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,880
and in private,



00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,110
Secretary General Ding and I are not so close to a level that



00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,620
I should attend his funeral.



00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,240
So, I'm not suitable to go there in every way.



00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,290
This funeral thing is



00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,720
definitely not related to you.



00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,560
But General Manager Hu had been fine in the prison.



00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,020
But right after your arrival,



00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,680
he died.



00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,310
I'm just worried about



00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,380
the conspiracy theorists.



00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,190
You mean I must show up to prove that



00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,430
I'm not panicking?



00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:28,930
Be open.



00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,150
And be frank.



00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,110
You're going with me?



00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,320
Please.



00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:32,960
Please.



00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,990
After you.



00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,010
After you.



00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,160
After you. Come on. Let's go.



00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,810
Secretary General Ding, why did you come?



00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,670
Has your lumbar injury healed now?



00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,070
Would you like to go to the hospital and have it rechecked?



00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,250
Is the funeral being taken care of?



00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,660
The investigation is done by the police.



00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,190
You just need to take care of yourself.



00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,280
What have you discovered?



00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,700
W-We haven't started yet.



00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,460
Secretary general!



00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,380
Light man, hurry!



00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,180
Uh, the explosion took out the wires,



00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,650
and the electricians are repairing them.



00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,740
How long is it going to take?



00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,340
Maybe you can go home and have a rest.



00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,070
I'll send someone to invite you here once it's done.



00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,050
T-Take care. It's dark.



00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,830
T-T-Take care.



00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,510
Where are you pointing at? Just point it at the ground.



00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:31,930
We have



00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,940
searched the place about ten times



00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,540
but haven't found any gunpowder residual.



00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,220
I have no idea how it went off.



00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:40,460
The ground is flat and even.



00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,540
Burn marks are everywhere.



00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,060
And the explosion residuals landed averagely.



00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,680
Solid explosive blasts usually leave craters.



00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:51,920
You couldn't find gunpowder residual,



00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,900
because it was a gas explosion.



00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:55,950
Gas?



00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,130
What gas is inflammable?



00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,540
Excrement gas.



00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:01,330
A septic tank in my hometown exploded once.



00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,350
It was pretty powerful.



00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,630
Shut up.



00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,360
But gas explosion usually



00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,990
happens in a closed environment.



00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,140
It shouldn't have happened here.



00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,500
It's finally repaired.



00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,060
You're so late…



00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,590
You!



00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,310
If I can't find the murderer,



00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:07,980
I, Tieniu, will go to the spiritual world with you.



00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:11,500
Mr. Guo!



00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,150
Guo Deyou!



00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,730
Drink the farewell wine.



00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,610
Then let's avenge Master Guo Chun.



00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:29,970
You drank the wine



00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,660
and smashed the bowl.



00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,630
Now get out of here.



00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,150
Listen up.



00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,120
If you want to investigate it,



00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,130
go ahead.



00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,860
But whoever does



00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,850
must not enter this Dragon King Temple again.



00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,230
That night,



00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,350
only you were with Master Guo Chun.



00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:31,780
How did he die?



00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,560
You must explain everything to us.



00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,120
Tell us!



00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,520
Well…



00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,240
Let me ask you a question.



00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,370
It's my master who died.



00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,640
What does it have to do with you?



00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,190
No!



00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,620
L-Let go!



00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,090
Before the coffin even leaves the house,



00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:16,910
you descendants started to beat each other.



00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,850
Look how ridiculous you all are!



00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,730
What do you want?



00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,840
Hey,



00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,400
it's time to see the deceased off.



00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:53,260
Lift up the coffin.



00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:00,000
See the deceased off.



00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,640
Fu Laiyong!



00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,330
Slowly.



00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,800
Why am I here?



00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:34,470
You were wounded.



00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,710
The police brought you here.



00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,610
The police?



00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,510
Are you still dizzy?



00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,450
Do you feel you want to throw up?



00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,310
Your wound isn't big,



00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,720
but you need to rest quietly.



00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,250
I'm fine.



00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:48,030
I haven't seen my parents since I was young.



00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:53,600
But that doesn't mean I have no parents.



00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,720
To me,



00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,060
the sorceress who looks so odd and unhinged is my mom,



00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,790
and Uncle Guo is my dad.



00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,690
When Gu Weiliang died,



00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:23,490
even though someone told me with total confidence that



00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,690
he was my dad,



00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,590
I felt nothing.



00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,390
But…



00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,130
But not until the moment Uncle Guo died



00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,410
did I realize what it feels like to lose a father.



00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,440
Tieniu beat you today,



00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:20,470
because you didn't take Uncle Guo as your dad.



00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,210
In fact,



00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,860
I also don't understand why you are doing so.



00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,700
Whatever needs clearing



00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,370
has been cleared in his room.



00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,630
The repairmen



00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,520
will take care of the rest.



00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,180
I'm leaving.



00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:26,930
I'll listen to you.



00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,660
Let's quit investigating



00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,520
and live firmly in the Dragon King Temple.



00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,430
We'll have a stable life.



00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:35,610
During all this time,



00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,530
there's been no one who can keep you warm in your bed.



00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,070
Of course I can't get you a wife.



00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,920
But as I'm getting married,



00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,550
let me give you this big heatable brick bed.



00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,960
My original bamboo bed was pretty good.



00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,120
Why did you make me a heatable brick bed?



00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,650
It has a large heat chamber,



00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,639
and can warm your lower back which is so susceptible to the cold.



00:34:56,949 --> 00:34:58,520
You've got some appetite.



00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,380
You want some gift



00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,680
in return?



00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,900
Come on.



00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,230
Why would I want a gift in return?



00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,570
Am I such a miser?



00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:11,900
But,



00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,330
if you don't feel all right without returning a gift,



00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,480
I won't refuse it.



00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,700
I will accept any gift.



00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:21,050
Then I'll give you a plaque.



00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,630
What will it say?



00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,470
The craftiest man of Tianjin!



00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,200
Sure!



00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:30,500
Then I'll put it above your bed,



00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,850
so that it'll be the first thing you'll see



00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:32,810
every morning.



00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:37,990
Oh boy!



00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:30,300
If you want to investigate it, just leave us an instruction.



00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,140
Us…



00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,080
You don't look up to us much.



00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,460
You see. You've been wounded,



00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,870
but you don't have a good rest.



00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:42,140
I know. I can't dissuade you from it.



00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,370
The electrician has slipped away in the dark.



00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:47,040
We have sent men to…



00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,790
Yes, yes, it's all our fault.



00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,330
It's all our fault.



00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:55,810
Secretary General Ding.



00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,330
I'll just shut up.



00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:03,200
Clamp.



00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,080
Tool!



00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,040
T-Tool!



00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,190
Clamp. Come on.



00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:09,400
Hurry.



00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,450
Joule thief!



00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:28,270
You see? You see?



00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,640
I knew that electrician was a thief.



00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,350
Have the circuits been repaired lately?



00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:37,550
A few days ago,



00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,600
the lightbulbs in General Manager Hu's office broke as soon as they were installed.



00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,200
They tried new ones, but they kept breaking.



00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,160
So, they had an electrician to repair it.



00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:45,550
Bring me all the circuit diagrams of this prison area.



00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:46,890
Then find out



00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,750
which power plant is supplying electricity.



00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:49,900
OK.



00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,250
I want details.



00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,890
Why are you standing here? Get down to it.



00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:55,040
Go go go. Do it.



00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,460
What are you doing?



00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,120
Wh-What was stolen?



00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,330
Mr. Guo Chun.



00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,130
We need to make a hot one.



00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:58,970
It's better to be as hot as an alchemy stove.



00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,890
Do you hate Master or what?



00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:02,340
You want to burn Master to practice alchemy?
