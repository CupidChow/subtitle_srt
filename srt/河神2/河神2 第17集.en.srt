00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,140
Let's come back to our story and continue.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,260
[Previously on Tientsin Mystic 2]

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,260
Previously, we talked about

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,880
the two investigate separately

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,260
following the clues left by Tie Niu.

7
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,980
Guo Deyou, Gu Ying and Xiao Lanlan confirmed

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,600
that Tie Niu's clues are related to the First Freezer.

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,460
Yusi overpowered the First Freezer staff member surnamed Zhao.

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,220
It confirmed that Zhao was directly implicated in the death of Tie Niu.

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,510
Guo Ding went to First Freezer to question the director.

12
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,340
The director of the First Freezer made a false claim that Tie Niu had stolen something.

13
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,050
The staff accidentally killed him.

14
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,780
The director caught Guo Ding off guard,

15
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,020
locked the two inside the freezer.

16
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,780
Captain Fu rescued Guo Deyou and Ding Mao.

17
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,820
They learned that the First Freezer Director had died.

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,100
That's another ox cases.

19
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,260
Ding Mao decided to stay in Tianjin to save the situation

20
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,060
and persuaded the senior members of Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce

21
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,020
to tide over the difficulties together.

22
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,220
Ding Mao, Xiao Lanlan and Guo Deyou

23
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,060
found the remaining clues separately.

24
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,180
The three came to a conclusion

25
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,540
that Gu Weiliang's death

26
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,379
should be done by three old men.

27
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,460
The three of them were members of the Gutenberg Institute.

28
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,740
Gu Ying overheard it and retreated quietly.

29
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,230
This led to...

30
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,180
The Mogudao virus is on the rise again. Simian is dead.

31
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,180
Xiao Lanlan ended up in the refugee camp,

32
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:20,220
Gu was investigating the past according to the pattern.

33
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,300
Jianghu.

34
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,020
Science.

35
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,620
Kung fu.

36
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,340
Truth.

37
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,500
Nine statues of ox.

38
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:48,620
Two statues of tiger.

39
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,220
One statue of rooster.

40
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,860
Nature father.

41
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,140
Fan Junyao.

42
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,220
The young river god.

43
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,940
Mr. Li.

44
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,940
The person born with water nature.

45
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,380
the red leech poison.

46
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,420
The ox hoof island.

47
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,300
This is my fault.

48
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,260
Father.

49
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,260
Mogudao.

50
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,380
It's rare to see.

51
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,660
...the murderer...

52
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,620
...quit looking...

53
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:39,940
Ying...

54
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,540
River god.

55
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,540
River god.

56
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,700
River god.

57
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,740
River god.

58
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,620
Tientsin Mystic 2

59
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,579
Episode 17

60
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,180
Look at the lotus pattern,

61
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,780
only a master who is proficient in Chinese seal cutting

62
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,980
can make it.

63
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,500
So it looks like

64
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,340
an imported object,

65
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,900
but it's actually local.

66
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,880
It is neither imported nor made locally.

67
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,320
You deserve the fame as a famous stamp collector.

68
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,240
If you want any information of stamps,

69
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,300
you have to ask Mr. Lu.

70
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,740
This isn't a stamp.

71
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,020
Why?

72
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,380
Stamps are for leisure or collection or appreciation.

73
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,740
A man can have a thousand stamps.

74
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,760
They have different uses and their own niceties.

75
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:53,820
But one man

76
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,159
can only have one symbol.

77
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,700
A family emblem, a sect, or a religion...

78
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,300
It could be any of them.

79
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,540
But the imperial seal

80
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,740
only belongs to the emperor.

81
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,100
Ordinary people dare not carve it.

82
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,500
So the object you have

83
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,620
should be the symbol of some foreign gang.

84
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,260
Do you know this foreign gang well?

85
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,500
Nope.

86
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,740
The jade pendant and the symbol

87
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,700
belonged to my late father.

88
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,140
You can keep the jade pendant.

89
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,060
Can you tell me

90
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,900
what is the origin of this symbol?

91
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:03,900
What?

92
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,380
Okay.

93
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,500
Have you seen it before?

94
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,140
Tell it early, silly.

95
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,900
The refugee camp.

96
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,940
The camp is full of heavy smokers, disabled and seriously ill

97
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,940
and the desperate.

98
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,620
Stepping into the refugee camp

99
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,180
is like stepping into the hall of death.

100
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:29,660
But frankly speaking,

101
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,900
they are all miserable people,

102
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,180
nothing to be afraid of.

103
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,580
If I want to check things out in the black market,

104
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,380
I can only ask you for help.

105
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,500
Do not be so polite, Ms Xiao.

106
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:42,700
I'm not helping you.

107
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,180
I also want to

108
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:45,340
find out about Gutenberg.

109
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,420
What are you doing?

110
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,700
A person born with the water nature

111
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,420
can command the water,

112
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,060
who can condense water together

113
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,980
to put out the fire of the gods.

114
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,060
It's rare to see them.

115
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,500
It's rare to see a lady of this nature.

116
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,060
We came to inquire about something.

117
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,780
Offering his left hand is asking for money. Offering the right hand means paying you.

118
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,740
Give him money.

119
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,020
All things fall into vain.

120
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,820
You can't see through it until you're old.

121
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,020
It's only karma.

122
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,140
The old River God, Guo Chun,

123
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:27,060
Ding Yiqiu and Hu Haijiang from Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce,

124
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,900
and the Secretary General Xiao Yan.

125
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:36,140
They were the initiators of introducing Gutenberg into Tianjin.

126
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,660
Under the guise of spreading civilization,

127
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,260
Gutenberg's agents in China

128
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,820
penetrated all walks of life.

129
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,660
Twenty years ago,

130
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,660
the Mogudao virus spread.

131
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,580
The virus became a pandemic beyond control.

132
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,300
The Gutenberg Association was like timely rain,

133
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,740
bringing with it medicine and science technology

134
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,500
into China.

135
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,860
Their medicine and technology controlled the virus.

136
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,500
But none of them noticed

137
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,500
that the Gutenberg Association's ambition was

138
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,620
to control the Chinese people

139
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,300
through medical technology.

140
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,660
They were like the virus that sickens the country,

141
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,140
and the more control it has,

142
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,940
the harder it is to cure.

143
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,460
Ten years ago,

144
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,020
the Gutenberg Association disappeared.

145
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,420
This was a carefully planned preparation.

146
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,620
They should have been planning something bigger.

147
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,100
Three old men.

148
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,540
One has been in jail.

149
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,980
One faked his own death to escape.

150
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,620
One has been hiding in a ruined temple.

151
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,420
They killed a diplomat.

152
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,300
They even used pigeons to pass messages.

153
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,020
The pigeons kept arriving and wouldn't leave

154
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,020
after the master's death.

155
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,620
I found their correspondence

156
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,540
in the woodshed of the Dragon King Temple

157
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,180
as expected.

158
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,260
Gu Weiliang arrived in Tianjin

159
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,500
on the pretext of getting married,

160
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,580
He's actually reorganizing Gutenberg's people in China,

161
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,260
trying to make a comeback.

162
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,340
They are trying to screw China.

163
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,020
In the past we have committed sins

164
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,620
of inviting a Wolf into our house,

165
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,260
and now we shall be punished.

166
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,500
Gu Weiliang must have been

167
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,340
one of Gutenberg's most important agents.

168
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,140
They killed Gu,

169
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,180
in part, to stop Gutenberg's plot

170
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,340
to enter Tianjin,

171
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,540
On the other hand,

172
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,420
because they wanted to make up for the mistakes of the past.

173
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,060
Gu Weiliang is the fire ox.

174
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,300
He was one of the nine oxen.

175
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,500
Did they plan the nine ox statues cases?

176
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,500
No.

177
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,660
They belonged to the nine oxen in the first place.

178
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,700
The Ox Constellation.

179
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,500
And after the Ox Constellation,

180
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,940
the nine ox statues cases continue.

181
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,100
It looks like

182
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,940
they were used by the real killer,

183
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,340
and also became a link in the nine ox statues cases.

184
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,140
Lanlan is much more behaved

185
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,060
these days.

186
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,420
Things have changed before.

187
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,140
I'm afraid our lives will be in danger.

188
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,620
But even if we die,

189
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,460
I believe we will make

190
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,780
the same decision.

191
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,460
We don't want to be a sinners

192
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,980
in our children's eyes.

193
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:49,940
So it seems

194
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,540
there is only one clue left

195
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,460
in the nine ox statues cases.

196
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,860
This is the deposit record

197
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,660
locked in the safe by Director Zhao.

198
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,860
The time of inputting money on the account book

199
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,380
is the time that the black door trades

200
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,740
on entering goods record.

201
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,460
The Director of the First Freezer

202
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,580
must be doing some business on the sly.

203
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,740
Time checked.

204
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,380
But I don't understand these foreign language letters.

205
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,900
These letters are the names of ships.

206
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,500
And these numbers represent time.

207
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,500
The account book of transporting chamber of Commerce

208
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,980
is also recorded in this way.

209
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,380
I've been reading them every day.

210
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:35,660
Look at these goods.

211
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:36,820
They have already left the port.

212
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,180
But there is no record of entries.

213
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,020
The ship should still be at the dock.

214
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,100
Put it here.

215
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:55,940
Guo Deyou.

216
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,140
Guo Deyou.

217
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,780
Put it down.

218
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,580
What are you doing?

219
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:01,820
Off you go.

220
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,820
What the hell are you doing?

221
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,340
what's inside?

222
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,540
Don't offend the Dragon King.

223
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,780
This is a batch of goods

224
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,460
that the Director of the First Freezer has not been put into storage yet.

225
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,260
I found out that the string of characters in the ledger

226
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,860
was a sea freight number.

227
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,820
I sent Yu Si to the dock.

228
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,900
They were actually found

229
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,260
in the unloading bay of an ocean-going ship.

230
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,020
Such a small box is worth so much money.

231
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,060
Is it gold in it?

232
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,540
There is a dozen more boxes.

233
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,700
They're all parked at the dock.

234
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,260
I was confused when I opened it.

235
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,020
There is nothing special about it.

236
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,100
Don't you know things in the water best?

237
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,380
So I'll bring you a box.

238
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,500
Isn't this just normal dry food?

239
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,620
What's so special about it?

240
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,540
Are you sure you're on the right track?

241
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,940
The numbers are all matched.

242
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,339
There is a hidden box.

243
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,380
Is this the red leech raised by Bai Sihu?

244
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,780
I don't know. It looks like it.

245
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,740
It should be.

246
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,980
Watch your feet.

247
00:17:58,990 --> 00:17:59,820
Are there any more of them?

248
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:01,260
No more.

249
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,700
Don't move.

250
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,340
Don't move.

251
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,460
The tattoo paint used to

252
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,140
the girl jumped off the building and Gu Ying

253
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,620
was all extracted from it.

254
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,540
It's poison.

255
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,260
Don't. Don't do it.

256
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,020
Its mouthparts will stay in the skin.

257
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,060
It's easy to get infected.

258
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:36,820
So what do we do?

259
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,740
Salt, salt.

260
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,660
It is in the kitchen.

261
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,180
The kitchen.

262
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,260
Don't pull it out.

263
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,300
Guo Deyou.

264
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:07,660
Fan Junyao.

265
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,220
Why are you in such a hurry?

266
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,860
Did you find evidence to arrest me?

267
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,540
Guo Deyou was bitten by a red leech.

268
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,660
I need you to come with me to the hospital.

269
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,700
This is a doctor's job.

270
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,140
As a chemistry man,

271
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,460
I'll be suspected if I meddle.

272
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,380
He is being planted by the poison of red leeches.

273
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,700
No hospital in Tianjin has had such a case.

274
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,100
What can those doctors do?

275
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:46,420
Okay.

276
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,100
It's okay if you don't want to go.

277
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,620
Give me the red leeches poison,

278
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,620
I'll give it to the German experts to figure it out.

279
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,140
Do you hear me?

280
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,180
The young river god would be dead for at least a week

281
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,500
when those experts figure it out.

282
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,540
How do I mix the antidote

283
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,220
if I don't have all these chemicals ready?

284
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:17,700
Let's go.

285
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:34,540
Indeed.

286
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,380
This is the same poison

287
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,220
I have seen in the Enlightenment Academy.

288
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,460
I looked into it later.

289
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,100
It lives in the rain forests of South America.

290
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,580
This creature

291
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,580
is not found at all in the country.

292
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,700
Nothing serious.

293
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,420
He doesn't need an antidote.

294
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,260
Sleep for four or five days and he will wake up.

295
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,420
Listen.

296
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,660
Bitten by this creature,

297
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,100
and poison with a pigment purified of that toxin,

298
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,740
are completely different.

299
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,940
I'm going to give him a quick fix.

300
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,580
You don't have to worry too much.

301
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,660
Done.

302
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,180
That's it?

303
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,380
Basic chemical knowledge of

304
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,900
neutralizing alkaloids in acidic solution.

305
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:08,580
The doctors

306
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,020
couldn't cure him.

307
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,420
You just disinfect him.

308
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:13,900
Will he be all right?

309
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,340
What do you think I should do?

310
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,740
Cut it open?

311
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,340
What are you doing here?

312
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:30,940
Wait.

313
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,500
Depending on the amount of toxins in your blood,

314
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,900
you'll need at least four or five more days of sleep.

315
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,500
Come on, let me see what's going on.

316
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:37,900
- What are you going to do? -Let me have a look.

317
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,140
Go away.

318
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,540
Where is the red leech that bit me? Did it run away?

319
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:45,900
They were all disposed of.

320
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,660
Alright.

321
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,460
Now that you're awake, it's all right.

322
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:51,860
Then I'd better go.

323
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:02,980
Well done.

324
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,900
You are welcome.

325
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,620
Maybe I have

326
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,060
some special purposes.

327
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:17,660
Secretary Ding,

328
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,260
maybe you should check it out again.

329
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,460
No strenuous exercise is allowed.

330
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,260
You need a good rest to recover.

331
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,060
What's wrong with you guys?

332
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,340
What's going on?

333
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,620
Nothing.

334
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,820
By the way,

335
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,980
Someone used the First Freezer's Director

336
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,700
and transported red leeches from South America.

337
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,380
In every previous case,

338
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,900
this neuro-purified toxin

339
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,700
has been mentioned.

340
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:54,220
So the person who bought the leeches

341
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:56,260
should be the one who planned the nine ox statues cases.

342
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:02,540
They took so much effort to move leeches across the ocean.

343
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,460
What is their purpose?

344
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,580
The man who planned the nine ox statues cases

345
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,740
will go to the dock

346
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,820
and take all the remaining red leeches.

347
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,900
It's easy.

348
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,020
We can lure him with the red leeches.

349
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,940
He will take the bait.

350
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,460
It sounds nice.

351
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,140
Gu Ying is meeting the midwife today.

352
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,020
Miss.

353
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,660
Did you ask someone about birth records the other day?

354
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,500
Birth records?

355
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,860
What kind of birth records?

356
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,580
I've been a midwife all my life.

357
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,500
I've seen a lot of people who come to ask me about their origins.

358
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,620
There were only two kinds of answers.

359
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,100
Some want a yes

360
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,580
and some want a no.

361
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,140
But that's not

362
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,460
what you want.

363
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,260
You want something else.

364
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,380
I'll keep the door open for you.

365
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:56,660
The birth records are on the table.

366
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,540
Come in and check it out if you really want to.

367
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,820
If you're sure you don't want to know, then leave it.

368
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,660
I'll lock the door.

369
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,540
And I won't open it even if you come later.

370
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,500
She said she found the midwife,

371
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,460
and went out.

372
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,860
We couldn't stop her.

373
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,420
I haven't seen her yet.

374
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:34,860
Maybe she saw the results

375
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,460
she shouldn't have known,

376
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,860
and couldn't get over it.

377
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,620
Come on, you've been walking back and forth all night.

378
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:48,460
Don't you feel dizzy?

379
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:50,380
It's getting late.

380
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:51,860
Aren't you going out to look for her?

381
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,300
Who are you looking for?

382
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,580
Let me help you.

383
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,900
Girl, you're back.

384
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,260
Mother, it's so late,

385
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,300
Why do you come to the Dragon King Temple?

386
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,860
I should ask you the same question.

387
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,500
Horses need food at night.

388
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,980
And so do us.

389
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,940
Well. Girl.

390
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,940
He is sure to eat up

391
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,580
the supper you bought.

392
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,380
Does that mean you won't eat it?

393
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,220
Then you can leave.

394
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,700
I...

395
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,980
Does Guo have any more wine?

396
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,500
He does. But he has to keep his wine.

397
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,420
Come on.

398
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,940
You won't find it.

399
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:53,740
Have you seen the midwife?

400
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:56,500
I have.

401
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,140
Then,

402
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,660
have you seen the birth records?

403
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,020
There were two kinds of people who wanted to check the birth records.

404
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,220
Some want a yes.

405
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,460
And some want a no.

406
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,060
But I don't want either of them.

407
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,060
Whatever the outcome, it doesn't matter to me.

408
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:25,940
There are only three people I care about.

409
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,700
Uncle Guo, my mother,

410
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,260
and you.

411
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,780
Now only you two are still alive.

412
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,940
I have to be nicer to you guys.

413
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,860
Did you see it or not?

414
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,620
Since the outcome doesn't matter,

415
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,820
what else am I afraid of?

416
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,780
Of course I've checked it out.

417
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,500
So are you...?

418
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,420
Stop dreaming, brother.

419
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,700
How could I be

420
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:19,980
so blessed to be

421
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,380
the daughter of a diplomat?

422
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,300
What do you dream about?

423
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,340
Do you want to climb a social ladder?

424
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:27,860
Of course not.

425
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,620
Well,

426
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:32,460
Since you have figured it out, we will be at ease.

427
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,820
From now on,

428
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,740
accept your fate.

429
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:38,420
Let's eat it.

430
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,260
Eat.

431
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,100
Help yourself.

432
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,460
The elders say,

433
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,660
You can tell by your appearance

434
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,700
whether you are rich or not.

435
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,820
You do look like

436
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,820
a rich lady.

437
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,300
You almost fooled me.

438
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,820
Look at my temperament and figure.

439
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,340
Don't I look like a diplomat's daughter?

440
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,900
I've told you already.

441
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,980
You've been thinking too much.

442
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:13,100
Now,

443
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,700
they've figured it out.

444
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,700
I'll have a pitcher of your wine.

445
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,820
Don't grudge it.

446
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,420
Drink it.

447
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,780
Drink it out.

448
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:34,540
Don't worry, we're all fine.

449
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:36,740
We're all fine.

450
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:39,860
Good.

451
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,820
That's good.

452
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,500
Brother, it is delicious.

453
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,660
Come on, let me feed you.

454
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,460
You eat it.

455
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:41,540
I found out that

456
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:44,340
The old river god Xiao Yan,

457
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,060
and Director Hu of the transportating chamber of commerce

458
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,180
were responsible for the spontaneous combustion case.

459
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,020
This case was one of the nine ox statues cases.

460
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,220
So,

461
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,100
These three old men were behind the nine ox statues cases.

462
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,740
They were the thorn in your heart.

463
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,940
I had not forgotten your orders.

464
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:02,980
You wanted me to find out who did the nine ox statues cases, and killed them.

465
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:07,020
So, you've killed them.

466
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,420
Since you took office,

467
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:10,900
there have been many strange cases.

468
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,660
The nine ox statues case, the two tiger statues case and the rooster statue case.

469
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,700
Obviously, they were going to mess up Tianjin.

470
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,020
I am eager to make contributions.

471
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:21,740
I didn't expect to pull out the ox constellation.

472
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,820
How did you know

473
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,180
these three are behind the spontaneous combustion case?

474
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:32,660
And how did you get the ox constellation out?

475
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:37,020
I've believed the groundless allegations I heard and caused great trouble.

476
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:38,940
It's too late to regret.

477
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,220
Where did the gossip come from?

478
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,420
According to you,

479
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:57,460
these three old men killed Gu Weiliang.

480
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,260
I have proof.

481
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,220
As long as Captain Zheng is willing to cooperate,

482
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,300
it would not be difficult to get rid of these three.

483
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,940
It will settle the general's worries,

484
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,940
Captain Zheng, that's a big achievement.

485
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,300
Why are you helping me?

486
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:17,219
Those three people together

487
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,820
wiped out Mogudao.

488
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:21,699
It took us twenty years

489
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:23,100
to rise again.

490
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:27,900
Now it has fallen apart.

491
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,739
I want them

492
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,860
to be buried with Mogudao.

493
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:36,380
Why should I believe you?

494
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,020
Our master Lian Huaqing

495
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,940
is still alive.

496
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,820
As long as Captain Zheng agrees to cooperate,

497
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:51,260
you can take away his belongings,

498
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,179
find a fall guy,

499
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,699
you can take the credit of eradicating the remaining evils.

500
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,260
The decision is yours.

501
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,420
What are the terms of cooperation?

502
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,740
The woman had a plan,

503
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,980
and there were only three things I needed to work with.

504
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,180
First,

505
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:21,940
arrange an electrician in prison.

506
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,980
The new guy is in charge of electricity.

507
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,860
Second,

508
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,100
Get to control a person around Xiao Yan.

509
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,700
Captain,

510
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,540
I don't have any guts.

511
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:40,980
Go.

512
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,180
Dad.

513
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,300
Captain, please leave my daughter alone.

514
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:49,620
I will listen to you.

515
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,820
Have a nice birthday party

516
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,900
for Miss Xiao.

517
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,220
Third,

518
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,460
The magnesium powder used in the longwang temple bombing

519
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,020
is hard to get.

520
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,500
You're the one who got it.

521
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:12,660
Yes.

522
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,900
In this case,

523
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,380
the woman who gave you the news,

524
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,700
is the black hand behind the nine ox statues case.

525
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,860
You are being tricked by the evil person.

526
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,900
And you

527
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,220
are absolutely faithful.

528
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:30,580
You see every detail.

529
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,940
And where is the woman?

530
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,820
I was careless and lost her.

531
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:54,500
Hu Haijiang and Ding Mao are as intimate as a father and his son.

532
00:36:55,990 --> 00:37:00,140
If he tracks you down

533
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,420
and you happen to reveal that

534
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:05,620
I was the person who ordered you

535
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,700
to kill those who are ever behind the spontaneous combustion case,

536
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,100
aka those three old men.

537
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,100
Then, I will become

538
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:18,900
the man who killed Ding Mao's father.

539
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,260
Everyone involved with the three frozen corpses

540
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:22,140
has been disposed of.

541
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,860
I promise you, there will be no trail left behind.

542
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:26,660
The Director of the First Freezer

543
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,700
has been identified as the killer behind the scenes.

544
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:29,900
The others are dead.

545
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,460
Ding Mao couldn't find

546
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,860
any more leads.

547
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,540
You're only saying it now

548
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,540
because you took care of it.

549
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:40,460
Now you dare to tell me.

550
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:43,780
I made a big mistake. Punish me as you like.

551
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,580
Thank you

552
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,380
for sparing my life.

553
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,300
Get things

554
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,020
done clean.

555
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:45,820
Yes, sir.

556
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:59,100
Write to the young Lord and you will be rewarded.

557
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:06,700
If you persist in not telling the truth,

558
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:09,660
Immediately,

559
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:15,860
I will order your death.

560
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,140
Are you sure?

561
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,820
You smell this.

562
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,100
Then smell the aquatic box that Ding Mao carried over.

563
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,060
Is it the same smell?

564
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,420
It really smells like the same medicine.

565
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,340
If you carry medicated fragrant wood,

566
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,260
neither flies nor mosquitoes will bite you.

567
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,060
Isn't this a mahogany sword?

568
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,740
The medicated fragrant wood isn't a wood seed,

569
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,180
it is a kind of craft.

570
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:03,540
All wood can be made into medicinal wood.

571
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,420
The wood is carved, soaked and smoked.

572
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,900
It's complicated.

573
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:12,500
Do you have this skill?

574
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,900
It was my mother

575
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,780
who took a peachwood stick,

576
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,260
and asked Mr. Li to make it.

577
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,260
Mr. Li?

578
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,540
Is he the Mr. Li

579
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,300
who held the ceremony?

580
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,860
It's Li Fengcheng.

581
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:32,580
I look for turtles every year,

582
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,620
but I haven't really asked

583
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:35,340
how this ceremony was handed down.

584
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:41,300
Does your mother know Mr. Li well?

585
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,460
Mr. Li

586
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,660
used to be a dandy in Shanxi.

587
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,860
No one dared meddle with him.

588
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,420
I don't know if it was karma.

589
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:56,260
His younger son died of a sudden illness.

590
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,860
His wife committed suicide by drowning herself in a river.

591
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,340
After that,

592
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,660
he seemed to be a different person.

593
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:04,580
He began to concentrate on praying for Buddha and helping the poor.

594
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:07,060
He also worshipped the old monk as a teacher

595
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,100
and went to the mountain

596
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,780
and learned the art of making drums.

597
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,420
Then,

598
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:13,140
he began to travel.

599
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,140
When he got to Tianjin,

600
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:17,900
he found that people in Tianjin live by the river.

601
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,100
We revere the river.

602
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,460
He was particularly touched

603
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:21,660
and decided to stay.

604
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,220
He thought of holding an annual ceremony on the River.

605
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,460
He made all the drums

606
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:27,620
on the dock.

607
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,020
When it was played,

608
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,420
the noise shook the mountains and rivers.

609
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,180
You can hear it in the river.

610
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:37,700
It turned out that Mr Li was not a carpenter

611
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,180
but a drum maker.

612
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:42,380
Drums are no ordinary craft.

613
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:48,740
He needs to make wooden drums and paint them red,

614
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,700
covered it with leather, then nail in brass.

615
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,100
After a set of procedures,

616
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,500
he can learn woodworking, leather craft, paint and metal craft,

617
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,900
and even

618
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:56,980
playing in a band.

619
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,060
What's that got to do with the medicated fragrant wood?

620
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:03,500
Those big drums are only used once a year.

621
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,940
When stored, it is hard to avoid being eaten by moths.

622
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,940
Mr. Li put in a lot of efforts

623
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,180
into the wood craft.

624
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,900
In his eyes,

625
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,340
whether the wood is expensive or not

626
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:16,420
as long as it can be made into medicated fragrant wood,

627
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,980
It's good wood.

628
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,580
Come on, don't fool me,

629
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,660
I know Mr. Li

630
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,100
was buried in the Hai river.

631
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,180
Where does this medicated fragrant wood come from?

632
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,940
Are they hereditary?

633
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:28,620
Can't he have an apprentice?

634
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:31,940
Li Fengcheng's apprentices

635
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:33,340
inherited his skills

636
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:34,820
and spread all over all walks of life.

637
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,300
Were there any carpenters among them?

638
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:37,940
Of course there is.

639
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:40,820
The most loyal, filial and hardworking Huang Chengzhong,

640
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,180
inherited his craft as a carpenter.

641
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:47,100
But it is said that he is now a coffin maker.

642
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:50,380
The medicated fragrant wood became a medicated fragrant coffin.

643
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,420
A coffin maker?

644
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,020
That's close.

645
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:59,380
It doesn't take much to make an aquatic box.

646
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,660
Why are you asking so much?

647
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:06,660
Now I just need to know who made this box,

648
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,900
I'll find the murderer of nine oxen.

649
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,940
How many oxen are there now?

650
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:18,820
Crazy Cui, Gu Weiliang,

651
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:21,140
ox constellation, Tie Niu,

652
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:22,980
The First Freezer Director.

653
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:28,140
What about those in the Enlightenment Academy?

654
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,940
Bai Sihu, Chen Siru,

655
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,500
and the girl who jumped off the building,

656
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:34,340
None of them had anything to do with the ox.

657
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:35,420
How can you explain that?

658
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:39,140
The ox hoof island.

659
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:44,460
In Tianjin,

660
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:47,540
there's a desert island

661
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:51,900
with the shape of a huge ox hoof.

662
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:53,940
Foreigners took a fancy to it,

663
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,100
but they disapproved of the name

664
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:58,420
and changed it.

665
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:02,700
They built a school on it.

666
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:04,860
What kind of school?

667
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,980
You went to school there.

668
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:11,340
Qi Zhi?

669
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,660
The ox hoof island.

670
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:22,460
The Enlightenment Academy represents an ox.

671
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:25,180
Add in the rest and you have six oxen.

672
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:27,740
I thought the clues of

673
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,780
nine ox statueswere all gone,

674
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,580
I didn't expect you to find one.

675
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,260
Three more oxen will die.
