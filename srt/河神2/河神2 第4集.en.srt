
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]



00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,980
[Previously on Tientsin Mystic 2]



00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,000
Xiao Lanlan opened a newspaper office,



00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,640
and her cousin Fan Junyao helped her a lot.



00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,960
They're deeply attached to each other.



00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,520
Guo Deyou and Gu Ying found out the secret of the golden pot



00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,550
and they sneaked into Thousand Treasure House at night to search for clues.



00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,710
Ding Mao followed up the clue



00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,950
and investigated the residence of Mrs. Wang.



00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,870
Therapist Rong Aoshuang treated Ding Mao.



00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,470
Suffering from memory disorder,



00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,840
Ding Mao can't tell the true from the false.



00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,230
The Jinlan Times was set up,



00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,600
and Fan Junyao intended to save the country with industry.



00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,200
The three-day period expired,



00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,360
and Yishengmen Gang came to kill Ding Mao.



00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,240
Ding Mao admitted defeat for bet and lay in the coffin himself.



00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,630
At that time,



00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,200
Guo Deyou and Gu Ying saved him



00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,110
by telling everyone that



00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,590
Mrs. Cui had admitted her guilt.



00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,360
Ding Mao rushed to the police station to interrogate the murderer,



00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,470
thus leading to



00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,680
Miaotai Garden locking up parted lovers,



00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,840
an ill-fated beauty obsessed with the play "Lovers' Joint Burial Tomb",



00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,200
the bronze ox implying a deeper meaning,



00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,840
the bitter water burying the pond fish,



00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,080
and the diplomatist arriving in Tientsin.



00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,150
Tientsin will see a gathering of the talented and able



00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,310
and a scene of hustle and bustle.



00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,039
It's the yellow cake from Kiessling.



00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,680
Young master specially asked me to buy it for you.



00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:42,400
You must be tired recently.



00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,190
I'm OK. I can handle it.



00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,830
Are they normal?



00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,630
They really don't have much chance to meet.



00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,440
Here you are. Feel relieved.



00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,120
I'll try my best to arrange it.



00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,160
Thank you for your hard work.



00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,510
It's my duty.



00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,160
Jianghu.



00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,829
Science.



00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:30,670
Kung fu.



00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,240
Truth.



00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,390
Nine statues of ox.



00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,030
Two statues of tiger.



00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,910
One statue of rooster.



00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,000
Mr. Nie.



00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,880
Living dead.



00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,520
Uncle Guo.



00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,110
Going to the theater.



00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,670
Having a meteoric rise.



00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,830
Printing machine.



00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,390
Alocasia.



00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,440
Winning people's hearts.



00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,320
Jinlan Times.



00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,110
Inspector.



00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,000
Foreign doctor.



00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,630
Gastric ulcer.



00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,470
Second Elder Brother.



00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,000
Understanding drug properties.

Tientsin Mystic.



00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,550
Tientsin Mystic 2



00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,550
Episode 4



00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,960
Waiter, fetch me some water.



00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,440
Sir, coming!



00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:36,480
Looking at the mirror…



00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,880
Gentlemen, please come in.



00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:44,640
…my facial expression…



00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,640
The play "Lovers' Joint Burial Tomb" depicts the story of



00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,600
the Chinese version of Romeo and Juliet



00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,720
who couldn't be together in spite of their deep love,



00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,640
so they killed themselves in the end.



00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,159
Mr. Nie, your performance on stage



00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,670
was emotional and vivid.



00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,760
I wonder whether you've had similar stories in your life.



00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,320
On stage, we play the gifted scholars and beautiful ladies



00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,230
to show the vicissitudes of their lives.



00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,200
Off stage, we're just normal people.



00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,390
What stories can we have?



00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
How to sing it?



00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,350
For the passion of love,



00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,110
I'm filled with sorrow.



00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,950
Mr. Nie, did you kill someone



00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,390
for the passion of love?



00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,550
I don't know what you mean.



00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,790
You must know Mrs. Cui well.



00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,320
She often came to the theater.



00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
She's a familiar face.



00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,000
A theatre fan?



00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,320
Sort of.



00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,550
Xiaoqiu is only your stage name.



00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,790
Am I right?



00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,950
Mr. Nie Ping.



00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,390
You dressed like a woman



00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,790
and took advantage of the driver's eye problem



00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,070
to make him mistake you for Mrs. Wang.



00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,760
In my opinion,



00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,720
Mrs. Cui is not just a theatre fan to you, right?



00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,040
A short distance away and yet poles apart, we've got no luck to meet.



00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:27,200
Even if I have to die, I'll feel happy at heart.



00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,950
"Madam White Snake".



00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,640
"Broken Bridge".



00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,640
I heard that is your signature play



00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,000
which made you famous.



00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,760
This jade ring



00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,320
was a gift from Mrs. Cui, right?



00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,760
It was with this jade ring that



00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,230
you went to Thousand Treasure House for Mr. Lu



00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,760
in exchange for the alocasia.



00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,480
You knew Crazy Cui had gastric ulcer,



00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,320
so you put the alocasia



00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,440
into the ginseng soup.



00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,160
The three of you all drank the ginseng soup.



00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,320
Only Crazy Cui died of broken intestines,



00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,000
while Mrs. Cui and you were safe,



00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,110
which was perfect to deceive the public.



00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,040
It's not true!



00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,600
After meeting her, I thought there was



00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,880
still something to look forward to in my miserable life.



00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,710
Fame or wealth,



00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,670
I can let go of everything.



00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,790
We had agreed to leave that night.



00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,400
I waited for her the entire night,



00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,470
but she didn't come.



00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,030
I thought fine.



00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,030
Such being the case,



00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,520
I might as well kill myself



00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,590
and end all the trouble.



00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,880
I heard that



00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,960
the alocasia is highly toxic,



00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,520
but its colorless and tasteless,



00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,790
so I can die with decency.



00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,760
Afraid of losing face,



00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,590
I dressed as a woman



00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,840
to buy the drug in the night fair.



00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,200
There was no place for me



00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,280
in the big world.



00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,110
Fine.



00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,080
To die, I should first



00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,840
give a spectacular performance on stage,



00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,280
singing the "Broken Bridge" and bringing down the house.



00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,590
Then I would drink the toxic soup.



00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,000
That way, I could die with no regrets.



00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,960
Why did you deliver the toxic soup to them?



00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,840
She didn't show up.



00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,110
If she changed her mind



00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,470
because she was scared,



00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,230
I wouldn't blame her,



00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,840
but they came to the theatre as a couple



00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,640
for birthday celebration right away.



00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,030
I've learned to perform since childhood.



00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,110
Skilled or not,



00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,470
I'm not shameless.



00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,520
Seeing that they could still



00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,110
live together for most of their lives,



00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,150
while I could



00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,350
only be a lonely ghost wandering in the wasteland,



00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,760
I delivered them two bowls of ginseng soup as the birthday gift



00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,150
so we could all die.



00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,320
You mean



00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,320
you didn't know the alocasia



00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,710
is only toxic when it meets blood.



00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,550
You wanted to kill her, too.



00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,960
She failed me.



00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,520
She also thinks she failed you,



00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,150
so she pled guilty instead.



00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,710
Get out! Who allows you to sleep here?



00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,910
Get up! Get out!



00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,670
You!



00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,110
Wait outside!



00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,320
Please.



00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:53,760
Let me go!



00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,350
Mrs. Cui!



00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:54,960
Let me go!



00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,550
In theory,



00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,150
it's not my duty to stop people from committing suicide.



00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,840
I'm only supposed to collect people's corpses from the river.



00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,790
Life and death are decreed by fate.



00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,470
Mr. Guo, please leave me alone.



00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,030
Mrs. Cui!



00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:11,760
Well,



00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,200
people struggle



00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,200
to live.



00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,440
Crazy Cui…



00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,840
Sorry! Mr. Cui



00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,320
died by accident.



00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,320
It's not easy for you to survive.



00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,110
Why do you have to kill yourself?



00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,230
Well, moreover,



00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,640
if you kill yourself so rashly,



00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:29,910
then Mr. Nie



00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:34,150
gave up his life for nothing.



00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,710
Xiaoqiu…



00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,960
I was to blame for what he did!



00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,640
I was to blame!



00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,110
Abandoned by his parents,



00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,960
Xiaoqiu was picked up



00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,350
and raised by the theatrical troupe.



00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,670
Heaven knows how much pain



00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,550
he suffered to become a star.



00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:14,550
Others thought he lived a comfortable and happy life,



00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,440
but the Heaven never spares a miserable man.



00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,110
He who is destined to swallow the pain



00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,400
can never live happily ever after.



00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,350
We just



00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,550
tried to warm each other



00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,350
and to prevent each other



00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,280
from being frozen in this cold world.



00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,470
But I've failed him



00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,670
since that day.



00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,320
That day?



00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,080
That day,



00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,960
we had agreed to meet near the stone bridge at midnight



00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,790
to leave together.



00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,470
From that day on,



00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,520
we would sleep together



00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,400
and get up together.



00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,320
We would never be apart.



00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,670
That day,



00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,400
if I hadn't gone back home,



00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,760
I'm afraid he would have been killed.



00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,920
In this life,



00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,710
I've made up my mind to be his wife.



00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,190
I'm afraid he would never know that.



00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,070
I am the one who failed him.



00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,880
I am the one



00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,680
who destroyed his desire to live in the world.



00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,590
Well,



00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,470
who's that man holding the gun?



00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,000
I can't see him clearly, but he can't be



00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,880
a member of Yishengmen Gang.



00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,880
I was not in the mood for a birthday celebration.



00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,400
Crazy Cui was drunk that day



00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,400
and he forced me there.



00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,070
That was not a birthday celebration,



00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,710
but a painful gathering.



00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,430
I…



00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,040
Pardon me for saying this.



00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,950
Maybe



00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,160
I shouldn't have stopped you just now.



00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,760
Look at you.



00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,800
Even if you're alive, you'll live a miserable life.



00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,800
You won't pardon yourself for the rest of your life.



00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,190
That being the case,



00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,680
you might as well kill yourself



00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,710
and end all the trouble.



00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,400
You were right.



00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,710
If I just kill myself,



00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,880
it's too easy for me.



00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,350
You should live.



00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,590
Only when you're alive



00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,070
can you make up for your mistake.



00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,280
Thank you.



00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,640
You made me realize



00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,470
how I should live my life in the future.



00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,000
I almost forgot about my task.



00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,160
Mrs. Cui,



00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,040
it's late at night, yet I came in



00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,880
through the side door without invitation.



00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,470
Actually,



00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,280
I need your help.



00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,400
The western medicine is all ready-made in the gallipot.



00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,350
He kept these foreign medical prescriptions



00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,680
purely for show.



00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,430
To show what?



00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,640
A year ago,



00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,280
he got to know a foreign doctor.



00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,160
After taking some western medicine,



00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,280
his symptoms were relieved.



00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,000
From then on,



00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,310
he only visited that doctor.



00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,310
Have you met that foreign doctor?



00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:10,590
No.



00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,470
Foreign doctors never make house calls.



00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,190
Right.



00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,760
This bookend



00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,950
is also a gift from that doctor.



00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,000
He used it to clamp those foreign medical prescriptions.



00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,280
Whenever someone visited, he would show them off,



00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,640
calling them foreign treasures.



00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,400
Secretary General Xiao,



00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,950
curve cut-off is the fastest and most effective way



00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,950
to clean up the Haihe River.



00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,070
I know,



00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,560
but it still needs you to promote it.



00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,000
Me?



00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,590
Ao Dan, the new Governor,



00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,230
built up a fortune through developing western-style industries.



00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,800
He fought a battle with Yakub Beg in Xinjiang before,



00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,350
and he had all the surrenders buried alive.



00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,280
When suppressing bandits in Shenyang,



00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,590
he killed them all,



00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,400
including women and children.



00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,430
He took office in Tientsin this time



00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,560
only to wipe out Mogudao.



00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,070
Xiao San from Mogudao used to be my subordinate.



00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,520
I might lose my life,



00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,110
let alone my position as the Secretary General.



00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,310
We can definitely find evidence



00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,310
to prove your innocence.



00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,560
I'm afraid it's too late to save me,



00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,520
but I want to make sure that you'll be the one to take my position.



00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,040
What do you mean?



00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,800
Harnessing the Haihe River



00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,830
is Ao Dan's main task in Tientsin.



00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,950
If the Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce



00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,190
offers money and manpower only to let him take all the credit,



00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,230
he'll surely remember your generosity.



00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,350
Then if you make great efforts to wipe out the remnants of Mogudao



00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,470
to show your loyalty,



00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,400
you're bound to be entrusted with an important post.



00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,640
Of course, in Ao Dan's eyes,



00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,040
I'm also a remnant of Mogudao,



00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,310
so I must die.



00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,040
Your relationship with Lanlan



00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,520
will be severely harmed.



00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,880
Is he OK?



00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,830
The case of Crazy Cui is closed.



00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,590
Curve cut-off can proceed smoothly.



00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,110
The first phase of the explosion will be carried out tomorrow.



00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,110
By then, you…



00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,400
I've got a fish.



00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,160
Unfortunately, you're unable to play dead and get away like I did.



00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,830
I'll eat you for dinner tonight.



00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,590
You're really capable.



00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,160
Only you can think of such a move.



00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,800
I still can't help laughing



00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,710
when I think of your driver's look when he saw the gun.



00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,470
Ingenuous as he is,



00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,310
he probably never experienced such things.



00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,710
Seeing the red card goon of Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce coming back to life



00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,190
and hunting down the Secretary General of Tientsin Municipal Government,



00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,230
he's not bad since he didn't cry out in fright.



00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,800
To be honest,



00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,800
the Little River God does live up to his reputation.



00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,470
He swims like a fish.



00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,160
If he had swum a bit slower,



00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,760
I would have really been drowned.



00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,710
This fish is not big enough.



00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,000
I should catch a bigger one,



00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,800
so you can deliver it to Lanlan for me at night.



00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,400
Well,



00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,800
don't worry.



00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,350
Just live here steadfastly.



00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,310
Now almost the entire government in Tientsin



00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,160
has been overhauled.



00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,680
As to the former officials,



00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,230
they're lucky if they're put into prison.



00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,560
Ao Dan took office suddenly



00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,590
and acted ruthlessly.



00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,950
He must be here for a reshuffle.



00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,310
Your father is better than him.



00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,710
He guessed everything right.



00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,110
Even with the new governor in the way,



00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,920
he can still escape by crafty scheme.



00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,040
Are you sure



00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,110
that place is safe?



00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,230
Just feel relieved.



00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,710
That place is surrounded by



00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,640
wharfs and lands of the grain transporting gang.



00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,310
Even if an nonlocal fly comes in,



00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,280
we'll know.



00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,520
Your father is very safe.



00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,760
Also, you fired a shot in the assembly room,



00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,190
and that's enough to gain the governor's trust.



00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,680
For safety's sake,



00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,950
we shall meet here



00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,280
at fixed times.



00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,950
If we meet on other occasions,



00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,430
we're still enemies.



00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,710
Yusi!



00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,760
What's up, Young Master?



00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,350
When can you distinguish the salt jar from the sugar jar?



00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,040
Sorry, Young Master,



00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,160
but the salt jar and the sugar jar at Miss Xiao's place



00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,160
look the same,



00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,160
and they're labeled in foreign language,



00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,000
so I…



00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,640
Fine.



00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,000
That's not your job in the first place.



00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,070
Next time, I'll change a sugar jar.



00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,880
It is said that the Maltese



00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,310
actually use sea salt to make salty coffee.



00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,710
Why not pretend we're traveling



00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,310
in the Mediterranean area?



00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,640
How long should we pretend?



00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,560
Now you can't go back to your home,



00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,800
and you're also dismissed by the newspaper office.



00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,470
Those snobs bullied you openly,



00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,430
but I could do nothing to help you.



00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,640
What they took away



00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,190
are things that I don't need.



00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,830
I've never felt so free



00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,470
in my entire life.



00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,880
[Jinlan Times]



00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,470
It's the first copy of the first edition.



00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,400
My cousin asked for it with both hard and soft tactics,



00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,680
but I didn't gave it to him.



00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,560
I only want to give it to you.



00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,520
The Jinlan Times.



00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,920
It's a pity that



00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,710
I can't witness its formation with my own eyes.



00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,110
That's all right.



00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,230
You should pay attention to your own business.



00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,800
Though the case of Crazy Cui is closed,



00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,640
there's still a long way to go



00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,040
when it comes to the curve cut-off.



00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,830
Who's your cousin?



00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,520
Do I



00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,950
know him?



00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,590
The salty coffee is not bad. It tastes pretty good.



00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,400
An old saying goes that there's no coincidence and no lack of luck.



00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,280
Nothing is coincidental



00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,560
for it's all destined by fate.



00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,880
But the bronze ox was split in half,



00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:01,110
and Crazy Cui was also split in half.



00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,920
What a coincidence!



00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,800
What a coincidence!



00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,350
Have you found anything?



00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,830
When the alocasia meets blood,



00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,560
it'll lead to strong corrosion reactions.



00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:16,830
But normally,



00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,520
our internal organs won't bleed.



00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,880
Why did Crazy Cui



00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,880
happen to have gastric ulcer,



00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,310
the wounds of which reacted with the alocasia



00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,280
to cause corrosion?



00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,760
That's the reason?



00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,560
Look, the prescription explicitly reads



00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,680
aspirin.



00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,800
Poria is for inducing perspiration, and radix scutellariae is for reducing dryness.



00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,920
What is aspirin?



00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,230
Westerners call it panacea,



00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,950
but an overdose of aspirin



00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,310
will lead to hemorrhage of gastric mucous membrane.



00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,280
The amount of aspirin



00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,520
on this prescription is way too high.



00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:45,590
So, first Crazy Cui



00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,560
had gastrorrhagia caused by aspirin.



00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:52,680
And then his bones were melted by the alocasia.



00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,310
It was the combined efforts of the Chinese and Western medicines.



00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,040
The foreign guns and cannons can't make their way in,



00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,710
but sometimes,



00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,760
the old methods still work well.



00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,800
We're all together again.



00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,160
Not everyone is here.



00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,560
There's always one member missing.



00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,430
This time, without your help,



00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,760
Ding Mao wouldn't be able to prove his innocence.



00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,230
I'd like to thank you



00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,950
on behalf of Commander Ding.



00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,760
He's Ding Yiqiu's son,



00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,680
but he's also my student.



00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,160
It's a master's duty



00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,760
to help his student.



00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,830
Gentlemen,



00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,190
let's get down to business today.



00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,680
Have you made up your mind?



00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,190
Are you



00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,760
in or not?



00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:35,520
I'm in.



00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,560
I'm out.



00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,560
If you're out,



00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,280
it's not gonna work.



00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,310
Then just forget about it.



00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:29,230
The river keeps flowing, making a clear distinction between purity and impurity.



00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,920
Why do you worship me



00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,000
instead of the Dragon King?



00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:34,920
Master,



00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,280
weren't it for the Compendium of Materia Medica left by you,



00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,560
we wouldn't have solved the case.



00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,520
You solved the case?



00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,310
Yes!



00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,310
Actually, I still feel there's something missing,



00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,160
so I come to visit you.



00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,800
One man should not walk into a temple.



00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,310
Two men should not look into a well.



00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,680
In this world,



00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,470
there're so many unsolved mysteries.



00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,430
You're not a cat.



00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,160
You don't have nine lives.



00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,230
Dragon King, may you bless me!



00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,470
Let me have one more life than the cat.



00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:28,920
Come on!



00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,560
It took a lot of efforts to build the dam.



00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,950
Are we really gonna blow it up?



00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,400
By then,



00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,470
the river water here will flow down



00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,230
along those river channels



00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,640
to the river channels below.



00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,760
Then the river no longer needs to take a detour.



00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,400
That is the curve cut-off.



00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:45,950
Man struggles upwards,



00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,190
while water flows downwards.



00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,680
When the flow rate accelerates,



00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,800
the river water will become clean again quickly.



00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,950
I'll lift the river ban as soon as possible,



00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,520
so that people living along the Haihe River



00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,760
and the corpse-salvage team



00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,400
can return to a normal life.



00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,280
Secretary General Ding,



00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,760
I'd like to thank you on behalf of my teammates.



00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,350
Secretary General,



00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,760
Diplomatist Gu Weiliang will be here tonight.



00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,310
How should we receive him?



00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,310
How come he's coming earlier?



00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,280
I've no idea.



00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:14,560
Let's go.



00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,230
Find a car to send Mr. Guo home.



00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,800
No problem.



00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,830
It's OK. It's OK.



00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,230
Mr. Guo, this way, please.



00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,880
Evacuating the staff.



00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,590
Evacuating the units.



00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,040
The first phase of explosion



00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,760
for Tientsin curve cut-off project.



00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,920
Start!



00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,880
We're ordered to transfer suspect Nie Xiaoqiu.



00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,800
He will be held in military custody temporarily to await trial.



00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,280
Mr. Nie,



00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:46,840
please.



00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,800
No, I won't go!



00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,389
Get up!



00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,120
I won't go!



00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,760
I killed someone! I won't go!



00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,710
Let go of me! I won't go!



00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:56,560
I killed someone!



00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,150
Let's go!



00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,430
Let go of me!



00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,120
Mr. Gu!



00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,600
I'm Ding Mao, the Secretary General of the Municipal Government.



00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,910
The governor specially sent me



00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,560
to receive you.



00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,950
Your accommodation has been arranged properly.



00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:33,080
I'm Fu Laiyong, Captain of the Sixth Bureau of



00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,840
Tientsin Police Department.



00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,430
I'll cooperate with Secretary General Ding



00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:38,630
to keep you safe in Tientsin.



00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:40,760
Come on!



00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,080
I'll open the door for you.



00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,120
Mr. Gu, please.



00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,840
Secretary General, please.



00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,190
I'm sorry.



00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,280
Mr. Gu is not used to sharing the car.



00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,560
All right.



00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,470
So he's a diplomatist. Big Deal!



00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,840
He's really put on high airs.



00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,950
He's up to no good.



00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,430
Tientsin is complicated and filled with all sorts of people.



00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,670
Those with good intention won't come.



00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,760
Come on! Make way!



00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,520
If I can't have your love,



00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,360
it feels like no oxygen in the air.



00:36:54,360 --> 00:37:00,040
I can see you everywhere.



00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,320
You left me with a lot of questions.



00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,360
Then you disappeared within the blink of an eye.



00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:13,120
Are you impatient or heartless?



00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:16,600
Put it on.
